PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

a)

General
    Development of Business

ConAgra Foods, Inc. (“ConAgra Foods”,
    “Company”, “we”, “us”, or
    “our”) is one of North America’s leading food
    companies, with brands in 97% of America’s households.
    ConAgra Foods also has a strong business-to-business presence,
    supplying potato, other vegetable, spice, and grain products to
    a variety of well-known restaurants, foodservice operators, and
    commercial customers.

ConAgra Foods is focused on expanding profit margins and
    improving returns on capital over time. To that end, we have
    significantly changed our portfolio of businesses over a number
    of years, focusing on branded, value-added opportunities, while
    divesting commodity-based and lower-margin businesses. Executing
    this strategy has involved the acquisition over time of a number
    of brands such as

Banquet

®

,

Chef
    Boyardee

®

,

PAM

®

,

    and

Alexia

®

,

    and more recently, has focused on product innovations such as

Healthy
    Choice

®

Café
    Steamers

tm

,

Healthy
    Choice

®

Fresh
    Mixers

tm

,

Healthy
    Choice

®

All Natural Entrées,

Marie
    Callender’s

®

Pasta Al Dente,

Alexia

®

Natural Crunchy Snacks, and others. More notable divestitures
    have included a trading and merchandising business, packaged
    meat operations, a poultry business, beef and pork businesses,
    and various other businesses. For more information about our
    more recent acquisitions and divestitures, see
    “Acquisitions” and “Divestitures” below.

As part of this strategy, we have also prioritized improving our
    overall operational effectiveness, focusing on better innovation
    and marketing programs, reducing manufacturing and selling,
    general and administrative costs, and enhancing our business
    processes, which are intended to drive profitable sales growth,
    expand profit margins, and improve returns on capital.

Currently we are focusing our efforts in the following areas,
    with our initiatives aligned with five strategic priorities:
    convenient meals, potatoes, snacks, meal enhancers, and
    specialty businesses:

•

Increased investments in marketing and innovation focused on
    “fewer, bigger, and better” initiatives;

•

Sales growth initiatives focused on penetrating the fastest
    growing channels, achieving better returns on customer trade
    arrangements, optimizing shelf placement for our most profitable
    brands, and aligning with customers to leverage consumer
    insights;

•

Reducing costs throughout the supply chain and the general and
    administrative functions;

•

Delivering consistent customer service and high standards of
    food safety and quality; and

•

Navigating the challenging input cost environment.  We
    increased prices across a significant portion of our product
    portfolio in the latter portion of fiscal 2008 and early fiscal
    2009 in response to significant increases in input costs. We
    continue to monitor input cost trends and our pricing strategies
    and intend to take appropriate actions to maintain and increase
    market-share and sales volume at acceptable profit margins.

We were initially incorporated as a Nebraska corporation in 1919
    and were reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in December
    1975.

b)

Financial
    Information about Reporting Segments

We report our operations in two reporting
    segments:  Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods. The
    contributions of each reporting segment to net sales, profit
    contribution margin, operating profit, and the identifiable
    assets are set forth in Note 22 “Business Segments and
    Related Information” to the consolidated financial
    statements.

c)

Narrative
    Description of Business

We compete throughout the food industry and focus on adding
    value for customers who operate in the retail food, foodservice,
    and ingredients channels.

Our operations, including our reporting segments, are described
    below. Our locations, including distribution facilities, within
    each reporting segment, are described in Item 2.



Consumer
    Foods

The Consumer Foods reporting segment includes branded and
    private label food products which are sold in various retail and
    foodservice channels, principally in North America. The products
    include a variety of categories (meals, entrées,
    condiments, sides, snacks, and desserts) across frozen,
    refrigerated, and shelf-stable temperature classes. The segment
    is comprised of and managed through five subsegments as
    described below:

Grocery Foods North America

—includes branded and
    private label refrigerated or shelf-stable food products that
    are sold in various retail and foodservice channels primarily
    across the United States. Major brands include:

    The segment also includes the consumer foods businesses in
    Mexico and Canada, which distribute packaged foods that are both
    locally manufactured and imported from the United States.

Frozen Foods

—includes branded and private label
    frozen food products that are sold in various retail and
    foodservice channels across the United States. Major brands
    include:

Alexia

®

,

Banquet

®

,

Healthy
    Choice

®

,

Kid
    Cuisine

®

,

    and

Marie
    Callender’s

®

.

Snacks and Store Brands

—includes branded popcorn,
    meats, seeds, and specialty snacks, as well as private label
    food products that are sold in various retail and foodservice
    channels across the United States. Major brands include:

ACT
    II

Enabler Brands

—includes national and regional
    branded food products across shelf-stable, refrigerated, and
    frozen temperature classes. Products are sold in various retail
    and foodservice channels across the United States. Major
    brands include:

.

Domestic Export

—includes branded shelf-stable food
    products sold through distributors in various markets throughout
    the world.

The Consumer Foods’ supply chain and order-to-cash
    functions are centrally managed and largely integrated.
    Accordingly, we do not maintain balance sheets at the subsegment
    level. Selling, general and administrative expenses, other than
    advertising and promotion, are managed at the Consumer Foods
    reporting segment level, and as such, we do not separately
    allocate selling, general and administrative expenses other than
    advertising and promotion expenses to the Consumer Foods
    subsegments.

Commercial
    Foods

The Commercial Foods reporting segment includes commercially
    branded foods and ingredients, which are sold principally to
    foodservice, food manufacturing, and industrial customers. The
    segment’s primary products include: specialty potato
    products, milled grain ingredients, a variety of vegetable
    products, seasonings, blends, and flavors which are sold under
    brands such as

ConAgra
    Mills

®

,

Lamb
    Weston

®

,

Gilroy Foods &
    Flavors

tm

,

    and

Spicetec

®

.

Unconsolidated
    Equity Investments

We have a number of unconsolidated equity investments.
    Significant affiliates produce and market potato products for
    retail and foodservice customers.

Acquisitions

During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we acquired Saroni
    Sugar & Rice, Inc., a distribution company included in
    the Commercial Foods segment.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we acquired a 49.99%
    interest in Lamb Weston BSW, LLC (“Lamb Weston BSW” or
    the “venture”), a potato processing joint venture with
    Ochoa Ag Unlimited Foods, Inc. (“Ochoa”). This venture
    is considered a variable interest entity for which we are the
    primary beneficiary and is consolidated in our financial
    statements. This business is included in the Commercial Foods
    segment.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we acquired Alexia
    Foods, Inc. (“Alexia Foods”) a privately held natural
    food company, headquartered in Long Island City, New York.
    Alexia Foods offers premium natural and organic food items
    including potato products, appetizers, and artisan breads.



During the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we acquired Lincoln
    Snacks Holding Company, Inc. (“Lincoln Snacks”), a
    privately held company located in Lincoln, Nebraska. Lincoln
    Snacks offers a variety of snack food brands and private label
    products.

Also during the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we acquired the
    manufacturing assets of Twin City Foods, Inc. (“Twin City
    Foods”), a potato processing business.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we acquired Watts
    Brothers, a privately held group which owns and operates
    agricultural and farming businesses.

Divestitures

In June 2009, subsequent to our fiscal 2009 year end, we
    completed the divestiture of the

Fernando’s

®

foodservice brand for proceeds of $6 million. We reflected
    the results of these operations as discontinued operations for
    all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of the
    divested

Fernando’s

®

business have been reclassified as assets and liabilities held
    for sale within our consolidated balance sheets for all periods
    presented.

In July 2008, we completed the sale of our

Pemmican

®

beef jerky business for proceeds of approximately
    $29 million. Due to our continuing involvement with the
    business through providing sales and distribution support to the
    buyer for a period of up to five years, the results of
    operations of the

Pemmican

®

business have not been reclassified as discontinued operations.

In June 2008, we completed the sale of our trading and
    merchandising operations (previously principally reported as the
    Trading and Merchandising segment). We reflected the results of
    these operations as discontinued operations for all periods
    presented. The assets and liabilities of the divested trading
    and merchandising operations are classified as assets and
    liabilities held for sale within our consolidated balance sheets
    for all periods prior to divestiture.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we completed our
    divestiture of the

Knott’s Berry
    Farm

®

(“Knott’s”) operations. We reflected the results
    of these operations as discontinued operations for all periods
    presented. The assets and liabilities of the divested
    Knott’s business are classified as assets and liabilities
    held for sale within our consolidated balance sheets for all
    periods prior to divestiture.

We finalized the dispositions of our packaged meats and cheese
    operations during the first half of fiscal 2007. We reflect the
    results of these businesses as discontinued operations for all
    periods presented.

We disposed of a refrigerated pizza business with annual
    revenues of less than $70 million during the second quarter
    of fiscal 2007. Due to our expected significant continuing cash
    flows associated with this business, we continue to include the
    results of operations of this business in continuing operations.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we completed the
    divestiture of our nutritional supplement business. We reflected
    the gain within discontinued operations.

General

The following comments pertain to both of our reporting segments.

ConAgra Foods is a food company that operates in many sectors of
    the food industry, with a significant focus on the sale of
    branded, private label, and value-added consumer products. We
    use many different raw materials, the bulk of which are
    commodities. The prices paid for raw materials used in our
    products generally reflect factors such as weather, commodity
    market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, tariffs, and the
    effects of governmental agricultural programs. Although the
    prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result
    of these factors, we believe such raw materials to be in
    adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources.
    We have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw
    materials, packaging, and energy inputs. We seek to mitigate the
    higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives,
    and through the use of derivative instruments used to
    economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption.

We experience intense competition for sales of our principal
    products in our major markets. Our products compete with widely
    advertised, well-known, branded products, as well as private
    label and customized products. Some of our competitors are
    larger and have greater resources than we have. We have major
    competitors in each of our reporting segments. We compete
    primarily on the basis of quality, value, customer service,
    brand recognition, and brand loyalty.



We employ processes at our principal manufacturing locations
    that emphasize applied research and technical services directed
    at product improvement and quality control. In addition, we
    conduct research activities related to the development of new
    products. Research and development expense was $81 million,
    $69 million, and $68 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, and
    2007, respectively.

Demand for certain of our products may be influenced by
    holidays, changes in seasons, or other annual events.

We manufacture primarily for stock and fill customer orders from
    finished goods inventories. While at any given time there may be
    some backlog of orders, such backlog is not material in respect
    to annual net sales, and the changes from time to time are not
    significant.

Our trademarks are of material importance to our business and
    are protected by registration or other means in the United
    States and most other markets where the related products are
    sold. Some of our products are sold under brands that have been
    licensed from others. We also actively develop and maintain a
    portfolio of patents, although no single patent is considered
    material to the business as a whole. We have proprietary trade
    secrets, technology, know-how, processes, and other intellectual
    property rights that are not registered.

Many of our facilities and products are subject to various laws
    and regulations administered by the United States
    Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug
    Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health
    Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign
    governmental agencies relating to the quality and safety of
    products, sanitation, safety and health matters, and
    environmental control. We believe that we comply with such laws
    and regulations in all material respects, and that continued
    compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect
    upon capital expenditures, earnings, or our competitive position.

Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates,
    accounted for approximately 16%, 15%, and 16% of consolidated
    net sales for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. This
    reflects all Consumer Foods businesses, including those which
    are classified as discontinued operations.

At May 31, 2009, ConAgra Foods and its subsidiaries had
    approximately 25,600 employees, primarily in the United
    States. Approximately 53% of our employees are parties to
    collective bargaining agreements. Of the employees subject to
    collective bargaining agreements, approximately 37% are parties
    to collective bargaining agreements that are scheduled to expire
    during fiscal 2010. We believe that our relationships with
    employees and their representative organizations are good.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

The following factors could affect our operating results and
    should be considered in evaluating us.

Deterioration
    of general economic conditions could harm our business and
    results of operations.

Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected
    by changes in national or global economic conditions, including
    inflation, interest rates, availability of capital markets,
    consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs
    (including fuel surcharges), and the effects of governmental
    initiatives to manage economic conditions.

The continued volatility in financial markets and the
    deterioration of national and global economic conditions could
    impact our business and operations in a variety of ways,
    including as follows:

•

consumers may shift purchases to lower-priced private label or
    other value offerings or may forego certain purchases altogether
    during economic downturns, which may adversely affect the
    results of our Consumer Foods operations;

•

decreased demand in the restaurant business, particularly casual
    and fine dining, may adversely affect our Commercial Foods
    operations;

•

volatility in the equity markets or interest rates could
    substantially impact our pension costs and required pension
    contributions;

•

it may become more costly or difficult to obtain debt or equity
    financing to fund operations or investment opportunities, or to
    refinance our debt in the future, in each case on terms and
    within a time period acceptable to us; and

•

a downgrade to our credit ratings would increase our borrowing
    costs and could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our
    short-term and longer-term borrowing needs.

Increases
    in commodity costs may have a negative impact on
    profits.

We use many different commodities such as wheat, corn, oats,
    soybeans, beef, pork, poultry, and energy. Commodities are
    subject to price volatility caused by commodity market
    fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuations, and
    changes in governmental agricultural programs. Commodity price
    increases will result in increases in raw material costs and
    operating costs. We may not be able to increase our product
    prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these
    increased costs; and increasing prices may result in reduced
    sales volume and profitability. We have experience in hedging
    against commodity price increases; however, these practices and
    experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative
    profit impacts from commodity price increases.

Increased
    competition may result in reduced sales or profits.

The food industry is highly competitive, and increased
    competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or
    the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer
    pressures. Competitive pressures also may restrict our ability
    to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other
    cost increases. Our profits could decrease if a reduction in
    prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased
    sales volume.

The
    sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a
    negative impact on profits.

Many of our customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs,
    and food distributors, have consolidated in recent years and
    consolidation is expected to continue. These consolidations and
    the growth of supercenters have produced large, sophisticated
    customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength
    who are more capable of resisting price increases and operating
    with reduced inventories. These customers may also in the future
    use more of their shelf space, currently used for our products,
    for their private label products. We continue to implement
    initiatives to counteract these pressures. However, if the
    larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating
    strength

and/or

increased private label competition, our profitability could
    decline.



We must
    identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer
    food products to meet their preferences.

Consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our
    food products depends on our ability to identify the tastes and
    dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to
    their preferences. Introduction of new products and product
    extensions requires significant development and marketing
    investment. If our products fail to meet consumer preference,
    then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated
    and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in
    marketing and innovation will be less successful.

If we do
    not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly
    competitive food industry, our profitability could
    decrease.

Our success depends in part on our ability to achieve the
    appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly
    competitive food industry, particularly in an environment of
    volatile input costs. We continue to implement profit-enhancing
    initiatives that impact our supply chain and general and
    administrative functions. These initiatives are focused on
    cost-saving opportunities in procurement, manufacturing,
    logistics, and customer service, as well as general and
    administrative overhead levels. If we do not continue to
    effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies,
    our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease.

We may be
    subject to product liability claims and product recalls, which
    could negatively impact our profitability.

We sell food products for human consumption, which involves
    risks such as product contamination or spoilage, product
    tampering, and other adulteration of food products. We may be
    subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products
    causes injury, illness, or death. In addition, we will
    voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or
    damage. In the past, we have issued recalls and have from time
    to time been and currently are involved in lawsuits relating to
    our food products. A significant product liability judgment or a
    widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and
    profitability for a period of time depending on product
    availability, competitive reaction, and consumer attitudes. Even
    if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully
    pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that
    our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our
    reputation with existing and potential customers and our
    corporate and brand image.

If we
    fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business, we
    may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and
    penalties.

Our facilities and products are subject to many laws and
    regulations administered by the United States Department of
    Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the
    Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other
    federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies
    relating to the processing, packaging, storage, distribution,
    advertising, labeling, quality, and safety of food products and
    health and safety of our employees. Our failure to comply with
    applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits,
    administrative penalties and injunctive relief, civil remedies,
    including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. Our
    operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly
    stringent regulations administered by the Environmental
    Protection Agency, which pertain to the discharge of materials
    into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes.
    Failure to comply with these regulations can have serious
    consequences, including civil and administrative penalties and
    negative publicity.

Our
    information technology resources must provide efficient
    connections between our business functions, or our results of
    operations will be negatively impacted.

Each year we engage in billions of dollars of transactions with
    our customers and vendors. Because the amount of dollars
    involved is so significant, our information technology resources
    must provide connections among our marketing, sales,
    manufacturing, logistics, customer service, and accounting
    functions. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the
    resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology
    infrastructure and to maintain the related automated and manual
    control processes, we could be subject to billing and collection
    errors, business disruptions, or damage resulting from security
    breaches. We are currently implementing new financial and
    operational information technology systems. Some systems were
    placed into production during fiscal 2008 and



2009. Additional changes and enhancements will be placed into
    production at various times in fiscal 2010. If future
    implementation problems are encountered, our results of
    operations could be negatively impacted.

PROPERTIES

Our headquarters are located in Omaha, Nebraska. In addition,
    certain shared service centers are located in Omaha, Nebraska,
    including a product development facility, supply chain center,
    business services center, and an information technology center.
    The general offices and location of principal operations are set
    forth in the following summary of our locations.

We maintain a number of stand-alone distribution facilities. In
    addition, there is warehouse space available at substantially
    all of our manufacturing facilities.

Utilization of manufacturing capacity varies by manufacturing
    plant based upon the type of products assigned and the level of
    demand for those products. Management believes that our
    manufacturing and processing plants are well maintained and are
    generally adequate to support the current operations of the
    business.

We own most of the manufacturing facilities. However, a limited
    number of plants and parcels of land with the related
    manufacturing equipment are leased. Substantially all of our
    transportation equipment and forward-positioned distribution
    centers and most of the storage facilities containing finished
    goods are leased or operated by third parties. Information about
    the properties supporting our two business segments follows.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

In fiscal 1991, we acquired Beatrice Company
    (“Beatrice”). As a result of the acquisition and the
    significant pre-acquisition contingencies of the Beatrice
    businesses and its former subsidiaries, our consolidated
    post-acquisition financial statements reflect liabilities
    associated with the estimated resolution of these contingencies.
    These include various litigation and environmental proceedings
    related to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to its
    acquisition by the Company. The litigation includes several
    public nuisance and personal injury suits against a number of
    lead paint and pigment manufacturers, including ConAgra Grocery
    Products and the Company as alleged successors to W. P. Fuller
    Co., a lead paint and pigment manufacturer owned and operated by
    Beatrice until 1967. Although decisions favorable to us have
    been rendered in Rhode Island, New Jersey, Wisconsin, and Ohio,
    we



remain a defendant in active suits in Illinois and California.
    The Illinois suit seeks

class-wide

relief in the form of medical monitoring for elevated levels of
    lead in blood. In California, a number of cities and counties
    have joined in a consolidated action seeking abatement of the
    alleged public nuisance.

The environmental proceedings include litigation and
    administrative proceedings involving Beatrice’s status as a
    potentially responsible party at 35 Superfund, proposed
    Superfund, or state-equivalent sites; these sites involve
    locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of
    Beatrice that used or produced petroleum, pesticides,
    fertilizers, dyes, inks, solvents, PCBs, acids, lead, sulfur,
    tannery wastes,

and/or

other
    contaminants. Beatrice has paid or is in the process of paying
    its liability share at 33 of these sites. Reserves for these
    matters have been established based on our best estimate of the
    undiscounted remediation liabilities, which estimates include
    evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required cleanup,
    the known volumetric contribution of Beatrice and other
    potentially responsible parties, and its experience in
    remediating sites. The reserves for Beatrice environmental
    matters totaled $88.8 million as of May 31, 2009, a
    majority of which relates to the Superfund and state-equivalent
    sites referenced above. Expenditures for Beatrice environmental
    matters are expected to continue for a period of up to
    20 years.

We are a party to a number of lawsuits and claims arising out of
    the operation of our business, including lawsuits and claims
    related to the February 2007 recall of our peanut butter
    products and litigation we initiated against an insurance
    carrier to recover our settlement expenditures and defense
    costs. We recognized a charge of $25.3 million during the
    second half of fiscal 2009 in connection with the disputed
    coverage with this insurance carrier.

An investigation by the Division of Enforcement of the
    U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
    (“CFTC”) of certain commodity futures transactions of
    a former Company subsidiary, has led to an investigation by the
    CFTC of the Company itself. The investigation may result in
    litigation by the CFTC against the Company. The former
    subsidiary was sold on June 23, 2008, as part of the
    divestiture of our trading and merchandising operations. The
    CFTC’s Division of Enforcement has advised the Company that
    it questions whether certain trading activities of the former
    subsidiary violated the Commodity Exchange Act (the
    “CEA”) and that the CFTC has been evaluating whether
    we should be implicated in the matter based on the existence of
    the parent-subsidiary relationship between the two entities at
    the time of the trades. Based on information we have learned to
    date, the Company believes that both it and the former
    subsidiary have meritorious defenses. We have submitted a
    statement to the Division of Enforcement contesting any
    purported liability. We also believe the sale contract with the
    buyer of the business provides us indemnification rights.
    Accordingly, we do not believe any decision by the CFTC to
    pursue this matter will have a material adverse effect on the
    Company. If litigation ensues, the Company intends to defend
    itself vigorously.

After taking into account liabilities recognized for all of the
    foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution
    of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

Fiscal 2009 diluted earnings per share were $2.15, including
    $1.42 per diluted share of income from continuing operations and
    income of $0.73 per diluted share from discontinued operations.
    Fiscal 2008 diluted earnings per share were $1.90, including
    income from continuing operations of $1.06 per diluted share and
    income from discontinued operations of $0.84 per diluted share.
    Several items affect the comparability of results of continuing
    operations, as discussed below.

Items Impacting
    Comparability

Items of note impacting comparability for fiscal 2009 included
    the following:

Reported within Continuing Operations

•

charges totaling $50 million ($31 million after-tax)
    related to debt refinancing,

•

charges totaling $10 million ($8 million after-tax)
    under our restructuring plans,

•

charges totaling $33 million ($20 million after-tax)
    related to a product recall and associated insurance coverage
    dispute,

•

a gain of $19 million ($11 million after-tax)
    resulting from the

Pemmican

®

beef jerky divestiture, and

•

net tax benefits of approximately $6 million primarily
    related to changes in estimates.

In addition, fiscal 2009 income per share benefited by
    approximately $.03 as a result of the fiscal year including
    53 weeks.

Items of note impacting comparability for fiscal 2008 included
    the following:

Reported within Continuing Operations

•

charges totaling $45 million ($28 million after-tax)
    related to product recalls,

•

charges totaling $26 million ($16 million after-tax)
    under our restructuring plans, and

•

net tax benefits of approximately $19 million related to
    changes in our legal entity structure, favorable settlements,
    and changes in estimates.

Operating
    Initiatives

We continue to execute against our operational improvement
    initiatives that are intended to generate profitable sales
    growth, improve profit margins, and expand returns on capital
    over time.



Recent developments in our strategies and action plans include:

•

Pricing initiatives: We implemented price increases across a
    significant portion of our Consumer Foods portfolio in the
    latter portion of fiscal 2008 and early fiscal 2009, in response
    to significant increases in input costs. Although input cost
    increases moderated during fiscal 2009, we continue to actively
    monitor these costs and will consider additional pricing
    actions, as appropriate, to offset input cost increases.

•

Innovation: During fiscal 2009 we continued to benefit from
    innovation investments. As part of transforming our frozen foods
    operations and building on our snacks platform, we developed a
    variety of new products, including

Marie
    Callender’s

    manufacturing, and industrial customers. Together with
    additional new products planned for fiscal 2010 and beyond, our
    new products are expected to contribute to additional sales
    growth in the future.

•

Sales growth initiatives: We continue to implement sales
    improvement initiatives focused on penetrating the fastest
    growing channels, better returns on customer trade arrangements,
    and optimizing shelf placement for our most profitable products.
    These, along with marketing initiatives, are intended to
    generate profitable sales growth.

•

Marketing Initiatives: We have increased our marketing
    investment to support our brands over the last few years and
    have added significantly to marketing talent throughout the
    organization. These changes have dramatically improved the
    quality of our communication with consumers as well as the
    strength of our consumer insights and overall execution of
    marketing plans. We sharpened our focus on marketing
    effectiveness and have developed a

return-on-investment

culture that promotes high returns on incremental marketing
    investments.

•

Reducing costs throughout the supply chain and the general and
    administrative functions:

•

As part of a focus on cost reduction, we initiated restructuring
    plans focused on streamlining our supply chain, reducing
    selling, general and administrative costs

(“2006-2008

restructuring plan”), and streamlining the Consumer Foods
    international operations

(“2008-2009

restructuring plan”). We have recognized substantially all
    of the $269 million of expected costs of these plans as of
    May 31, 2009. Together, these plans are generating
    significant annual savings.

References to the restructuring plans refer to both the

2006-2008

restructuring plan and the

2008-2009

restructuring plan, unless otherwise noted.

•

In addition to restructuring activities, we have ongoing
    initiatives focused on supply chain activities (i.e.,
    manufacturing, logistics, and procurement functions), which have
    resulted in significant cost savings in both fiscal 2008 and
    2009.

•

With respect to general and administrative costs, we continue to
    focus on controlling these costs through driving a “zero
    overhead growth” culture throughout the organization. We
    anticipate this initiative will generate benefits in fiscal 2010
    and beyond.

•

Portfolio Strengthening: As part of our continuing efforts to
    simplify operations, enhance efficiency, and allow greater
    investment in our core food businesses going forward, we
    divested several businesses in fiscal 2008 and 2009, including
    our trading and merchandising operations (fiscal 2009),

Pemmican

®

beef jerky business (fiscal 2009), and

Knott’s Berry
    Farm

®

jelly and jam business (fiscal 2008). Except for the

Pemmican

®

beef jerky business, the results of operations for each of these
    businesses are reflected in discontinued operations for all
    periods presented. Due to our continuing involvement with the
    business



through providing sales and distribution services to the buyer
    for a period of up to five years, the results of operations of
    the

Pemmican

®

business have not been reclassified as discontinued operations.

We also made strategic investments in fiscal 2008 and 2009 in
    order to enhance our portfolio. In fiscal 2009, we entered into
    a potato processing venture, Lamb Weston BSW, with an initial
    investment of $46 million. We consolidate this venture. In
    fiscal 2008, we acquired Alexia Foods, Lincoln Snacks, Watts
    Brothers, and Twin City Foods for a total of approximately
    $255 million in cash plus assumed liabilities.

Dispositions
    of Businesses

Before-tax proceeds from the trading and merchandising
    operations divestiture were comprised of (1) approximately
    $2.26 billion of cash, net of transaction costs (including
    incentive compensation amounts due to divested business
    employees),

(2) payment-in-kind

debt securities issued by the purchaser with aggregate principal
    amount of $550 million, recognized at fair market value of
    $479 million, and (3) a four-year warrant to purchase
    approximately 5% of the issued common equity of the purchaser,
    recognized at estimated fair market value of approximately
    $2 million. We recognized an after-tax gain on the
    divestiture of approximately $301 million.

Proceeds from the disposition of the trading and merchandising
    business were primarily used as follows: 1) to fund a
    $900 million accelerated share repurchase, 2) to pay
    down commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of the beginning
    of fiscal 2009 as well as commercial paper borrowings drawn for
    the purpose of funding working capital needs of the trading and
    merchandising business just prior to the disposition, and
    3) to pay income taxes on the gain resulting from the
    transaction.

Before-tax proceeds from the

Knott’s Berry
    Farm

®

divestiture were $55 million, with the transaction
    resulting in no significant gain or loss, while before-tax
    proceeds from the

Pemmican

®

divestiture were approximately $29 million and we
    recognized an after-tax gain of approximately $11 million.

Capital
    Allocation

In fiscal 2009, we took advantage of a favorable interest rate
    environment and refinanced a portion of our debt. Specifically,
    we issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior
    notes ($500 million maturing in 2014 and $500 million
    maturing in 2019), with an average blended interest rate of
    approximately 6.4%. With the proceeds from this debt issuance,
    we repaid approximately $900 million aggregate principal
    amount of senior notes and, in the process, paid approximately
    $50 million ($31 million after-tax) of premiums and
    related transaction fees. In addition, we contributed
    $100 million to our company-sponsored defined benefit
    pension plans.

In fiscal 2009, we funded an accelerated share repurchase
    program totaling $900 million (approximately
    44.0 million shares of common stock), utilizing a portion
    of the proceeds from the trading and merchandising business
    divestiture.

In addition, during fiscal 2009, we executed the following:

•

repayment of $578 million of short-term debt;

•

capital expenditures of approximately $442 million; and

•

dividend payments of approximately $348 million.

Opportunities
    and Challenges

We believe our operating initiatives will favorably impact
    future sales, profits, and returns on capital. Because of the
    scope of change underway, there is risk that these broad change
    initiatives will not be successfully implemented. Input costs,
    competitive pressures, the ability to execute operational
    changes and implement pricing actions, among other factors, will
    affect the timing and impact of these initiatives.

We have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw
    materials, packaging, and energy inputs. We seek to mitigate the
    higher input costs through pricing and productivity initiatives,
    and through the use of derivative instruments used to
    economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption.
    We are also focusing on selling, general and administrative cost
    initiatives, as evidenced by the implementation of our
    restructuring plans as



well as our zero overhead growth initiative. If the benefits
    from pricing actions, supply chain productivity improvements,
    economic hedges, and selling, general and administrative cost
    reduction initiatives are insufficient to cover these expected
    higher input costs, results of operations, particularly Consumer
    Foods operating profit, may continue to be negatively impacted.

Changing consumer preferences may impact sales of certain of our
    products. We offer a variety of food products that appeal to a
    range of consumer preferences and utilize innovation and
    marketing programs to develop products that fit with changing
    consumer trends. As part of these programs, we introduce new
    products and product extensions.

Consolidation of many of our customers continues to result in
    increased buying power, negotiating strength, and complex
    service requirements for those customers. This trend, which is
    expected to continue, may negatively impact gross margins,
    particularly in the Consumer Foods segment. In order to
    effectively respond to this customer consolidation, we
    continually evaluate our consumer marketing, sales, and customer
    service strategies. We are implementing trade promotion programs
    designed to improve return on investment and pursuing shelf
    placement and customer service improvement initiatives.

The continuing volatility in financial markets and the
    deterioration of national and global economic conditions could
    impact our business and operations in a variety of ways.
    Consumers may shift purchases to lower-priced private label or
    other value offerings or may forego certain purchases altogether
    during economic downturns, which may adversely affect our
    results of operations. The financial stability of our customers
    and suppliers may be compromised, which could result in
    additional bad debts for us or non-performance by suppliers.
    Volatility in the equity markets or interest rates could
    substantially increase our pension costs and required pension
    contributions. Decreased demand in the restaurant business,
    particularly casual and fine dining, may adversely affect our
    Commercial Foods operations.

Other

On June 9, 2009, an accidental explosion occurred at our
    manufacturing facility in Garner, North Carolina. This facility
    was the primary production facility for our

Slim
    Jim

®

branded meat snacks. The packaging area of the plant is expected
    to be out of service for the foreseeable future. On
    June 13, 2009, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
    Firearms and Explosives announced its determination that the
    explosion was the result of an accidental natural gas release,
    and not a deliberate act.

We maintain comprehensive property (including business
    interruption), workers’ compensation, and general liability
    insurance policies with very significant loss limits that we
    believe will provide substantial and broad coverage for the
    currently foreseeable losses arising from this accident. We
    anticipate that we will incur modest costs related to
    deductibles and co-payment obligations under available insurance
    policies, as well as other one-time costs that are not currently
    expected to be material.

SEGMENT
    REVIEW

We report our operations in two reporting
    segments:  Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods.

In June 2009, subsequent to our fiscal 2009 year end, we
    completed the divestiture of the

Fernando’s

®

foodservice brand for proceeds of approximately
    $6.4 million. We reflected the results of these operations
    as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets
    and liabilities of the divested

Fernando’s

®

business have been reclassified as assets and liabilities held
    for sale within our consolidated balance sheets for all periods
    presented.

Presentation of Commodity and Foreign Currency Derivative
    Gains and Losses in Segment Results

Prior to fiscal 2008, we designated certain commodity derivative
    instruments as cash flow hedges qualifying for hedge accounting
    treatment. We discontinued designating derivatives as cash flow
    hedges during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2008,
    subsequent to the cessation of designating derivatives for hedge
    accounting



treatment, derivative gains and losses were recorded immediately
    in our segment results as a component of cost of goods sold
    regardless of when the item being hedged impacted earnings.

Following the sale of our trading and merchandising operations
    and related organizational changes in fiscal 2009, we
    transferred the management of commodity hedging activities
    (except for those related to our milling operations) to a
    centralized procurement group. Beginning in the first quarter of
    fiscal 2009, we began to reflect realized and unrealized gains
    and losses from derivatives (except for those related to our
    milling operations) used to hedge anticipated commodity
    consumption in earnings immediately within general corporate
    expenses. The gains and losses are reclassified to segment
    operating results in the period in which the underlying item
    being hedged is recognized in cost of goods sold. We believe
    this change results in better segment management focus on key
    operational initiatives and improved transparency to derivative
    gains and losses.

In fiscal 2008, we began to centrally manage foreign currency
    risk for all of our reporting segments. Foreign currency
    derivatives used to manage foreign currency risk are not
    designated for hedge accounting treatment. As such, these
    derivatives are recognized at fair market value with realized
    and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate
    expenses. The gains and losses are subsequently recognized in
    the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in
    which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is
    included in earnings. We believe that these derivatives provide
    economic hedges of the foreign currency risk of certain
    forecasted transactions.

The following table presents the net derivative losses from
    economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and foreign
    currency risk for fiscal 2009, under this new methodology (in
    millions):

    $7.8 million and gains of $2.5 million to segment
    operating results in fiscal 2010 and 2011, respectively.

In fiscal 2008, net derivative gains from economic hedges of
    forecasted commodity consumption and currency risk of our
    foreign operations were $62.6 million in the Consumer Foods
    segment and $26.4 million in the Commercial Foods segment.
    In fiscal 2007, net derivative gains from economic hedges of
    forecasted commodity consumption and currency risk of our
    foreign operations were $14.0 million in the Consumer Foods
    segment and $7.6 million in the Commercial Foods segment.

Consumer
    Foods

The Consumer Foods reporting segment includes branded and
    private label food products that are sold in various retail and
    foodservice channels, principally in North America. The products
    include a variety of categories (meals, entrees, condiments,

    level. Selling, general and administrative expenses, other than
    advertising and promotion, are managed at the primary segment
    level, and as such, we do not separately allocate selling,
    general and administrative expenses other than advertising and
    promotion expenses to the Consumer Foods subsegments.

    and mix in the Consumer Foods segment and increased pricing in
    the milling and specialty potato operations of the Commercial
    Foods segment.

Consumer Foods net sales for fiscal 2009 were
    $8.03 billion, an increase of 8% compared to fiscal 2008.

Consumer Foods PCM for fiscal 2009 was $1.66 billion, an

    The increase in PCM reflected improved net pricing and mix and
    significant supply chain productivity savings, partially offset
    by significantly higher input costs in all subsegments. Consumer
    Foods PCM in fiscal 2008 included approximately $28 million
    of costs related to the recalls of pot pie and peanut butter
    products. Highlights by subsegment are as follows:

Grocery Foods North America

Grocery Foods North America PCM was $729 million, an
    increase of 6% compared to fiscal 2008. Results reflected
    increased volume of 3%, increased net pricing that more than
    offset higher input costs, and significant supply chain savings.
    The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign
    currencies resulted in a reduction of PCM of approximately
    $17 million, net of the benefit of economic foreign
    currency hedges. Advertising and promotion costs were
    $14 million higher in fiscal 2009 than in fiscal 2008. PCM
    included costs of $6 million related to the peanut butter
    recall in fiscal 2008.

Frozen Foods

Frozen Foods PCM was $349 million, an increase of 7%
    compared to fiscal 2008. Results reflected increased volume of
    5% and improved pricing and mix that more than offset higher
    input costs. Advertising and promotion costs were
    $16 million higher in fiscal 2009 than in fiscal 2008. PCM
    included costs of $21 million related to the pot pie recall
    in fiscal 2008.

Snacks and Store Brands

Snacks and Store Brands PCM was $324 million, an increase
    of 10% compared to fiscal 2008. Results reflected decreased
    volume of 7% and improved pricing and mix that more than offset
    higher input costs. The improvement in PCM, despite the decrease
    in volume reflects the elimination of certain low-margin

Enabler Brands

Enabler Brands PCM was $215 million, a decrease of 5%
    compared to fiscal 2008. Results reflected decreased volume of
    1%. Increases in net pricing were more than offset by the impact
    of higher input costs across the portfolio of brands, primarily
    due to an increase in the cost of edible oils.

Domestic Export

Domestic Export PCM was $47 million, an increase of 34%
    compared to fiscal 2008. Results reflected decreased volume of
    12%. The impact of improved net pricing and mix was more than
    offset by the impact of higher input costs. Fiscal 2009 PCM was
    also favorably impacted by a $9 million decrease in
    advertising and promotion expense.



Other

Other Consumer Foods PCM included $48 million and
    $63 million of realized and unrealized net losses and
    gains, respectively, on derivative instruments used to
    economically hedge anticipated commodity input costs in fiscal
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

Commercial Foods PCM was $789 million for fiscal 2009, an
    increase of $80 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2008.
    All major businesses in this segment experienced significantly
    higher input costs in fiscal 2009 than in fiscal 2008 and
    increased pricing to offset these higher costs. Improved results
    reflected increased PCM of $25 million in our flour milling
    operations due to high quality wheat crops and improved flour
    conversion margins. Our Lamb Weston specialty potato business
    achieved increased PCM of $46 million in fiscal 2009,
    reflecting PCM of $28 million from the Watts Brothers
    business acquired in late fiscal 2008 and the Lamb Weston BSW
    business acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, as well
    as increased pricing that more than offset increased input costs
    and lower volume.

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses (includes General Corporate
    Expense) (“SG&A”)

SG&A expenses totaled $1.69 billion for fiscal 2009, a
    decrease of 4% compared to fiscal 2008. We estimate that the
    inclusion of an extra week in the fiscal 2009 results increased
    SG&A expenses by approximately 2%.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2009
    reflected the following:

•

a decrease in incentive compensation expense of $53 million,

•

a charge of $49 million representing the net premium and
    fees paid to retire certain debt instruments prior to maturity,

•

a decrease in pension expense of $18 million,

•

a decrease in postretirement expense of $8 million,

•

a charge of $25 million related to a coverage dispute with
    an insurer,

•

a gain of $19 million from the sale of the

Pemmican

®

brand,

•

a decrease in stock compensation expense of $17 million,

•

an increase in salaries expense of $11 million,

•

charges related to peanut butter and pot pie recalls of
    $11 million,

•

charges of $10 million related to the execution of our
    restructuring plans,

•

$5 million of income, net of direct pass-through costs, for
    reimbursement of expenses related to transition services
    provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses,

•

a gain of $5 million on the sale of a facility in our
    Commercial Foods segment, and

•

an increase in advertising and promotion expense of
    $5 million.

Included in SG&A expenses for fiscal 2008 were the
    following items:

•

charges of $22 million related to the execution of our
    restructuring plans,

•

charges related to product recalls of $21 million, and

•

$14 million of income, net of direct pass-through costs,
    for reimbursement of expenses related to transition services
    provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses.

Consumer Foods operating profit increased $126 million in
    fiscal 2009 versus the prior year to $956 million. The
    increase was reflective of the increased PCM, discussed above,
    and was influenced by a number of factors, including:

•

restructuring costs included in selling, general and
    administrative expenses of $8 million and $19 million
    in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively,

•

costs of the product recalls classified in selling, general and
    administrative expenses of approximately $11 million and
    $21 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively,

•

a decrease in incentive compensation expense of
    $21 million, and

•

a gain of approximately $19 million related to the sale of
    the

Pemmican

brand.

Commercial Foods operating profit increased $72 million to
    $584 million in fiscal 2009. Operating profit improvement
    was principally driven by the improved PCM, as discussed above.

Interest
    Expense, Net

In fiscal 2009, net interest expense was $186 million, a
    decrease of $67 million, or 26%, from fiscal 2008. The
    reduction in net interest expense reflects interest income of
    $78 million in fiscal 2009, largely due to the

payment-in-kind

notes received in June 2008 in connection with the divestiture
    of our trading and merchandising operations.

Equity
    Method Investment Earnings

We include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based
    on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates.
    Significant affiliates produce and market potato products for
    retail and foodservice customers. Our share of earnings from our
    equity method investments were $24 million ($3 million
    in the Consumer Foods segment and $21 million in the
    Commercial Foods segment) and $50 million ($1 million
    in the Consumer Foods segment and $49 million in the
    Commercial Foods segment) in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    The decrease in equity method investment earnings in Commercial
    Foods was driven by the reduced profits of a foreign potato
    venture, resulting primarily from excess supply of potato
    products in the venture’s market.

Results
    of Discontinued Operations

Our discontinued operations generated after-tax earnings of
    $332 million in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, we completed
    the sale of the trading and merchandising operations and
    recognized an after-tax gain on the disposition of approximately
    $301 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we made
    a decision to sell certain small foodservice brands. The sale of
    these brands was completed in June 2009, subsequent to our
    fiscal 2009. We recognized after-tax impairment charges of
    $6 million in anticipation of this divestiture.

Our discontinued operations generated after-tax earnings of
    $412 million in fiscal 2008.



Income
    Taxes and Net Income

Our income tax expense was $337 million in fiscal 2009. The
    effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax
    expense to pre-tax income from continuing operations, inclusive
    of equity method investment earnings) was 34% for fiscal 2009.

During fiscal 2008, we adjusted our estimates of income taxes
    payable due to increased benefits from a domestic manufacturing
    deduction and lower foreign income taxes, resulting in a lower
    than normal effective tax rate of 30%.

The Company expects its effective tax rate in fiscal 2010,
    exclusive of any unusual transactions or tax events, to be in
    the range of 34% to 35%.

Net income was $978 million, or $2.15 per diluted share, in
    fiscal 2009, compared to $931 million, or $1.90 per diluted
    share, in fiscal 2008.

Overall, our net sales increased $1.07 billion to
    $11.56 billion in fiscal 2008, reflecting increased pricing
    in the milling and specialty potato operations of the Commercial
    Foods segment and increased volume and pricing in the Consumer
    Foods segment.

Consumer Foods net sales for fiscal 2008 were
    $7.44 billion, an increase of 5% compared to fiscal 2007.
    Results reflect an increase of three percentage points from
    improved net pricing and product mix and two percentage points
    of improvement from higher volumes. We initiated a peanut butter
    recall in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and reintroduced

Peter

peanut butter products in August 2007. Sales of all peanut
    butter products, including both branded and private label, in
    fiscal 2008 were $14 million lower than comparable amounts
    in fiscal 2007. Consumer Foods net sales were also adversely
    impacted by the recall of

Banquet

and private label pot pies in the second quarter of fiscal 2008.
    Net sales of pot pies were lower by approximately
    $22 million in fiscal 2008, relative to fiscal 2007,
    primarily due to product returns and lost sales of

and private label pot pies. Highlights by subsegment are as

Grocery Foods North America

Grocery Foods North America net sales were $2.69 billion,
    an increase of 5% compared to fiscal 2007. Results reflected
    increased sales of approximately 4% due to volume and mix. The
    strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the
    U.S. dollar accounted for approximately 1% of the increase
    in sales. Net pricing was essentially flat. Net sales of some of

    impact was flat.

Commercial Foods net sales were $4.13 billion in fiscal
    2008, an increase of $706 million, or 21%. Increased sales
    are reflective of higher sales prices in our milling operations
    due to higher grain prices, and price and volume increases in
    our specialty potato and dehydrated vegetable operations. The
    fiscal 2007 divestiture of an oat milling operation resulted in
    a reduction of sales of $27 million for fiscal 2008,
    partially offset by increased sales of $18 million from the
    acquisition of Watts Brothers in February 2008.

Consumer Foods PCM for fiscal 2008 was $1.63 billion, a
    decrease of $62 million, or 4%, from the prior year. The
    decrease in PCM reflected significantly higher input costs,
    partially offset by improved net pricing, mix, and volume. The
    increased input costs were partially offset by productivity
    improvements and gains on derivatives held



to economically hedge current and future input costs. The
    factors impacting comparability of Consumer Foods net sales also
    impact the comparability of Consumer Foods PCM. Due to the
    peanut butter recall that was initiated in the third quarter of
    fiscal 2007 and the subsequent reintroduction of

Peter
    Pan

®

peanut butter products in August 2007, PCM in the Consumer Foods
    segment is not comparable across periods. Consumer Foods PCM
    from all peanut butter products, including both branded and
    private label, in fiscal 2008 was $23 million lower than
    comparable amounts in fiscal 2007. Consumer Foods PCM on

Banquet

®

and private label pot pies products were lower by approximately
    $22 million in fiscal 2008, relative to fiscal 2007,
    primarily due to product returns and lost sales. Newly acquired

    Costs of implementing our restructuring plans reduced Consumer
    Foods PCM for fiscal 2008 and 2007 by $4 million and
    $45 million, respectively. Highlights by subsegment are as
    follows:

Grocery Foods North America

Grocery Foods North America PCM was $685 million, a
    decrease of 11%. Increased sales were offset by higher input
    costs across the portfolio of brands that decreased PCM by
    approximately 19%. Advertising and promotion costs were in line
    with prior year levels. The change in PCM includes a benefit of
    approximately $11 million due to favorable foreign currency
    exchange rate changes.

Snacks and Store Brands PCM was $294 million, a decrease of
    14%. Increases due to the impact of higher sales and lower
    advertising and promotion expense were more than offset by
    higher input costs across the portfolio of brands. The peanut
    butter and pot pie recalls, which included store brands,
    negatively impacted this subsegment’s PCM by
    $7 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007.

Enabler Brands

Enabler Brands PCM was $228 million, a decrease of 19%.
    Increases in net sales were more than offset by the impact of
    higher input costs across the portfolio of brands, primarily due
    to the increase in cost of edible oils. Advertising and
    promotion expense was in line with prior year levels.

Domestic Export

Domestic Export PCM was $35 million, an increase of 30%.
    The impact of increased sales was offset by the impact of input
    costs. Fiscal 2008 PCM was also favorably impacted by a decrease
    in advertising and promotion expense.

Other Consumer Foods PCM for fiscal 2008 principally includes
    net gains on derivatives held to economically hedge current and
    future input costs, partially offset by restructuring and other
    expenses not allocated directly to subsegments. For fiscal 2007,
    Other Consumer Foods PCM principally includes restructuring
    costs and other expenses not allocated directly to subsegments,
    partially offset by net gains on derivatives held to
    economically hedge current and future input costs. These amounts
    are not reflected in subsequent PCM results.

Commercial Foods PCM was $709 million for fiscal 2008, an
    increase of $131 million, or 23%, over the prior year.
    Improved results reflected increased PCM of $68 million in
    our milling operations due to a favorable wheat commodity
    environment and improved flour conversion margins. We also
    achieved an increase in PCM of $61 million in our specialty
    potato business as benefits from pricing, volume growth, and
    product mix management exceeded the impact of higher input
    costs. Results also reflected gains on derivatives held to
    economically hedge current and future input costs as well as
    profits from wheat derivatives trading.



Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses (includes General Corporate
    Expense) (“SG&A”)

SG&A expenses totaled $1.76 billion for fiscal 2008,
    virtually unchanged from the prior fiscal year.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2008
    reflected the following:

•

a decrease in advertising and promotion expense of
    $58 million,

•

an increase in salaries expense of $45 million,

•

a decrease in incentive compensation expense of $41 million,

•

charges of $22 million related to the execution of our

•

charges related to product recalls of $21 million,

•

$14 million of income, net of direct pass-through costs,
    for reimbursement of expenses related to transition services

Consumer Foods operating profit decreased $81 million in
    fiscal 2008 versus the prior fiscal year to $830 million.
    The decrease for the fiscal year was reflective of the decreased
    PCM, discussed above, and was influenced by a number of factors,
    including:

•

restructuring costs included in selling, general and
    administrative expenses of $19 million and $40 million
    in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively,

•

costs of the product recalls classified in selling, general and
    administrative expenses of approximately $21 million and
    $36 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively,

•

a $23 million decrease in transition services reimbursement
    income, net of direct pass-through costs, related to transition
    services provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses
    in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, similar reimbursement income of
    $14 million is reflected in general corporate expenses and
    did not impact operating profit, and

•

a gain of approximately $4 million related to the sale of
    certain international licensing rights.



Commercial Foods operating profit increased $77 million to
    $512 million in fiscal 2008. Operating profit improvement
    was principally driven by the improved PCM, as discussed above.
    Other factors affecting the increased operating profit included
    higher selling expense and compensation costs in fiscal 2008,
    and gains recorded in fiscal 2007 of $18 million related to
    our sale of an oat milling business and $8 million
    resulting from a legal settlement related to a fire.

Interest
    Expense, Net

In fiscal 2008, net interest expense was $253 million, an
    increase of $34 million, or 15%, over the prior fiscal
    year. Increased interest expense reflected our use of commercial
    paper to finance higher working capital balances in all
    segments, particularly in the trading and merchandising business
    which is now presented within discontinued operations. We also
    earned less interest income due to lower balances of cash on
    hand in fiscal 2008.

Equity
    Method Investment Earnings

We include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based
    on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates.
    Significant affiliates produce and market potato products for
    retail and foodservice customers. Our share of earnings from our
    equity method investments was $50 million ($1 million
    in the Consumer Foods segment and $49 million in the
    Commercial Foods segment) and $28 million ($2 million
    in the Consumer Foods segment and $26 million in the
    Commercial Foods segment) in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    The increase in equity method investment earnings in Commercial
    Foods was driven by improved performance of a foreign potato
    venture.

Results
    of Discontinued Operations

Income from discontinued operations was $412 million, net
    of tax, in fiscal 2008. Included in these amounts are:

•

pre-tax earnings of $669 million, largely the result of
    very strong profits from the fertilizer, agricultural
    merchandising, energy trading, and agricultural trading
    operations of the trading and merchandising business, and

•

income tax expense of $257 million.

Income from discontinued operations was $283 million, net
    of tax, in fiscal 2007. Included in these amounts are:

•

pre-tax earnings of $459 million from operations of
    discontinued businesses, largely the result of strong profits
    from the trading of fertilizer and crude oil in the trading and
    merchandising business, a pre-tax curtailment gain of
    $9 million related to postretirement benefits of the
    packaged meats operations divested in fiscal 2007, and an
    $8 million gain related to a legal settlement in connection
    with the packaged meats operations,

•

impairment charges of $21 million based on the final
    negotiations related to the sale of the packaged meats
    operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2007,

•

a gain of $64 million primarily from the disposition of our
    packaged cheese business and a dietary supplement business, and

•

income tax expense of $176 million.

Income
    Taxes and Net Income

The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax
    expense to pre-tax income from continuing operations, inclusive
    of equity method investment earnings) was 30% for fiscal 2008.
    During fiscal 2008, we adjusted our estimates of income taxes
    payable due to increased benefits from a domestic manufacturing
    deduction and lower foreign income taxes, resulting in a lower
    than normal effective tax rate. These impacts and tax benefits
    related to a change in the legal structure of our subsidiaries
    are the primary contributors to the decrease in the year-to-date
    effective tax rate from fiscal 2007.



The effective tax rate was 34% in fiscal 2007. In 2007, state
    income taxes included approximately $24 million of benefits
    related to the implementation of tax planning strategies and
    changes in estimates, principally related to state tax
    jurisdictions. These benefits were offset by the tax impact of
    an Internal Revenue Service audit settlement.

Net income was $931 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, in
    fiscal 2008, compared to $765 million, or $1.51 per diluted
    share, in fiscal 2007.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Sources
    of Liquidity and Capital

Our primary financing objective is to maintain a prudent capital
    structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth
    objectives. We currently use short-term debt principally to
    finance ongoing operations, including our seasonal requirements
    for working capital (accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and
    other current assets, and inventories, less accounts payable,
    accrued payroll, and other accrued liabilities) and a
    combination of equity and long-term debt to finance both our
    base working capital needs and our noncurrent assets.

Commercial paper borrowings (usually less than 30 days
    maturity) are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets
    within notes payable. At May 31, 2009, we had a
    $1.5 billion multi-year revolving credit facility with a
    syndicate of financial institutions which matures in December
    2011. The multi-year facility has historically been used solely
    as a

back-up

facility for our commercial paper program. As of May 31,
    2009, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility.
    Borrowings under the multi-year facility bear interest at or
    below prime rate and may be prepaid without penalty. The
    multi-year facility requires that our consolidated funded debt
    not exceed 65% of our consolidated capital base, and that our
    fixed charges coverage ratio be greater than 1.75 to 1.0. As of
    the end of fiscal 2009, the Company was in compliance with these
    financial covenants.

As of the end of fiscal 2009, our senior long-term debt ratings
    were all investment grade. A significant downgrade in our credit
    ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the
    revolving credit facility, although borrowing costs would
    increase. A downgrade of our short-term credit ratings would
    impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program
    by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter
    durations, as well as making access to commercial paper more
    difficult.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we issued
    $1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes
    ($500 million maturing in 2014 and $500 million
    maturing in 2019), with an average blended interest rate of
    approximately 6.4%. We subsequently repaid approximately
    $900 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes
    with maturities of 2010, 2011, and 2027. We incurred charges of
    $50 million for the premium paid and transaction costs
    associated with the debt retirement. We also contributed
    $100 million to our pension plans in order to improve the
    funded status of the plans.

We have repurchased our shares of common stock from time to time
    based on repurchase limits authorized by our Board of Directors
    and market conditions. During fiscal 2008 we repurchased
    $188 million of our shares. During fiscal 2009, we executed
    an accelerated share repurchase, buying back approximately
    44 million shares of our common stock at a cost of
    $900 million. At May 31, 2009, our current share
    repurchase authorization was essentially exhausted.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we sold our trading and
    merchandising operations for proceeds of: 1) approximately
    $2.2 billion in cash, net of transaction costs,
    2) $550 million (face value) of

payment-in-kind

debt securities issued by the purchaser (the “Notes”)
    which was recorded at an initial estimated fair value of
    $479 million, 3) a short-term receivable of
    $37 million due from the purchaser (which was subsequently
    collected), and 4) a four-year warrant to acquire
    approximately 5% of the issued common equity of the parent
    company of the divested operations, which has been recorded at
    an estimated fair value of $1.8 million. The Notes, which
    are classified as other assets, had a carrying value of
    $522 million at May 31, 2009.



Cash
    Flows

In fiscal 2009, we generated $72 million of cash, which was
    the net result of $124 million generated from operating
    activities, $1.79 billion generated from investing
    activities, and $1.83 billion used in financing activities.

Cash generated from operating activities of continuing
    operations totaled $978 million for fiscal 2009 as compared
    to $371 million generated in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2008,
    cash flows from income of continuing operations were largely
    absorbed by increased working capital requirements, particularly
    due to increased quantities and unit costs of inventory. In
    fiscal 2009, improved income from continuing operations and
    working capital management efforts resulted in significantly
    improved cash flows from operating activities of continuing
    operations. Specifically, we improved the speed of our
    collection of accounts receivable and converted derivative
    positions used in our economic hedging activities to cash, which
    more than offset the increase in crop-based inventory balances
    in our Commercial Foods businesses. The increased inventory
    balances in our Commercial Foods businesses are largely due to
    the purchase of strong potato and garlic crops, coupled with
    lower demand in the foodservice channel. We also contributed
    $112 million to our Company-sponsored pension plans in
    fiscal 2009. Cash used in operating activities of discontinued
    operations was $854 million in fiscal 2009, primarily due
    to the increase in commodity inventory balances and derivative
    assets in the trading and merchandising business during the
    brief period we held that business prior to its divestiture in
    June 2008. Cash used in operating activities of discontinued
    operations was $278 million in fiscal 2008.

Cash used in investing activities of continuing operations
    totaled $467 million in fiscal 2009 and $676 million
    in fiscal 2008. Investing activities of continuing operations in
    fiscal 2009 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of
    $442 million and acquisitions of businesses (including Lamb
    Weston BSW) and intangible assets totaling $84 million,
    partially offset by sales of businesses (including the

Pemmican

business) and fixed assets. Investing activities of continuing
    operations in fiscal 2008 consisted primarily of expenditures of
    $255 million related to the acquisition of businesses (see
    Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements) and
    capital expenditures of $489 million, which included
    approximately $39 million of expenditures related to the
    purchase of certain warehouse facilities from our lessors (these
    warehouses were sold for proceeds of approximately
    $36 million to unrelated third parties immediately
    thereafter), offset by $30 million of proceeds from the
    sale of property, plant, and equipment. We generated
    $2.26 billion of cash from investing activities of
    discontinued operations in fiscal 2009 from the disposition of
    the trading and merchandising business. We generated
    $32 million from investing activities from discontinued
    operations in fiscal 2008, primarily from the sale of the

Knott’s Berry
    Farm

®

jams and jellies brand and operations.

Cash used in financing activities totaled $1.83 billion in
    fiscal 2009, as compared to cash used in financing activities of
    $22 million in fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2009, we
    repurchased $900 million of our common stock as part of our
    share repurchase program, we reduced our short-term borrowings
    by $578 million, and paid dividends of $348 million.
    We refinanced certain of our long-term debt in fiscal 2009,
    issuing $1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior
    notes ($500 million maturing in 2014 and $500 million
    maturing in 2019.) We repaid $950 million aggregate
    principal amount of senior and subordinated notes throughout the
    year (net losses of $49 million on the retirement of debt
    are also reflected as financing cash outflows). During fiscal
    2008, we repurchased $188 million of our common stock as
    part of our share repurchase program and paid dividends of
    $362 million. As part of the Watts Brothers acquisition, we
    repaid $64 million of assumed long-term debt subsequent to
    the acquisition. In addition to these early retirements of debt,
    we made scheduled principal payments of debt and payments of
    lease financing obligations during fiscal 2008, reducing
    long-term debt by $21 million. Also, during fiscal 2008, we
    increased our short-term borrowings by $577 million,
    primarily reflecting the financing of significantly increased
    working capital.

We estimate our capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 will be
    approximately $475 million. Management believes that
    existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing
    credit facilities, and access to capital markets will provide
    sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs, planned
    capital expenditures, and payment of anticipated quarterly
    dividends for at least the next twelve months.



OFF-BALANCE
    SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We use off-balance sheet arrangements (e.g., operating leases)
    where the economics and sound business principles warrant their
    use. We periodically enter into guarantees and other similar
    arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of
    business. These are described further in “Obligations and
    Commitments,” below.

In September 2008, we formed a potato processing venture, Lamb
    Weston BSW, with Ochoa Ag Unlimited Foods, Inc. We provide all
    sales and marketing services to the venture. We have determined
    that Lamb Weston BSW is a variable interest entity and that we
    are the primary beneficiary of the entity. Accordingly, we
    consolidate the financial statements of Lamb Weston BSW. We also
    consolidate the assets and liabilities of several entities from
    which we lease corporate aircraft. Each of these entities has
    been determined to be a variable interest entity and we have
    been determined to be the primary beneficiary of each of these
    entities.

Due to the consolidation of the variable interest entities, we
    reflected in our balance sheets:

The liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating these

    assets of the Company. The creditors of these entities have
    claims only on the assets of the specific variable interest
    entities to which they have advanced credit.

OBLIGATIONS
    AND COMMITMENTS

As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements
    that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as
    debt agreements, lease agreements, and unconditional purchase
    obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future
    for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or
    minimum prices, such as “take-or-pay” contracts). The
    unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into
    in our normal course of business in order to ensure adequate
    levels of sourced product are available. Of these items, debt
    and capital lease obligations, which totaled $3.6 billion
    as of May 31, 2009, were recognized as liabilities in our
    consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease obligations and
    unconditional purchase obligations, which totaled approximately
    $1.0 billion as of May 31, 2009, in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles, were not recognized as
    liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.



A summary of our contractual obligations at the end of fiscal
    2009 was as follows (including obligations of discontinued
    operations):

We are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our
    long-term debt and capital lease obligations. The weighted
    average interest rate of the long-term debt obligations
    outstanding as of May 31, 2009 was approximately 7.0%.

We consolidate the assets and liabilities of certain entities
    that have been determined to be variable interest entities and
    for which we have been determined to be the primary beneficiary
    of these entities. The amounts reflected in contractual
    obligations of long-term debt, in the table above, include
    $89 million of liabilities of these variable interest
    entities to the creditors of such entities. The long-term debt
    recognized as a result of consolidating these entities does not
    represent additional claims on our general assets. The creditors
    of these entities have claims only on the assets of the specific
    variable interest entities. As of May 31, 2009, we were
    obligated to make rental payments of $60 million to the
    variable interest entities, of which $7 million is due in
    less than one year, $23 million is due in one to three
    years, and $30 million is due in three to five years. Such
    amounts are not reflected in the table above.

The purchase obligations noted in the table above do not reflect
    approximately $474 million of open purchase orders, some of
    which are not legally binding. These purchase orders will be
    settled in the ordinary course of business in less than one year.

As part of our ongoing operations, we also enter into
    arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only
    upon the occurrence of a future event (e.g., guarantee debt or
    lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable
    to perform). In accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, the following commercial commitments are not
    recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. A
    summary of our commitments, including commitments associated
    with equity method investments, as of the end of fiscal 2009,

In certain limited situations, we will guarantee an obligation
    of an unconsolidated entity. We have outstanding guarantees of
    certain railcar leases of the divested trading and merchandising
    business (now operating as the Gavilon Group, LLC
    (“Gavilon”)); the railcar leases were in place prior
    to the divestiture and the parties are working with the lessors
    to secure our release. The remaining terms of these lease
    agreements do not exceed two years and the maximum amount of
    future payments we have guaranteed was $3 million as of
    May 31, 2009. We have not established a liability for these
    guarantees, which are included in the table above, as we have
    determined that the likelihood of our required performance under
    the guarantees is remote.

We guarantee certain leases and other commercial obligations
    resulting from our fresh beef and pork divestiture. The
    remaining terms of these arrangements do not exceed seven years
    and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was
    approximately $18 million as of May 31, 2009. We have
    also



guaranteed the performance of the divested fresh beef and pork
    business with respect to a hog purchase contract. The hog
    purchase contract requires the divested fresh beef and pork
    business to purchase a minimum of approximately 1.2 million
    hogs annually through 2014. The contract stipulates minimum
    price commitments, based in part on market prices, and in
    certain circumstances also includes price adjustments based on
    certain inputs.

We are a party to various potato supply agreements. Under the
    terms of certain such potato supply agreements, we have
    guaranteed repayment of short-term bank loans of the potato
    suppliers, under certain conditions. At May 31, 2009, the
    amount of supplier loans effectively guaranteed by us was
    approximately $40 million, included in the table above. We
    have not established a liability for these guarantees, as we
    have determined that the likelihood of our required performance
    under the guarantees is remote.

We are a party to a supply agreement with an onion processing
    company. We have guaranteed repayment of a loan of this
    supplier, under certain conditions. At May 31, 2009, the
    amount of this loan was $25 million, included in the table
    above. In the event of default on this loan by the supplier, we
    have the contractual right to purchase the loan from the lender,
    thereby giving us the rights to underlying collateral. We have
    not established a liability in connection with this guarantee,
    as we believe the likelihood of financial exposure to us under
    this agreement is remote.

The obligations and commitments tables above do not include any
    reserves for income taxes under FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (as amended),

as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of
    settlement of our reserves for income taxes. The liability for
    gross unrecognized tax benefits at May 31, 2009 was
    $75 million.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The process of preparing financial statements requires the use
    of estimates on the part of management. The estimates used by
    management are based on our historical experiences combined with
    management’s understanding of current facts and
    circumstances. Certain of our accounting estimates are
    considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal
    of our financial condition and results and require significant
    or complex judgment on the part of management. The following is
    a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by
    management.

Our Audit Committee has reviewed management’s development,
    selection, and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates.

Marketing Costs

—We incur certain costs to promote
    our products through marketing programs, which include
    advertising, retailer incentives, and consumer incentives. We
    recognize the cost of each of these types of marketing
    activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles. The judgment required in determining when marketing
    costs are incurred can be significant. For volume-based
    incentives provided to retailers, management must continually
    assess the likelihood of the retailer achieving the specified
    targets. Similarly, for consumer coupons, management must
    estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by
    consumers in the future. Estimates made by management in
    accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on our
    historical experience with marketing programs with consideration
    given to current circumstances and industry trends. As these
    factors change, management’s estimates could change and we
    could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over
    different periods of time.

In fiscal 2009, we entered into approximately 120,000 individual
    marketing programs with customers, resulting in annual costs in
    excess of $2.5 billion, which are reflected as a reduction
    of net sales. Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the
    cost of any of the individual customer marketing programs would
    not result in a material change in our results of operations or
    cash flows.

Advertising and promotion expenses of continuing operations
    totaled $399 million, $393 million, and
    $451 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Income Taxes

—Our income tax expense is based on our
    income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities
    available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax
    laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the
    taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities.
    Significant judgment is



required in determining our income tax expense and in evaluating
    our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties under
    Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (FIN) 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

. Management
    reviews our tax positions quarterly and adjusts the balances as
    new information becomes available. Deferred income tax assets
    represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on
    taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of
    temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax
    bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating
    loss and tax credit carryforwards. Management evaluates the
    recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the
    adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources,
    including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted
    operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These
    estimates of future taxable income inherently require
    significant judgment. Management uses historical experience and
    short and long-range business forecasts to develop such
    estimates. Further, we employ various prudent and feasible tax
    planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future
    deductions. To the extent management does not consider it more
    likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a
    valuation allowance is established.

Further information on income taxes is provided in Note 15
    to the consolidated financial statements.

Environmental Liabilities

—Environmental liabilities
    are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been
    incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated.
    Management works with independent third-party specialists in
    order to effectively assess our environmental liabilities.
    Management estimates our environmental liabilities based on
    evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required cleanup,
    our known volumetric contribution, other potentially responsible
    parties, and our experience in remediating sites. Environmental
    liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or
    other external determinations of what constitutes an
    environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup.
    Management’s estimate as to our potential liability is
    independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or
    indemnification arrangements. Insurance companies and other
    indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and
    periodically updated as to the general status of known claims.
    We do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing
    of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily
    determinable. To the extent that there are changes in the
    evaluation factors identified above, management’s estimate
    of environmental liabilities may also change.

We have recognized a reserve of approximately $89 million
    for environmental liabilities as of May 31, 2009.
    Historically, the underlying assumptions utilized in estimating
    this reserve have been appropriate as actual payments have
    neither differed materially from the previously estimated
    reserve balances, nor have significant adjustments to this
    reserve balance been necessary. The reserve for each site is
    determined based on an assessment of the most likely required
    remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect
    such remedy.

Employment-Related Benefits

—We incur certain
    employment-related expenses associated with pensions,
    postretirement health care benefits, and workers’
    compensation. In order to measure the expense associated with
    these employment-related benefits, management must make a
    variety of estimates including discount rates used to measure
    the present value of certain liabilities, assumed rates of
    return on assets set aside to fund these expenses, compensation
    increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates,
    anticipated health care costs, and employee accidents incurred
    but not yet reported to us. The estimates used by management are
    based on our historical experience as well as current facts and
    circumstances. We use third-party specialists to assist
    management in appropriately measuring the expense associated
    with these employment-related benefits. Different estimates used
    by management could result in us recognizing different amounts
    of expense over different periods of time.

We recognized pension expense from Company plans of
    $38 million, $56 million, and $75 million in
    fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, which reflected
    expected returns on plan assets of $159 million,
    $149 million, and $134 million, respectively. We
    contributed $112 million, $8 million, and
    $172 million to our pension plans in fiscal years 2009,
    2008, and 2007, respectively. We anticipate contributing
    approximately $34 million to our pension plans in fiscal
    2010.

One significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the
    discount rate. We select a discount rate each year (as of our
    fiscal year-end measurement date for fiscal 2008 and thereafter)
    for our plans based upon a hypothetical bond portfolio for which
    the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the

year-by-year

projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans. The
    hypothetical bond portfolio is comprised of high-quality fixed
    income debt instruments (usually Moody’s Aa) available at
    the measurement date. Based on this information, the discount
    rate



selected by us for determination of pension expense was 6.6% for
    fiscal year 2009 and 5.75% for fiscal 2008 and 2007. We selected
    a discount rate of 6.9% for determination of pension expense for
    fiscal 2010. A 25 basis point increase in our discount rate
    assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would decrease
    pension expense for our pension plans by $1.4 million for
    the year. A 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate
    assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would increase
    pension expense for our pension plans by $1.5 million for
    the year. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate
    would decrease pension expense by approximately
    $1.6 million for fiscal 2010. A 25 basis point
    decrease in the discount rate would increase pension expense by
    approximately $1.7 million for fiscal 2010. For our
    year-end pension obligation determination, we selected a
    discount rate of 6.9% and 6.6% for fiscal year 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Another significant assumption used to account for our pension
    plans is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
    In developing the assumed long-term rate of return on plan
    assets for determining pension expense, we consider long-term
    historical returns (arithmetic average) of the plan’s
    investments, the asset allocation among types of investments,
    estimated long-term returns by investment type from external
    sources, and the current economic environment. Based on this
    information, we selected 7.75% for the long-term rate of return
    on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2009 pension expense.
    A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our expected
    long-term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of
    fiscal 2009 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for
    our pension plans by approximately $5 million. We selected
    an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% to be used to
    determine our pension expense for fiscal 2010. A 25 basis
    point increase/decrease in our expected long-term rate of return
    assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2010 would
    decrease/increase annual pension expense for our pension plans
    by approximately $5 million.

When calculating expected return on plan assets for pension
    plans, we use a market-related value of assets that spreads
    asset gains and losses (differences between actual return and
    expected return) over five years. The market-related value of
    assets used in the calculation of expected return on plan assets
    for fiscal 2009 was $266 million lower than the actual fair
    value of plan assets.

The rate of compensation increase is another significant
    assumption used in the development of accounting information for
    pension plans. We determine this assumption based on our
    long-term plans for compensation increases and current economic
    conditions. Based on this information, we selected 4.25% for
    fiscal years 2009 and 2008 as the rate of compensation increase
    for determining our year-end pension obligation. We selected
    4.25% for the rate of compensation increase for determination of
    pension expense for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007. A 25 basis
    point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption
    as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would increase pension
    expense for our pension plans by approximately $1 million
    for the year. A 25 basis point decrease in our rate of
    compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal
    2009 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by
    approximately $1 million for the year. We selected a rate
    of 4.25% for the rate of compensation increase to be used to
    determine our pension expense for fiscal 2010. A 25 basis
    point increase/decrease in our rate of compensation increase
    assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2010 would
    increase/decrease pension expense for our pension plans by
    approximately $1 million for the year.

We also provide certain postretirement health care benefits. We
    recognized postretirement benefit expense of $15 million,
    $23 million, and $10 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, and
    2007, respectively. We reflected liabilities of
    $281 million and $378 million in our balance sheets as
    of May 31, 2009 and May 25, 2008, respectively. We
    anticipate contributing approximately $34 million to our
    postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2010.

The postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also
    dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined
    amounts. These assumptions include discount rates (discussed
    above), health care cost trend rates, inflation rates,
    retirement rates, mortality rates, and other factors. The health
    care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical
    cost data, the near-term outlook, and an assessment of likely
    long-term trends. Assumed inflation rates are based on an
    evaluation of external market indicators. Retirement and
    mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience.
    The discount rate we selected for determination of
    postretirement expense was 6.4% for fiscal year 2009 and 5.5%
    for fiscal 2008 and 2007. We have selected a discount rate of
    6.6% for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal
    2010. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our discount
    rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would not
    have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for
    our plans. We have assumed the initial year increase in cost of
    health care to be 8.5%, with the trend rate



decreasing to 5.5% by 2013. A one percentage point change in the
    assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following
    effect:

We provide workers’ compensation benefits to our employees.
    The measurement of the liability for our cost of providing these
    benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs. One
    significant assumption we make is the discount rate used to
    calculate the present value of our obligation. The discount rate
    used at May 31, 2009 was 4.2%. A 25 basis point
    increase/decrease in the discount rate assumption would not have
    a material impact on workers’ compensation expense.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (including property, plant
    and equipment), Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible
    Assets

—We reduce the carrying amounts of long-lived
    assets, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets to their
    fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to
    be less than their carrying amounts (i.e., assets are deemed to
    be impaired). Fair value is typically estimated using a
    discounted cash flow analysis, which requires us to estimate the
    future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular
    asset(s) being tested for impairment as well as to select a
    discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated
    cash flows. When determining future cash flow estimates, we
    consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and
    anticipated operating conditions. Estimating future cash flows
    requires significant judgment by management in such areas as
    future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions,
    product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures. The use of
    different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could
    produce different impairment amounts (or none at all) for
    long-lived assets, goodwill, and identifiable intangible assets.

We utilize a “relief from royalty” methodology in
    evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brands/trademarks.
    The methodology determines the fair value of each brand through
    use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an
    estimated “royalty rate” we would be able to charge a
    third party for the use of the particular brand. When
    determining the future cash flow estimates, we must estimate
    future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each
    applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the
    present value of the anticipated cash flows. Estimating future
    net sales requires significant judgment by management in such
    areas as future economic conditions, product pricing, and
    consumer trends.

In determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the
    estimated future cash flows, we consider the current interest
    rate environment and our estimated cost of capital. As the
    calculated fair value of our goodwill and other identifiable
    intangible assets generally significantly exceeds the carrying
    amount of these assets, a one percentage point increase in the
    discount rate assumptions used to estimate the fair values of
    our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets would not
    result in a material impairment charge.

RECENTLY
    ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167,

Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)

. This
    statement amends FIN 46(R) to require an enterprise to
    perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise’s
    variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial
    interest in a variable interest entity. This analysis identifies
    the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the
    enterprise that has both of the following characteristics: the
    power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity
    that most significantly impact the entity’s economic
    performance, and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity
    that could potentially be significant to the variable interest
    entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that
    could potentially be significant to the variable interest
    entity. The provisions of this statement are effective as of the
    beginning of our fiscal 2011. Earlier application is prohibited.
    We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting
    SFAS No. 167.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP

EITF 03-6-1,

Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions are Participating Securities

. FSP

EITF 03-6-1

requires that unvested share-based payment awards that contain
    nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are
    participating securities and must be included in the computation
    of earnings per share under the two-class method. FSP

EITF 03-6-1

is effective as of



the beginning of our fiscal 2010. We do not expect the adoption
    of this FSP to have a material impact on our financial
    statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an Amendment of ARB No. 51

. This statement
    amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards
    for the noncontrolling interest (minority interest) in a
    subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Upon its
    adoption, effective as of the beginning of our fiscal 2010,
    noncontrolling interests will be classified as equity in our
    financial statements and income and comprehensive income
    attributed to the noncontrolling interest will be included in
    our income and comprehensive income. The provisions of this
    standard must be applied prospectively, except for the
    presentation and disclosure requirements. The presentation and
    disclosure requirements of this standard must be applied
    retrospectively upon adoption. We are currently evaluating the
    impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 160 on our
    consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

(“SFAS No. 141(R)”).
    SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and
    requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination
    recognizes and measures the assets acquired, liabilities
    assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. The
    provisions of SFAS No. 141(R) are effective for our
    business combinations occurring on or after June 1, 2009.

RELATED
    PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Sales to affiliates (equity method investees) of
    $1.6 million, $4.2 million, and $3.8 million for
    fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, were included in net
    sales. We received management fees from affiliates of
    $17.8 million, $16.3 million, and $14.8 million
    in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Accounts
    receivable from affiliates totaled $2.7 million and
    $3.2 million at May 31, 2009 and May 25, 2008,
    respectively, of which $3.0 million was included in current
    assets held for sale at May 25, 2008. Accounts payable to
    affiliates totaled $14.3 million and $15.6 million at
    May 31, 2009 and May 25, 2008, respectively.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we sold an aircraft for
    proceeds of approximately $8.1 million to a company on
    whose board of directors one of the Company’s directors
    sits. We recognized a gain of approximately $3.0 million on
    the transaction.

From time to time, one of our business units has engaged an
    environmental and agricultural engineering services firm. The
    firm is a subsidiary of an entity whose chief executive officer
    serves on our Board of Directors. Payments to this firm for
    environmental and agricultural engineering services and
    structures acquired totaled $0.4 million in each of fiscal
    2009 and fiscal 2008.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The principal market risks affecting us during fiscal 2009 and
    2008 were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and
    energy inputs, interest rates, and foreign currencies. These
    fluctuations impacted raw material and energy costs of all
    reporting segments, as well as our trading and merchandising
    activities, which are presented as discontinued operations for
    all periods presented in our financial statements.

Commodities

—We purchase commodity inputs such as
    wheat, corn, oats, soybean meal, soybean oil, meat, dairy
    products, sugar, natural gas, electricity, and packaging
    materials to be used in our operations. These commodities are
    subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk. We
    enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using
    physical forward contracts or derivative instruments. We have
    policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may
    use. These policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure
    for each of our businesses. We also monitor the amount of
    associated counter-party credit risk for all non-exchange-traded
    transactions. In addition, during our ownership of the trading
    and merchandising business (divested during quarter one of
    fiscal 2009), we purchased and sold certain commodities, such as
    wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, oats, natural
    gas, and crude oil (presented in discontinued operations).

The following table presents one measure of market risk exposure
    using sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis is the
    measurement of potential loss of fair value resulting from a
    hypothetical change of 10% in market prices. Actual changes in
    market prices may differ from hypothetical changes. In practice,
    as markets move, we actively manage our risk and adjust hedging
    strategies as appropriate.

Fair value was determined using quoted market prices and was
    based on our net derivative position by commodity at each
    quarter-end during the fiscal year.

The market risk exposure analysis excludes the underlying
    commodity positions that are being hedged. The values of
    commodities hedged have a high inverse correlation to price
    changes of the derivative commodity instrument.

Interest Rates

—We may use interest rate swaps to
    manage the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of
    our existing debt as well as the forecasted interest payments
    for the anticipated issuance of debt. At the end of fiscal 2009
    and 2008, we did not have any interest rate swap agreements
    outstanding.

As of May 31, 2009 and May 25, 2008, the fair value of
    our fixed rate debt was estimated at $3.7 billion, based on
    current market rates primarily provided by outside investment
    advisors. As of May 31, 2009 and May 25, 2008, a one
    percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease the
    fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately
    $196 million and $228 million, respectively, while a
    one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase
    the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately
    $307 million and $258 million, respectively.

Foreign Operations

—In order to reduce exposures
    related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we may
    enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions
    denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for
    certain of our processing operations. This activity primarily
    relates to hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing
    inventory, capital equipment, sales of finished goods, and
    future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.



The following table presents one measure of market risk exposure
    using sensitivity analysis for our processing operations.
    Sensitivity analysis is the measurement of potential loss of
    fair value resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in
    exchange rates. Actual changes in exchange rates may differ from
    hypothetical changes.

Fair value was determined using quoted exchange rates and was
    based on our net foreign currency position at each quarter-end
    during the fiscal year.

The market risk exposure analysis excludes the underlying
    foreign denominated transactions that are being hedged. The
    currencies hedged have a high inverse correlation to exchange
    rate changes of the foreign currency derivative instrument.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Fiscal Year

—The fiscal year of ConAgra Foods,
    Inc. (“ConAgra Foods”, “Company”,
    “we”, “us”, or “our”) ends the
    last Sunday in May. The fiscal years for the consolidated
    financial statements presented consist of a 53-week period for
    fiscal year 2009 and 52-week periods for fiscal years 2008 and
    2007.

Basis of Consolidation

—The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of ConAgra Foods and
    all majority-owned subsidiaries. In addition, the accounts of
    all variable interest entities for which we are determined to be
    the primary beneficiary are included in our consolidated
    financial statements from the date such determination is made.
    All significant intercompany investments, accounts, and
    transactions have been eliminated.

Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates

—The
    investments in and the operating results of 50%-or-less-owned
    entities not required to be consolidated are included in the
    consolidated financial statements on the basis of the equity
    method of accounting or the cost method of accounting, depending
    on specific facts and circumstances.

We review our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for
    impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances
    indicate that the carrying amount of the investments may not be
    fully recoverable. Evidence of a loss in value that is other
    than temporary might include the absence of an ability to
    recover the carrying amount of the investment, the inability of
    the investee to sustain an earnings capacity which would justify
    the carrying amount of the investment, or, where applicable,
    estimated sales proceeds which are insufficient to recover the
    carrying amount of the investment. Management’s assessment
    as to whether any decline in value is other than temporary is
    based on our ability and intent to hold the investment and
    whether evidence indicating the carrying value of the investment
    is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs
    evidence to the contrary. Management generally considers our
    investments in our equity method investees to be strategic
    long-term investments. Therefore, management completes its
    assessments with a long-term viewpoint. If the fair value of the
    investment is determined to be less than the carrying value and
    the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary,
    an appropriate write-down is recorded based on the excess of the
    carrying value over the best estimate of fair value of the
    investment.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

—Cash and all highly
    liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or
    less at the date of acquisition, including short-term time
    deposits and government agency and corporate obligations, are
    classified as cash and cash equivalents.

Inventories

—We principally use the lower of
    cost (determined using the

first-in,

first-out method) or market for valuing inventories other than
    merchandisable agricultural commodities. Grain, flour, and major
    feed ingredient inventories are principally stated at market
    value.

Property, Plant and Equipment

—Property, plant
    and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation has been
    calculated using primarily the straight-line method over the
    estimated useful lives of the respective classes of assets as
    follows:

Land improvements

1 - 40 years

Buildings

15 - 40 years

Machinery and equipment

3 - 20 years

Furniture, fixtures, office equipment, and other

5 - 15 years

We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever
    events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
    Recoverability of an asset considered

“held-and-used”

is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to
    the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from
    the use of the asset. If the carrying amount is greater than the
    undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the
    asset, the asset’s carrying amount is reduced to its
    estimated fair

value. An asset considered “held-for-sale” is reported
    at the lower of the asset’s carrying amount or fair value
    less cost to sell.

Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible
    Assets

—Goodwill and other identifiable intangible
    assets with indefinite lives (e.g., brands or trademarks) are
    not amortized and are tested annually for impairment of value
    and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
    carrying amount of the asset may be impaired. Impairment of
    identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives occurs when
    the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. If
    impaired, the asset’s carrying amount is reduced to its
    fair value. Goodwill is evaluated using a two-step impairment
    test at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit can be an
    operating segment or a business within an operating segment. The
    first step of the test compares the recorded value of a
    reporting unit, including goodwill, with its fair value, as
    determined by its estimated discounted cash flows. If the
    recorded value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we
    complete the second step of the test to determine the amount of
    goodwill impairment loss to be recognized. In the second step,
    we estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s
    goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to
    all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including
    any unrecognized intangible assets). The impairment loss is
    equal to the excess of the recorded value of the goodwill over
    the implied fair value of that goodwill. Our annual impairment
    testing is performed during the fourth quarter using a
    discounted cash flow-based methodology.

Identifiable intangible assets with definite lives (e.g.,
    licensing arrangements with contractual lives or customer
    relationships) are amortized over their estimated useful lives
    and tested for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be
    impaired. Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to
    amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process
    similar to that used in evaluating elements of property, plant
    and equipment. If impaired, the asset is written down to its
    fair value.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

—Unless
    otherwise specified, we believe the carrying value of financial
    instruments approximates their fair value.

Environmental Liabilities

—Environmental
    liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations
    have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably
    estimated. We use third-party specialists to assist management
    in appropriately measuring the expense associated with
    environmental liabilities. Such liabilities are adjusted as new
    information develops or circumstances change. We do not discount
    our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated
    cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable.
    Management’s estimate of our potential liability is
    independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or
    indemnification arrangements. We have not reduced our
    environmental liabilities for potential insurance recoveries.

Employment-Related
    Benefits

—Employment-related benefits associated
    with pensions, postretirement health care benefits, and
    workers’ compensation are expensed as such obligations are
    incurred. The recognition of expense is impacted by estimates
    made by management, such as discount rates used to value these
    liabilities, future health care costs, and employee accidents
    incurred but not yet reported. We use third-party specialists to
    assist management in appropriately measuring the expense
    associated with employment-related benefits.

Revenue Recognition

—Revenue is recognized
    when title and risk of loss are transferred to customers upon
    delivery based on terms of sale and collectibility is reasonably
    assured. Revenue is recognized as the net amount to be received
    after deducting estimated amounts for discounts, trade
    allowances, and returns of damaged and out-of-date products.
    Changes in the market value of inventories of merchandisable
    agricultural commodities, forward cash purchase and sales
    contracts, and exchange-traded futures and options contracts are
    recognized in earnings immediately.

Shipping and Handling

—Amounts billed to
    customers related to shipping and handling are included in net
    sales. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods
    sold.

Marketing Costs

—We promote our products with
    advertising, consumer incentives, and trade promotions. Such
    programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons,
    rebates, and volume-based incentives. Advertising costs are
    expensed as incurred. Consumer incentives and trade promotion
    activities are recorded as a reduction of revenue or as a
    component of cost of goods sold based on amounts estimated as
    being due to customers and consumers at the end of the period,
    based principally on historical utilization and redemption
    rates. Advertising and promotion expenses totaled
    $398.5 million, $393.1 million, and
    $451.1 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Research and Development

—We incurred expenses
    of $80.6 million, $68.9 million, and
    $68.3 million for research and development activities in
    fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Comprehensive Income

—

Comprehensive
    income includes net income, currency translation adjustments,
    certain derivative-related activity, changes in the value of
    available-for-sale investments, and changes in prior service
    cost and net actuarial gains/losses from pension and
    postretirement health care plans. We generally deem our foreign
    investments to be essentially permanent in nature and we do not
    provide for taxes on currency translation adjustments arising
    from converting the investment in a foreign currency to
    U.S. dollars. When we determine that a foreign investment
    is no longer permanent in nature, estimated taxes are provided
    for the related deferred taxes, if any, resulting from currency
    translation adjustments. We reclassified $2.0 million of
    foreign currency translation net losses and $21.7 million
    of foreign currency translation net gains to net income due to
    the disposal or substantial liquidation of foreign subsidiaries
    and equity method investments in fiscal 2009 and 2007,
    respectively.

Foreign Currency Transaction Gains and
    Losses

—We recognized net foreign currency
    transaction gains (losses) of $0.6 million,
    ($8.4) million, and $2.0 million in fiscal 2009, 2008,
    and 2007, respectively, in selling, general, and administrative
    expenses.

Use of Estimates

—Preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
    principles requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect reported
    amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses as
    reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Actual
    results could differ from these estimates.

Reclassifications—

Certain prior year amounts
    have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

Accounting Changes

—We adopted Emerging Issues
    Task Force (“EITF”)

06-4,

Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement
    Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance
    Contracts

, as of the beginning of fiscal 2009.

EITF 06-4

requires an employer to recognize a liability for future
    benefits provided to employees under a split-dollar life
    insurance arrangement. As a result of the implementation of

EITF 06-4,

we recognized a $6.2 million liability for such future
    benefits with a corresponding adjustment, net of tax, of
    $3.9 million to retained earnings.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

, which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of
    SFAS No. 157 were effective as of the beginning of our
    fiscal 2009 for our financial assets and liabilities, as well as
    for other assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value
    on a recurring basis in our consolidated financial statements.
    The FASB has provided for a one-year deferral of the
    implementation of this standard for other nonfinanical assets
    and liabilities. Assets and liabilities subject to this deferral
    include goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets
    measured at fair value for impairment assessments, and
    nonfinancial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair
    value in a business combination. The adoption of
    SFAS No. 157 did not have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial position or results of operations. The
    additional disclosures required by this statement are included
    in Note 20.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities—An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133

.
    This standard requires enhanced disclosures about how and why an
    entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments
    and related hedged items are accounted for under
    SFAS No. 133 and its related interpretations, and how
    derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an
    entity’s financial position, financial performance, and
    cash flows. The provisions of this statement were effective for
    our third quarter of fiscal 2009. The adoption of
    SFAS No. 161 had no impact on our consolidated
    financial position or results of operations. The additional
    disclosures required by this statement are included in
    Note 18.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    (“FSP”)

FAS 140-4

and FIN 46(R)-8,

Disclosures by Public Entities
    (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests
    in Variable Interest Entities

. This FSP requires public
    companies to provide additional disclosures about transfers of
    financial assets and to provide additional disclosures about
    their involvement with variable interest entities. The
    provisions of this FSP were effective for our third quarter of
    fiscal 2009. The additional disclosures required by this
    statement are included in Note 5.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

—In
    June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167,

Amendments
    to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)

. This statement amends
    FIN 46(R) to require an enterprise to perform an analysis
    to determine whether the enterprise’s variable interest or
    interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable
    interest entity. This analysis identifies the primary
    beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that
    has both of the following characteristics: the power to direct
    the activities of a variable interest entity that most
    significantly impact the entity’s economic performance, and
    the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could

potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or
    the right to receive benefits from the entity that could
    potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. The
    provisions of this statement are effective as of the beginning
    of our fiscal 2011. Earlier application is prohibited. We are
    currently evaluating the impact of adopting
    SFAS No. 167.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an Amendment of ARB No. 51

. This statement
    amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards
    for the noncontrolling interest (minority interest) in a
    subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Upon its
    adoption, effective as of the beginning of our fiscal 2010,
    noncontrolling interests will be classified as equity in our
    financial statements and income and comprehensive income
    attributed to the noncontrolling interest will be included in
    our income and comprehensive income. The provisions of this
    standard must be applied prospectively, except for the
    presentation and disclosure requirements. The presentation and
    disclosure requirements of this standard must be applied
    retrospectively upon adoption. We are currently evaluating the
    impact of adopting SFAS No. 160 on our consolidated
    financial position and results of operations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

(“SFAS No. 141(R)”).
    SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and
    requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination
    recognizes and measures the assets acquired, liabilities
    assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. The
    provisions of SFAS No. 141(R) are effective for our
    business combinations occurring on or after June 1, 2009.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP

EITF 03-6-1,

Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions are Participating Securities

. FSP

EITF 03-6-1

requires that unvested share-based payment awards that contain
    nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are
    participating securities and must be included in the computation
    of earnings per share under the two-class method. FSP

EITF 03-6-1

is effective as of the beginning of our fiscal 2010. We do not
    expect the adoption of this FSP to have a material impact on our
    financial statements.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS AND DIVESTITURES

Fernando’s

Operations

In June 2009, subsequent to our fiscal 2009 year end, we
    completed the divestiture of the

Fernando’s

®

foodservice brand for proceeds of approximately
    $6.4 million. Based on our estimate of proceeds from the
    sale of this business, we recognized impairment charges totaling
    $8.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. We
    reflected the results of these operations as discontinued
    operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities
    of the divested

Fernando’s

business have been reclassified as assets and liabilities held
    for sale within our consolidated balance sheets for all periods
    presented.

Trading
    and Merchandising Operations

On March 27, 2008, we entered into an agreement with
    affiliates of Ospraie Special Opportunities Fund to sell our
    commodity trading and merchandising operations conducted by
    ConAgra Trade Group (previously principally reported as the
    Trading and Merchandising segment). The operations included the
    domestic and international grain merchandising, fertilizer
    distribution, agricultural and energy commodities trading and
    services, and grain, animal, and oil seed byproducts
    merchandising and distribution business. In June 2008, the sale
    of the trading and merchandising operations was completed for
    before-tax proceeds of: 1) approximately $2.2 billion
    in cash, net of transaction costs (including incentive
    compensation amounts due to employees due to accelerated
    vesting), 2) $550 million (face value) of

payment-in-kind

debt securities issued by the purchaser (the “Notes”)
    which were recorded at an initial estimated fair value of
    $479 million, 3) a short-term receivable of
    $37 million due from the purchaser, and 4) a four-year

company of the divested operations, which has been recorded at
    an estimated fair value of $1.8 million. We recognized an
    after-tax gain on the disposition of approximately
    $301 million in fiscal 2009.

During fiscal 2009, we collected the $37 million short-term
    receivable due from the purchaser. See Note 4 for further
    discussion on the Notes.

We reflected the results of the divested trading and
    merchandising operations as discontinued operations for all
    periods presented. The assets and liabilities of the divested
    trading and merchandising operations have been reclassified as
    assets and liabilities held for sale within our consolidated
    balance sheets for all periods prior to the divestiture.

Operations

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we completed the
    divestiture of the

Knott’s Berry
    Farm

(“Knott’s”) jams and jellies brand and operations
    for proceeds of approximately $55 million, resulting in no
    significant gain or loss. We reflected the results of these
    operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Packaged
    Meats Operations

During the first half of fiscal 2007, we completed our
    divestiture of the packaged meats operations for proceeds of
    approximately $553 million, resulting in no significant
    gain or loss. Based upon our estimate of proceeds from the sale
    of this business, we recognized impairment charges totaling
    $240.4 million ($209.3 million after tax) in the
    second half of fiscal 2006, and based on the final negotiations
    of this transaction, we recognized an additional impairment
    charge of approximately $19.7 million ($12.1 million
    after tax) in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We reflected the
    results of these operations as discontinued operations.

As a result of completing the divestiture of the packaged meats
    operations, we recognized a pre-tax curtailment gain related to
    postretirement benefits totaling approximately $9.4 million
    during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 (see Note 19 for
    further information). This amount has been included within
    results of discontinued operations.

During fiscal 2007, we decided to discontinue the production of
    certain branded deli meat products concurrent with the
    disposition of the packaged meats business, discussed above.
    Accordingly, the results of operations associated with this
    branded deli meats business are reflected as discontinued
    operations.

Packaged
    Cheese Operations

During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we completed the
    divestiture of the packaged cheese business for proceeds of
    approximately $97.6 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of
    approximately $57.8 million ($32.0 million after tax).
    We reflected the results of these operations as discontinued
    operations.

    Business

During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we completed our
    divestiture of a nutritional supplement business for proceeds of
    approximately $8.2 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of
    approximately $6.2 million ($3.5 million after tax).
    We reflected this gain within discontinued operations.

ACQUISITIONS

On July 23, 2007, we acquired Alexia Foods, Inc.
    (“Alexia Foods”), a privately held natural food
    company headquartered in Long Island City, New York, for
    approximately $50 million in cash plus assumed liabilities.
    Alexia Foods, which is included in our Frozen Foods subsegment
    of the Consumer Foods segment, offers premium natural and
    organic food items including potato products, appetizers, and
    artisan breads. Approximately, $34 million of the purchase
    price was allocated to goodwill and $19 million to brands,
    trademarks and other intangible assets.

On September 5, 2007, we acquired Lincoln Snacks Holding
    Company, Inc. (“Lincoln Snacks”), a privately held
    company located in Lincoln, Nebraska, for approximately
    $50 million in cash plus assumed liabilities. Lincoln
    Snacks, which is included in the Snacks and Store Brands
    subsegment of the Consumer Foods segment, offers a variety of
    snack food brands and private label products. Approximately
    $20 million of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill
    and $17 million to brands, trademarks and other intangible
    assets.

On October 21, 2007, we acquired manufacturing assets of
    Twin City Foods, Inc., a potato processing business, for
    approximately $23 million in cash. These operations are
    included in the Commercial Foods segment.

On February 25, 2008, we acquired Watts Brothers, a
    privately held group which has farming, processing, and
    warehousing operations for approximately $132 million in
    cash plus assumed liabilities of approximately
    $101 million. Approximately $20 million of the
    purchase price was allocated to goodwill. The Watts Brothers
    operations are included in the Commercial Foods segment.

On September 22, 2008, we acquired a 49.99% interest in
    Lamb Weston BSW, LLC (“Lamb Weston BSW” or the
    “venture”), a potato processing joint venture with
    Ochoa Ag Unlimited Foods, Inc. (“Ochoa”), for
    approximately $46 million in cash. Lamb Weston BSW
    subsequently distributed $20.0 million of our initial
    investment to us. This venture is considered a variable interest
    entity and is consolidated in our financial statements (see
    Note 5). Approximately $19 million of the purchase
    price was allocated to goodwill and approximately
    $11 million was allocated to brands, trademarks and other
    intangibles. This business is included in the Commercial Foods
    segment.

On August 1, 2008, we acquired Saroni Sugar &
    Rice, Inc., a distribution company included in the Commercial
    Foods segment, for approximately $9 million in cash plus
    assumed liabilities. Approximately $5 million of the
    purchase price was allocated to brands, trademarks and other
    intangibles.

During fiscal 2009, we completed other individually immaterial
    acquisitions of businesses and other identifiable intangible
    assets for approximately $13 million plus assumed
    liabilities.

Under the purchase method of accounting, the assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed in these acquisitions were recorded at their
    respective estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The
    fair values of the assets and liabilities related to certain
    fiscal 2009 acquisitions are subject to refinement as we
    complete our analyses relative to the fair values at the
    respective acquisition dates.

The pro forma effect of the acquisitions mentioned above was not
    material.

PAYMENT-IN-KIND

NOTES RECEIVABLE

In connection with the divestiture of the trading and
    merchandising operations, we received $550 million (face

The Notes were issued in three tranches: $99,990,000 principal
    amount of 10.5% notes due June 19, 2010; $200,035,000
    principal amount of 10.75% notes due June 19, 2011;
    and $249,975,000 principal amount of 11.0% notes due
    June 19, 2012.

The Notes permit payment of interest in cash or additional
    notes. The Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part prior to
    maturity at the option of the issuer. Redemption is at par plus
    accrued interest. The Notes contain covenants that, among other
    things, govern the issuer’s ability to make restricted
    payments and enter into certain affiliate transactions. The
    Notes also provide for the making of mandatory offers to
    repurchase upon certain change of control events involving the
    purchaser, their co-investors, or their affiliates. In the third
    quarter of fiscal 2009, we received a cash interest payment on
    the Notes of $30 million from the purchaser. The Notes,
    which are classified as other assets, had a carrying value of
    $522 million at May 31, 2009.

Based on market interest rates of comparable instruments
    provided by investment bankers, we estimated the fair market
    value of the Notes was $526 million at May 31, 2009.

VARIABLE
    INTEREST ENTITIES

In September 2008, we entered into a potato processing venture,
    Lamb Weston BSW. We provide all sales and marketing services to
    the venture. Commencing on June 1, 2018, or on an earlier
    date under certain circumstances, we have a contractual right to
    purchase the remaining equity interest in Lamb Weston BSW from
    Ochoa (the “call option”). Commencing on July 30,
    2011, or on an earlier date under certain circumstances, we are
    subject to a contractual obligation to purchase all of
    Ochoa’s equity investment in Lamb Weston BSW at the option
    of Ochoa (the “put option”). The purchase prices under
    the call option and the put option (the “options”) are
    based on the book value of Ochoa’s equity interest at the
    date of exercise, as modified by an

agreed-upon

rate of return for the holding period of the investment balance.
    The

agreed-upon

rate of return varies depending on the circumstances under which
    any of the options are exercised. We have determined that the
    venture is a variable interest entity and that we are the
    primary beneficiary of the entity. Accordingly, we consolidate
    the financial statements of the venture. Our variable interests
    in this entity include an equity investment in the entity and
    the options. Other than our equity investment in the entity and
    our sales and marketing services on behalf of the entity, we
    have not provided financial support to this entity. Our maximum
    exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with this entity
    is equal to our equity investment in the entity.

We also consolidate the assets and liabilities of several
    entities from which we lease corporate aircraft. Each of these
    entities has been determined to be a variable interest entity
    and we have been determined to be the primary beneficiary of
    each of these entities. Under the terms of the aircraft leases,
    we provide guarantees to the owners of these entities of a
    minimum residual value of the aircraft at the end of the lease
    term. We also have fixed price purchase options on the aircraft
    leased from these entities. Our maximum exposure to loss from
    our involvement with these entities is limited to the difference
    between the fair value of the leased aircraft and the amount of
    the residual value guarantees at the time we terminate the
    leases. The total amount of the residual value guarantees for
    these aircraft at the end of the respective lease terms is
    $38.4 million.

    2009, 2008, and 2007, we recognized amortization expense of
    $6.6 million, $2.6 million, and $2.3 million,
    respectively. Based on amortizing assets recognized in our
    balance sheet as of May 31, 2009, amortization expense is
    estimated to be approximately $5.6 million for each of the
    next five years.

In connection with the acquisitions of Alexia Foods, Lincoln
    Snacks, and Watts Brothers in fiscal 2008, we acquired
    approximately $73 million of non-deductible goodwill (of
    which $53 million and $20 million (including
    $3 million which was reclassified in fiscal 2009 upon
    finalization of the purchase price allocation) are presented in
    the Consumer Foods segment and Commercial Foods segment,
    respectively) and approximately $36 million of intangible
    assets (all of which is presented in the Consumer Foods segment).

In connection with the acquisition of Lamb Weston BSW, we
    acquired approximately $19 million of non-deductible
    goodwill and approximately $11 million of intangible assets
    (all of which is presented in the Commercial Foods segment).

In May 2008, we entered into a licensing and capabilities
    agreement with The Procter & Gamble Company that
    provides access to unique nutrition-enhancing food ingredients
    and packaging capabilities related to sustainability, ergonomics
    and design, as well as access to research associated with those
    technologies. At May 31, 2009, an amortizable intangible
    asset of $14 million related to this agreement was
    reflected in brands, trademarks and other intangible assets.

    stock options outstanding, respectively, that were excluded from
    the computation of shares contingently issuable upon exercise of
    the stock options because exercise prices exceeded the annual
    average market value of our common stock.

The decline in the diluted weighted average shares outstanding
    in fiscal 2009 resulted principally from our repurchase of
    44.0 million shares during fiscal 2009 under an accelerated
    share repurchase plan.

RESTRUCTURING
    ACTIVITIES

2006-2008
    Restructuring Plan

In February 2006, our board of directors approved a plan
    recommended by executive management to simplify our operating
    structure and reduce our manufacturing and selling, general, and
    administrative costs

(“2006-2008

plan”). The plan included supply chain rationalization
    initiatives, the relocation of a divisional headquarters from
    Irvine, California to Naperville, Illinois, the centralization
    of shared services, salaried headcount reductions, and other
    cost-reduction initiatives. The plan was completed during fiscal
    2009. The total cost of the plan was $232.5 million, of
    which $1.3 million of expense was recorded in fiscal 2009,
    a benefit of $1.6 million was recorded in fiscal 2008,
    $103.0 million of expense was recorded in fiscal 2007, and
    $129.6 million of expense was recorded in the second half
    of fiscal 2006. We have recorded expenses associated with this
    restructuring plan, including but not limited to, asset
    impairment charges, accelerated depreciation (i.e., incremental
    depreciation due to an asset’s reduced estimated useful
    life), inventory write-downs, severance and related costs, and
    plan implementation costs (e.g., consulting, employee
    relocation, etc.). At May 31, 2009, approximately
    $1.9 million of liabilities related to this plan remained
    outstanding.

Included in the above amounts are $133.5 million of charges
    that have resulted or will result in cash outflows and
    $99.0 million of non-cash charges.

During fiscal 2008, we reassessed certain aspects of our plan to
    rationalize our supply chain. We determined that we would
    continue to operate three production facilities that we had
    previously planned to close. As a result of this determination,
    previously established reserves, primarily for related severance
    costs and pension costs, were reversed in fiscal 2008. We are
    currently evaluating the best use of a new production facility,
    the construction of which is in progress, in connection with our
    restructuring plans. We believe, based on our current assessment
    of likely scenarios, the carrying value of this facility
    ($40.4 million at May 31, 2009) is recoverable.
    In the event we determine that the future use of the new
    facility will not result in recovery of the recorded value of
    the asset, an impairment charge would be required.

2008-2009
    Restructuring Plan

During fiscal 2008, our board of directors approved a plan

(“2008-2009

plan”) recommended by executive management to improve the
    efficiency of our Consumer Foods operations and related
    functional organizations and to streamline our international
    operations to reduce our manufacturing and selling, general, and
    administrative costs. This plan includes the reorganization of
    the Consumer Foods operations, the integration of the
    international headquarters functions into our domestic business,
    and exiting a number of international markets. These plans were
    substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2009. The total
    cost of the

2008-2009

plan was $36.3 million, of which $8.5 million was
    recorded in fiscal 2009 and $27.8 million was recorded in
    fiscal 2008. We have recorded expenses associated with the

2008-2009

plan, including but not limited to, inventory write-downs,
    severance and related costs, and plan implementation costs
    (e.g., consulting, employee relocation, etc.).

CREDIT
    FACILITIES AND BORROWINGS

At May 31, 2009, we had a $1.5 billion multi-year
    revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial
    institutions that matures in December 2011. Borrowings under the
    multi-year facility bear interest at or below prime rate and may
    be prepaid without penalty.

We finance our short-term liquidity needs with bank borrowings,
    commercial paper borrowings, and bankers’ acceptances. The
    average consolidated short-term borrowings outstanding under
    these facilities were $245.5 million and
    $418.5 million for fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively,
    which included borrowings to finance the trading and
    merchandising operations prior to divestiture.

    consolidating these entities do not represent additional claims
    on our general assets. The creditors of these entities have
    claims only on the assets of the specific variable interest
    entities to which they extend credit.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we issued
    $500 million of senior notes maturing in 2014 and
    $500 million of senior notes maturing in 2019.

During fiscal 2009, we retired $357.3 million of
    6.75% senior long-term debt due September 2011,
    $27.6 million of 7.125% senior long-term debt due
    October 2026, $290.8 million of 6.7% senior long-term
    debt due August 2027, $17.9 million of 7% senior
    long-term debt due October 2028, $252.0 million of
    7.875% senior long-term debt due September 2010, and
    $4.1 million of 9.75% senior subordinated long-term
    debt due March 2021, prior to the maturity of the long-term
    debt, resulting in net charges of $49.2 million.

In September 2008, we formed a potato processing venture, Lamb
    Weston BSW, with Ochoa. We have determined that the venture is a
    variable interest entity and that we are the primary beneficiary
    of the entity. Accordingly, we consolidate the financial
    statements of the venture. During the second quarter of fiscal
    2009, Lamb Weston BSW entered into a term loan agreement
    with a bank under which it borrowed $20.0 million of senior
    debt at an annual interest rate of 4.34% due September 2018.
    During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, Lamb Weston BSW
    restructured and repaid this debt and entered into a term loan
    agreement with a bank under which it borrowed $40.0 million
    of variable

(30-day

LIBOR+1.85%) interest rate debt due in June 2018.

Our most restrictive note agreements (the revolving credit
    facility and certain privately placed long-term debt) require
    that our consolidated funded debt not exceed 65% of our
    consolidated capital base, and that our fixed charges coverage
    ratio be greater than 1.75 to 1.0. At May 31, 2009, we were
    in compliance with our debt covenants.

Our net interest expense was reduced by $1.2 million and
    $3.6 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively, due to
    the net impact of previously closed interest rate swap
    agreements.

As part of the Watts Brothers purchase in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2008, we assumed $83.8 million of debt, of which we
    immediately repaid $64.3 million after the acquisition.

On December 4, 2003, we announced a share repurchase
    program of up to $1 billion. On September 28, 2006,
    the share repurchase program was increased to $1.5 billion,
    and during the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the Board of
    Directors authorized management to repurchase up to an
    additional $500 million of our common stock. During the
    first quarter of fiscal 2009, we initiated an accelerated share
    repurchase program. This program was finalized in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2009. We paid $900.0 million and received
    44.0 million shares of common stock under this program.
    During fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, we repurchased approximately
    44.0 million shares of common stock at a total cost of
    $900.0 million, 7.5 million shares of common stock at
    a total cost of $188.0 million, and 24.3 million
    shares of common stock at a total cost of $614.8 million,

SHARE-BASED
    PAYMENTS

In accordance with stockholder-approved plans, we issue
    share-based payments under various stock-based compensation
    arrangements, including stock options, restricted stock,
    performance shares, and other share-based awards.

On September 28, 2006, the stockholders approved the
    ConAgra Foods 2006 Stock Plan, which authorizes the issuance of
    up to 30 million shares of ConAgra Foods common stock. At
    May 31, 2009, approximately 12.1 million shares were
    reserved for granting additional options, restricted stock,
    bonus stock awards, or other share-based awards.

Stock
    Option Plan

We have stockholder-approved stock option plans which provide
    for granting of options to employees for the purchase of common
    stock at prices equal to the fair value at the date of grant.

various vesting schedules (typically three to five years) and
    generally expire seven to ten years after the date of grant.

The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant
    using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
    weighted average assumptions for stock options granted:

The expected volatility is based on the historical market

    options granted. The expected life represents the period of time
    that the awards are expected to be outstanding and is based on
    the contractual term of each instrument, taking into account
    employees’ historical exercise and termination behavior.

We recognize compensation expense using the straight-line method
    over the requisite service period. During fiscal 2009, 2008, and
    2007, the Company granted 7.7 million options,
    8.3 million options, and 6.7 million options,
    respectively, with a weighted average grant date value of $2.84,
    $4.23, and $3.92, respectively. The total intrinsic value of
    options exercised was $0.3 million, $4.8 million, and
    $7.6 million for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.
    The closing market price of our common stock on the last trading
    day of fiscal 2009 was $18.59 per share.

Compensation expense for our stock option awards totaled
    $23.8 million, $26.7 million, and $21.4 million
    for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The tax benefit
    related to the stock option expense for fiscal 2009, 2008, and
    2007, respectively, was $9.1 million, $9.7 million,
    and $7.7 million, respectively.

At May 31, 2009, we had $21.2 million of total
    unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures,
    related to stock options that will be recognized over a weighted
    average period of 1.3 years.

Cash received from option exercises for the fiscal years ended
    May 31, 2009, May 25, 2008, and May 27, 2007 was

Share
    Unit Plans

In accordance with stockholder-approved plans, we issue stock
    under various stock-based compensation arrangements, including
    restricted stock, restricted share equivalents, and other
    share-based awards (“share units”). These awards
    generally have requisite service periods of three to five years.
    Under each arrangement, stock is issued without direct cost to
    the employee. We estimate the fair value of the share units
    based upon the market price of our stock at the date of grant.
    Certain share unit grants do not provide for the payment of
    dividend equivalents to the participant during the requisite
    service period (vesting period). For those grants, the value of
    the grants is reduced by the net present value of the foregone
    dividend equivalent payments. We recognize compensation expense
    for share unit awards on a straight-line basis over the
    requisite service period. The compensation expense for our share
    unit awards totaled $17.8 million, $16.7 million, and
    $10.4 million for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007,
    respectively. The tax benefit related to the compensation
    expense for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $6.8 million,
    $6.1 million, and $3.8 million, respectively.

    value of $21.00, $25.28, and $22.75, respectively.

The total intrinsic value of share units vested during fiscal

Performance
    Based Share Plan

Under our 2006 Performance Share Plan, adopted pursuant to
    stockholder-approved incentive plans, we granted selected
    executives and other key employees performance share awards with
    vesting contingent upon meeting various Company-wide performance
    goals. We granted awards for a fiscal 2007 to 2009 performance
    period and a fiscal 2008 to 2010 performance period, which were
    based upon our earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and
    return on average invested capital (ROAIC) measured over the
    fiscal 2007 to 2009 performance period and the fiscal 2008 to
    2010 performance period, respectively. The awards actually
    earned may range from zero to three hundred percent of the
    targeted number of performance shares and are paid in shares of
    common stock. Based on the attainment of various interim
    Company-wide performance goals, we issued one-third of the
    targeted performance shares granted for the fiscal 2007 to 2009
    performance period in both July 2007 and July 2008 to those
    participants who were eligible for an interim payout and issued
    one-third of the targeted number of performance

shares and the additional shares related to the above target
    payout in July 2009 to those participants who were eligible for
    the final payout. Because the payouts did not occur until after
    the fiscal year end, amounts in the table below reflect
    outstanding awards under the fiscal 2007 to 2009 performance
    period. The fiscal 2008 to 2010 program does not contain an
    interim payout feature. Subject to limited exceptions set forth
    in the plan, any shares earned under the fiscal 2008 to 2010
    performance period will be distributed at the end of fiscal 2010.

Under our 2008 Performance Share Plan, adopted pursuant to
    stockholder-approved incentive plans, we granted selected
    executives and other key employees performance share awards with
    vesting contingent upon meeting various Company-wide performance
    goals for fiscal 2009 to 2011 performance period. The
    performance goals for the fiscal 2009 to 2011 performance period
    are based upon our earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and
    our return on average invested capital (ROAIC) measured over the
    fiscal 2009 to 2011 performance period. The awards actually
    earned will range from zero to three hundred percent of the
    targeted number of performance shares and will be paid in shares
    of common stock. Subject to limited exceptions set forth in the
    plan, any shares earned will be distributed at the end of the
    three-year period.

The fair value of each grant was estimated based upon our stock
    price on the date of grant. With respect to the fiscal 2008 to
    2010 and fiscal 2009 to 2011 performance periods, management
    must evaluate, on a quarterly basis, the probability that the
    target performance goals will be met and the anticipated level
    of attainment in order to determine the amount of compensation
    cost to recognize in the financial statements. If such defined
    performance goals are not met, no compensation cost will be
    recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost will
    be reversed. As the awards under the 2008 performance share plan
    contained both a service condition and performance conditions in
    order to vest and a certain portion of the award (tranche)
    vested each fiscal year within the performance period, we
    recognized compensation expense for these awards over the
    requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche.
    Awards for the fiscal 2008 to 2010 performance period are
    recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
    period. Awards for the fiscal 2009 to 2011 performance period
    are adjusted based upon the market price of our stock at the end
    of each reporting period and amortized over the vesting period.

    $5.8 million for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively,
    while the tax benefit/(expense) related to the compensation
    expense for the same periods was $(0.4) million,
    $0.4 million, and $2.1 million, respectively. The
    total payments for share-based liabilities during fiscal 2009,
    2008, and 2007 were $8.9 million, $11.5 million, and
    $4.1 million, respectively.

SFAS No. 123R requires the benefits of tax deductions
    in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a
    financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow. This
    requirement has reduced (increased) net operating cash flows and
    increased (decreased) net financing cash flows by approximately
    ($0.7) million, $1.8 million, and $2.8 million
    for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

At May 31, 2009 and May 25, 2008, net deferred tax
    assets of $112.1 million and $146.3 million,
    respectively, are included in prepaid expenses and other current
    assets. At May 31, 2009 and May 25, 2008, net deferred
    tax liabilities of $503.4 million and $600.5 million,
    respectively, are included in other noncurrent liabilities.

Effective May 28, 2007, we adopted the provisions of
    FIN 48. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48,
    we recognized a $1.2 million decrease in the liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits, with a corresponding adjustment to
    retained earnings.

The liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at
    May 31, 2009 was $74.6 million, excluding a related
    liability of $14.5 million for gross interest and
    penalties. Included in the balance at May 31, 2009 are
    $2.5 million of tax positions for which the ultimate
    deductibility is highly certain but for which there is
    uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of
    the impact of deferred tax accounting, the disallowance of the
    shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual
    effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to
    the taxing authority to an earlier period. Any associated
    interest and penalties imposed would affect the tax rate. As of
    May 25, 2008, our gross liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits was $75.8 million, excluding a related liability
    of $21.8 million for gross interest and penalties.

The net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at May 31, 2009
    and May 25, 2008 that, if recognized, would impact our
    effective tax rate was $51.0 million and
    $46.2 million, respectively. Recognition of these tax
    benefits would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate.

We accrue interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax
    positions as part of income tax expense.

We conduct business and file tax returns in numerous countries,
    states, and local jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue
    Service (“IRS”) has completed its audit for tax years
    through fiscal 2006 and all resulting significant items for
    fiscal 2006 and prior years have been settled with the IRS.
    Other major jurisdictions where we conduct business generally
    have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to 5 years.

We estimate that it is reasonably possible that the amount of
    gross unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by
    $10 million to $15 million over the next twelve months
    due to various federal, state, and foreign audit settlements and
    the expiration of statutes of limitations.

We have approximately $61.6 million of foreign net
    operating loss carryforwards ($14.0 million expire between
    fiscal 2010 and 2020 and $47.6 million have no expiration
    dates).

Substantially all of our foreign tax credits will expire between
    fiscal 2013 and 2018. State tax credits of approximately
    $12.4 million expire in various years ranging from fiscal
    2013 to 2016.

We have recorded a valuation allowance for the portion of the
    net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, and
    other deferred tax assets for which we believe the likelihood of
    realization is not more likely than not. The net impact on
    income tax expense related to changes in the valuation allowance
    for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007 were charges of
    $3.8 million, $1.6 million, and $0.4 million,
    respectively. The current year change principally relates to
    increases to the valuation allowances for foreign net operating
    losses and foreign capital losses, offset by decreases related
    to foreign tax credits and state net operating losses.

We have not provided U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative
    earnings of

non-U.S. affiliates

and associated companies that have been reinvested indefinitely.
    Deferred taxes are provided for earnings of

non-U.S. affiliates

and associated companies when we determine that such earnings

CONTINGENCIES

In fiscal 1991, we acquired Beatrice Company
    (“Beatrice”). As a result of the acquisition and the
    significant pre-acquisition contingencies of the Beatrice
    businesses and its former subsidiaries, our consolidated
    post-acquisition financial statements reflect liabilities
    associated with the estimated resolution of these contingencies.
    These include various litigation and environmental proceedings
    related to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to its
    acquisition by the Company. The litigation includes several
    public nuisance and personal injury suits against a number of
    lead paint and pigment manufacturers, including ConAgra Grocery
    Products and the Company as alleged successors to W. P. Fuller
    Co., a lead paint and pigment manufacturer owned and operated by
    Beatrice until 1967. Although decisions favorable to us have
    been rendered in Rhode Island, New Jersey, Wisconsin, and Ohio,
    we remain a defendant in active suits in Illinois and
    California. The Illinois suit seeks

class-wide

relief in the form of medical monitoring for elevated levels of
    lead in blood. In California, a number of cities and counties
    have joined in a consolidated action seeking abatement of the
    alleged public nuisance.

The environmental proceedings include litigation and
    administrative proceedings involving Beatrice’s status as a
    potentially responsible party at 35 Superfund, proposed
    Superfund, or state-equivalent sites; these sites involve
    locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of
    Beatrice that used or produced petroleum, pesticides,
    fertilizers, dyes, inks, solvents, PCBs, acids, lead, sulfur,
    tannery wastes,

and/or

other
    contaminants. Beatrice has paid or is in the process of paying
    its liability share at 33 of these sites. Reserves for these
    matters have been established based on our best estimate of the
    undiscounted remediation liabilities, which estimates include
    evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required cleanup,
    the known volumetric contribution of Beatrice and other
    potentially responsible parties, and its experience in
    remediating sites. The reserves for Beatrice environmental
    matters totaled $88.8 million as of May 31, 2009, a
    majority of which relates to the Superfund and state-equivalent
    sites referenced above. Expenditures for Beatrice environmental
    matters are expected to continue for a period of up to
    20 years.

In limited situations, we will guarantee an obligation of an
    unconsolidated entity. At the time in which we initially provide
    such a guarantee, we assess the risk of financial exposure to us
    under these agreements. We consider the credit-worthiness of the
    guaranteed party, the value of any collateral pledged against
    the related obligation, and any other factors that may mitigate
    our risk (e.g., letters of credit from a financial institution).
    We periodically monitor market and entity-specific conditions
    which may result in a change of our assessment of its risk of
    loss under these agreements.

We have outstanding guarantees of certain railcar leases of the
    divested trading and merchandising business (now operating as
    the Gavilon Group, LLC, “Gavilon”); the railcar leases
    were in place prior to the divestiture and the parties are
    working with the lessors to secure our release. The remaining
    terms of these lease agreements do not exceed two years and the
    maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was
    $3.4 million as of

May 31, 2009. We have not established a liability for
    these guarantees as we have determined that the likelihood of
    our required performance under the guarantees is remote.

We guarantee certain leases and other commercial obligations
    resulting from our fresh beef and pork divestiture. The
    remaining terms of these arrangements do not exceed seven years
    and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was
    approximately $18.5 million as of May 31, 2009.

We have also guaranteed the performance of the divested fresh
    beef and pork business with respect to a hog purchase contract.
    The hog purchase contract requires the fresh beef and pork
    business to purchase a minimum of approximately 1.2 million
    hogs annually through 2014. The contract stipulates minimum
    price commitments, based in part on market prices, and, in
    certain circumstances, also includes price adjustments based on
    certain inputs. We have not established a liability for any of
    the fresh beef and pork divestiture-related guarantees, as we
    have determined that the likelihood of our required performance
    under the guarantees is remote.

We are a party to various potato supply agreements. Under the
    terms of certain such potato supply agreements, we have
    guaranteed repayment of short-term bank loans of the potato
    suppliers, under certain conditions. At May 31, 2009, the
    amount of supplier loans we have effectively guaranteed was
    approximately $39.6 million. We have not established a
    liability for these guarantees, as we have determined that the
    likelihood of our required performance under the guarantees is
    remote.

We are a party to a supply agreement with an onion processing
    company. We have guaranteed repayment of a loan of this
    supplier, under certain conditions. At May 31, 2009, the
    amount of this loan was $25.0 million. In the event of
    default on this loan by the supplier, we have the contractual
    right to purchase the loan from the lender, thereby giving us
    the rights to the underlying collateral. We have not established
    a liability in connection with this guarantee, as we believe the
    likelihood of financial exposure to us under this agreement is
    remote.

We are a party to a number of lawsuits and claims arising out of
    the operation of our business, including lawsuits and claims
    related to the February 2007 recall of our peanut butter
    products and litigation we initiated against an insurance
    carrier to recover our settlement expenditures and defense
    costs. We recognized a charge of $25.3 million during the
    second half of fiscal 2009 in connection with the disputed
    coverage with this insurance carrier.

An investigation by the Division of Enforcement of the
    U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
    (“CFTC”) of certain commodity futures transactions of
    a former Company subsidiary, has led to an investigation by the
    CFTC of the Company itself. The investigation may result in
    litigation by the CFTC against the Company. The former
    subsidiary was sold on June 23, 2008, as part of the
    divestiture of our trading and merchandising operations. The
    CFTC’s Division of Enforcement has advised the Company that
    it questions whether certain trading activities of the former
    subsidiary violated the Commodity Exchange Act (the
    “CEA”) and that the CFTC has been evaluating whether
    we should be implicated in the matter based on the existence of
    the parent-subsidiary relationship between the two entities at
    the time of the trades. Based on information we have learned to
    date, the Company believes that both it and the former
    subsidiary have meritorious defenses. We have submitted a
    statement to the Division of Enforcement contesting any
    purported liability. We also believe the sale contract with the
    buyer of the business provides us indemnification rights.
    Accordingly, we do not believe any decision by the CFTC to
    pursue this matter will have a material adverse effect on the
    Company. If litigation ensues, the Company intends to defend
    itself vigorously.

Subsequent to fiscal 2009 year-end, an accidental explosion
    occurred at our manufacturing facility in Garner, North
    Carolina. See Note 24 for information related to this
    matter.

After taking into account liabilities recognized for all of the
    foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution
    of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition, results of

    change in one of the estimates of the foregoing matters may
    occur in the future. Costs of legal services are recognized in

DERIVATIVE
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Our operations are exposed to market risks from adverse changes
    in commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials and
    energy, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. In
    the normal course of business, these risks are managed through a
    variety of strategies, including the use of derivatives.

Commodity futures and options contracts are used from time to
    time to economically hedge commodity input prices on items such
    as natural gas, vegetable oils, proteins, dairy, grains, and
    electricity. Generally, we economically hedge a portion of our
    anticipated consumption of commodity inputs for periods of up to
    36 months. We may enter into longer-term economic hedges on
    particular commodities if deemed appropriate. As of May 31,
    2009, we had economically hedged certain portions of our
    anticipated consumption of commodity inputs using derivative
    instruments with expiration dates through July 2010.

In order to reduce risk related to changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates, when deemed prudent, we enter into forward
    exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a
    currency other than the applicable functional currency. This
    includes, but is not limited to, hedging against foreign
    currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment,
    sales of finished goods, and future settlement of
    foreign-denominated assets and liabilities. As of May 31,
    2009, we had economically hedged certain portions of our foreign
    currency risk of anticipated transactions using derivative
    instruments with expiration dates through November 2009.

Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges

From time to time, we may use derivative instruments, including
    interest rate swaps, to reduce risk related to changes in
    interest rates. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we
    entered into an interest rate swap to hedge the interest rate
    risk related to our then-anticipated long term debt refinancing.
    We designated this interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of
    the forecasted interest payments related to this debt
    refinancing. The loss associated with this swap, which is
    deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss at May 31,
    2009 is $0.7 million. This loss is being amortized over the
    life of the related debt. No other interest rate swap agreements
    were outstanding during the periods presented.

In prior periods, we designated certain commodity-based and
    foreign currency derivatives as cash flow hedges qualifying for
    hedge accounting treatment. We discontinued designating such
    derivatives as cash flow hedges during the first quarter of
    fiscal 2008.

Gains and losses associated with designated commodity cash flow
    hedges were deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income
    until the underlying hedged item impacted earnings. At that
    time, we reclassified net gains and losses from cash flow hedges
    into the same line item of the consolidated statement of
    earnings as where the effects of the hedged item were recorded,
    typically cost of goods sold.

Hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow hedges may impact net
    earnings when a change in the value of a hedge does not offset
    the change in the value of the underlying hedged item. The
    ineffectiveness associated with derivatives designated as cash
    flow hedges from continuing operations was a loss of
    $1.1 million and a loss of $3.3 million for fiscal
    2008 and 2007, respectively. Depending on the nature of the
    hedge, ineffectiveness is recognized within cost of goods sold
    or selling, general and administrative expense. We do not
    exclude any component of the hedging instrument’s gain or
    loss when assessing ineffectiveness.

Economic Hedges of Forecasted Cash Flows

Many of our derivatives do not qualify for, and, as noted above,
    we are not currently designating any commodity or foreign
    currency derivatives to achieve hedge accounting treatment.
    Beginning in the first quarter of

fiscal 2009, we began to reflect realized and unrealized gains
    and losses from derivatives used to hedge anticipated commodity
    consumption and to mitigate foreign currency cash flow risk in
    earnings immediately within general corporate expense (within
    cost of goods sold). The gains and losses are reclassified to
    segment operating results in the period in which the underlying
    item being hedged is recognized in cost of goods sold. Prior to
    the first quarter of fiscal 2009, these derivative gains and
    losses were recorded immediately in our segment results as a
    component of cost of goods sold or selling, general and
    administrative expenses, regardless of when the item being
    hedged impacted earnings.

Other Derivative Activity (Primarily in the Milling
    Operations)

We also use derivative instruments within our milling
    operations, which are part of the Commercial Foods segment.
    Derivative instruments used to economically hedge commodity
    inventories and forward purchase and sales contracts are
    marked-to-market such that realized and unrealized gains and
    losses are immediately included in operating results. The
    underlying inventory and forward contracts being hedged are also
    marked-to-market with changes in market value recognized
    immediately in operating results.

For commodity derivative trading activities within our milling
    operations that are not intended to mitigate commodity input
    cost risk, the derivative instrument is marked-to-market each
    period with gains and losses included in net sales of the
    Commercial Foods segment. In fiscal 2009, there were no material
    gains or losses from derivative trading activities. In fiscal
    2008, net derivative gains from trading activities of
    $23.3 million, were included in the results of operations
    for the Commercial Foods segment.

All derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet
    at fair value. The fair value of derivative assets is recognized
    within prepaid expenses and other current assets and current
    assets held for sale, while the fair value of derivative
    liabilities is recognized within other accrued liabilities and
    current liabilities held for sale. In accordance with FASB
    Interpretation Number (FIN) 39,

PENSION
    AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company and its subsidiaries have defined benefit retirement
    plans (“plans”) for eligible salaried and hourly
    employees. Benefits are based on years of credited service and
    average compensation or stated amounts for each year of service.
    We also sponsor postretirement plans which provide certain
    medical and dental benefits (“other benefits”) to
    qualifying U.S. employees.

We historically have used February 28 as our measurement date
    for our plans. Beginning May 28, 2007, we elected to early
    adopt the measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158.
    These provisions require the measurement date for plan assets
    and liabilities to coincide with the sponsor’s fiscal
    year-end. We used the “alternative” method for
    adoption. As a result, we recorded a decrease to retained
    earnings of approximately $11.7 million, net of tax, and an
    increase to accumulated other comprehensive income of
    approximately $1.6 million, net of tax, representing the
    periodic benefit cost for the period from March 1, 2007
    through our fiscal 2007 year-end.

On May 27, 2007, we adopted the recognition and disclosure
    requirements of SFAS No. 158 which requires that we
    recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our plans as
    an asset or liability on our consolidated balance sheet. The
    funded status is the difference between the fair value of plan
    assets and the benefit obligation.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we completed the
    divestiture of the packaged meats operations. As a result,
    during the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we recognized a pre-tax
    curtailment gain relating to postretirement benefits totaling
    approximately $9.4 million. This amount has been recognized
    within results of discontinued operations.

We amortize prior service cost and amortizable gains and losses
    in equal annual amounts over the average expected future period
    of vested service. For plans with no active participants,
    average life expectancy is used instead of average expected
    useful service.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
    assumption for the pension plans, we consider the current asset
    allocation strategy, the historical investment performance, and
    the expectations for future returns of each asset class.

Our pension plan weighted-average asset allocations and our
    target asset allocations at May 31, 2009 and May 25,
    2008, by asset category were as follows:

Our investment strategy reflects the expectation that equity
    securities will outperform debt securities over the long term.
    Assets are invested in a prudent manner to maintain the security
    of funds while maximizing returns within our Investment Policy
    guidelines. The strategy is implemented utilizing indexed and
    actively managed assets from the categories listed.

The investment goals are to provide a total return that, over
    the long term, increases the ratio of plan assets to liabilities
    subject to an acceptable level of risk. This is accomplished
    through diversification of assets in accordance with the
    Investment Policy guidelines. Investment risk is mitigated by
    periodic rebalancing between asset classes as necessitated by
    changes in market conditions within the Investment Policy
    guidelines.

Other investments primarily include private equity funds and
    hedge funds. For certain of the plan assets, we use net asset
    values as our best estimate of fair market value. Certain of the
    funds in which plan assets are invested have contractual terms
    under which our ability to redeem the investment may be
    temporarily restricted by minimum required redemption notices,
    or the imposition of redemption gates.

Our assets for other post-retirement benefits are primarily
    comprised of money-market securities.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect
    on the benefit obligation of the postretirement plans.

FAIR
    VALUE MEASUREMENTS

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements,

which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of
    SFAS No. 157 were effective as of the beginning of our
    fiscal 2009 for our financial assets and liabilities, as well as
    for other assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value
    on a recurring basis in our consolidated financial statements.
    The FASB has provided for a one-year deferral of the
    implementation of this standard for other non financial assets
    and liabilities. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not
    have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or
    results of operations.

SFAS No. 157 establishes a three-level fair value
    hierarchy based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price
    assets or liabilities. The hierarchy requires us to maximize the
    use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
    inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value
    are as follows:

Level 1—Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities,

Level 2—Observable inputs other than those included in
    Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and
    liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical
    assets or liabilities in inactive markets, and

Level 3—Unobservable inputs reflecting our own
    assumptions and best estimate of what inputs market participants
    would use in pricing the asset or liability.

    the transaction.

****

In June 2009, subsequent to our fiscal 2009 year end, we
    completed the divestiture of the

Fernando’s

®

foodservice brand for proceeds of approximately
    $6.4 million. We reflected the results of these operations
    as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets
    and liabilities of the divested

Fernando’s

®

business have been reclassified as assets and liabilities held
    for sale within our consolidated balance sheets for all periods
    presented.

At the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we shifted
    management responsibility of our handheld product operations
    into the Consumer Foods segment from the Commercial Foods
    segment. Accordingly, all prior periods have been
    recharacterized to reflect these changes.

Intersegment sales have been recorded at amounts approximating
    market. Operating profit for each segment is based on net sales
    less all identifiable operating expenses. General corporate
    expense, net interest expense, and income taxes have been
    excluded from segment operations.

General corporate expenses included transition services income
    of $5 million and $14 million for fiscal 2009 and
    2008, respectively, related to services provided to the buyers
    of certain divested businesses. Prior to fiscal 2008, we
    recognized the transition services income in Consumer Foods
    operating profit. Consumer Foods operating profit included

During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we discontinued the
    practice of designating derivatives as cash flow hedges of
    commodity inputs. As such, during fiscal 2008, derivative
    instruments used to create economic hedges of such commodity
    inputs were marked-to-market each period with both realized and
    unrealized changes in market value immediately included in cost
    of goods sold within segment operating profit.

In fiscal 2009, following the sale of our trading and
    merchandising operations and related organizational changes, we
    transferred the management of commodity hedging activities
    (except for those related to our milling operations) to a
    centralized procurement group. Beginning in the first quarter of
    fiscal 2009, we began to reflect realized and unrealized gains
    and losses from derivatives (except for those related to our
    milling operations) used to hedge anticipated commodity
    consumption in earnings immediately within general corporate
    expenses. The gains and losses are reclassified to segment
    operating results in the period in which the underlying item
    being hedged is recognized in cost of goods sold. Prior to the
    first quarter of fiscal 2009, these derivative gains and losses
    were recorded immediately in our segment results as a component
    of cost of goods sold, regardless of when the item being hedged
    impacted earnings. We believe this change results in better
    segment management focus on key operational initiatives and
    improved transparency to derivative gains and losses. We did not
    recharacterize fiscal 2008 segment results in a comparable
    manner, as it was impracticable to retrospectively apply the
    processes which

we began to use in fiscal 2009 to determine the appropriate
    period in which to allocate derivative gains and losses from
    general corporate expenses to segment operating results.

In fiscal 2008, we began to centrally manage foreign currency
    risk for all of our reporting segments. Foreign currency
    derivatives used to manage foreign currency risk are not
    designated for hedge accounting treatment. As such, these
    derivatives are recognized at fair market value with realized
    and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate
    expenses. The gains and losses are subsequently recognized in
    the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in
    which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is
    included in earnings. We believe that these derivatives provide
    economic hedges of the foreign currency risk of certain
    forecasted transactions.

The following table presents the net derivative losses from
    economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and currency
    risk of our foreign operations for fiscal 2009, under this new
    methodology:

Based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the
    underlying hedged items, we expect to reclassify losses of
    $7.8 million and gains of $2.5 million to segment
    operating results in fiscal 2010 and 2011, respectively.

In fiscal 2008, net derivative gains from economic hedges of
    forecasted commodity consumption and currency risk of our
    foreign operations were $62.6 million in the Consumer Foods
    segment and $26.4 million in the Commercial Foods segment.
    In fiscal 2007, net derivative gains from economic hedges of
    forecasted commodity consumption and currency risk of our
    foreign operations were $14.0 million in the Consumer Foods
    segment and $7.6 million in the Commercial Foods segment.

At May 31, 2009, ConAgra Foods and its subsidiaries had
    approximately 25,600 employees, primarily in the United
    States. Approximately 53% of our employees are parties to
    collective bargaining agreements. Of the employees subject to
    collective bargaining agreements, approximately 37% are parties
    to collective bargaining agreements that are scheduled to expire
    during fiscal 2010.

Our operations are principally in the United States. With
    respect to operations outside of the United States, no single
    foreign country or geographic region was significant with
    respect to consolidated operations for fiscal 2009, 2008, and
    2007. Foreign net sales, including sales by domestic segments to
    customers located outside of the United States, were
    approximately $1.3 billion, $1.3 billion, and
    $1.1 billion in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.
    Our long-lived assets located outside of the United States are
    not significant.

Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates,
    accounted for approximately 16%, 15%, and 16% of consolidated
    net sales for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. This
    reflects all Consumer Foods businesses, including those which
    are classified as discontinued operations.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates accounted for
    approximately 15% and 13% of consolidated net receivables for
    fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. This reflects all Consumer
    Foods businesses, including those which are classified as
    discontinued operations.

Firearms and Explosives announced its determination that the
    explosion was the result of an accidental natural gas release,
    and not a deliberate act.

We maintain comprehensive property (including business
    interruption), workers’ compensation, and general liability
    insurance policies with very significant loss limits that we
    believe will provide substantial and broad coverage for the
    currently foreseeable losses arising from this accident. We
    anticipate that we will incur modest costs related to
    deductibles and co-payment obligations under available insurance
    policies, as well as other costs that are not currently expected
    to be material.

Based on management’s current assessment of production
    options, the expected level of insurance proceeds, and the
    estimated potential amount of losses and impact on the

brand, which continue to be reviewed, we do not believe that the

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

ConAgra Foods, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    ConAgra Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
    May 31, 2009 and May 25, 2008, and the related
    consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income,
    common stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended May 31, 2009. These
    consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of ConAgra Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    May 31, 2009 and May 25, 2008, and the results of
    their operations and cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended May 31, 2009, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB
    Statement No. 109

, as of May 28, 2007. As
    discussed in note 19 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted the measurement date provisions
    of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
    No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
    Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

,
    (SFAS No. 158), as of May 28, 2007, and the
    recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158,
    as of May 27, 2007.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    May 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission

    procedures as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of
    May 31, 2009. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief

Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management, with the participation of the
    Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, evaluated any change in the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting that occurred during the
    quarter covered by this report and determined that there was no
    change in our internal controls over financial reporting during
    the quarter covered by this report that has materially affected,
    or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
    control over financial reporting.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

The management of ConAgra Foods is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. ConAgra
    Foods’ internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. ConAgra
    Foods’ internal control over financial reporting includes
    those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the
    maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
    and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
    assets of ConAgra Foods; (ii) provide reasonable assurance
    that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
    receipts and expenditures of ConAgra Foods are being made only
    in accordance with the authorization of management and directors
    of ConAgra Foods; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
    regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
    acquisition, use or disposition of ConAgra Foods’ assets
    that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
    Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluations of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of the changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

With the participation of ConAgra Foods’ Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management assessed the
    effectiveness of ConAgra Foods’ internal control over
    financial reporting as of May 31, 2009. In making this
    assessment, management used criteria established in

Internal
    Control—Integrated Framework

, issued by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (“COSO”). As a result of this assessment, management
    concluded that, as of May 31, 2009, its internal control
    over financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of ConAgra Foods’ internal control over
    financial reporting as of May 31, 2009 has been audited by
    KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
    stated in their report, a copy of which is included in this

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

ConAgra Foods, Inc.:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    ConAgra Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
    May 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, ConAgra Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained,
    in all material respects, effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of May 31, 2009, based on the
    criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

ConAgra Foods, Inc.:

Under date of July 24, 2009, we reported on the
    consolidated balance sheets of ConAgra Foods, Inc. and
    subsidiaries (the Company) as of May 31, 2009 and
    May 25, 2008, and the related consolidated statements of
    earnings, comprehensive income, common stockholders’
    equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
    period ended May 31, 2009, which are included in the Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

of ConAgra Foods, Inc. for the fiscal year ended May 31,
    2009. In connection with our audits of the aforementioned
    consolidated financial statements, we also audited the related
    consolidated financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
    Item 15. This consolidated financial statement schedule is
    the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on this consolidated
    financial statement schedule based on our audits.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statement schedule,
    when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB
    Statement No. 109

, as of May 28, 2007. As
    discussed in note 19 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted the measurement date provisions
    of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
    No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
    Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

,
    (SFAS No. 158), as of May 28, 2007, and the
    recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158,
    as of May 27, 2007.
