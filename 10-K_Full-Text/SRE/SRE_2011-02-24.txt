PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

We provide a description of Sempra Energy and its subsidiaries in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders (Annual Report), which is attached as Exhibit 13.1 to this report and is incorporated by reference.

This report includes information for the following separate registrants:

§

Sempra Energy and its consolidated entities

§

San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E)

§

Pacific Enterprises (PE), the holding company for Southern 
California Gas Company

§

Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas)

References in this report to "we," "our," "us," and "our company" are to Sempra Energy and its consolidated entities, collectively, unless otherwise indicated by the context.  SDG&E and SoCalGas are collectively referred to as the Sempra Utilities.

Sempra Energy has six separately managed reportable segments consisting of SDG&E, SoCalGas, Sempra Generation, Sempra Pipelines & Storage, Sempra LNG (liquefied natural gas) and Sempra Commodities. Sempra Generation, Sempra Pipelines & Storage, Sempra LNG and Sempra Commodities are subsidiaries of Sempra Global. Sempra Global is a holding company for most of our subsidiaries that are not subject to California utility regulation.

SDG&E, PE and SoCalGas are subsidiaries of Sempra Energy. Sempra Energy directly or indirectly owns all the common stock and substantially all of the voting stock of each of the three companies.

Sempra Commodities

In April 2008, Sempra Energy formed a partnership with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc (RBS) to purchase and operate our commodities-marketing businesses, which generally comprised the Sempra Commodities segment. In November 2009, RBS announced its intention to divest its interest in this joint venture, RBS Sempra Commodities LLP (RBS Sempra Commodities), following a directive from the European Commission to dispose of certain assets. In three separate transactions in 2010 and one in early 2011, we and RBS divested substantially all of the partnership’s businesses and assets.

We provide further disc
ussion about RBS Sempra Commodities and the transactions in Notes 3, 4 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

The most significant government regulation affecting Sempra Energy is the regulation of the Sempra Utilities.

California Utility Regulation

The Sempra Utilities are regulated in California by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), the California Energy Commission (CEC), and the California Air Resources Board (CARB).

The California Public Utilities Commission:

§

consists of five commissioners appointed by 
the Governor of California for staggered, six-year terms (only four positions are currently filled).

§

regulates SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ rates and conditions of service, sales of securities, rates of return, capital structure, rates of depreciation, and long-term resource procurement, except as described below in "United States Utility Regulation."

§

has jurisdiction over the proposed construction of major new electric transmission, electric distribution, and natural gas storage, transmission and distribution facilities in California.

§

conducts reviews and audits of utility performance and compliance with regulatory guidelines, 
and conducts investigations into various matters, such as deregulation, competition and the environment, to determine its future policies.

§

regulates the interactions and transactions of the Sempra Utilities with Sempra Energy and its other affiliates.

We provide further discussion in Notes 14 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

SDG&E is also subject to regulation by the CEC, which publishes electric demand forecasts for the state and for specific service territories.  Based upon these forecasts, the CEC:

§

determines the need for additional energy sources and conservation programs;

§

sponsors alternative-energy research and development projects;

§

promotes energy conservation programs;

§

maintains a statewide plan of action in case of energy shortages; and

§

certifies power-plant sites and related facilities within California.

The CEC conducts a 20-year forecast of available supplies and prices for every market sector that consumes natural gas in California. This forecast includes resource evaluation, pipeline capacity needs, natural gas demand and wellhead p
rices, and costs of transportation and distribution. This analysis is one of many resource materials used to support the Sempra Utilities’ long-term investment decisions.

The State of California requires certain California electric retail sellers, including SDG&E, to deliver 20 percent of their retail demand from renewable energy sources. The rules governing this requirement, administered by both the CPUC and the CEC, are generally known as the Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) Program. We discuss this requirement as it applies to SDG&E in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report. Certification of a generation project by the CEC as an Eligible Renewable Energy Resource (ERR) allows the purchase of output from a generation facility to be counted towards fulfillment of the RPS Program requirements. This may affect the demand for output from renewables projects developed by Sempra Generation, particularly from Cal
ifornia utilities. Final certification as an ERR for Sempra Generation’s El Dorado Solar generation facility was approved in June 2009. Sempra Generation has filed for ERR certification of its Copper Mountain Solar facility in Nevada.

California

Assembly Bill 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, assigns responsibility to CARB for monitoring and establishing policies for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The bill requires CARB to develop and adopt a comprehensive plan for achieving real, quantifiable and cost-effective GHG emission reductions, including a statewide GHG emissions cap, mandatory reporting rules, and regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of GHG emissions. CARB is a department within the California Environmental Protection Agency, an organization which reports directly to the Governor's Office in the Executive Branch of California State Government. In September 2010, CARB adopted a requir
ement known as the California Renewable Energy Standard (RES), which obligates California utilities to procure 33 percent of their annual electric energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2020. CARB has not yet issued the final version of formal regulations articulating the requirement or detailing how the RES will be implemented.

United States Utility Regulation

The Sempra Utilities are also regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

In the case of SDG&E, the FERC regulates the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas, the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, transmission access, rates
 of return on transmission investment, the uniform systems of accounts, rates of depreciation and electric rates involving sales for resale.

In the case of SoCalGas, the FERC regulates the interstate sale and transportation of natural gas and the uniform systems of accounts.

The NRC oversees the licensing, construction and operation of nuclear facilities in the United States, including the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS), in which SDG&E owns a 20-percent interest. NRC regulations require extensive review of the safety, radiological and environmental aspects of these facilities. Periodically, the NRC requires that newly developed data and techniques be used to reanalyze the design of a nuclear power plant and, as a result, may require plant modifications as a condition of continued operation.

The Department of Transportation (DOT) has 
established regulations regarding engineering standards and operating procedures applicable for the Sempra Utilities’ natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines. The DOT has certified the CPUC to administer oversight and compliance with these regulations for the entities they regulate in California.

Sempra Pipelines & Storage operates Mobile Gas Service Corporation (Mobile Gas), a natural gas distribution utility serving southwest Alabama that is regulated by the Alabama Public Service Commission (APSC).

Local Regulation Within the U.S.

SoCalGas has natural gas franchises with the 12 counties and 232 cities in its service territory. These franchises allow SoCalGas to locate, operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of natural gas. Most of the franchises have indefinite lives with no expiratio
n date. Some franchises have fixed expiration dates, ranging from 2011 to 2048.

SDG&E has

§

electric franchises with the two counties and the 26 cities in its electric service territory, and

§

natural gas franchises with the one county and the 18 cities in its natural gas service territory.

These franchises allow SDG&E to locate, operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of electricity and/or natural gas. Most of the franchises have indefinite lives with no expiration dates. Some natural gas franchises have fixed expiration dates, ranging from 2012 to 2035, and some electric franchises have fixed expiration dates that range 
from 2012 to 2018.

Sempra Generation, Sempra Pipelines & Storage and Sempra LNG have operations or development projects in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, and Texas. These entities are subject to state and local laws, and to regulations in the states in which they operate.

Other Regulation

In the United States, the FERC, with ratemaking authority over wholesale sales of power and the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce, and siting and permitting authority for LNG terminals, regulates Sempra Generation’s, Sempra Pipelines & Storage’s and Sempra LNG’s operations.  Sempra Pipelines & Storage also owns an interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline, a natural gas pipeline which operates in several states in the United States and is subje
ct to regulation by the FERC. Intrastate storage at Sempra Pipelines & Storage’s Bay Gas Storage Company (Bay Gas) is also regulated by the APSC.

The FERC may regulate rates and terms of service based on a cost-of-service approach or, in geographic and product markets determined by the FERC to be sufficiently competitive, rates may be market-based. Our LNG terminal in the United States is subject to market-based rates and terms of service. FERC regulated rates at the following businesses are

§

Sempra Generation: market-based for wholesale electricity sales.

§

Sempra Pipelines & Storage: cost-based and market-based for the transportation and storage of natural gas, respectively.

§

Sempra LNG: Market-based for the receipt, storage and vaporization of LNG and the purchase and sale of natural gas.

Sempra Pipelines & Storage is also subject to DOT rules and regulations regarding pipeline safety.

Several of our segments operate in Mexico as follows:

§

Sempra Generation owns and operates a natural gas-fired power plant in Baja California, Mexico

§

Sempra Pipelines & Storage’s Mexican utilities build and operate natural gas distribution systems in Mexicali, Chihuahua, and the La Laguna-Durango zone in north-central Mexico

<
/p>

§

Sempra Pipelines & Storage transports gas between the U.S. border and Baja California, Mexico and Sonora, Mexico. Sempra Pipelines & Storage also owns a 50-percent interest in a joint venture with PEMEX (the Mexican state-owned oil company) that operates two natural gas pipelines and a propane system in northern Mexico

§

Sempra LNG owns and operates the Energía Costa Azul LNG receipt terminal located in Baja California, Mexico

These operations are subject to regulation by the Comisión Reguladora de Energía and by the labor and environmental agencies of city, state and federal governments in Mexico.

Sempra Pipelines & Storage also has investments
 in South America that are subject to laws and regulations in the localities and countries in which they operate.

Licenses and Permits

The Sempra Utilities obtain numerous permits, authorizations and licenses in connection with the transmission and distribution of natural gas and electricity and the operation and construction of related assets, some of which may require periodic renewal.

Our other subsidiaries are also required to obtain numerous permits, authorizations and licenses in the normal course of business. Some of these permits, authorizations and licenses require periodic renewal.

Sempra

Generation and its subsidiaries obtain a number of permits, authorizations and licenses in connection with the construction and operation of power generation facilities, and in c
onnection with the wholesale distribution of electricity.

Sempra Pipelines & Storage’s Mexican subsidiaries obtain numerous permits, authorizations and licenses for their natural gas distribution and transmission systems from the local governments where the service is provided. Sempra Pipelines & Storage’s U.S. operations obtain licenses and permits for natural gas storage facilities and pipelines.

Sempra LNG obtains licenses and permits for the operation and expansion of LNG facilities, and the import and export of LNG and natural gas.

We describe other regulatory matters in Notes 14 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

CALIFORNIA

NATURAL GAS UTILITY OPERATIONS

SoCalGas and SDG&E sell, distribute and transport natural gas. SoCalGas purchases and stores natural gas for itself and SDG&E on a combined portfolio basis and provides natural gas storage services for others. The Sempra Utilities’ resource planning, natural gas procurement, contractual commitments, and related regulatory matters are discussed below. We also provide further discussion in the Annual Report in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and in Notes 14 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Customers

For regulatory purposes, end-use customers are classified as either core or noncore customers. Core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers. Noncore cus
tomers at SoCalGas consist primarily of electric generation, wholesale, large commercial, industrial, and enhanced oil recovery customers. Noncore customers at SDG&E consist primarily of electric generation and large commercial and industrial customers.

Most core customers purchase natural gas directly from SoCalGas or SDG&E. While core customers are permitted to purchase directly from producers, marketers or brokers, the Sempra Utilities are obligated to provide reliable supplies of natural gas to serve the requirements of their core customers. Noncore customers are responsible for the procurement of their natural gas requirements.

In 2010, SoCalGas added 24,000 new natural gas customer meters at a growth rate of 0.4 percent; in 2009, it added 27,000 new meters at a growth rate of 0.5 percent. SDG&E added 4,300 and 4,200 new natural gas customer meters in 2010 and 2009, respectively, both at a growt
h rate of 0.5 percent. Based on forecasts of new housing starts, SoCalGas and SDG&E each expects that its new meter growth rates in 2011 will be comparable to those in 2010.

Natural Gas Procurement and Transportation

SoCalGas

purchases natural gas under short-term and long-term contracts for the Sempra Utilities’ core customers. SoCalGas purchases natural gas from Canada, the U.S. Rockies and the southwestern U.S. to meet customer requirements and maintain pipeline reliability. It also purchases some California natural gas production and additional supplies delivered directly to California for its remaining requirements. Purchases of natural gas are primarily based on published monthly bid-week indices.

To ensure the delivery of the natural gas supplies to its distribution system and to meet the seasonal and annual needs 
of customers, SoCalGas has entered into firm interstate pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed reservation charges to reserve firm transportation rights. Interstate pipeline companies, primarily El Paso Natural Gas Company, Transwestern Pipeline Company, and Kern River Gas Transmission Company, provide transportation services into SoCalGas' intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by SoCalGas or its transportation customers from outside of California. The FERC regulates the rates that interstate pipeline companies may charge for natural gas and transportation services.

SoCalGas has natural gas transportation contracts with various interstate pipelines. These contracts expire on various dates between 2011 and 2025.

Natural Gas Storage

SoCalGas provides natural gas storage services for core, noncore 
and non-end-use customers. The Sempra Utilities’ core customers are allocated a portion of SoCalGas' storage capacity. SoCalGas offers the remaining storage capacity for sale to others through an open bid process. The storage service program provides opportunities for these customers to purchase and store natural gas when natural gas costs are low, usually during the summer, thereby reducing purchases when natural gas costs are expected to be higher. This program allows customers to better manage their natural gas procurement and transportation needs.

Demand for Natural Gas

Growth in the demand for natural gas largely depends on the health and expansion of the Southern California economy, prices of alternative energy products, environmental regulations, renewable energy, legislation, and the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs. External factors such as weather, the price of 
electricity, electric deregulation, the use of hydroelectric power, development of renewable energy resources, development of new natural gas supply sources, and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in demand and market price.

The Sempra Utilities face competition in the residential and commercial customer markets based on customers' preferences for natural gas compared with other energy products. In the noncore industrial market, some customers are capable of securing alternate fuel supplies from other suppliers which can affect the demand for natural gas. The Sempra Utilities’ ability to maintain their respective industrial market shares is largely dependent on the relative spread between delivered energy prices.

Natural gas demand for electric generation within Southern California competes with electric power generated throughout the western U.S. Natural gas trans
ported for electric generating plant customers may be affected by the growth in renewable generation, the addition of more efficient gas technologies and to the extent that regulatory changes and electric transmission infrastructure investment divert electric generation from the Sempra Utilities’ respective service areas. The demand may also fluctuate due to volatility in the demand for electricity and the availability of competing supplies of electricity such as hydro-electric generation and other renewable energy sources. We provide additional information regarding electric industry restructuring in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

The natural gas distribution business is seasonal, and revenues generally are greater during the winter heating months. As is prevalent in the industry, SoCalGas injects natural gas into storage during the summer months (usually April through October) for withdrawal from sto
rage during the winter months (usually November through March) when customer demand is higher.

ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS

Customers

SDG&E’s service area covers 4,100 square miles. At December 31, 2010, SDG&E had 1.4 million customer meters consisting of:

§

1,232,000 residential

§

147,000 commercial

§

500 industrial

§

2,100 street and highway lighting

§

4,500 direct access

SDG&E added 7,000 new electric customer meters at a growth rate of 0.5 percent in both 2010 and 2009. Based on forecasts of new housing starts, SDG&E expects that its new meter growth rate in 2011 will be comparable to that in 2010.

Resource Planning and Power Procurement

SDG&E's resource planning, power procurement and related regulatory matters are discussed in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in Notes 14, 15 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

Electric Resources

The supply of electric power available to SDG&E for resale is based on CPUC-approved purchased-power contracts currently in place with its various suppliers, its Palomar and Miramar generating facilities, its 20-percent ownership interest in SONGS and purchases on a spot basis. This supply as of December 31, 2010 is as follows:

A QF is a generating facility which meets the requirements for QF status under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. It includes cogeneration facilities, which produce electricity and another form of useful thermal energy (such as heat or steam) used for industrial, commercial, residential or institutional purposes. It also includes small power production facilities, which are generating facilities whose primary energy source is renewable (hydro, wind, solar, etc.), biomass, waste, or geothermal resources. Small power production facilities are generally limited in size to 80 MW.

Tolling contracts are purchased-power agreements under which we provide the fuel for generation to the energy supplier.

Under the contract with PGE, SDG&E pays a capacity charge plus a charge based on the amount of energy received and/or PGE's non-fuel costs. Costs under most of the contracts with QFs are based on SDG&E's avoided cost. Charges under the remaining contracts are for firm and as-available energy, and are based on the amount of energy received or are tolls based on available capacit
y. The prices under these contracts are based on the market value at the time the contracts were negotiated.

Natural Gas Supply

SDG&E buys natural gas under short-term contracts for its Palomar and Miramar generating facilities and for the Cabrillo Power I, LLC, Otay Mesa Energy Center LLC, Orange Grove Energy L.P., and El Cajon Energy, LLC tolling contracts. Purchases are from various southwestern U.S. suppliers and are primarily based on published monthly bid-week indices. SDG&E's natural gas is delivered from southern California border receipt points to the SoCal CityGate pool via firm access rights which expire on September 30, 2011.  The natural gas is then delivered from the SoCal CityGate pool to the generating facilities through SoCalGas' pipelines in accordance with a transportation agreement that expires on May 31, 2011. SDG&E has also contracted with SoC
alGas for natural gas storage from April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2011.

SDG&E also buys natural gas as the California DWR's limited agent for the DWR-allocated contracts. Most of the natural gas deliveries for the DWR-allocated contracts are transported through the Kern River Gas Transmission Pipeline under a long-term transportation agreement. The DWR is financially responsible for the costs of gas and transportation.

SONGS

SDG&E has a 20-percent ownership interest in SONGS, which is located south of San Clemente, California. SONGS consists of two operating nuclear generating units. The city of Riverside owns 1.79 percent and Southern California Edison (Edison), the operator of SONGS, owns the remaining interest.

The two units began commercial operation in August 1983 and April 1984,
 respectively. SDG&E's share of the capacity from the two units is 430 MW.

A third unit was removed from service in November 1992. Decommissioning of that unit is largely complete, with the remaining work to be done in the future when the remaining two units are decommissioned. Its spent nuclear fuel is being stored on site in an independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI) licensed by the NRC.

SDG&E has fully recovered the capital invested through December 31, 2003 in SONGS and earns a return only on subsequent capital additions, including SDG&E’s share of costs associated with the steam generator replacement project, which is currently in progress.

We provide additional information concerning the SONGS units and nuclear decommissioning below in "Environmental Matters" and in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations" and Notes 6, 14 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

Nuclear Fuel Supply

The nuclear fuel supply cycle includes materials and services performed by others under various contracts that extend through 2020. Fuel supply contracts are index-priced and provide nuclear fuel through 2022, the expiration of SONGS’ NRC license.

Spent fuel from SONGS is being stored on site in both the ISFSI and spent fuel pools. With the completion of the current phase of decommissioning, the site has adequate space to build ISFSI storage capacity through 2022. Pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, SDG&E entered into a contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for spent-fuel disposal. Under the agreement, the DOE is responsible for the ultimate disposal of spent fuel f
rom SONGS. SDG&E pays the DOE a disposal fee of $1.00 per megawatt-hour of net nuclear generation, or $3 million per year. It is uncertain when the DOE will begin accepting spent fuel from any nuclear generation facility.

We provide additional information concerning nuclear-fuel costs and the storage and movement of spent fuel in Notes 14 and 16, respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

Power Pools

SDG&E is a participant in the Western Systems Power Pool, which includes an electric-power and transmission-rate agreement with utilities and power agencies located throughout the United States and Canada. More than 300 investor-owned and municipal utilities, state and federal power agencies, energy brokers and power marketers share power and information in order to increase eff
iciency and competition in the bulk power market. Participants are able to make power transactions on standardized terms, including market-based rates, preapproved by the FERC.

Transmission Arrangements

SDG&E's 500-kilovolt (kV) Southwest Powerlink transmission line, which is shared with Arizona Public Service Company and Imperial Irrigation District, extends from Palo Verde, Arizona to San Diego, California. SDG&E's share of the line is 1,162 MW, although it can be less under certain system conditions.

Mexico's Baja California system is connected to SDG&E's system via two 230-kV interconnections with firm capability of 408 MW in the north to south direction and 800 MW in the south to north direction.

SDG&E’s Sunrise Powerlink, a new 117-mile, 500-kV transmission
 line project that is designed to deliver up to 1,000 megawatts of energy from the Imperial Valley to the San Diego region, received approval from the CPUC in December 2008, the Bureau of Land Management in January 2009 and the U.S. Forest Service in July 2010. SDG&E commenced construction in the fall of 2010 and expects the line to be in commercial operation in the second half of 2012. We provide further discussion in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

Transmission Access

The National Energy Policy Act governs procedures for requests for transmission service. The FERC approved the California investor-owned utilities' (IOUs) transfer of operation and control of their transmission facilities to the Independent System Operator (ISO) in 1998. We provide additional information regarding transmission issues in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolida
ted Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

RATES AND REGULATION – SEMPRA UTILITIES

We provide information concerning rates and regulation applicable to the Sempra Utilities in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in Notes 1, 14 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

SEMPRA GLOBAL

Sempra Global is a holding company for most of our subsidiaries that are not subject to California utility regulation.

Sempra Global includes Sempra Generation, Sempra Pipelines & Storage, Sempra LNG and Sempra Commodities.

We provide descriptions of these business units and information concerning their operations under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in Notes 1, 3, 4, 16, 17 and 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

Competition

Sempra Energy’s non-utility businesses are among many others in the energy industry providing similar products and services. They are engaged in highly competitive activities that require significant capital investments and highly skilled and experienced personnel. Many of their competitors may have significantly greater financial, personnel and other resources than Sempra Global.

Sempra Generation

For sales of non-contracted power, Sempra Generation is subject to competition from energy
 marketers, utilities, industrial companies and other independent power producers. For a number of years, natural gas has been the fuel of choice for new power generation facilities for economic, operational and environmental reasons. While natural gas-fired facilities will continue to be an important part of the nation’s generation portfolio, some regulated utilities are now constructing units powered by renewable resources, often with subsidies or under legislative mandate. These utilities generally have a lower cost of capital than most independent power producers and often are able to recover fixed costs through rate base mechanisms. This recovery allows them to build, buy and upgrade generation without relying exclusively on market clearing prices to recover their investments.

When Sempra Generation sells power not subject to long-term contract commitments, it is exposed to market fluctuations in prices based on a number of facto
rs, including the amount of capacity available to meet demand, the price and availability of fuel, and the presence of transmission constraints. Additionally, generation from Sempra Generation’s renewable energy assets is exposed to fluctuations in naturally occurring conditions such as wind, weather and hours of sunlight. Some of Sempra Generation’s competitors, such as electric utilities and generation companies, have their own generation capacity, including natural gas, coal and nuclear generation.  These companies, generally larger than Sempra Generation, may have a lower cost of capital and may have competitive advantages as a result of their scale and the location of their generation facilities.

Sempra Generation’s competitors include

Sempra Pipelines & Storage

Within its market area, Sempra Pipelines & Storage’s natural gas storage facilities and pipelines compete with other regulated and unregulated storage facilities and pipelines. It competes primarily on the basis of price (in terms of storage and transportation fees), available capacity, and connections to downstream markets.

Sempra Pipelines & Storage’s competitors include

Sempra LNG

New supplies to meet North America’s natural gas demand may be developed from a combination of the following sources:

§

e
xisting producing basins in the United States, Canada and Mexico;

§

frontier basins in Alaska, Canada, and offshore North America;

§

areas currently restricted from exploration and development due to public policies, such as areas in the Rocky Mountains and offshore Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf of Mexico coasts;

§

previously inaccessible or uneconomic natural gas reserves through hydraulic fracturing (natural gas recovery from deep shale formations) and other new exploration, drilling and production techniques; and

§

LNG imported into LNG receipt terminals in operation or under development in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

In addition, the demand for energy currently met by natural gas could be met by other energy forms such as coal, hydroelectric, oil, wind, solar, geothermal, biomass and nuclear energy. Sempra LNG will, therefore, face competition from companies who supply each of these energy sources.

Sempra LNG competes with other companies that operate LNG receiving terminals and purchase LNG. As of December 31, 2010, there were 16 existing and operating LNG receipt terminals in North America. There are two additional LNG receipt terminals currently under construction in North America. Worldwide, there are 82 existing and operating LNG receipt terminals in 21 countries. There are also other proposed LNG receipt terminals worldwide with which Sempra LNG will compete to be the most economical delivery
 point for LNG supply of both long-term contracted and spot volumes.

Sempra LNG’s major domestic and international competitors include the following companies and their related LNG affiliates:

Sempra Commodities

Sempra Commodities consists of our investment in RBS Sempra Commodities, a joint venture formed in April 2008. As we discuss above under “Description of Business – Sempra Commodities,” substantially all of the joint venture’s businesses and assets were divested in 2010 and early 2011.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

We discuss environmental issues affecting us in Notes 14, 15
 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report. You should read the following additional information in conjunction with those discussions.

Hazardous Substances

In 1994, the CPUC approved the Hazardous Waste Collaborative mechanism, allowing California's IOUs to recover hazardous waste cleanup costs for certain sites, including those related to certain Superfund sites. This mechanism permits the Sempra Utilities to recover in rates 90 percent of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related third-party litigation costs, and 70 percent of the related insurance-litigation expenses. In addition, the Sempra Utilities have the opportunity to retain a percentage of any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third parties to offset the cleanup and associated litigation costs not recovered in rates.

At 
December 31, 2010, we had accrued estimated remaining investigation and remediation liabilities of $0.6 million at SDG&E and $20.2 million at SoCalGas, both related to hazardous waste sites for which the Hazardous Waste Collaborative mechanism authorizes us to recover 90 percent of the costs. The accruals include costs for numerous locations, most of which had been manufactured-gas plants. This estimated cost excludes remediation costs of $5.4 million associated with SDG&E's former fossil-fuel power plants and other locations for which the cleanup costs are not being recovered in rates. We believe that any costs not ultimately recovered through rates, insurance or other means will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial condition of Sempra Energy, SDG&E or PE/SoCalGas.

We record estimated liabilities for environmental remediation when amounts are probable and estimable. In addition, we record amounts autho
rized to be recovered in rates under the Hazardous Waste Collaborative mechanism as regulatory assets.

Air and Water Quality

The electric and natural gas industries are subject to increasingly stringent air-quality and greenhouse gas standards, such as those established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the CARB. We discuss these standards in "Government Regulation – California Utility Regulation" above. The Sempra Utilities generally recover in rates the costs to comply with these standards.

In connection with the issuance of operating permits, SDG&E and the other owners of SONGS have an agreement with the California Coastal Commission to mitigate environmental impacts to the marine environment attributed to the cooling-water discharge from SONGS. SDG&E's share of the mitigation costs is 
estimated to be $53 million, of which $36 million had been incurred through December 31, 2010, and $17 million is accrued for the remaining costs through 2050. In 2008, an artificial kelp reef project was completed. The remaining costs are to complete a wetlands project and maintain both projects through 2050.

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

When evaluating our company and its subsidiaries, you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report. These risk factors could affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. Other risks and uncertainties, in addition to those that are described below, may also impair our business operations. If any
 of the following occurs, our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition could be seriously harmed. In addition, the trading price of our securities could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning

our company set forth in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Annual Report.

Sempra Energy's cash flows, ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries.

Sempra Energy's ability to pay dividends and meet its debt obligations depends on cash flows from its subsidiaries and, in the short term, its ability to raise capital from external sources. In the long term,
 cash flows from the subsidiaries depend on their ability to generate operating cash flows in excess of their own capital expenditures and long-term debt obligations. In addition, the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and could be precluded from making such distributions under certain circumstances, including as a result of legislation or regulation or in times of financial distress.

Our businesses may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.

Our businesses are capital intensive and we rely significantly on long-term debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and refund outstanding debt, and on short-term borrowings to fund a portion of day-to-day business operations.

The credit markets and financial services industry have recently experienced a period 
of extreme world-wide turmoil characterized by the bankruptcy, failure, collapse or sale of many financial institutions and by extraordinary levels of government intervention and proposals for further intervention and additional regulation.

Limitations on the availability of credit and increases in interest rates or credit spreads may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. In difficult credit markets, we may find it necessary to fund our operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support business activities. This could cause us to reduce capital expenditures and could increase our cost of funding, both of which could reduce our short-term and long-term profitability.

The availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings. If the credit ratings of SoCalGas or SDG&E were to be
 reduced, their businesses could be adversely affected and any reduction in Sempra Energy's ratings could adversely affect its non-utility subsidiaries.

Risks Related to All Sempra Energy Subsidiaries

Our businesses are subject to complex government regulations and may be adversely affected by changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation.

In recent years, the regulatory environment that applies to the electric power and natural gas industries has undergone significant changes, on both federal and state levels. These changes have affected the nature of these industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their businesses. These changes are ongoing, and we cannot pre
dict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on our businesses. Moreover, existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted, and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us and our facilities. Our business is subject to increasingly complex accounting and tax requirements, and the laws and regulations that affect us may change in response to economic or political conditions. Compliance with these requirements could increase our operating costs, and new tax legislation, regulations or other interpretations could materially affect our tax expense. Changes in laws and regulations may have a detrimental effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.

Our operations are subject to rules relating to transactions among the Sempra Utilities and other Sempra Energy operations. These rules are commonly re
ferred to as the Affiliate Transaction Rules. These businesses could be adversely affected by changes in these rules or by additional CPUC or FERC rules that further restrict our ability to sell electricity or natural gas, or to trade with the Sempra Utilities and with each other. Affiliate Transaction Rules also could require us to obtain prior approval from the CPUC before entering into any such transactions with the Sempra Utilities. Any such restrictions or approval requirements could adversely affect the LNG receiving terminals, natural gas pipelines, electric generation facilities, or other operations of our subsidiaries.

Our businesses require numerous permits and other governmental approvals from various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies; any failure to obtain or maintain required permits or approvals could cause our sales to decline and/or our costs to increase.

All of our existing and planned development projects require multiple permits. The acquisition, ownership and operation of LNG receiving terminals, natural gas pipelines and storage facilities, and electric generation and transmission facilities require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies. Once received, approvals may be subject to litigation, and projects may be delayed or approvals reversed in litigation. If there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, we may not be able to construct or operate our facilities, or we may be forced to incur additional costs.

Our businesses have significant environmental compliance costs, and future environmental compliance costs could adversely affect our profitability.

We

are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign statutes, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection, including, in particular, climate change and GHG emissions. We are required to obtain numerous governmental permits, licenses and other approvals to construct and operate our businesses. Additionally, to comply with these legal requirements, we must spend significant sums on environmental monitoring, pollution control equipment, mitigation costs and emissions fees. In addition, we are generally responsible for all on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our electric generation facilities and other energy projects, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. If we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws, we may be subject to penalties, fines and/or curtailments of our operations.

The scope and effect of new environmental 
laws and regulations, including their effects on our current operations and future expansions, are difficult to predict. Increasing international, national, regional and state-level concerns as well as new or proposed legislation and regulation may have substantial effects on our operations, operating costs, and the scope and economics of proposed expansion. In particular, state-level laws and regulations, as well as proposed national and international legislation and regulation relating to the control and reduction of GHG emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride), may limit or otherwise adversely affect our operations. The implementation of recent and proposed California and federal legislation and regulation may adversely affect our unregulated businesses by imposing additional costs associated with emission limits, controls and the possible requirement of carbon taxes or the purchase of emis
sions credits. Similarly, the Sempra Utilities may be affected if costs are not recoverable in rates. The effects of existing and proposed greenhouse gas emission reduction standards may cause rates to increase to levels that substantially reduce customer demand and growth. In addition, SDG&E may be subject to penalties if certain mandated renewable energy goals are not met.

In addition, existing and future laws and regulation on mercury, nitrogen and sulfur oxides, particulates, or other emissions could result in requirements for additional pollution control equipment or emission fees and taxes that could adversely affect us. Moreover, existing rules and regulations may be interpreted or revised in ways that may adversely affect us and our facilities and operations.

We provide further discussion of these matters in Notes 14, 15 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in th
e Annual Report.

Natural disasters, catastrophic accidents or acts of terrorism could materially adversely affect our business, earnings and cash flows.

Like other major industrial facilities, ours may be damaged by natural disasters, catastrophic accidents, or acts of terrorism. Such facilities include

§

generation plants

§

chartered LNG tankers

§

electric transmission and distribution

§

natural gas pipelines and storage

§

LNG receipt terminals and storage

Such incidents could result in severe business disruptions, significant decreases in revenues, and/or significant additional costs to us. Any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, earnings and cash flows.

Depending on the nature and location of the facilities affected, any such incident also could cause fires, leaks, explosions, spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties, or cause personal injuries or fatalities. Any of these consequences could lead to significant claims against us. Insurance coverage may significantly increase in cost or become unavailable for certain of these risks, and any insurance proceeds we receive may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, earnings and cash flows.

Our future results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of pending litigation against us.

Sempra Energy and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits. We have spent, and continue to spend, substan
tial amounts defending these lawsuits, and in related investigations and regulatory proceedings. In particular, SDG&E is subject to numerous lawsuits arising out of San Diego County wildfires in 2007. We discuss this and other litigation in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report. The uncertainties inherent in legal proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the costs and effects of resolving these matters. In addition, California juries have demonstrated an increasing willingness to grant large awards, including punitive damages, in personal injury, product liability, property damage and other claims. Accordingly, actual costs incurred may differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and could materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.

We discuss these proceedings in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
and in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Annual Report.

Risks Related to the Sempra Utilities

The Sempra Utilities are subject to extensive regulation by state, federal and local legislative and regulatory authorities, which may adversely affect the operations, performance and growth of their businesses.

The CPUC regulates the Sempra Utilities' rates, except SDG&E's electric transmission rates which are regulated by the FERC. The CPUC also regulates the Sempra Utilities':

§

conditions of service

§

rates of depreciation

§

capital structure

§

long-term resource procurement

§

rates of return

§

sales of securities

The CPUC conducts various reviews and audits of utility performance, compliance with CPUC regulations and standards, affiliate relationships and other matters. These reviews and audits may result in disallowances and penalties that could adversely affect earnings and cash flows. We discuss various CPUC proceedings relating to the Sempra Utilities' rates, costs, incentive mechanisms, and performance-based regulation in Notes 14 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Annual Report.

The Sempra Utilities may spend funds related to a major capital project prior to 
receiving regulatory approval. If the project does not receive regulatory approval or if management decides not to proceed with the project, they may not be able to recover all amounts spent for that project, which could adversely affect earnings and cash flows.

The CPUC periodically approves the Sempra Utilities' rates based on authorized capital expenditures, operating costs and an authorized rate of return on investment. If actual capital expenditures and operating costs were to exceed the amount approved by the CPUC, earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected.

The CPUC applies performance-based measures and incentive mechanisms to all California utilities. Under these, earnings potential above authorized base margins is tied to achieving or exceeding specific performance and operating goals, rather than relying solely on expanding utility plant (rate base) to increase earnings. At the Semp
ra Utilities, the areas that are eligible for incentives are operational activities such as employee safety, energy efficiency programs and, at SoCalGas, natural gas procurement and unbundled natural gas storage and system operator hub services. Although the Sempra Utilities have received incentive awards in the past, there can be no assurance that they

will receive awards in the future, or that any future awards earned would be in amounts comparable to prior periods. Additionally, if the Sempra Utilities fail to achieve certain minimum performance levels established under such mechanisms, they may be assessed financial disallowances or penalties which could negatively affect earnings and cash flows.

The FERC regulates electric transmission rates, the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, transmission access, the rates of return on transmission investments, and other similar matters involving SDG&E.

<
/p>

The Sempra Utilities

may be adversely affected by new regulations, decisions, orders or interpretations of the CPUC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies. New legislation, regulations, decisions, orders or interpretations could change how they

operate, could affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms, or could require them to incur additional expenses.

The construction and expansion of the Sempra Utilities' natural gas pipelines, SoCalGas' storage facilities, and SDG&E's electric transmission and distribution facilities require numerous permits and approvals from federal, state and local governmental agencies. If there are delays in obtaining required approvals, or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals, or to comply with applicable laws or regulations, the Sempra Utilities' business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition cou
ld be materially adversely affected.

Recovery of 2007 Wildfire Litigation Costs

SDG&E is subject to numerous lawsuits arising out of the San Diego County wildfires in 2007. It expects that substantially all reasonably incurred costs of resolving 2007 wildfire claims that exceed its liability insurance coverage and any amounts recovered from other potentially responsible parties will be recovered from utility customers. However, recovery from customers will require future regulatory actions, and a failure to obtain recovery, or any negative assessment of the likelihood of recovery, would likely have a material adverse effect on Sempra Energy’s and SDG&E’s cash flows and results of operations. In addition, SDG&E's cash flows may be adversely affected due to the timing differences between resolution of claims and the recoveries from other potentially responsible parties and utility
 customers, which may extend over a number of years.

SDG&E may incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of its ownership of nuclear facilities.

SDG&E has a 20-percent ownership interest in SONGS, a 2,150-MW nuclear generating facility near San Clemente, California, operated by Southern California Edison Company. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. SDG&E's ownership interest in SONGS subjects it to the risks of nuclear generation, which include

§

the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials;

§

limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and

§

uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of replacing steam generators or other equipment, and the decommissioning of nuclear plants.

Risks Related to our Generation, LNG, Pipelines & Storage and Other Businesses

Our businesses are exposed to market risk, and our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected by fluctu
ations in commodity market prices that are beyond our control.

Sempra Generation generates electricity that it sells under long-term contracts and into the spot market or other competitive markets. It purchases natural gas to fuel its power plants and may also purchase electricity in the open market to satisfy its contractual obligations. As part of its risk management strategy, Sempra Generation may hedge a substantial portion of its electricity sales and natural gas purchases to manage its portfolio.

We buy energy-related commodities from time to time, for power plants or for LNG receipt terminals to satisfy contractual obligations with customers, in regional markets and other competitive markets in which we compete. Our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for electricity, natural gas, LNG or other commodities that we buy change
 in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we had not provided through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions.

Unanticipated changes in market prices for energy-related commodities result from multiple factors, including:

§

weather conditions

§

seasonality

§

changes in supply and demand

§

transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies

§

availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources

§

commodity production levels

§

actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with respect to the supply of crude oil

§

federal, state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation

§

natural disasters, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events

§

expropriation of assets by foreign countries

The FERC has jurisdiction over wholesale power and transmission rates, independent system operators, and other entities that control transmission facilities or that administer wholesale power sales in some of the markets in which we operate. The FERC may impose additional price limitations, bidding rules and other mechanisms, or terminate existing price limitations from time to time. Any such action by the FERC may result in prices for electricity changing in an unanticipated direction or manner and, as a result, may have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.

When our businesses enter into fixed-price long-term contracts to provide services or commodities, we are exposed to inflation and interest rate risks.

Sempra Generation, Sempra Pipelines & Storag
e and Sempra LNG generally endeavor to secure long-term contracts with customers for services and commodities to optimize the use of their facilities, reduce volatility in earnings, and support the construction of new infrastructure. However, if these contracts are at fixed prices, the profitability of the contract may be adversely affected by inflationary pressures, including rising operational costs, costs of labor, materials and equipment, and rising interest rates that affect financing costs. To the extent possible, we may mitigate these risks by using variable pricing tied to market indices, anticipating an escalation in costs when bidding on projects, or providing for cost escalation. However, these measures may not ensure that the increase in revenues they provide will fully offset increases in operating expenses and/or financing costs.

Business development activities may not be successful and projects under construction may not commence oper
ation as scheduled, which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments.

The acquisition, development, construction and expansion of LNG receiving terminals, natural gas pipelines and storage facilities, electric generation facilities, and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks. We may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, fuel supply, resource exploration, legal, and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible, economically attractive, or capable of being built.

Success in developing a particular project is contingent upon, among other things:

§

negotiation of satisfactory engineering, procurement and construction agreements

§

negotiation of supply and natural gas sales agreements or firm capacity service agreements

§

receipt of required governmental permits

§

timely implementation and satisfactory completion of construction

Successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected by:

§

unforeseen engineering problems

§

construction delays and contractor performance
 shortfalls

§

work stoppages

§

equipment supply

§

adverse weather conditions

§

environmental and geological conditions

§

other factors

If we are unable to complete the development of a facility, we typically will not be able to recover our investment in the project.

The operati
on of existing and future facilities also involves many risks, including the breakdown or failure of generation or regasification and storage facilities or other equipment or processes, labor disputes, fuel interruption, and operating performance below expected levels. In addition, weather-related incidents and other natural disasters can disrupt generation, regasification, storage and transmission systems. The occurrence of any of these events could lead to operating facilities below expected capacity levels, which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs and penalties. Such occurrences could adversely affect our business, cash flows and results of operations.

We may elect not to, or may not be able to, enter into long-term supply and sales agreements or long-term firm capacity agreements for our projects, which would subject our revenues to increased volatility and our businesses to increased competitio
n.

The electric generation and wholesale power sales industries have become highly competitive. As more plants are built and competitive pressures increase, wholesale electricity prices may become more volatile. Without the benefit of long-term power sales agreements, our revenues may be subject to increased price volatility. The 10-year power sales agreement between Sempra Generation and the DWR, which comprised 8 percent of our revenues in 2010, 9 percent in 2009 and 10 percent in 2008, expires in September 2011. As a result, we may be unable to sell the power generated by Sempra Generation's facilities or operate those facilities profitably.

Sempra LNG utilizes its receipt terminals by entering into long-term capacity agreements. Under these agreements, customers pay Sempra LNG capacity reservation and usage fees to receive, store and regasify the customer's LNG. Sempra LNG also may e
nter into short-term and/or long-term supply agreements to purchase LNG to be received, stored and regasified at its terminals for sale to other parties. The long-term supply agreement contracts are expected to reduce our exposure to changes in natural gas prices through corresponding natural gas sales agreements or by tying LNG supply prices to prevailing natural gas market price indices. However, if Sempra LNG is unable to obtain sufficient long-term agreements or if the counterparties, customers or suppliers to one or more of the key agreements for the LNG facilities were to fail to perform or become unable to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, reduced availability of LNG to the United States and Mexico due to inadequate supplies, increased demand and higher prices in other countries, abundant domestic supplies of natural gas and/or delays in the development o
f new liquefaction capacity could affect the timing of expansion of our existing LNG facilities. These conditions also are likely to delay attainment of full-capacity utilization at our facilities. Our potential LNG suppliers also may be subject to international political and economic pressures and risks, which may also affect the supply of LNG.

Sempra Pipelines & Storage's natural gas pipeline operations are dependent on supplies of LNG and/or natural gas from their transportation customers, which may include Sempra LNG facilities.

We provide information about these matters in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

Our businesses depend on counterparties, business partners, customers, and suppliers performin
g in accordance with their agreements. If they fail to perform, we could incur substantial expenses and be exposed to commodity price risk and volatility, which could adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations.

We are exposed to the risk that counterparties, business partners, customers, and suppliers that owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other long-term agreements will not perform their obligations under such agreements. Should they fail to perform, we may be required to acquire alternative hedging arrangements or to honor the underlying commitment at then-current market prices. In such event, we may incur additional losses to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties or suppliers. In addition, we often extend credit to counterparties and customers. While we perform significant credit analyses prior to extending credit, we are exposed to the risk that we may not be able to co
llect amounts owed to us.

Sempra LNG's obligations and those of its suppliers for LNG supplies are contractually subject to (1) suspension or termination for "force majeure" events beyond the control of the parties; and (2) substantial limitations of remedies for other failures to perform, including limitations on damages to amounts that could be substantially less than those necessary to provide full recovery of costs for breach of the agreements.

We rely on transportation assets and services that we do not own or control to deliver electricity and natural gas.

We depend on electric transmission lines, natural gas pipelines, and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to:

§

de
liver the electricity and natural gas we sell to wholesale markets,

§

supply natural gas to our electric generation facilities, and

§

provide retail energy services to customers.

Sempra Pipelines & Storage also depends on natural gas pipelines to interconnect with their ultimate source or customers of the commodities they are transporting. Sempra LNG also relies on specialized ships to transport LNG to its facilities and on natural gas pipelines to transport natural gas for customers of the facilities. If transportation is disrupted, or if capacity is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver our products and services may be hindered. As a result, we may be responsible for damages incurred by our custom
ers, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative natural gas supplies at then-current spot market rates.

We cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices. Our hedging procedures may not work as planned.

To reduce financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, we may enter into contracts to hedge our known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments, inventories of natural gas and LNG, electric generation capacity, and natural gas storage and pipeline capacity. As part of this strategy, we may use forward contracts, physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and options. We do not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of our assets or our contract positions, and the coverage will vary over time. To the extent we have unhedged positions, or if our
 hedging strategies do not work as planned, fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Risk management procedures may not prevent losses.

Although we have in place risk management systems and control systems that use advanced methodologies to quantify and manage risk, these systems may not always prevent material losses. Risk management procedures may not always be followed as required by the companies or may not always work as planned. In addition, daily value-at-risk and loss limits are based on historic price movements. If prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices, the limits may not protect us from significant losses. As a result of these and other factors, there is no assurance that our risk management procedures will prevent losses that would ne
gatively affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Our international businesses are exposed to different local, regulatory and business risks and challenges, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

We have interests in electricity generation and transmission, natural gas distribution and transportation, and LNG terminal projects in Mexico and electricity and natural gas distribution businesses in Argentina, Chile and Peru, and we intend to significantly increase our interests in South America, as we discuss in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report. Developing infrastructure projects, owning energy assets, and operating businesses in foreign jurisdictions subject us to significant political, legal and financial
 risks that vary by country, including:

§

changes in foreign laws and regulations, including tax and environmental laws and regulations, and U.S. laws and regulations related to foreign operations

§

high rates of inflation

§

changes in government policies or personnel

§

trade restrictions

§

limitations on U.S. company ownership in foreign countries

§

permitting and regulatory compliance

§

changes in labor supply and labor relations

§

adverse rulings by foreign courts or tribunals, challenges to permits, difficulty in enforcing contractual rights, and unsettled property rights and titles in Mexico and other foreign jurisdictions

§

general political, economic and business conditions

Our international businesses also are subject to foreign currency risks. These risks arise from both volatility in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates 
and devaluations of foreign currencies. In such cases, an appreciation of the U.S. dollar against a local currency could reduce the amount of cash and income received from those foreign subsidiaries. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and inflation rates may result in increased taxes in foreign countries. While Sempra Pipelines & Storage believes that it has contracts and other measures in place to mitigate its most significant foreign currency exchange risks, some exposure is not fully mitigated.

We discuss litigation related to Sempra LNG's Energía Costa Azul LNG receipt terminal in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

Other Risks

Sempra Energy has substantial inve
stments and other obligations in businesses that it does not control or manage.

Sempra Energy is a partner with RBS in RBS Sempra Commodities, a commodities-marketing firm, which divested substantially all of its businesses and assets in 2010 and early 2011, as we discuss above under "Description of Business – Sempra Commodities." Our remaining investment in the partnership is $787 million at December 31, 2010. The realization of this investment, which is the undistributed portion of our share of the proceeds from the divestitures and related cash distributions, depends on the collection of accounts receivable by the partnership, as well as net margin that is expected to be collected as customers are transferred to the new owner of certain businesses sold. We have guaranteed various obligations of businesses previously owned and operated by RBS Sempra Commodities, as we discuss in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
in the Annual Report.

We also own a 25-percent interest in Rockies Express Pipeline LLC (Rockies Express), a joint venture which completed construction in 2009 of a 1,679-mile natural gas pipeline at an estimated cost of approximately $6.8 billion. Our investment in Rockies Express is $854 million at December 31, 2010. Rockies Express is controlled by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, which holds a 50-percent interest. We also have smaller investments in other entities that we do not control or manage, or in which we share control, and we continue to make such investments.

We may not control and have limited influence over these businesses and their management. In addition to the other risks inherent in these businesses, if their management were to fail to perform adequately or the other investors in the businesses were unable or otherwise failed to perform their obligations to provide capital and credit 
support for these businesses, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

On September 11, 2007, the Sempra Energy board of directors authorized the repurchase of Sempra Energy common stock provided that the amounts spent for such purpose do not exceed the greater of $2 billion or amounts spent to purchase no more than 40 million shares.

During 2008, we expended $1 billion to purchase a total of 18,416,241 shares. No shares were repurchased under this authorization during 2009.

In September 2010, we entered into a Collared Accelerated Share Acquisition Program with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, under which we prepaid $500 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. We discuss this program, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2011, in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.
