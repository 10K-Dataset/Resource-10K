                   MINNESOTA MINING AND MANUFACTURING COMPANY

                                  FORM 10-K

                      For the Year Ended December 31, 1995

                                   PART I

Item 1. Business.
Minnesota  Mining  and  Manufacturing Company was incorporated  in  1929
under the laws of the State of Delaware to continue operations, begun in
1902, of a Minnesota corporation of the same name.  As used herein,  the
term  "3M"  includes  Minnesota  Mining and  Manufacturing  Company  and
subsidiaries unless the context otherwise indicates.

Discontinued Operations

In  November 1995, the Board of Directors approved a plan to launch  the
company's data storage and imaging systems businesses as an independent,
publicly  owned company.  This transaction will be effected through  the
distribution  of  shares in a newly formed company to  3M  shareholders.
The  transaction  is expected to be tax free to 3M and to  shareholders.
The  distribution  is expected to occur around July 1,  1996.   3M  will
contribute  the  net  assets  of the data storage  and  imaging  systems
businesses to the newly formed company, reducing stockholders' equity by
an estimated $1 billion.

The spin-off company is a worldwide leader in the supply of products and
services  to  the  information processing industry, including  printing,
image capture and data storage.

Major   customers  include  graphic  arts  pre-press  shops,  commercial
printers, information systems OEMs, software developers, medical imaging
departments  in  health  care,  amateur  photographers,  and  users   of
removable digital data storage.

The  new  company  manufactures and markets a wide variety  of  products
meeting  the  information needs of these customers.   For  printers  and
graphic  arts  firms,  these  products include  graphic  arts  film  and
supplies;  lithographic  plates and related supplies;  duplicator  press
plates;  automated imaging systems and related supplies;  copy  and  art
preparation  materials;  pre-press proofing  systems;  carbonless  paper
sheets  for  business forms; and light sensitive dry silver  papers  for
electronically  recorded  images.  For medical imaging  users,  products
include  a  full line of diagnostic medical imaging films and  equipment
for X-ray and electronic imaging systems.  In both printing products and
medical  imaging,  the  new company also provides hardware  service  and
support.

In  addition,  the  spin-off company produces computer  diskettes;  data
cartridges  and tapes; CD-ROM and rewritable optical media; and  amateur
photographic film.

In   November   1995,   the  Board  of  Directors  also   approved   the
discontinuance of 3M's audio and video tape business within 12 months.

As  a  result  of  the  plans to spin-off the data storage  and  imaging
systems businesses and to discontinue the audio and video tape business,
the  company's consolidated financial statements and notes report  these
businesses   as  discontinued  operations.   Prior  years'  consolidated
financial statements and notes have been restated accordingly.

General

3M   is   an   integrated   enterprise  characterized   by   substantial
interdivision and intersector cooperation in research, manufacturing and
marketing   of   products  incorporating  similar  component   materials
manufactured  at common internal sources.  3M's business  has  developed
from  its  research  and technology in coating and  bonding  for  coated
abrasives,  the company's only product in its early years.  Coating  and
bonding  is  the  process of applying one material to another,  such  as
adhesives to a backing (pressure-sensitive tapes), abrasive granules  to
paper  or cloth (coated abrasives), ceramic coating to granular  mineral
(roofing   granules),   glass  beads  to  plastic  backing   (reflective
sheeting), and low-tack adhesives to paper (repositionable notes).

3M  is  among  the  leading manufacturers of products for  many  of  the
markets  it serves. In all cases, 3M products are subject to  direct  or
indirect  competition.  Most 3M products involve  expertise  in  product
development, manufacturing and marketing and are subject to  competition
with  products  manufactured  and sold  by  other  technically  oriented
companies.

At  December  31,  1995,  the company's continuing  operations  employed
70,687 people.

Business Segments

Information  relating to 3M's two business segments and 3M's  operations
in  various  geographic areas of the world is provided in the  Notes  to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Each  of 3M's two business sectors brings together common or related  3M
technologies,  providing  greater opportunity  for  the  development  of
products and services and efficient sharing of business strengths. These
sectors  have  worldwide  responsibility for virtually  all  3M  product
lines.   A  few miscellaneous and staff-sponsored products, still  under
development,  are not assigned to the sectors. Various corporate  assets
and corporate overhead expenses are also not assigned to the sectors.

Industrial  and Consumer Sector:  This sector is a leader  in  pressure-
sensitive  adhesives,  specialty tapes, coated and  nonwoven  abrasives,
specialty   chemicals,   electronic   and   electrical   products,   and
telecommunications   products.   The  sector  has  strong   distribution
channels  and  logistics  expertise.  This sector  participates  in  the
following markets:  Industrial Markets; Automotive and Chemical Markets;
Electro  and  Communications  Markets;  Consumer  Markets;  and   Office
Markets.

The  Industrial Markets businesses manufacture and market a wide variety
of   high-performance  and  general-use  pressure-sensitive  tapes   and
specialty   products.   Major  product  categories  include   industrial
application tapes made from a wide variety of materials, such  as  foil,
film,  vinyl and polyester; specialty tapes and adhesives for industrial
applications, including Scotch Brand VHB Brand Tapes, lithographic tapes,
joining systems, specialty additives, vibration control materials, liquid
adhesives, and reclosable fasteners; general-use tapes, such as masking,
box-sealing and filament; and labels and other materials for identifying
and  marking durable goods.  Other products include coated abrasives for
grinding, conditioning and finishing a wide range of surfaces; finishing
compounds; and flame-retardant materials.  These businesses also  market
products for maintaining and repairing vehicles.

The   Automotive  and  Chemical  Markets  businesses'  major  automotive
products  include body side-molding and trim; functional and  decorative
graphics;  corrosion-resistant and abrasion-resistant films;  tapes  for
attaching  nameplates,  trim and moldings; and fasteners  for  attaching
interior   panels  and  carpeting.   Major  chemical  products   include
protective  chemicals for furniture, fabrics and paper  products;  fire-
fighting  agents;  fluoroelastomers for  seals,  tubes  and  gaskets  in
engines;  engineering fluids; and high-performance fluids  used  in  the
manufacture of computer chips and for electronic cooling and lubricating
of computer hard disk drives.  Other products include natural and color-
coated  mineral  granules for asphalt shingles.  These  businesses  also
serve  as  a major resource for other 3M divisions, supplying  specialty
chemicals,  adhesives  and  films used in the  manufacture  of  many  3M
products.

The  Electro and Communications Markets businesses provide products  for
the  electronic, electrical, telecommunication, and visual communication
fields.  Electronic  and  electrical  products  include  packaging   and
interconnection  devices;  insulating  materials,  including   pressure-
sensitive tapes and resins; and related items.  These products are  used
extensively by manufacturers of electronic and electrical equipment,  as
well  as  in  the construction and maintenance segments of the  electric
utility, telephone and other industries. The telecommunications products
serve the world's telephone companies with a wide array of products  for
fiber-optic  and  copper-based telephone systems.   These  include  many
innovative   connecting,  closure  and  splicing  systems,   maintenance
products  and  test equipment.  The visual communication products  serve
the  world's  office and education markets with overhead projectors  and
transparency  films,  plus  equipment and materials  for  computer-based
presentations.

Major  products  in  the Consumer Markets and Office Markets  businesses
include Scotch Brand Tapes; Post-it Brand Note products, including memo pads,
labels,  stickers, pop-up notes and dispensers; home cleaning  products,
including Scotch-Brite Brand Scouring Products, O-Cel-O Brand Sponges and
Scotchgard Brand Fabric Protectors; energy control products, such as window
insulation kits; nonwoven abrasive materials for floor maintenance and
commercial cleaning; floor matting; and a wide range of do-it-yourself
products, including surface preparation and wood finishing materials, and
filters for furnaces and air conditioners.

Life  Sciences  Sector:  This sector contributes to  better  health  and
safety  for  people around the world. The Life Sciences  Sector's  major
technologies include pressure-sensitive adhesives, substrates, extrusion
and  coating, nonwoven materials, specialty polymers and resins, optical
systems,  drug-delivery  systems, and electro-mechanical  devices.   The
sector has strong distribution channels in all its major markets.   This
sector   participates  in  the  following  markets:  Medical   Products;
Pharmaceuticals,  Dental  and Personal Care Products;  and  Traffic  and
Personal Safety Products.

The  Medical  Products  businesses produce  a  broad  range  of  medical
supplies,  devices  and  equipment.   Medical  supplies  include  tapes,
dressings,  surgical drapes and masks, biological indicators, orthopedic
casting materials and electrodes.  Medical devices and equipment include
stethoscopes,  heart-lung machines, sterilization equipment,  blood  gas
monitors,  powered  orthopedic  instruments,  and  intravenous  infusion
pumps. These businesses also develop clinical information systems.

The  Pharmaceuticals, Dental and Personal Care Products businesses serve
the  pharmaceutical  and  dental markets, as well  as  manufacturers  of
disposable  diapers.  Pharmaceuticals include ethical  drugs  and  drug-
delivery  systems.  Among ethical pharmaceuticals are analgesics,  anti-
inflammatories  and  cardiovascular  and  respiratory  products.   Drug-
delivery  systems include metered-dose inhalers, as well as  transdermal
skin  patches  and  related components. Dental products  include  dental
restoratives,   adhesives,  impression  materials,   temporary   crowns,
infection  control products, and orthodontic brackets and wires.   These
businesses  also  produce a broad line of tape closures  for  disposable
diapers.

The  Traffic  and  Personal  Safety Products businesses  have  a  strong
position   in   the  following  markets:   traffic  control   materials,
commercial  graphics,  occupational health and safety,  and  out-of-home
advertising.  In traffic control materials, 3M is a worldwide leader  in
reflective  sheetings.   These materials  are  used  on  highway  signs,
vehicle  license plates, construction workzone devices, and  trucks  and
other  vehicles.  In commercial graphics, 3M supplies a  broad  line  of
films, inks and related products used to produce graphics for trucks and
signs.    Major   occupational  health  and  safety   products   include
maintenance-free  and  reusable respirators,  plus  personal  monitoring
systems.    Out-of-home   advertising  includes   outdoor   advertising,
advertising  displays  in  shopping centers, and  local  advertising  in
national  magazines.  These businesses also market a  variety  of  other
products, including spill-control sorbents, Thinsulate Brand and Lite Loft
Brand Insulations, traffic control devices, electronic surveillance products,
reflective  materials  for  personal safety, and  films  for  protection
against counterfeiting.

Distribution

3M products are sold directly to users and through numerous wholesalers,
retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in a wide variety of trades
in  many  countries  around  the world.  Management  believes  that  the
confidence of wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and  dealers
in  3M and its products, developed through long association with trained
marketing  and  sales representatives, has contributed significantly  to
3M's  position in the marketplace and to its growth.  3M has a total  of
292  sales  offices and distribution centers worldwide,  including  nine
major  branch offices located in principal cities throughout the  United
States.   3M operates 89 sales offices and distribution centers  in  the
United  States.   Internationally,  with  companies  in  more  than   60
countries, 3M has 203 sales offices and distribution centers.

Research, Patents and Raw Materials

Research  and product development constitute an important part  of  3M's
activities.  Products resulting from research and development have  been
a  major  driver of 3M's growth.  Spending for research and  development
activities  in continuing operations totaled $883 million, $828  million
and $794 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Corporate research laboratories support the research efforts of division
and  sector laboratories.  These corporate labs also engage in  research
not directly related to existing 3M product lines.  Most major operating
divisions,  as  well  as several of 3M's international  companies,  have
their  own  laboratories  for  improvement  of  existing  products   and
development  of new products. Engineering research staff groups  provide
specialized   services  in  instrumentation,  engineering  and   process
development.   3M  also  maintains  an  organization  for  technological
development not sponsored by other units of the company.

3M  is  the owner of many domestic and foreign patents derived primarily
from  its  own  research activities.  3M's business as a  whole  is  not
materially  dependent upon any one patent, license or  trade  secret  or
upon any group of related patents, licenses or trade secrets.

The  company  experienced  no significant or  unusual  problems  in  the
purchase  of  raw materials during 1995.  While 3M has successfully  met
its  raw  material  requirements, it is  impossible  to  predict  future
shortages or the impact such shortages would have.

Executive Officers

The  following is a list of the executive officers of 3M as of March  1,
1996,  their  present position, current age, the year first  elected  to
their  position and other positions held within 3M during the past  five
years.  All  of these persons have been employed full time by  3M  or  a
subsidiary of 3M for more than five years.  All officers are elected  by
the  Board  of Directors at its annual meeting, with vacancies  and  new
positions  filled  at  interim meetings.  No family relationships  exist
among  any of the executive officers named, nor is there any arrangement
or  understanding  pursuant  to which any  person  was  selected  as  an
officer.



Item 2. Properties.

3M's  general  offices, corporate research laboratories,  most  division
laboratories  and certain manufacturing facilities are  located  in  St.
Paul, Minnesota.  3M has 89 sales offices and distribution centers in 23
states  and  operates  67  plants in 23 states.   Internationally,  with
companies  in  more  than 60 countries, 3M has  203  sales  offices  and
distribution  centers.   The  company  operates  102  manufacturing  and
converting facilities in 42 countries.

3M owns substantially all of its physical properties.  3M leases certain
facilities financed through the issuance of industrial development bonds
in the original principal amount of $30 million.  3M has capitalized the
construction costs related to these facilities and recorded the  related
liabilities.   3M's  physical facilities are  highly  suitable  for  the
purposes for which they were designed.


Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

The company and certain of its subsidiaries are named as defendants in a
number  of  actions,  governmental  proceedings  and  claims,  including
environmental  proceedings,  and  products  liability  claims  involving
products now or formerly manufactured and sold by the company.  In  some
actions,  the claimants seek damages as well as other relief  which,  if
granted,  would  require  substantial  expenditures.   The  company  has
accrued certain liabilities which represent reasonable estimates of  its
probable  liabilities for these matters.  The company also has  recorded
receivables  for  the  probable  amount of  insurance  recoverable  with
respect to these matters.

Some  of  these  matters raise difficult and complex factual  and  legal
issues,  and  are  subject  to many uncertainties,  including,  but  not
limited  to, the facts and circumstances of each particular action,  the
jurisdiction   and  forum  in  which  each  action  is  proceeding   and
differences  in applicable law. Accordingly, the company is  not  always
able  to estimate the amount of future liabilities with respect to  such
matters.

There  can  be  no  certainty that the company may not ultimately  incur
charges,  whether  for  governmental proceedings  and  claims,  products
liability claims, environmental proceedings or other actions, in  excess
of presently established accruals.  While such future charges could have
a  material adverse impact on the company's net income in the  quarterly
period  in  which  they  are recorded, the company  believes  that  such
additional charges, if any, will not have a material adverse  effect  on
the  consolidated financial position or annual results of operations  of
the company.

Breast Implant Litigation

As  of  December  31, 1995, the company had been named as  a  defendant,
often  with  multiple  co-defendants, in 6,566 claims  and  lawsuits  in
various courts, all seeking damages for personal injuries from allegedly
defective  breast  implants.   These  claims  and  lawsuits  purport  to
represent  approximately  17,600 individual claimants.  It  is  not  yet
certain   how  many  of  these  lawsuits  and  claims  involve  products
manufactured and sold by the company, as opposed to other manufacturers.
The  company  entered the business of manufacturing breast  implants  in
1977  by  purchasing McGhan Medical Corporation.  In 1984,  the  company
sold  the  business to a corporation that was also named McGhan  Medical
Corporation.

The  typical  claim  or  lawsuit alleges that  the  individual's  breast
implants  caused  one or more of a wide variety of ailments,  including,
but not limited to, non-specific autoimmune disease, scleroderma, lupus,
rheumatoid  arthritis,  fibromyalgia, mixed connective  tissue  disease,
Sjogren's Syndrome, dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and chronic fatigue.

Plaintiffs  in  these cases typically seek monetary  damages,  often  in
unspecified  amounts, and also seek certain types of  equitable  relief,
including  requiring  the  company to fund  the  costs  associated  with
removal  of  the  breast  implants, to fund medical  research  into  the
ailments  allegedly caused by silicone gel breast implants and  to  fund
periodic medical checkups.

A  number of breast implant claims and lawsuits seek to impose liability
on  the  company under various theories for personal injuries  allegedly
caused  by breast implants manufactured and sold by manufacturers  other
than  the  company,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  McGhan  Medical
Corporation and manufacturers that are no longer in business or that are
insolvent,  whose  breast implants may or may  not  have  been  used  in
conjunction  with implants manufactured and sold by the company.   These
claims  raise many difficult and complex factual and legal  issues  that
are subject to many uncertainties, including the facts and circumstances
of  each  particular  claim, the jurisdiction  in  which  each  suit  is
brought, differences in applicable law and insurance coverage.

A  number  of breast implant lawsuits seek to recover punitive  damages.
Any such punitive damages that may be awarded against the company may or
may  not be covered by some insurance policies depending on the language
of the insurance policy, applicable law and agreements with insurers.

In  addition to the individual suits against the company, a class action
on   behalf  of  all  women  with  breast  implants  filed  against  all
manufacturers of such implants has been conditionally certified  and  is
pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Alabama  (the "Court")(DANTE, ET AL., V. DOW CORNING, ET AL.,  U.S.D.C.,
N.  Dist.,  Ala., 92-2589; part of IN RE:  SILICONE GEL  BREAST  IMPLANT
PRODUCT  LIABILITY  LITIGATION,  U.S.D.C.,  N.  Dist.  Ala.,  MDL   926,
U.S.D.C.,  N. Dist. Ala., CV 92-P-10000-S; now held in abeyance  pending
settlement proceedings in the settlement class action LINDSEY,  ET  AL.,
V.  DOW CORNING CORPORATION, ET AL., U.S.D.C., N. Dist., Ala., CV  94-P-
11558-S). Class actions, some of which have been certified, are  pending
in various state courts, including, among others, Louisiana, Florida and
Illinois, and in the British Columbia courts in Canada.

The  company has also been served with a purported class action  brought
on behalf of children allegedly exposed to silicone in utero and through
breast milk.  (FEUER, ET AL., V. MCGHAN, ET AL., U.S.D.C., E. Dist.  NY,
93-0146.)  The suit names all breast implant manufacturers as defendants
and seeks to establish a medical monitoring fund.

On  December  22,  1995,  the  Court approved  a  revised  class  action
settlement program for resolution of claims seeking damages for personal
injuries   from  allegedly  defective  breast  implants  (the   "Revised
Settlement Program").  The Revised Settlement Program is a revision of a
previous  settlement pursuant to a Breast Implant Litigation  Settlement
Agreement  (the "Settlement Agreement") reached on April  8,  1994,  and
approved by the Court on September 1, 1994.

Under  the  terms of the previous Settlement Agreement, the company  and
other  defendants agreed to make total contributions in  the  amount  of
$4.25  billion,  including  the company's  maximum  commitment  of  $325
million,  which  was  to be paid into a court-administered  fund  within
three  years from the date that the final order ratifying the Settlement
Agreement  was entered and after appeals had been exhausted. On  May  1,
1995,  the  Court stated that preliminary information from claims  filed
prior  to  the September 1994 deadline for current claims  had  led  the
Court  to believe that the total amount of current claims likely  to  be
approved  would  substantially  exceed the  portion  of  the  Settlement
Agreement   allocated  to  current  claims.   The  Settlement  Agreement
provided,  in  that case, for a reduction in the amount to  be  paid  to
individual  claimants,  but first obligated the parties  to  attempt  to
adjust the Settlement Agreement. After the parties were unable to  reach
agreement,  the  Court  approved  the  Revised  Settlement  Program  for
presentation to eligible class members.

The  Court has ordered that, beginning after November 30, 1995,  members
of  the  plaintiff  class  will  be able to  choose  whether  they  will
participate  in  the Revised Settlement Program or will opt  out,  which
would  then  allow  them  to  proceed with separate  products  liability
actions.

The Revised Settlement Program includes only domestic class members, and
only  class  members with implants manufactured by certain  manufacturer
defendants,  including the company and McGhan Medical  Corporation.  The
company's  obligations under the Revised Settlement Program are  limited
to  eligible claimants with implants manufactured by the company or  its
predecessors  ("3M  implants") or manufactured only  by  McGhan  Medical
Corporation  after its divestiture from the company on  August  3,  1984
("Post 8/84 McGhan implants"). With respect to claimants with only  Post
8/84  McGhan  implants (or only Post 8/84 McGhan implants  plus  certain
other  manufacturers' implants), the benefits may be more  limited  than
for  claimants  with  3M implants.  Such benefits  are  payable  by  the
company, Union Carbide Corporation and McGhan Medical Corporation.

In  general,  the  amounts payable to individual current  claimants  (as
defined in the Court's order) under the Revised Settlement Program,  and
the  company's obligations to make those payments, will not be  affected
by  the  number  of  class members electing to opt out  of  the  Revised
Settlement  Program or the number of class members making  claims  under
the Revised Settlement Program.  The Revised Settlement Program provides
for  two  compensation  options, in addition  to  certain  miscellaneous
benefits, for current claimants with 3M implants.

Under  the  first option, denominated as Fixed Amount Benefits,  current
claimants  with 3M implants who satisfy disease criteria established  in
the  prior Settlement Agreement will receive amounts ranging from $5,000
to  $100,000, depending on disease severity or disability level, whether
the  claimant can establish that the implants have ruptured, and whether
the  claimant also has had implants manufactured by Dow Corning.   Under
the  second option, denominated as Long-Term Benefits, current claimants
with  3M  implants  who  satisfy more restrictive disease  and  severity
criteria  specified  under the Revised Settlement  Program  can  receive
benefits ranging from $37,500 to $250,000.

In  addition, current claimants with 3M implants are eligible for (a)  a
one-time payment of $3,000 upon removal of 3M implants during the course
of  the  class settlement, and (b) an advance payment of $5,000  against
the  above referenced benefits upon proof of having 3M implants and upon
waiving  or not timely exercising the right to opt out from the  Revised
Settlement  Program.   Current claimants  with  only  Post  8/84  McGhan
implants  (or  only  Post  8/84  McGhan  implants  plus  certain   other
manufacturers'  implants) are eligible only for  benefits  ranging  from
$10,000 to $50,000.

Eligible participants with 3M implants, who did not file current  claims
but  are  able  to  satisfy the more restrictive  disease  and  severity
criteria during an ongoing period of 15 years, will be eligible for  the
Long-Term  Benefits,  subject  to  certain  funding  limitations.   Such
participants also will be eligible for an advance payment of $1,000 upon
proof  of  having 3M implants and upon waiving or not timely  exercising
the  right  to  opt  out from the Revised Settlement  Program.   Benefit
levels  for  eligible participants, who are not current claimants,  with
only  Post 8/84 McGhan implants (or only Post 8/84 McGhan implants  plus
certain other manufacturers' implants) again will range from $10,000  to
$50,000.

The  company's  obligations  to  fund Long-Term  Benefits  for  eligible
claimants with 3M implants, and its obligations to fund any benefits for
claimants with only Post 8/84 McGhan implants, are suspended if  certain
provisions  of the Revised Settlement Program are challenged  on  appeal
and  will  be  canceled if any of those provisions  are  disapproved  on
appeal.   In  that event, the other benefits provided under the  Revised
Settlement  Program  would still be payable  to  any  claimant  with  3M
implants who elected to participate in the program.

Because  it  is uncertain how many plaintiffs will choose to participate
in  the  Revised Settlement Program, or what disease criteria they  will
satisfy  and what options they will choose, the total amount and  timing
of  the  company's  prospective payments under  the  Revised  Settlement
Program  cannot be determined with precision at this time.   In  January
1996, the company paid $130 million into a court administered fund as an
initial reserve against costs of claims payable by the company under the
Revised Settlement Program.

In  the first quarter of 1994, the company took a pre-tax charge of  $35
million ($22 million after tax) in recognition of its then best estimate
of its probable liabilities and associated expenses, net of the probable
amount  of  insurance  recoverable from its  carriers.   In  the  fourth
quarter  of  1995,  the company increased its estimate  of  the  minimum
probable  liabilities  and  associated expenses  to  approximately  $885
million. This amount represents the company's best estimate of the  cost
of  the  Revised  Settlement Program and the cost of  resolving  opt-out
claims.  After  subtracting payments of $62 million  in  1994  and  $143
million  in  1995 for defense costs and settlements with  litigants  and
claimants, the company, as of December 31, 1995, had accrued liabilities
of $678 million.

The  company  has  substantial  primary and  excess  products  liability
occurrence   insurance  coverage  and  claims-made  products   liability
insurance coverage, which it believes provide coverage for substantially
all of its current exposure for breast implant claims and defense costs.
Most insurers have alleged reservations of rights to deny all or part of
the coverage for differing reasons, including each insurer's obligations
in  relation  to  the other insurers and which claims trigger  both  the
various  occurrence  and claims-made insurance policies.  Some  insurers
have  resolved  and paid or committed to their policy  obligations.  The
company  believes  that  the  failure of many  insurers  to  voluntarily
perform  as  promised subjects them to the company's claims  for  excess
liability  and  damages for breach of the insurers' obligation  of  good
faith.   Based on inappropriate non-performance by insurers, it  is  the
opinion of counsel that insurers have waived all policy term provisions.

On  September  22,  1994,  three  excess  coverage  occurrence  insurers
initiated in the courts of the State of Minnesota a declaratory judgment
action  against  the  company  and numerous insurance  carriers  seeking
adjudication  of certain coverage issues and allocation among  insurers.
On  December  9,  1994,  the company initiated  an  action  against  its
occurrence insurers in the Texas State Court in and for Harrison County,
seeking  a  determination of responsibility among the company's  various
occurrence  insurers having applicable coverages.  Texas  is  the  state
with the most implant claims.  This action has since been removed to the
U.S.  District  Court,  Eastern District of Texas,  and  stayed  pending
resolution of the litigation in the Minnesota courts.

The  insurers  that  are parties to these actions generally  acknowledge
that  they issued products liability insurance to the company  and  that
breast  implant  claims  are  products  liability  claims.  A  trial  is
scheduled  in  Minnesota  for March 4, 1996, to  resolve  the  company's
insurance  coverage  and  the  financial  responsibility  of  occurrence
insurers  for  breast  implant  claims  and  defense  costs.  Settlement
discussions  continue  with  most insurers  through  court  ordered  and
supervised discussions.

The  occurrence insurers that are parties to the litigation in Minnesota
filed  more than thirty motions for summary judgment or partial  summary
judgment  in  mid-October  1995. The insurers,  through  these  motions,
attempt to shift all or a portion of the responsibility for those claims
that  the  company  believes fall within the period of  occurrence-based
coverage (before 1986) into the period of claims-made coverage (from and
after  1986). The trial court denied the insurers' motions, ruling  that
the  key issues of "trigger" and allocation raised in these motions will
be  resolved at trial. If the occurrence insurers prevail at trial,  the
company  could be effectively deprived of significant insurance coverage
for breast implant claims.

The  company believes it will prevail in this insurance litigation.  The
company's  belief  is  based on an analysis of its  insurance  policies,
court  decisions on similar issues, reimbursement by insurers for  these
types  of  claims  and  consultation  with  outside  counsel  expert  in
insurance coverage matters.

The  company  had accrued receivables for insurance recoveries  of  $800
million  as of December 31, 1995.  There are various factors that  could
affect  the  timing  and  amount of proceeds to be  received  under  the
company's  various  insurance  policies, including  (i)  the  timing  of
payments  made  in settlement of claims, (ii) the outcome of  occurrence
insurance  litigation  in  the  courts of  Minnesota  and  Texas,  (iii)
potential  arbitration with claims-made insurers,  and  (iv)  delays  in
payment by insurers.  Settlements are currently developing through court-
ordered  and supervised discussions.  However, there can be no  absolute
assurance  that  the company will collect all amounts accrued  as  being
probable of recovery from its insurers.

The  company's current estimate of the probable liabilities,  associated
expenses and probable insurance recoveries related to the breast implant
claims  is  based on the facts and circumstances existing at this  time.
New developments may occur that could affect the company's estimates  of
probable  liabilities (including associated expenses) and  the  probable
amount of insurance recoveries.  These developments include, but are not
limited to, (i) the number of plaintiffs who elect to opt out and pursue
individual claims against the company, (ii) the success of and costs  to
the  company  in  defending  such individual  claims,  including  claims
involving breast implants not manufactured or sold by the company, (iii)
the  outcome  of the occurrence insurance litigation in  the  courts  of
Minnesota  and  Texas,  (iv) the outcome of potential  arbitration  with
claims-made insurers, and (v) the availability of coverage with  respect
to  certain of the types of claims or remedies to which the company  may
be subject.

The  company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments
on  the  current estimate of probable liabilities (including  associated
expenses) and the probable amount of insurance recoveries.  Accordingly,
the  company  is  not able to estimate its potential future  liabilities
beyond   the   current  estimate  of  probable  liabilities.    As   new
developments occur, the estimates may be revised, or additional  charges
may  be  necessary  to reflect the impact of these developments  on  the
costs  to the company of resolving breast implant litigation and claims.
While  such revisions or additional future charges could have a material
adverse  impact on the company's net income in the quarterly  period  in
which  they  are recorded, the company believes that such  revisions  or
additional charges, if any, will not have a material adverse  effect  on
the  consolidated financial position or annual results of operations  of
the company.

The  company  conducts ongoing reviews, assisted by outside counsel,  to
determine the adequacy and extent of insurance coverage provided by  its
occurrence  and  claims-made insurers. The company  believes,  based  on
these  ongoing  reviews and the bases described in the fourth  preceding
paragraph,  that  the collectible coverage provided  by  its  applicable
insurance  policies  is  sufficient to cover substantially  all  of  its
current exposure for breast implant claims and defense costs.  Based  on
the  availability of this insurance coverage, the company believes  that
its  uninsured financial exposure has not materially changed  since  the
first  quarter  of  1994,  and therefore, no recognition  of  additional
charges had been made as of year-end 1995.

Environmental Matters

The company is also involved in a number of environmental proceedings by
governmental  agencies asserting liability for past waste  disposal  and
other   alleged  environmental  damage.  The  company  conducts  ongoing
investigations,  assisted  by environmental  consultants,  to  determine
accruals  for  the  probable,  estimable  costs  of  remediation.    The
remediation accruals are reviewed each quarter and changes are  made  as
appropriate.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and
Results of Operations.

Operating Results

On  November 14, 1995, 3M announced that it intends to launch  its  data
storage and imaging systems businesses as an independent, publicly owned
company.  3M also announced that it will discontinue its audio and video
tape  business within 12 months.  As a result of these actions, the data
storage,  imaging  systems,  and audio and  video  tape  businesses  are
presented as discontinued operations within the financial statements and
notes  for  all  periods presented.  The following discussion  is  on  a
continuing operations basis.

Net  sales in 1995 rose 10.8 percent to $13.460 billion.  This  followed
increases of 9.9 percent in 1994 and 2.2 percent in 1993.

Internationally, sales increased about 17 percent to $7.253 billion.   
Sales  in  the United States were $6.207 billion, up more than 4  percent
from 1994.

__________________________________________________________________________

Internationally, volume rose 10 percent, matching the gain  achieved  in
1994.   3M  companies in all major geographic areas abroad posted  solid
volume  growth. In the United States, volume growth moderated  in  1995,
reflecting the slowdown in the U.S. economy.

Selling  prices, which were essentially flat in 1994, increased about  2
percent  in  1995.   These increases helped offset higher  raw  material
costs.

Changes  in  currency exchange rates increased sales about 2 percent  in
1995, following an increase of about 1 percent the previous year.

Cost  of  goods sold was 57.3 percent of sales, up one percentage  point
from  1994, but down slightly from 1993.  The increase was due to a  7.5
percent rise in raw material costs, the largest in many years.  In 1994,
cost  of  goods  sold  benefited  from solid  worldwide  volume  growth,
productivity  gains  and  cost-control  efforts.   Cost  of  goods  sold
includes   manufacturing,  research  and  development,  and  engineering
expenses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were 25.6 percent of sales,
the  lowest  level  in  more than five years.  This  spending  reflected
strong emphasis on cost control and productivity improvement.  In  1994,
the  rate  of  SG&A  spending increased slightly due to  investments  to
sustain rapid growth in developing countries.

Employment  increased  by  about 845 people worldwide  in  1995.   These
additions   were  made  to  help  support  rapid  growth  in  developing
countries.   Sales  per  employee rose more  than  7  percent  in  local
currencies.  This followed an 8 percent gain in 1994.

During the fourth quarter of 1995, 3M recorded one-time, pre-tax charges
of  $653 million related to the spin-off of the data storage and imaging
systems  businesses  and  the phase-out of  the  audio  and  video  tape
business.   Of  this  amount, $79 million related  to  restructuring  in
continuing  operations  and  is  shown  on  a  separate  line   of   the
Consolidated  Statement  of Income titled "Restructuring  charge."   The
remainder  related to discontinued operations. The restructuring  charge
and  discontinued operations are discussed more fully in  the  Notes  to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Operating  income  totaled $2.221 billion, up  6.0  percent  from  1994.
Excluding  the  one-time  charge, operating  income  rose  9.8  percent.
Internationally,  operating income rose 22 percent  and  profit  margins
were  up eight-tenths of a percentage point.  International results were
helped  by  solid volume growth, productivity improvement  and  positive
currency effects.

In  the  United States, operating income was down about 11  percent  and
profit  margins  declined by 2.5 percentage points.  U.S.  results  were
affected  by  higher raw material costs, modest volume  growth  and  the
restructuring charge.

In 1994, operating income rose 16.6 percent, with the gain well-balanced
between U.S. and international operations.

The  company estimates that currency changes increased operating  income
by $79 million in 1995 and by $17 million in 1994.

________________________________________________________________________

Interest expense was $102 million, compared with $70 million in 1994 and
$39 million in 1993.  The increases in both 1995 and 1994 were due to  a
planned increase in debt and higher interest rates.

Investment  and other income was $49 million, compared with $21  million
in  1994  and  $94  million in 1993.  The increase in 1995  was  due  to
improved investment results, including higher interest income.  In 1993,
investment and other income included $36 million from the resolution  of
several  income  tax claims. It also benefited from improved  investment
results and other items, many of which were of a nonrecurring nature.

During  the first quarter of 1994, 3M recorded a pre-tax charge  of  $35
million  related to breast implant litigation.  Other income and expense
in  1994 includes this amount, which is shown on a separate line of  the
Consolidated Statement of Income titled "Implant litigation - net."

The  effective  tax rate was 36.2 percent of pre-tax income,  about  the
same as in 1994 and 1993.

Income  from continuing operations totaled $1.306 billion, or $3.11  per
share  ($1.358  billion, or $3.23 a share, excluding  the  restructuring
charge).  Earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding  both
the  1995  restructuring charge and the 1994 implant litigation  charge,
increased 11.4 percent in 1995.

Net  income,  before one-time 1995 charges, totaled $1.390  billion,  or
$3.31 a share, up 5.1 percent from $1.322 billion, or $3.13 a share,  in
1994.  Including these charges, net income was $976 million, or $2.32  a
share, compared with $1.322 billion, or $3.13 a share, in 1994.

Changes  in  the  value of the U.S. dollar increased net  income  by  an
estimated  $51 million, or 12 cents a share, in 1995.  Currency  effects
increased income from continuing operations by an estimated 10  cents  a
share.   Changes  in the value of the U.S. dollar had little  impact  in
1994, and reduced net income by an estimated $62 million, or 14 cents  a
share,  in  1993.   These  estimates include the effect  of  translating
profits  from  local currencies into U.S. dollars, the  costs  in  local
currencies  of  transferring goods between the  parent  company  in  the
United  States  and international companies, and transaction  gains  and
losses in countries not considered to be highly inflationary.

Return  on  average stockholders' equity was 19.2 percent, up from  18.2
percent  in 1994.  Adjusting income from continuing operations  for  the
restructuring   charge  and  equity  for  the  impact  of   discontinued
operations,  return on equity was over 24 percent in  1995.   Return  on
capital  employed  was  23.4  percent.   Adjusting  for  the  continuing
operations  restructuring charge, return on capital  employed  was  24.3
percent,  up  from 23.6 percent in 1994.  In 1995, about 27  percent  of
sales came from products introduced within the past four years, compared
with about 26 percent in 1994.

Over the longer term, 3M expects to meet its aggressive financial goals.
These  include  annual growth in earnings per share  of  10  percent  or
better,  on average; return on stockholders' equity of 20 to 25 percent;
return  on  capital employed of 27 percent or better; and  at  least  30
percent of sales from products introduced within the past four years.

Performance by Business Sector

Industrial and Consumer Sector:
Despite  slowing in the U.S. economy and sharp increases in raw material
costs  worldwide,  this sector turned in another strong  performance  in
1995.   Sales were up 10.4 percent to $8.365 billion.  Operating  income
increased 9.6 percent to $1.335 billion.  Internationally, the  sector's
major businesses posted strong sales gains, with even greater growth  in
operating income.

This  sector  develops, manufactures and markets innovative,  high-value
products  for home, offices and industrial customers around  the  world.
This  sector  has achieved a strong position in most of the  markets  it
serves  by  leveraging 3M strengths in more than two dozen technologies,
building  on  strong  brands, expanding its international  presence  and
increasing its manufacturing efficiency.

Life Sciences Sector:
In  1995,  sales  increased 11.4 percent to $5.018  billion.   Operating
income also increased 11.4 percent, to $1.065 billion.  Operating income
was  21.2 percent of sales.  Profit margins exceeded 20 percent for  the
12th year in a row.

This  sector  contributes to better health and safety for people  around
the  world.   In  the health care market, this sector  is  a  leader  in
medical-surgical  supplies, clinical information systems,  drug-delivery
technologies and dental products.  In the safety area, this sector is  a
global leader in reflective materials for traffic safety and respirators
for  worker  protection.  This sector also is a leader in closure  tapes
for  disposable diapers, graphics for trucks and signs, and  out-of-home
advertising.

Performance by Geographic Area

United States
In  the  United  States, volume rose about 3 percent and selling  prices
increased  about 1 percent, for a total sales gain of about  4  percent.
Operating  profit margins decreased by about 2.5 percentage points  from
1994.   Adjusting for the restructuring charge, operating profit margins
decreased  by about 1.4 percentage points.  U.S. results were held  back
by  higher raw material costs and modest volume growth.  Employment  was
basically unchanged at year-end 1995 compared with the end of 1994.

Europe and Middle East
Sales grew about 19 percent in 1995.  Unit sales rose 8 percent, selling
prices  were up more than 1 percent, and translation increased sales  by
almost 10 percent.  Profits, aided by solid productivity gains, rose  38
percent.   Sales  per employee in local currencies increased  nearly  10
percent.

Through  3M's  European Business Centers, which direct the  development,
manufacture and sale of 3M products across the continent, the company is
meeting  customer  needs better, faster and more efficiently.   European
results were also helped by rapid growth in emerging economies.   Volume
gains ranging from 30 percent to 50 percent were posted in Hungary,  the
Czech Republic, Turkey and Poland.

Asia Pacific
In  the Asia Pacific area, sales increased about 16 percent.  Unit sales
increased about 13 percent.  In Japan, unit sales rose about 10 percent,
helped  by  a  strong flow of new products.  Nearly 13 percent  of  3M's
sales came from products introduced during 1995 and more than 40 percent
of sales in Japan came from products new within the past four years.  In
Asia  outside  Japan, volume grew about 20 percent.  Solid volume  gains
were  posted  throughout the region, in which 3M has more than  a  dozen
companies.

To   sustain  rapid  growth  in  Asia,  3M  continues  to  add  to   its
capabilities.   The  company  is expanding manufacturing  operations  in
China, Taiwan and Malaysia, and enlarging its technical support facility
in Singapore.  A new distribution center is being built in Korea.






Canada, Latin America and Africa
In  Canada,  the company posted good sales and profit growth,  paced  by
industrial  businesses.  The company is continuing  to  build  upon  two
platforms   for   growth.    These  include  an  efficient,   responsive
organization   to   serve  Canadian  customers,  and   a   manufacturing
organization to leverage 3M resources on a North American and  worldwide
basis.

In  Latin  America, the company achieved healthy growth again  in  1995,
despite  the sharp decline in economic activity in Mexico.   Unit  sales
increased more than 10 percent, with strong gains in most countries.  In
Brazil,  3M's  largest company in Latin America, volume  increased  more
than  20  percent.   In  Mexico, the company did  an  excellent  job  of
minimizing  the  impact  of currency devaluation  and  overall  economic
weakness.

In Africa, the company also showed solid growth.  Volume in South Africa
was  up  more  than  10  percent.  Sales there are benefiting  from  the
lifting  of  trade  sanctions, which has stimulated the  growth  of  the
economy, including exports to neighboring countries.

Financial Position

3M's  financial  condition remained strong in 1995.  The  company's  key
inventory  index was 3.9 months, down about 10 percent from the  end  of
1994.   The  accounts receivable index was 64 days, down two  days  from
1994.   The  current  ratio was 1.7, unchanged from  the  end  of  1994.
Various assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt,  can
fluctuate  significantly on a month-to-month basis depending  on  short-
term liquidity needs.

The  company recorded a current liability of $379 million in the  fourth
quarter  of  1995.   Of  this  amount,  $79  million  related   to   the
restructuring in continuing operations.  The remainder was for severance
and  other payments relating to discontinued operations. As of  December
31,  1995,  no  employee separations had occurred and no  cash  payments
related to employee separations had been made.

Total  debt was $2.025 billion, up from $1.948 billion in 1994.  Of  the
debt  outstanding at the end of 1995, $441 million was  a  guarantee  of
debt of the 3M Employee Stock Ownership Plan.  Total debt was 29 percent
of  stockholders' equity, the same as in 1994.  The company's borrowings
continued  to maintain triple-A long-term ratings.  At the time  of  the
spin-off   of   the   data  storage  and  imaging  systems   businesses,
stockholders'  equity  will  be reduced  by  an  estimated  $1  billion,
essentially representing the distribution of the net assets of the spin-
off   businesses.   The  company  is  reviewing  the  capital  structure
requirements  of the spin-off company.  This determination  will  affect
the debt levels of both companies.

Legal proceedings are discussed in the legal proceedings section in Part
I,  Item  3,  of  this  Form 10-K.  There can be no certainty  that  the
company  may  not  ultimately incur charges,  whether  for  governmental
proceedings   and  claims,  products  liability  claims,   environmental
proceedings  or  other  actions,  in  excess  of  presently  established
accruals.   While  such  future charges could have  a  material  adverse
impact on the company's net income in the quarterly period in which they
are recorded, the company believes that such additional charges, if any,
will  not  have a material adverse effect on the consolidated  financial
position or annual results of operations of the company.



Liquidity

3M  meets  its  cash  requirements primarily from operating  activities.
During  1995, cash flows provided by operating activities of  continuing
operations  totaled  $1.935 billion, an increase of  $280  million  from
1994.   Cash flows from continuing operations more than covered  capital
expenditures and dividend payments of $1.878 billion.  The  increase  in
cash  provided  from continuing operations in 1995 was  helped  by  good
asset  management.  In 1994, working capital requirements increased  due
to higher sales growth, affecting cash provided by operating activities.

Timing differences between payment of implant liabilities and receipt of
related  insurance  recoveries could affect the  cash  flows  of  future
periods.  The  amount  and  timing  of prospective  payments  cannot  be
determined  with precision at this time.  In January 1996,  the  company
paid  $130 million into a court administered fund as an initial  reserve
against  costs  of  claims  payable by the company  under  the  "Revised
Settlement Program," which is discussed in the legal proceedings section
in Part I, Item 3, of this Form 10-K.  As a result of actions associated
with  discontinued operations and restructuring, the company  will  have
unusually  high  severance payments in 1996.   3M  believes  that  these
timing  differences  and  higher severance  payments  will  not  have  a
material  adverse  effect  on  the consolidated  financial  position  or
liquidity of the company.

Capital  spending  increased  11.9  percent  to  $1.088  billion.   This
followed  an  increase  of 8.2 percent in 1994.  These  investments  are
helping  to  meet  growing global demand for 3M  products  and  increase
manufacturing efficiency.

Stockholder  dividends increased 6.8 percent to $1.88 a share  in  1995.
Cash dividend payments totaled $790 million.  3M has paid dividends  for
80 consecutive years.

On  February  12, 1996, the 3M Board of Directors declared  a  quarterly
dividend  on  3M  common  stock of 47 cents  a  share,  maintaining  the
dividend at the existing quarterly rate.  The Board will reconsider  the
dividend later this year, and expects to continue 3M's record of  annual
dividend increases.  The Board also authorized the repurchase of up to six
million  of  the company's shares.  This share repurchase  authorization
runs  through  February 10, 1997.  The company purchased more  than  six
million shares under a previous authorization.

Repurchases  of  3M common stock totaled $351 million in 1995,  compared
with  $689  million in 1994 and $706 million in 1993.  Repurchases  were
made  to  support employee stock purchase plans and for other  corporate
purposes.

The  company's strong credit rating provides ready and ample  access  to
funds in global capital markets.  3M maintains a shelf registration with
the  Securities and Exchange Commission that provides the means to offer
medium-term  notes  not to exceed $601 million.  At December  31,  1995,
$402 million was available for future financial needs.

On January 10, 1995, the company completed a two-year, $200 million 7.75
percent  Eurobond offering.  The company entered into an  interest  rate
swap  that  resulted  in an all-in borrowing cost equal  to  the  30-day
commercial paper rate, less 30 basis points, for two years.





Future Outlook
As  a  result  of  the restructuring, 3M will be better  positioned  for
profitable growth.  The company will strive to meet its financial  goals
by  building  on  five  key strengths: market leadership,  technological
innovation, customer focus, global reach and employee initiative.  These
strengths have always been key elements of 3M's success, but their value
will  become even more pronounced in a faster, stronger and more focused
3M.

3M expects solid sales and earnings growth in 1996.  The company expects
to  benefit  from a strong flow of new products, further expansion  into
international  markets, an intense focus on customer  satisfaction,  and
ongoing  efforts  to reduce costs and improve productivity.   Sales  per
employee are expected to increase about 8 percent in 1996.

While volume, productivity and selling prices are expected to help  1996
results, currency effects may moderate profit growth.  Based on  current
exchange rates, currency could reduce 1996 earnings by about 15 cents  a
share. Raw material costs, which held back earnings growth in 1995,  are
expected  to  level  off.  The company expects  to  show  its  strongest
earning gains in the second half of the year.

Capital  spending,  which  was up 12 percent in  1995,  is  expected  to
increase about 10 percent in 1996.

The  company's tax rate is expected to be similar to 1995, at just  over
36 percent.

               Report of Independent Accountants


To the Stockholders of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company:

We  have  audited  the  consolidated financial statements  of  Minnesota
Mining and Manufacturing Company and Subsidiaries as listed in Item 8 of
this Form 10-K. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
company's  management. Our responsibility is to express  an  opinion  on
these financial statements based on our audits.

We  conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform  the  audit
to  obtain  reasonable assurance about whether the financial  statements
are  free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining,  on  a
test  basis,  evidence  supporting the amounts and  disclosures  in  the
financial  statements.  An audit also includes assessing the  accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating  the  overall financial statement presentation.   We  believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In  our  opinion,  the financial statements referred  to  above  present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Minnesota  Mining  and  Manufacturing Company  and  Subsidiaries  as  of
December  31,  1995  and  1994, and the consolidated  results  of  their
operations  and  their cash flows for each of the  three  years  in  the
period  ended  December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally  accepted
accounting principles.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Accounting Policies
Consolidation:    All   significant   subsidiaries   are   consolidated.
Unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates are included  on  the  equity
basis.

Foreign Currency Translation:  Local currencies are generally considered
the functional currencies outside the United States, except in countries
treated  as  highly inflationary.  Assets and liabilities for operations
in  local  currency  environments are translated  at  year-end  exchange
rates.   Income  and expense items are translated at  average  rates  of
exchange   prevailing   during   the   year.    Cumulative   translation
adjustments,  recorded as a component of stockholders'  equity,  reduced
stockholders' equity by $102 million, $163 million and $331  million  at
December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

For  operations  in  countries treated as highly  inflationary,  certain
financial statement amounts are translated at historical exchange rates,
with  all  other assets and liabilities translated at year-end  exchange
rates.   These translation adjustments are reflected in the  results  of
operations.   They  decreased net income by  $4  million  in  1995,  $20
million in 1994 and by $12 million in 1993.

Use of Estimates:  The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with  generally  accepted accounting principles requires  management  to
make  estimates  and  assumptions that affect the  reported  amounts  of
assets  and  liabilities  and the disclosure of  contingent  assets  and
liabilities  at  the date of the financial statements and  the  reported
amounts  of  revenues and expenses during the reporting period.   Actual
results could differ from these estimates.

Cash  and Cash Equivalents:  Cash and cash equivalents consist  of  cash
and  temporary investments with maturities of three months or less  when
purchased.

Other   Securities  and  Investments:   Other  securities   consist   of
marketable  securities and interest-bearing bank  deposits  with  varied
maturity dates.  These securities are employed in the company's banking,
captive insurance and cash management operations.  Investments primarily
include   debt  securities  held  by  captive  insurance   and   banking
operations, individual and commercial loans receivable held  by  banking
operations,  the  cash surrender value of life insurance  policies,  and

Unrealized gains and losses relating to other securities and investments
classified  as  available-for-sale  are  included  as  a  component   of
stockholders' equity.  Realized gains and losses in 1995 and  1994  were
not material.

Inventories:   Inventories are stated at lower of cost or  market,  with
cost generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.

Other   Assets:    Other   assets  include  goodwill,   patents,   other
intangibles,  product  and other insurance claims,  deferred  taxes  and
other  noncurrent  assets.  Intangible assets are periodically  reviewed
for  impairment  based on an assessment of future operations  to  ensure
that they are appropriately valued. Goodwill is generally amortized on a
straight-line basis over 10 years.  Other intangible items are amortized
on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives.

In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
No.  121,  "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  and  for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of."  This statement requires that long-
lived  assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or  changes  in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may  not  be
recoverable.  If the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash  flows
is  less  than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment  loss  is
recognized.   The impact of this statement on the company is immaterial.
The company will adopt this standard effective January 1, 1996.

Deferred Income Taxes:  Deferred income taxes arise from differences  in
bases between tax reporting and financial reporting.

Revenue  Recognition:  Revenue is recognized upon shipment of  goods  to
customers  and upon performance of services.  The company sells  a  wide
range  of  products to a diversified base of customers around the  world
and,  therefore, believes there is no material concentration  of  credit
risk.

Depreciation:   Depreciation  of  property,  plant  and   equipment   is
generally  computed on a straight-line basis over the  estimated  useful
lives of these assets.

Research and Development:  Research and development costs are charged to
operations as incurred and totaled $883 million in 1995, $828 million in
1994 and $794 million in 1993.

Advertising   Costs:   Advertising  costs  are  generally   charged   to
operations  in the year incurred and totaled $423 million in 1995,  $422
million in 1994 and $353 million in 1993.

Derivatives:   Derivative  financial instruments  are  utilized  by  the
company to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange  rate
and interest rate market volatility.  The company does not hold or issue
derivative  financial instruments for trading purposes.  The company  is
not a party to leveraged derivatives.  Realized and unrealized gains and
losses  are  deferred  until the underlying transactions  are  realized.
These  gains  and losses are recognized either as interest expense  over
the  borrowing  period  for  interest rate and  currency  swaps,  as  an
adjustment   to   cost   of  goods  sold  for  inventory-related   hedge
transactions,  or in stockholders' equity for hedges of net  investments
in  international companies.  Cash flows attributable to these financial
instruments are included with the cash flows from the associated  hedged
items.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation:  In October 1995, the Financial
Accounting  Standards  Board issued Statement No. 123,  "Accounting  for
Stock-Based   Compensation."   This  statement   establishes   financial
accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation
plans.   The company intends to follow the option that permits  entities
to  continue  to  apply  current  accounting  standards  to  stock-based
employee  compensation  arrangements.   Effective  with  year-end   1996
reporting,  the company will disclose pro forma net income and  earnings
per share amounts as if Statement No. 123 accounting were applied.

Discontinued Operations
In  November 1995, the Board of Directors approved a plan to launch  the
company's data storage and imaging systems businesses as an independent,
publicly  owned company.  This transaction will be effected through  the
distribution  of  shares in a newly formed company to  3M  shareholders.
The  transaction  is expected to be tax free to 3M and to  shareholders.
The  distribution  is expected to occur around July 1,  1996.   3M  will
contribute  the  net  assets  of the data storage  and  imaging  systems
businesses to the newly formed company, reducing stockholders' equity by
an estimated $1 billion.

In   November   1995,   the  Board  of  Directors  also   approved   the
discontinuance of 3M's audio and video tape business within 12 months.

As  a  result  of  the  plans to spin off the data storage  and  imaging
systems businesses and to discontinue the audio and video tape business,
the  company's consolidated financial statements and notes report  these
businesses   as  discontinued  operations.   Prior  years'  consolidated
financial statements and notes have been restated accordingly.

The  1995 income from operations of the discontinued businesses  include
results  through  November  30, 1995.  Income  from  operations  of  the
discontinued businesses includes interest expense allocations (based  on
the  ratio of net assets of discontinued operations to consolidated  net
assets plus debt) of $15 million, $17 million, and $11 million in  1995,
1994  and  1993,  respectively. The loss on  disposal  of  $373  million
includes  the  estimated  future  results  of  operations  through   the
estimated date of spin-off or closure.  Major components of the loss  on
disposal  include  $300 million of severance cost and  $265  million  of
asset  write-downs,  net  of  deferred income  taxes  of  $232  million.
Included  in the calculation of the loss on disposal was $13 million  in
interest expense.  Net cash provided by discontinued operations in  1995
differs  from the loss from discontinued operations principally  due  to
two  factors -- the loss on disposal for which no cash had been expended
at December 31, 1995, and depreciation.

Restructuring Charge
Related  to the spin-off of the data storage and imaging businesses  and
the phase-out of the audio and video tape business, the company recorded
a restructuring charge of $79 million in 1995.  Major components of this
charge  include $50 million of employee severance costs and $17  million
related  to  the  write-down of certain assets to their  net  realizable
value.   The company expects to reduce approximately 1,000 positions  by
the  end  of  1996, mainly in corporate service functions supporting  3M
businesses in the United States and Europe. As of December 31, 1995,  no
employee  separations  had  occurred and no  cash  payments  related  to
employee separations had been made.

*Effective  interest rates, which reflect the effects of  interest  rate
and currency swaps, at December 31, 1995.


Debt with fixed interest rates include the ESOP, Canadian Eurobond and a
portion  of  other  borrowings.  Other borrowings consist  primarily  of
borrowings of 3M's international companies and industrial bond issues in
the United States.

Maturities  of  long-term debt for the next five years are  as  follows:
1996,  $47  million; 1997, $558 million; 1998, $162 million; 1999,  $144
million; and 2000, $45 million.

Interest  payments included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash  Flows
totaled  $104  million in 1995, $72 million in 1994 and $42  million  in
1993.  The ESOP debt is being serviced by dividends on stock held by the
ESOP and by company contributions.  These contributions are reported  as
a benefit expense.

The  company  estimates that the fair value of short-term and  long-term
debt  approximates  the  carrying  amount  of  this  debt.   Payment  of
dividends is not restricted by debt covenants.


Other Financial Instruments
Interest  Rate and Currency Swaps:  To manage interest rate and  foreign
exchange  rate risk and to lower its cost of borrowing, the company  has
entered into interest rate and currency swaps.  The notional amounts set
forth in the table below serve solely as a basis for the calculation  of
payment  streams  to be exchanged.  These notional  amounts  are  not  a
measure  of  the exposure of the company through its use of derivatives.
These  instruments mature in relationship to their underlying  debt  and
have  maturities  extending to 1999.  Unrealized gains  and  losses  and
exposure  to changes in market conditions were not material at  December
31, 1995 and 1994.

Currency swaps                                      306     256

Foreign Exchange Forward and Options Contracts:  The company has entered
into   foreign  exchange  forward  and  options  contracts,  all  having
maturities of less than one year.  The face amounts represent contracted
U.S.  dollar  equivalents  of non-U.S. dollar  denominated  forward  and
options  contracts.   The amounts at risk are not material  because  the
company  is  not  required to exercise options  purchased  and  has  the
ability  to  generate  offsetting  foreign  currency  cash  flows.   The
unrealized  gains  and losses at December 31, 1995 and  1994,  were  not
material.

The  company  engages in foreign currency hedging activities  to  reduce
exchange  risks  arising from cross-border, non-U.S. dollar  denominated
cash flows. The company operates on a global basis, generating more than
half  of  its  revenues  from international customers  and  engaging  in
substantial product and financial transfers among geographic areas.  The
major  forward  contracts  at December 31,  1995,  were  denominated  in
Italian  lira, French francs, Japanese yen, German marks, Swiss  francs,
British pound sterling and Canadian dollars.

Credit  Risk:   The company is exposed to credit loss in  the  event  of
nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency  swaps
and  foreign  exchange contracts, but does not anticipate nonperformance
by  any  of  these  counterparties.  The company actively  monitors  its
exposure  to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and  credit
limits,  and  by  selecting  major  international  banks  and  financial
institutions as counterparties.

Leases
Rental  expense under operating leases was $154 million  in  1995,  $140
million  in  1994 and $132 million in 1993.  The table below sets  forth
minimum  payments  under  operating leases with noncancelable  terms  in
excess of one year, as of year-end 1995.

Income tax payments included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
totaled  $793 million in 1995, $865 million in 1994 and $754 million  in
1993.

At  December 31, 1995, approximately $3.377 billion of retained earnings
attributable   to   international  companies  were  considered   to   be
permanently invested.  No provision has been made for taxes  that  might
be  payable if these earnings were remitted to the United States.  It is
not  practical  to determine the amount of incremental  tax  that  might
arise were these earnings to be remitted.

  Business Segments
As  a result of the restructuring plan, the company's businesses now are
organized  into  two sectors.  The company's electro and  communications
businesses  now  are  included in the Industrial  and  Consumer  Sector.
Accordingly, all prior data have been restated.

3M's  two  business sectors have worldwide responsibility for  virtually
all  of  the company's product lines.  These product lines serve a  wide
range   of   markets,  including  automotive,  communication,   consumer,
electronic,  health care, industrial, office, personal care and  safety.
3M's business is not dependent upon any single product or market.

Financial information relating to the company's business sectors for the
years  ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 appears below.  3M  is  an
integrated   enterprise   characterized   by   substantial   intersector
cooperation,  cost  allocations  and  inventory  transfers.   Therefore,
management   does  not  represent  that  these  sectors,   if   operated
independently, could earn the operating income shown.

Retirement Plans
3M has various company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially
all  U.S.  employees  and  many employees  outside  the  United  States.
Pension benefits are based principally on an employee's years of service
and  compensation near retirement.  Plan assets are invested  in  common
stocks, fixed-income securities, real estate and other investments.

The  company's funding policy is to deposit with an independent  trustee
amounts  at  least  equal to those required by law.   A  trust  fund  is
maintained  to provide pension benefits to plan participants  and  their
beneficiaries.   In  addition,  a number  of  plans  are  maintained  by
deposits  with  insurance companies.  The charge to income  relating  to
these  plans  was $152 million in 1995, $153 million in  1994  and  $170
million in 1993.

Net  pension cost is reported on a continuing operations basis,  whereas
the  funded  status  of  pension  plans  includes  both  continuing  and
discontinued  operations.  The company is in the process of  determining
the  benefit arrangements of the spin-off company and, thus, the  funded
status   of  pension  plans  is  subject  to  change  based   on   these
determinations.

Other Postretirement Benefits
The  company  provides  health  care and  life  insurance  benefits  for
substantially all of its U.S. employees who reach retirement  age  while
employed  by  the  company.  The company has set  aside  funds  with  an
independent trustee for these postretirement benefits and makes periodic
contributions to the plan.  The assets held by the trustee are  invested
in  common  stocks and fixed-income securities.  Employees  outside  the
United  States  are  covered principally by government-sponsored  plans.
The cost of company-provided plans for these employees is not material.

Net  periodic  postretirement benefit cost is reported on  a  continuing
operations  basis,  whereas  the funded  status  of  the  postretirement
benefit plan includes both continuing and discontinued operations.   The
company is in the process of determining the benefit arrangements of the
spin-off  company  and,  thus, the funded status of  the  postretirement
benefit plan is subject to change based on these determinations.

The   table  below  sets  forth  the  components  of  the  net  periodic
postretirement benefit cost and a reconciliation of the funded status of
the postretirement benefit plan for U.S. employees.

The  accumulated  postretirement benefit obligation and related  benefit
costs  are  determined  through the application  of  relevant  actuarial
assumptions.  The company anticipates its health care cost trend rate to
slow  from  6.9 percent in 1996 to 5.0 percent in 2003, after which  the
trend  rate  is  expected to stabilize.  The effect of a one  percentage
point  increase  in  the assumed health care cost trend  rate  for  each
future year would increase the benefit obligation by $78 million and the
current  year benefit expense by $9 million. Other actuarial assumptions
include  an  expected long-term rate of return on  plan  assets  of  9.0
percent  (before  taxes applicable to a portion of the  return  on  plan
assets), and a discount rate of 7.0 percent.

Employee Savings and Stock Ownership Plans
The  company sponsors employee savings plans under Section 401(k) of the
Internal  Revenue  Code.  These plans are offered to  substantially  all
regular  U.S. employees.  The company matches employee contributions  of
up  to 6 percent of compensation at rates ranging from 10 to 85 percent,
depending upon company performance.

The  company  maintains  an  Employee Stock Ownership  Plan  (ESOP)  for
substantially  all  regular  U.S. employees not  covered  by  collective
bargaining  agreements.  This plan was established in 1989  as  a  cost-
effective  way of funding certain employee retirement savings  benefits,
including  the  company's matching contributions under  401(k)  employee
savings plans.  The ESOP borrowed $548 million and used the proceeds  to
purchase  15.4 million shares of the company's common stock,  previously
held  in treasury.  Because the company has guaranteed repayment of  the
ESOP  debt,  the debt and related unearned compensation are recorded  in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Dividends  on  shares held by the ESOP are paid to the ESOP  trust  and,
together  with  company contributions, are used by  the  ESOP  to  repay
principal  and interest on the outstanding notes.  Shares  are  released
for  allocation  to  participants based upon the ratio  of  the  current
year's  debt service to the sum of total principal and interest payments
over the life of the notes.

Annual  expenses  related  to the ESOP generally  represent  total  debt
