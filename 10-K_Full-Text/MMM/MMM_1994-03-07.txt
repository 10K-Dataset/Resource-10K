                     For the Year Ended December 31, 1993

                                    PART I

Item 1. Business.
    Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing  Company was incorporated
in 1929 under
the laws of the State of Delaware  to continue operations, begun
in 1902, of a
Minnesota corporation  of  the same  name.   As  used  herein,
the  term  "3M"
includes Minnesota Mining  and Manufacturing Company  and
subsidiaries  unless
the context otherwise indicates. 3M employs 86,168 persons.

    3M is an integrated  enterprise characterized by substantial
interdivision
and intersector  cooperation  in  research,  manufacturing  and 
marketing  of
products  incorporating similar  component  materials 
manufactured at  common
internal sources.  Its business has developed from its research
and technology
in coating  and bonding for  coated abrasives, its  only product
in  its early
years. Coating and bonding is the process of applying one
material to another,
such as adhesives to  a backing (pressure-sensitive tapes), 
abrasive granules
to  paper or  cloth (coated  abrasives), ceramic  coating to 
granular mineral
(roofing granules), heat-  or light-  sensitive materials to 
paper, film  and
metal  (dry silver  paper, photographic  film and  lithographic 
plates), iron
oxide to plastic  backing (magnetic  recording tape), glass 
beads to  plastic
backing (reflective sheeting), and low tack adhesives to paper
(repositionable
notes).

    3M believes that it  is among the leading  producers of
products  for many
of the markets it serves. In all  cases, 3M products are subject
to direct  or
indirect competition.  Generally speaking, most 3M  products
involve technical
competence  in development,  manufacturing and  marketing  and
are  subject to
competition with products manufactured and sold by other 
technically-oriented
companies.

    3M's three  business sectors  are: Industrial  and Consumer; 
Information,
Imaging and Electronic; and Life Sciences.  Each sector brings
together common
or  related  3M technologies  and thus  provides  greater
opportunity  for the
future development of  products and services and  a more
efficient  sharing of
business strengths.

    The notes  to the financial statements on page 25 and 26 of
this Form 10-K
provide financial information concerning 3M's three industry
segments and 3M's
operations in various geographic areas of the world.

Industry Segments

    3M's  operations are organized  into three business sectors.
These sectors
have worldwide  responsibility for  virtually all  3M  product
lines.   A  few
miscellaneous  and staff-sponsored new products, still in
development, are not
assigned to the sectors.

    Industrial and Consumer  Sector:   This sector is  a leader
in  developing
the technologies for pressure-sensitive adhesives, specialty
tapes, coated and
nonwoven abrasives,  and specialty chemicals.  These core
technologies provide
a strong basis  for the  development of  new products.   The 
sector also  has
strong distribution channels and logistics expertise.  The sector
is organized
into  five groups:  Abrasive,  Chemical and  Film  Products
Group;  Automotive
Systems Group; Consumer Markets; Office Markets; and Tape Group.


                                       


     Major products in the Abrasive, Chemical  and Film Products
Group include
coated abrasives  (such as sandpaper) for grinding, conditioning
and finishing
a  wide range  of  surfaces; natural  and  color-coated mineral 
granules  for
asphalt  shingles; finishing  compounds; and  flame-retardant
materials.  This
group also markets  products for  maintaining and repairing 
vehicles.   Major
chemical products  include protective  chemicals  for furniture, 
fabrics  and
paper products; fire-fighting  agents; fluoroelastomers for 
seals, tubes  and
gaskets  in engines; engineering fluids;  and high performance 
fluids used in
the manufacture of computer  chips and for electronic cooling 
and lubricating

    The  Tape  Group  manufactures  and  markets   a  wide 
variety  of  high-
performance and  general-use pressure-sensitive tapes and 
specialty products.
Major product categories include industrial application tapes
made from a wide
variety of materials such as foil, film, vinyl and  polyester;
specialty tapes
and adhesives  for industrial  applications including Scotch 
brand VHB  brand
tapes,  lithographic  tapes, joining  systems, specialty 
additives, vibration
control  materials, liquid  adhesives, and  reclosable 
fasteners; general-use
tapes  such as  masking,  box-sealing  and  filament;  and 
labels  and  other
materials for identifying and marking durable goods.

    Information, Imaging  and Electronic Sector:   This sector
serves  rapidly
changing markets in audio,  video and data recording;  graphic
communications;
information storage, output and transfer;  telecommunications;
electronics and
electrical products.  The  sector has  the  leading technologies 
for  certain
electrical,  electronic and  fiber-optic applications  and a 
wide  variety of
graphic imaging technologies. Having these related areas in one
operating unit
fosters  efficient product  development and  innovation.   The
sector  is also
strong in worldwide distribution  and service.  The  sector is
organized  into
three groups:  Electro and Communications Systems; Imaging
Systems; and Memory
Technologies.

    The Electro  and  Communication  Systems Group  includes
products  in  the
electronic, electrical,  telecommunication and  visual  
communication fields.
The electronic and electrical products include packaging and 
inter-connection
devices; insulating materials, including  pressure-sensitive
tapes and resins;
and  other  related  equipment.    These  products  are  used 
extensively  by
manufacturers  of  electronic  and  electrical  equipment,  as 
well  as   the
construction and maintenance segments  of the electric utility,
telephone  and
other industries.  The telecommunication  products serve the
world's telephone
companies  with  a wide  array of  products  for fiber-optic  and
copper-based

Distribution

    3M products are sold directly to  users and through numerous 
wholesalers,
retailers,  jobbers, distributors and  dealers in a wide  variety
of trades in
many countries  of the  world.   Management  believes that  the
confidence  of
wholesalers,  retailers,  jobbers, distributors  and  dealers  in 
3M and  its
products, developed through  long association with trained
marketing and sales
representatives,  has  contributed  significantly  to  3M's 
position  in  the
marketplace and  to its growth.   3M  has 322 sales  offices and 
distribution
centers  worldwide, including 9 major  branch offices and 
warehouses that are
located in principal  cities throughout the United States.  There
are 99 sales
offices and  distribution centers located in the United States. 
The remaining
223 sales offices and distribution centers are located in 52
countries outside
the United States.

Research, Patents and Raw Materials

    Research and  product  development constitute  an important 
part of  3M's
activities, and products resulting from such research and product 
development
have contributed  in large measure to its growth.   The total
amount spent for
all research  and development activities  was $1.030 billion, 
$1.007 billion,
and $914 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

    The corporate research  laboratories are  engaged in 
research which  does
not relate directly  to 3M's existing  product lines.   They also
support  the
research efforts  of division  and sector  laboratories. Most 
major operating
divisions  and  domestic  subsidiaries,  as  well  as  several  
international
subsidiaries, have their own laboratories for improvement of
existing products
and  development of related new  products.  Engineering  research
staff groups
provide  specialized  services  in instrumentation,  engineering 
and  process
development.  An organization is maintained  for technological
development not
sponsored by other units of the company.

    3M  is the owner  of many domestic  and foreign  patents
derived primarily
from its own research activities.  3M does not consider that its
business as a
whole is  materially dependent upon any one patent, license or
trade secret or
any group of related patents, licenses or trade secrets.

    The  company  experienced  no  significant  or  unusual 
problems  in  the
purchase  of raw  materials during 1993.   While  3M has 
successfully met its
demands to date, it is impossible to predict future shortages or
their impact.



Executive Officers

    The following  is a list of  the executive officers of  3M as 
of March 1,
1994, their present  position, their  current age, the  year
first elected  to
their position  and other positions  held within  3M during the 
previous five
years. All of these persons have been employed full time by 3M or
a subsidiary
of 3M for  more than five  years.  All  officers are elected  by
the Board  of
Directors at its annual meeting, with vacancies and new positions
being filled
at  interim meetings.   There are no  family relationships
between  any of the
executive officers  named,  nor  is there  any  arrangement  or 
understanding
pursuant to which any person was selected as an officer.







Item 2. Properties.

    3M's  general  offices,  corporate  research  laboratories,
most  division
laboratories and certain  manufacturing facilities  are located 
in St.  Paul,
Minnesota.  Within the United  States, 3M operates 82 plants in 
28 states and
has   99  sales  offices  and  distribution  centers  located  in 
24  states.
Internationally, 3M operates 109 manufacturing and converting
facilities in 44
countries.

    3M owns substantially  all of its physical  properties.  3M
leases certain
facilities that were financed  through the issuance of industrial 
development
bonds in the original principal amount of $30 million.  3M has
capitalized the
construction  costs  related  to these  facilities  and  recorded
the  related
liabilities.  Management believes 3M's existing physical
facilities are highly
suitable for the purposes for which they were designed.



Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

    The company  and certain  of its subsidiaries  are named 
defendants in  a
number of  actions, governmental  proceedings  and claims, 
including  product
liability claims involving products  now or formerly manufactured
and  sold by
the company, many of which  relate to silicone gel mammary
implants,  and some
of which claims are purported or tentatively certified class
actions.  Mammary
implant cases and claims are discussed separately below.  In some
actions, the
claimants  seek  damages as  well  as other  relief which,  if 
granted, would
require substantial expenditures.

    The company  is  involved in  a  number  of environmental 
proceedings  by
governmental agencies asserting  liability for past  waste
disposal and  other
alleged environmental damage.   The company  conducts ongoing 
investigations,
assisted by environmental consultants, to determine accruals for
the probable,
estimable  costs of remediation.   The remediation accruals  are
reviewed each
quarter and changes are made as appropriate.

    Some of  these  matters raise  difficult  and  complex
factual  and  legal
issues and are subject  to many uncertainties, including, but not 
limited to,
the  facts and circumstances of  each particular action,  the
jurisdiction and
forum in which  each action is proceeding, and  differences in
applicable law.
Accordingly, the company is not able to  estimate the nature and
amount of any
future liability with respect to such matters.

Mammary Implant Litigation

    As of December 31, 1993, the company had been named as a
defendant,  often
with multiple co-defendants, in  3,054 claims and lawsuits in 
various courts,
all  seeking damages  for personal  injuries from  allegedly
defective  breast
implants.   These  claims and  lawsuits, including  class
actions,  purport to
represent 8,842 individual claimants.  These claims and lawsuits
are generally
in  very preliminary  stages, and  it is  not yet  certain how 
many  of these
lawsuits and  claims involve products manufactured and sold by
the company, as
opposed to other  manufacturers.  The company entered the 
business in 1977 by
purchasing McGhan  Medical and subsequently sold  that business
in 1984.   The
company's sales of implants, during the time that it engaged in
this business,
represent approximately  seven percent of the total cumulative
mammary implant
sales.   The  company  is  vigorously  defending  the  individual 
claims  and
lawsuits.  Given the  preliminary state of the proceedings, 
company's counsel
has not yet reached a conclusion on the probability of company
liability.

    Discussions  regarding a  possible  "global  settlement" have 
taken place
during the  last several months, with  the facilitation of a 
panel of federal
judges acting as mediators, between a plaintiffs'  steering
committee, various
plaintiff  groups,  the mediators,  and key  defendants.   The 
company  was a
participant in  these mediation efforts.   On February 14, 1994, 
Dow Corning,
Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Baxter Healthcare Corp., together with
several other
defendants, announced  an agreement with representatives  from
the plaintiffs'
steering  committee on financial terms  for a global  settlement. 
The company
was not  included by the  parties in  this arrangement.  
Discussions are  now
being conducted  between the  company and  representatives of the 
plaintiffs'
steering committee.   The  company does  not know at  this time 
whether these
discussions will  lead to resolution  of all or any  portion of
the  suits and
claims against it or whether it will be a participant in such a
settlement.

    With respect  to these silicone gel  mammary implant  claims
and lawsuits,
the company's general counsel has opined that, based solely on
the facts known
as  of  February  25,  1994,  date  of  the  opinion  and 
subject  to  future
developments,  there is sufficient insurance coverage to recover
all liability
and costs arising  out of these  matters.  No  insurers have
denied  coverage.
Therefore,  the company  believes that such  matters will not 
pose a material
risk to the financial position of the company or its results of
operations.

Item  7. Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of Financial 
Condition  and
Results of Operations.

  Operating Results
1993 was a challenging year in several respects.  The company
faced recessions
in Europe and Japan, negative currency effects, a soft U.S.
health care market
and a highly competitive pricing environment.
   Worldwide net  sales rose  1.0 percent to  $14.020 billion.  
This followed
increases of 4.1 percent in 1992 and 2.5 percent in 1991.
   Sales in  the United States were  $7.126 billion, up  about 3
percent  from
1992.  Internationally, sales  totaled $6.894 billion,  a
decrease of about  1
percent from 1992.

   In the United States volume  growth accelerated in 1993,
helped by a slight
improvement  in   the  domestic  economy;  however,   pricing 
pressures  also
increased, mainly in memory technologies product lines.
   Internationally,  sales growth in local currencies was
slightly better than
in 1992.  However,  currency fluctuations, which added to 
international sales
in 1992, reduced those sales by about 6 percent in 1993.
   Cost of goods sold was 60.8 percent of sales, up from 60.1
percent in 1992.
The negative impact of lower selling prices and currency was
partially  offset
by improvements  due to productivity gains  and lower raw
material  costs.  In
1992, cost of goods sold  decreased as a percent of sales
compared to 1991 due
to productivity gains and lower raw material costs which were
partially offset
by higher R&D spending and lower selling prices.  Cost of goods 
sold includes
manufacturing, research and development, and engineering
expenses.
   Selling, general and  administrative expenses decreased to 
25.2 percent of
sales as the  result of several cost-reduction  programs.  This 
compares with
25.6  percent in  1992  and 24.9  percent  in  1991.   The  1992
increase  was
magnified  by costs for voluntary  separations, higher sales 
costs and modest
volume growth.
   Worldwide employment decreased by over 1,000 in 1993, even
though about 600
people were added to  support continued rapid growth in 
developing countries.
This  net reduction  in  employment occurred  with  little
disruption  to  the
company.

 In December  1992, 3M  recognized  $129 million  in  settlement
of  a  patent
lawsuit involving 3M orthopedic  casting materials.  Operating
income  in 1992
includes  this  amount, which  is  shown  on a  separate  line 
of the  Income
Statement titled "legal settlement."
 Also in 1992,  3M recorded  $115 million of  special charges  to
enhance  its
competitiveness and  productivity.   These charges  relate
primarily to  asset
write-downs, including rationalization of manufacturing
operations.  Operating
income  in 1992  includes this  amount, which  is shown  on a 
separate Income
Statement line titled "special charges".


 Worldwide operating income in  1993 decreased 1.9 percent to 
$1.956 billion.
The positive impact  of increased sales volume and cost  control
was more than
offset by negative  currency and pricing.   Operating income in 
1993 included
about   $53   million  for   manufacturing   rationalizations  
and  voluntary
separations.  This  compared to 1992 costs of about  $80 million
for voluntary
separation programs, in addition to the $115 million of special
charges.    In
1992, operating income  increased 1.7  percent, following a 
decrease of  10.6
percent in 1991.

 Interest expense  was $50  million, down  from $76  million in 
1992 and  $97
million in 1991.   The declines in both 1993 and 1992 were mainly
due to lower
interest rates.   Investment and  other income  totaled $96 
million in  1993,
which includes a $36 million benefit from tax settlements,
improved investment
results, and other items, many of which  were of a non-recurring
nature.  This
compared  with investment  and other  income of  $29 million  in
1992  and $15
million in 1991.
 The company's  effective tax  rate was  35.3 percent  of pre-tax
income,  the
same as in 1992 and down from 36.8 percent in 1991.  The 1
percent increase in
the 1993  U.S. statutory corporate  tax rate was offset  by lower
taxes  on 3M
International Operations,  the extension of  the U.S. R&D  tax
credit and  the
positive effect of  revaluing deferred tax assets.  The company's
deferred tax
assets will reverse over an extended period of time.
  Net income increased 2.5 percent to $1.263 billion, or $5.82
per share.   In
1992, net income increased 6.8 percent to $1.233 billion, or 
$5.63 per share,
compared with $1.154 billion, or $5.26 per share, in 1991.
      The  company estimates  that changes  in the  value  of the 
U.S. dollar
decreased  1993  net income  by  about $62  million,  or 29 
cents  per share.
Currency  changes increased  net income  by about  $1 million, 
or 1  cent per
share, in  1992, and by $23  million, or 11 cents  per share, in 
1991.  These
estimates include the effect of translating profits from local
currencies into
U.S.  dollars, the costs in local currencies of transferring
goods between the
parent  company in the U.S. and international companies, and
transaction gains
and losses in countries not considered to be highly inflationary.
 Over  the  long term,  3M  expects to  meet its  aggressive 
financial goals.
These include a growth  in earnings per share  averaging 10
percent a  year or
better; return on stockholders' equity of 20 to 25 percent; 
return on capital
employed  of 27  percent or  better;  and 30  percent of  sales
from  products
introduced in the last four years.
 Earnings per share  increased 3.4 percent in 1993.   Currency
effects reduced
earnings by about 5 percent.   Return on average stockholders'
equity was 19.1
percent, up from 18.8 percent in 1992.  This return has averaged 
20.5 percent
over the past 5 years.  Return on capital employed was 19.1
percent, down from
19.7 percent  in 1992.  This return has averaged  22.1 percent
over the past 5
years.     In 1993 more than 25 percent of sales came from
products introduced
within the last 4 years.

  Performance by Business Sector
Industrial and Consumer Sector:
In 1993, sales were up 2.6 percent to $5.4 billion.  Operating
income rose 2.8
percent to  $849 million.  Excluding  special charges of $13 
million in 1992,
operating income  rose 1.2 percent in  1993.  Sales and  profits
showed strong
growth in the Asia  Pacific area and  in Latin America.  
However, results  in
Europe were adversely affected by weak economies and the stronger
U.S. dollar.
This sector expects continued growth in  the United States, Asia
Pacific  area
and in Latin America.

Information, Imaging and Electronic Sector:
In  1993, sales were  down 1.7 percent to  $4.5 billion.   A
solid increase in




unit volume was more than  offset by continued price competition 
and negative
currency  translation.   Operating  income  increased  14.0 
percent  to  $271
million.  Excluding  special charges of $81 million in  1992,
operating income
decreased  15.0  percent.   Operating profit  margins  were
affected  by price
competition and  currency effects,  as  well as  by large 
investments in  new
products and efforts to  streamline operations.  This sector 
will continue to
face significant price pressure in 1994.



Life Sciences Sector:
In  1993, sales  increased 2.6  percent  to $4.1  billion.  
Sales growth  was
constrained by the stronger U.S. dollar and by the slowdown in
the U.S. health
care  market due to  uncertainty over  health care  reform.  
Operating income
decreased  8.6 percent  to $846  million.   Excluding  a net 
benefit of  $108
million  from  a  legal  settlement  and  special  charges, 
operating  income
increased by 3.4  percent.  This sector  will continue to  be
impacted by  the
uncertainty over U.S. health care reform.

  Financial Position
3M's financial condition remained strong in 1993, despite a
sluggish worldwide
economy.  Balance sheet amounts did not vary significantly from
1992.  Various
items, such as  cash and  short-term debt, can  fluctuate
significantly   from
month to month depending on short-term  liquidity needs. 
Substantially all of
the vested and earned benefits under 3M's employee retirement
plans, and about
half  of the  other  postretirement benefit  obligations,  were
funded  as  of
December 31, 1993.
  The company's key  inventory index, which represents the number
of months of
inventory, was  4.0 months, up from  3.8 months in 1992.  
Accounts receivable
days' sales outstanding  were 66 days, up  one day from  1992. 
The  company's
current ratio was 1.9, unchanged from the end of 1992.
  Of the long-term debt  outstanding at the  end of 1993,  $469
million was  a
guarantee of debt of the 3M Employee Stock Ownership Plan.  Total
debt  was 23
percent  of stockholders' equity  at the end  of 1993.   This
compared with 22
percent at year-end 1992.  The  company's borrowings continued to
maintain AAA
long-term ratings.
  Legal proceedings,  including the silicone gel  mammory
prosthesis situation
and environmental liabilities, are discussed in the legal
proceedings  section
on page 8.  The  company believes that such  matters will not
pose a  material
risk to the financial position of the company.

  Liquidity
Due  to a  change in  the  financial reporting  period for  3M's
international
companies, the 1992  Consolidated Statement  of Cash Flows 
includes the  cash
provided  or  used  by 3M's  international  companies  for  a
14-month  period
(November 1, 1991, to December 31, 1992).
 The  following  table  is presented  on  a  comparative  basis,
whereby  1992
excludes the November  1 to December  31, 1991, period  for our 
international
companies.

The  company met  its cash requirements  primarily from 
operating activities.
During  1993,  cash  flows provided  by  operating  activities 
totaled $2.091
billion.  This more than covered capital expenditures and
dividend payments of
$1.833 billion.  The company's superior credit rating  provides
easy and ample
access to global capital markets.
  As part of  our efforts  to control overall  spending, capital 
expenditures
declined  9.3 percent to $1.112  billion in 1993.   This followed
a decline of
7.5 percent in calendar year 1992.
 Stockholder  dividends  increased 3.8  percent to  $3.32  per
share  in 1993.
Cash dividend payments  totaled $721 million.   3M has  paid
dividends for  78
consecutive years.  On February 14, 1994 the 3M Board of
Directors boosted the
quarterly dividend on 3M  common stock 6 percent to 88 cents a
share, declared
a  two-for-one stock  split to shareholders  of record  on March 
15, 1994 and
authorized the  repurchase of up  to 12  million of the 
company's (pre-split)
shares.  This  share-repurchase authorization runs through
February  10, 1995.
The  company  repurchased all  of  the six  million  shares
available  under a
previous authorization. 
 Repurchases of 3M  common stock totaled $706  million in 1993, 
compared with
$247 million in 1992 and $240 million in 1991.  Increased share
repurchases in
1993 reduced  the total number of  shares outstanding by more 
than 4 million.
Repurchases  were made to support employee  stock purchase plans
and for other
corporate purposes.  

  Future Outlook
Most  economists expect slightly better global economic growth
this year, with
the improvement  coming  in the  second half.   This  combined
with  continued
emphasis on productivity improvement and new products should help
our results;
however, the pricing  environment is  likely to remain  quite
competitive  and
currency fluctuations could have a significant, negative effect
on our results
again this year.
 Spending on research  and development and  capital equipment  is
expected  to
remain  around  1993 levels.   Employment  levels  should
continue  to decline
slightly in 1994.
 In 1992, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement  No. 112,
"Employers' Accounting  for Postemployment Benefits." 
Postemployment benefits
include,  but  are  not limited  to,  disability,  severance  and
health  care
benefits.   3M will adopt  this standard in  the first quarter of 
1994.  This
adoption will have a diminimus effect on the company's results of
operations.

                       Report of Independent Accountants

We  have  audited the  consolidated  financial  statements  and
the  financial
statement  schedules  of  Minnesota   Mining  and  Manufacturing 
Company  and
subsidiaries  (the company) as listed  in Item  8 and  Item 14(a)
of this Form
10-K.   These financial statements  and financial statement 
schedules are the
responsibility  of the Company's management.  Our responsibility
is to express
an  opinion on  these financial  statements and financial 
statement schedules
based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally
accepted  auditing
standards.   Those standards require  that we  plan and perform 
the audit  to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of
material  misstatements.    An audit  includes  examining,  on  a
test  basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and  disclosures in the financial 
statements.
An  audit   also  includes  assessing  the  accounting  
principles  used  and
significant  estimates made by management,  as well as 
evaluating the overall
financial  statement presentation.    We believe  that  our
audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements  referred to above
present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Minnesota Mining
and Manufacturing  Company and subsidiaries as of  December 31,
1993 and 1992,
and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash
flows for each
of the three  years in the period  ended December 31, 1993 in 
conformity with
generally  accepted accounting principles.   In addition, in  our
opinion, the
financial statement schedules  referred to above, when 
considered in relation
to the basic  financial statements taken  as a whole,  present
fairly, in  all
material respects, the information required to be included
therein.

As discussed in the Notes to the Financial Statements, the
company changed the
fiscal year-end  of its  international companies  in 1992.   The 
company also
adopted  in  1992  Statements  of  Financial  Accounting 
Standards  No.  106,
"Employers' Accounting  for Postretirement Benefits Other  Than
Pensions," and
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."

Notes to Financial Statements

  Accounting Policies
  Consolidation:      All    significant   subsidiaries   are   
consolidated.
  Unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates are included on the
equity basis. 

  Cash and  Cash Equivalents:  Cash  and cash equivalents consist 
of cash and
  temporary investments with maturities of three months or less
when purchased.

  Other  Securities:   Other securities consist  of marketable 
securities and
  interest-bearing bank deposits with  varied maturity dates. 
These  securities
  are employed in the  company's banking, captive insurance and 
cash management
  operations.  The securities are stated at cost, which
approximates fair value.

  Inventories:  Inventories are stated  at lower of cost or
market,  with cost
generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.

  Investments:  Investments  primarily include assets  from
captive  insurance
and  banking   operations  and  from  venture  capital  
investments.    These
investments are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.

  Other Assets:   Other assets include  goodwill, patents, other 
intangibles,
deferred taxes and  other noncurrent  assets.  Other  assets are 
periodically
reviewed  for  impairment  to  ensure  that  they  are 
appropriately  valued.
Goodwill is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over 10
years.  Other
intangible items are amortized  on a straight-line basis over 
their estimated
economic lives.

  Deferred  Income Taxes:   Deferred  income taxes  arise from 
differences in
basis for tax and financial-reporting purposes.

  Revenue  Recognition:   Revenue  is recognized  upon  shipment
of  goods  to
customers and upon performance of services.

  Depreciation:   Depreciation of property,  plant and equipment 
is generally
computed on  a straight-line basis  over the  estimated useful
lives  of these
assets.

  Research and Development:   Research  and development costs 
are charged  to
operations as incurred and totaled $1.030  billion in 1993,
$1.007 billion  in
1992 and $914 million in 1991.

  Foreign Currency Translation:  Local currencies are generally
considered the
functional  currencies outside  the United  States, except  in
countries  with
highly inflationary economies.  Assets and liabilities are
translated at year-
end exchange rates for  operations in local currency
environments.  Income and
expense  items are translated at  average rates of  exchange
prevailing during
the   year.    Translation  adjustments   are  recorded  as   a 
component  of
stockholders' equity.
   For  operations in  countries with  highly inflationary 
economies, certain
financial  statement amounts are translated at historical
exchange rates, with
all other assets and liabilities translated at year-end exchange
rates.  These
translation  adjustments are  reflected in  the results  of
operations.   They
decreased  net income  by $12  million in  1993, increased  net
income  by $10
million in 1992 and decreased net income by $6 million in 1991.









  Accounting Changes
Effective  January  1,  1992,  3M's  international  companies 
changed   their
reporting  period from  a fiscal  year ending  October 31  to a 
calendar year
ending  December 31.  The change was  made to aid worldwide
business planning,
increase efficiency and reflect  the global nature of the 
company's business.
The international companies' results  of operations for the
period  November 1
to  December 31, 1991, are shown in  the 1992 Consolidated
Statement of Income
as  a cumulative  effect  of an  accounting change.    The cash 
flows  of the
international  companies for the 14-month period November 1,
1991, to December
31, 1992, are reflected in the 1992 Consolidated Statement of
Cash Flows.
  Effective  January  1,  1992,  the company  adopted  Statement 
of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement
Benefits  Other Than  Pensions."   This statement  requires that 
the  cost of
providing postretirement  benefits  be  accrued  over  an 
employee's  service
period.  In implementing this standard, the company was required
to accrue the
unfunded  obligation.  The company had accrued  and funded -
under a different
actuarial methodology - a substantial amount of these benefits
since 1977.  In
implementing this  standard,  the company  elected  to record 
the  transition
obligation using the immediate recognition option.
  Also   effective  January  1,  1992,  the  company  adopted 
SFAS  No.  109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes."  This statement requires an asset
and liability
approach for financial  accounting and reporting of income 
taxes.  Under this
approach, deferred  taxes are recognized  for the  estimated
taxes  ultimately
payable or recoverable based on enacted tax law.  Changes in
enacted tax rates
will be reflected in the tax provision as they occur.
  Adoption of these accounting changes, in aggregate, did  not
have a material
impact on 1992 results of operations.  
  The  table below shows the components of the cumulative effect
of accounting
changes.

  Legal Settlement and Special Charges
In  December 1992,  Johnson  &  Johnson  agreed  to pay  3M  $129 
million  in
settlement of  a patent lawsuit involving 3M orthopedic casting
materials.  3M
received payment in January 1993.

In 1992,  3M  recorded $115  million of  special charges 
designed to  enhance
competitiveness and productivity.   About 75 percent of these 
charges related
to asset write-downs, including rationalization of manufacturing
operations.

  Long-Term Debt
 Employee Stock Ownership Plan:  In 1989,  the company
established an Employee
Stock Ownership Plan  (ESOP).  The  ESOP borrowed $548  million. 
Because  the
company  has guaranteed  repayment  of the  ESOP  debt, the  debt
and  related
unearned compensation are recorded on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.
 Medium-Term Notes:   3M maintains a  shelf registration  with
the  Securities
and Exchange Commission that provides the means to offer
medium-term notes not
to exceed $601 million.  As  of December 31, 1993, $502 million 
was available
for future  financial  needs.   The company  entered into 
interest rate  swap
agreements  to achieve  variable interest  rates below  U.S.
commercial  paper
rates  for  notes  outstanding.    The  effective  rate  of 
these  agreements
approximated 2.5 percent at year-end 1993.
 Other  Borrowings:   These  are primarily  borrowings  of 3M's 
international
companies and municipal  bond issues  in the  United States.  
Interest  rates
range mainly from 2.3 to 11.0 percent.

 Maturities of long-term  debt for the next  five years are as 
follows: 1994,
$79  million; 1995,  $168 million; 1996,  $44 million; 1997,  $41
million; and
1998, $159 million.
 Interest  payments included  in  the  Consolidated  Statement of 
Cash  Flows
totaled $53  million in 1993,  $88 million in 1992  and $118
million  in 1991.
For the calendar year 1992, interest payments were $79 million.
 The  company  estimates  that  the  fair  value  of  long-term 
debt  is  not
materially different than the carrying amount of this debt.

  Other Financial Instruments
The company  has entered  into interest  rate and currency 
swaps, as  well as
forward interest rate  agreements, with face amounts of  $605
million and $308
million, respectively,  as of December 31,  1993, and 1992.   The
company uses



these  instruments to manage risk from interest rate and currency
fluctuations
and to  lower its  cost of  borrowing.   The unrealized  gains
and  losses are
deferred until the  underlying transactions are realized.  As  of
December 31,
1993, the unrealized gains and losses were not material.
 The company also had foreign exchange forward and option
contracts with  face
amounts  of $704 million and $785 million, respectively, at
December 31, 1993,
and 1992.   The  company uses these  financial instruments
primarily  to hedge
transactions  denominated in  foreign currencies,  thereby
reducing  risk from
exchange rate  fluctuations in the regular course of its global
business.  The
net unrealized  gain on  these  contracts as  of December  31, 
1993, was  not
material.

 Net deferred tax assets totaled $439 million ($293 million
current) and net
 deferred tax liabilities totaled $98 million ($6 million

 1993.  The major components of deferred taxes include benefit
costs not
 currently deductible of $336 million and accelerated
depreciation for tax
 purposes of $362 million.
 Income tax payments included in the Consolidated Statement of
Cash Flows
 totaled $802 million in 1993, $743 million in 1992 and $867
million in 1991.
 For calendar year 1992, income tax payments were $714 million.
 At December 31, 1993, there were approximately $2.850 billion of
retained
 earnings attributable to our international companies that are
considered to
 be permanently invested.  No provision has been made for taxes
that might be
 payable if these earnings were remitted to the United States. 
It is not
 practical to determine the amount of incremental tax that might
arise should
 these earnings be remitted.























  Retirement Plans
3M has  various company-sponsored retirement plans  covering
substantially all
U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. 
Pension benefits
are based principally on an employee's years of  service and
compensation near
retirement.    Plan  assets  are  invested  in  common   stocks, 
fixed-income
securities, real estate and other investments.
 The company's  funding  policy  is to  deposit  with an 
independent  trustee
amounts at least equal to those  required by law.  A trust fund 
is maintained
to provide pension benefits to plan participants  and their
beneficiaries.  In
addition,  a number  of  plans  are  maintained  by  deposits 
with  insurance
companies.
  The charge to income  relating to these plans was $203 million
in 1993, $178
million in 1992 and $133 million in 1991.


        


  Other Postretirement Benefits
The company provides health care and life insurance benefits for
substantially
all  of its  U.S. employees  who reach  retirement age  while
employed  by the
company.   The  company has set  aside funds  with an 
independent trustee for
these postretirement  benefits and makes  periodic contributions
to  the plan.
The assets  held by the trustee are invested in common stocks and
fixed-income
securities.   Employees outside the  United States are  covered
principally by
government-sponsored plans  and the cost  of company-provided
plans  for these
employees is not material.
 The table below sets forth the components of the net  periodic
postretirement
benefit cost and  a reconciliation of the funded  status of the
postretirement
benefit plan for U.S. employees.

     $(366)

 The  accumulated postretirement  benefit obligation and  related
benefit cost
are determined through the application of relevant actuarial
assumptions.  The
company anticipates its  health care cost trend rate to  slow
from 7.5 percent
in  1994 to 5.0  percent in 2003,  after which the  trend rate is 
expected to
stabilize.   The  effect of  a one  percentage point  increase in 
the assumed
health care  cost trend rate for  each future year would 
increase the benefit
obligation by  $57 million and the current year benefit expense
by $4 million.
Other  actuarial assumptions include an  expected long-term rate 
of return on
plan assets of 9.0 percent (before taxes applicable to a portion
of the return
on plan assets), and a discount rate of 7.25 percent.
 The charge to  income relating to  these plans was $54  million
in 1993,  $50
million in 1992 and $51 million in 1991.

  Other Postemployment Benefits
 In 1992, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement  No. 112,
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment  Benefits." 
Postemployment benefits
include,  but  are  not limited  to,  disability,  severance  and
health  care
benefits.   3M will  adopt this standard in  the first quarter 
of 1994.  This
adoption will have a diminimus effect on the company's results of
operations. 





  Employee Stock Ownership Plan
The   company  maintains   an  Employee   Stock  Ownership  Plan  
(ESOP)  for
substantially all full-time U.S. employees.  This plan was
established in 1989
as  a  cost-effective  way  of  funding certain  employee 
retirement  savings
benefits, including  the company's  matching  contributions under 
its  401(k)
employee savings plan.  The  ESOP borrowed $548 million and used 
the proceeds
to purchase 7.7  million shares of the company's common stock,
previously held
in  treasury.  The  debt is being serviced  by dividends on 
stock held by the
ESOP and by  company contributions.   These  contributions are 
reported as  a
benefit expense.

  Employee Savings Plan
The company  sponsors an  employee savings  plan under  Section
401(k) of  the
Internal  Revenue Code.   This  plan covers  substantially all 
full-time U.S.
employees.  The company matches  employee contributions of up to
6  percent of
compensation at rates  ranging from 35  to 85 percent, depending 
upon company
performance.   Amounts  charged against  income were $29  million
in  1993 and
1992, and $28 million in 1991.

  General Employees' Stock Purchase Plan
Participants in the General Employees' Stock Purchase Plan are
granted options
at 85 percent  of market value at  the date of grant.   At
December 31,  1993,
there were  23,216 participants in the plan, with 58,058
employees eligible to
participate.  Options must be exercised within 27 months from
date of grant.
