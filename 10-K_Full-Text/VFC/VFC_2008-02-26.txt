PART I

Item 1. Business.

V.F. Corporation, organized in 1899, is a worldwide leader in branded lifestyle apparel and related
products. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “VF,” “we,” “us” and “our” used herein
refer to V.F. Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. Our stated vision is: VF will grow by
building lifestyle brands that excite consumers around the world.

For over 100 years, VF has grown by offering consumers high quality, high value branded apparel and
related products. Since 2004, we have been implementing a growth plan that is transforming VF’s mix
of business to include more lifestyle brands. Lifestyle brands are those brands that connect
closely with consumers because they are aspirational and inspirational; they reflect consumers’
specific activities and interests. Lifestyle brands generally extend across multiple product
categories and have high margins and strong revenue growth rates. Accordingly, this
transformation has included the acquisitions of several growing lifestyle brands, such as

Vans

Ò

,

Reef

Ò

,

Kipling

Ò

,

Napapijri

Ò

,

7 For All
Mankind

Ò

and

lucy

Ò

.
At the same time, we have continued to make investments in our other businesses, such as extension of

The North
Face

â

brand to new product categories and new markets, investments in our

Nautica

â

men’s and women’s sportswear and in

Nautica

â

brand equity, expansion of

Lee

â

,

Wrangler

â

and other brands into Asian and Eastern European
markets, and acquisitions of the

Majestic

â

brand of athletic apparel and of a
business having rights to market the licensed

Harley-Davidson

Ò

brand for apparel.


An
important step in the continued transformation of VF was the sale in 2007 of our women’s intimate apparel
business, which had lower profit and growth prospects. This business, which had 2006 revenues in
excess of $800 million, included all of VF’s domestic and international women’s intimate apparel
business units. The women’s intimate apparel business is separately reported as discontinued
operations in this Annual Report. The remaining discussion of VF’s business, unless otherwise
stated, is focused on VF’s continuing operations. See additional discussion in Note C to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, included at Item 8 of this report, regarding our discontinued
operations.

Accordingly,
with acquisitions of growing lifestyle brands and  the sale of our women’s intimate apparel
business, VF is a far different company today than it was four years ago. And with the continuing
execution of our growth plan, VF is expected to be a different company five years from
now.

VF is a
highly diversified apparel company — across brands, product categories, channels of
distribution and geographies. VF owns a broad portfolio of brands in
the jeanswear, outerwear, packs, footwear, sportswear and occupational
apparel. These products are marketed to
consumers shopping in specialty stores, upscale and traditional department stores, national chains
and mass merchants. In addition, many products are sold directly to consumers through VF-operated
retail stores and internet sites, as well as monobrand retail stores operated by independent
parties. A global company, VF derives 28% of its revenues from outside the United States,
primarily in Europe, Canada, Latin America and Asia. VF products are
also sold in some geographic
areas through  licensees and distributors. To provide many types of products across numerous
channels of distribution in different geographic areas, we have implemented a strategy that
balances efficient and flexible internally-owned manufacturing with sourcing of finished goods from
independent contractors. An array of state-of-the-art technologies
enable us to get the right
products to our customers at the right time.

VF’s
businesses are organized primarily into product categories, and by brands within those
categories, for both management and internal financial reporting purposes. These groupings of
businesses are called “coalitions” and consist of the following: Jeanswear, Outdoor, Imagewear,
Sportswear and Contemporary Brands. The Contemporary Brands Coalition was formed in August 2007
with the acquisitions of Seven For All Mankind, LLC and lucy activewear, inc. These coalitions are
treated as reportable segments for financial reporting purposes.
Coalition management has responsibility to build their brands, with certain financial, administrative and systems
support and disciplines provided by consolidated functions within VF.

We consider our Outdoor, Sportswear and Contemporary Brands coalitions to be our lifestyle
coalitions. These are VF’s growth engines, where we expect long-term revenue and profit
growth at a mid-single digit to low-double digit rate. Our Jeanswear and Imagewear coalitions are
our heritage businesses where our focus is on strong profitability and cash flows, with
revenue growth at a low-single digit rate.

Jeanswear Coalition

The Jeanswear Coalition markets jeanswear and related casual products in the United
States and in many international markets. The largest of these brands, the

Lee

â

and

Wrangler

â

brands, have long-standing traditions as
authentic American jeans brands as they were established in 1889 and 1947, respectively, and have
strong market positions.

Lee

â

and

Wrangler

â

products are
sold in nearly every developed country. Products also include shorts,
casual pants, knit and woven tops and outerwear,
which are designed to complement the jeanswear products and have helped to extend our brands.


In domestic markets,

Lee

â

products are sold primarily through national chain
stores and specialty stores.

Wrangler

â

westernwear is marketed through western
specialty stores. The

Wrangler Hero

â

,

Rustler

â

and

Riders

â

brands are marketed to mass merchant and regional discount stores.
Overall, VF’s jeans brands are sold in the U.S. marketplace in
channels where there is significant volume
and less fashion risk. Despite significant competitive activity, VF’s domestic jeanswear revenues
have been stable in recent years. Including all of its jeanswear brands, we believe that VF has
the largest unit market share of jeans in the United States and is one of the largest marketers of
jeans in the world. We also market cotton casual pants under the

Lee
Casuals

â

,

Timber Creek by Wrangler

â

and

Wrangler

â

Khakis

brands.

We believe
our vendor managed inventory and retail floor space management
programs with several
of our major retailer customers give us a competitive advantage in our domestic jeanswear business.
We receive point-of-sale information from these customers on a daily basis, on an individual store
and style-size-color stockkeeping unit (“SKU”) level. We
then ship products based on that data to ensure the customers’ selling
floors are appropriately stocked with products that match their
shoppers’ needs. Our systems capabilities allow
us to analyze our retail customer’s sales, demographic and geographic data to develop product
assortment recommendations that maximize the productivity of
their jeanswear selling space and minimize their investment in inventory.

Jeanswear
in most international markets is more fashion-oriented and has a
higher selling price
than similar products in the United States. The jeans market internationally is also more
fragmented than in the United States, with competitors ranging from global brands to a number of
smaller national or regional brands.

VF’s largest international jeanswear business is located in Western Europe.

Lee

â

and

Wrangler

â

jeanswear products are sold through department stores and specialty
stores where we employ some of the same retail floor space management
programs described above.

Hero by Wrangler

â

,

Maverick

â

and

Old Axe

â

products are sold to hypermarket and discount stores. We also market

Lee

â

and

Wrangler

â

products to mass market and specialty stores in Canada and Mexico, as
well as to department stores and specialty stores in Asia and South America. In many international
markets, we are expanding our reach through VF-operated retail stores, an increasingly important
vehicle for presenting our brands’ image and marketing message directly to consumers. In addition,

Lee

â

and

Wrangler

â

products are

sold in over 400
independently operated monobrand retail stores, primarily in Eastern Europe and South America.

Lee

â

products are also manufactured and marketed in Spain and Portugal through a
50%-owned joint venture. We are continuing to expand our jeanswear brands in emerging markets,
such as China and Russia, and in 2006 entered into a majority-owned joint venture to design and
market VF-branded products in India, including the

Lee

â

and

Wrangler

â

brands. In foreign markets where VF does not have owned operations,

Lee

â

and

Wrangler

â

jeanswear and related products are marketed
through distributors, agents or licensees.

In the United States, we believe our Jeanswear Coalition brands can grow
in the mass market and national chain channels of distribution and through extension into new product
categories. In our international businesses, growth will be driven by (i) upgraded product,
positioning and marketing in Europe, (ii) expansion of our existing businesses in China, Russia and
India and (iii) continued rollout of new retail stores.

Outdoor Coalition

The Outdoor Coalition, VF’s fastest growing business, is a group of outdoor activity-based
businesses that represent a collection of lifestyle brands. Product offerings include outerwear,
sportswear, footwear, equipment, backpacks, daypacks, luggage and accessories.


As our largest Outdoor Coalition brand,

The North Face

â

high performance outdoor
apparel, equipment and footwear is sold across North and South America, Europe and Asia. (In
Japan and South Korea,

The North Face

â

trademarks are owned by a third party.)
During 2007, VF reacquired rights from a licensee to market

The North Face

â

products in China and Nepal.

The North Face

â

apparel lines consist of outerwear,
snow sports gear and functional sportswear and footwear for men, women and children. Equipment
consists of tents, sleeping bags, backpacks, daypacks and
accessories. Many of

The North
Face

â

products are designed for extreme applications, such as high altitude
mountaineering and ice and rock climbing, although many consumers
also purchase these products because
they represent a lifestyle to which they aspire.

The North Face

â

products are
marketed through specialty outdoor and premium sporting goods stores in the United States, Canada
and Europe and select department stores in the United States. In addition, these products are sold
through approximately 30 VF-operated full price retail and outlet stores in the United States and
Europe, as well as over 100 monobrand retail stores operated by independent third parties dedicated
to selling

The North Face

â

products in Europe and Asia.

VF manufactures and markets

Vans

â

performance and casual footwear and apparel for
skateboard, bicycle motocross (“BMX”), surf and snow sports participants and enthusiasts. Products
are sold on a wholesale basis through national chain  stores in the United States and through skate and
surf shops and specialty stores in the United States and Europe. The
brand’s products are also sold through approximately 180 owned full-price

Vans

â

retail stores and outlet stores in the
United States, primarily on the West Coast, and in key European markets. These retail stores carry
a wide variety of

Vans

â

footwear, along with a growing assortment of apparel and
accessory items, most of which bear the

Vans

â

trademarks. The

Vans

â

brand is marketed through a 50%-owned joint venture in Mexico. VF is the 70% owner of the

Vans Warped Tour

Ò

music festival, which presents over 50 alternative rock and
heavy metal bands in performances in over 40 cities across North America each summer.

JanSport

â

backpacks and luggage are sold through department and national chain stores,
as well as sports specialty stores and college bookstores in the United States.

JanSport

â

daypacks have a leading market share in the United States. A technical
line of

JanSport

â

backpacks is sold through outdoor and sporting goods stores.

JanSport

â

fleece and T-shirts imprinted with college logos are sold through
college bookstores and department stores in the United States. In Europe,

Eastpak

â

and

JanSport

â

backpacks, and a line of

Eastpak

â

clothing,

are sold primarily through department and specialty
stores, where the

Eastpak

Ò

brand is the leading backpack brand. The

JanSport

â

and

Eastpak

â

brands are also marketed throughout Asia
by licensees and distributors. In 2007, VF acquired the maker of

Eagle Creek

â

adventure travel gear.

Eagle Creek

â

products include luggage, daypacks and
accessories sold through department and specialty stores throughout the United States and Europe.

Derived
from the Finnish word for Arctic Circle,

Napapijri

â

is a premium-priced brand of
outdoor-inspired casual outerwear, sportswear and accessories for men, women and children. Products are sold on a wholesale basis primarily to
European specialty shops, such as sport stores and fashion boutiques, and through VF-operated and
independently-operated retail stores in Italy, France, Belgium and Germany. The

Napapijri

â

brand enjoys, especially strong consumer awareness in Italy, where it
was created, and is expanding strongly across Europe. In 2007, VF entered into a majority-owned
joint venture to market

Napapijri

â

brand products in Japan. In addition to
continued growth overseas, the

Napapijri

â

brand was introduced in the United
States on a limited basis through upper-tier department stores and VF-operated retail stores.

Kipling

Ò

handbags, shoulder bags, backpacks, luggage and accessories are stylish,
colorful and fun products that are both practical and
durable. The brand name comes from the author of

The Jungle Book

, Rudyard Kipling, and that
provides the connection to the

Kipling

Ò

monkey mascot, which symbolizes fun and
adventure. A colorful monkey key ring is attached to every bag, with a different monkey design for
each product collection. Products are sold through specialty stores in Europe, Asia and South
America, as well as through approximately 30 VF-operated and over 100 independently-operated retail
stores. The

Kipling

Ò

business in North America is managed as part of the
Sportswear Coalition.


The

Reef

Ò

brand of surf-inspired products includes sandals, apparel, shoes and
accessories marketed primarily to surf shops and department and specialty chain stores. Since its
acquisition in 2005, we have significantly expanded the

Reef

Ò

brand’s presence in
Europe by acquiring rights to certain geographic areas previously held by independent distributors.
The line of

Reef

Ò

men’s apparel was expanded in 2007, and women’s swimwear will
be launched in 2008.

We expect continued healthy growth in our Outdoor coalition as we expand into new product
categories, open additional retail stores, expand geographically and acquire additional
activity-based lifestyle brands.

Imagewear Coalition

The Imagewear Coalition consists of an occupational apparel division and an activewear division,
each representing approximately one-half of coalition revenues.

Occupational
workwear, career and safety apparel are sold by the Imagewear Coalition under the

Red
Kap

â

,

Bulwark

â

,

The Force

â

and

Chef
Designs

™

brands in North America. Approximately two-thirds of these sales are to
industrial laundries, resellers and distributors that in turn supply work clothes to employers,
primarily on a rental basis, for on-the-job wear by production, service and white-collar personnel.
Products include work pants, slacks, work and dress shirts, overalls, jackets and smocks

.

Since
industrial laundries maintain minimal inventories of work clothes, a supplier’s ability to offer
rapid delivery is an important factor in this market. Our commitment to customer service,
supported by an automated central distribution center with several satellite locations, has enabled
customer orders to be filled within 24 hours of receipt and has helped the

Red
Kap

â

brand obtain a significant share of the industrial laundry rental business.

The remaining part of the occupational apparel division is developing and managing corporate image
uniform and casual apparel programs for selected national accounts, primarily through over 70
catalog web sites maintained for major business customers (e.g., FedEx Corporation, Air Canada,
Continental Airlines and American Airlines) and governmental organizations (e.g., U.S. Customs and
Border Protection, Transportation Security Administration, National Park Service, Fire Department
of New York City and New York City Transit Authority). These web sites give more than 700,000
employees of these customers the convenience of shopping for their work and career apparel via the
internet.

In the
Imagewear Coalition’s activewear division, we design and market decorated sports apparel
under licenses granted by Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the National
Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Inc., NASCAR,
ESPN, Inc. and many major colleges and universities. Under license from Major League Baseball,

Majestic

â

brand  uniforms are worn exclusively on-field by all 30 major league
teams. Adult and youth-size authentic, replica jersey and casual
fanwear are sold through department, sporting goods and athletic specialty stores. Adult and youth
sports apparel products marketed under other licensed labels are distributed through department,
sporting goods and athletic specialty  stores.

The Imagewear
Coalition’s  growth in recent years has been driven by
(i) the 2007 acquisition of the

Majestic

â

brand and related assets, (ii) expansion
of the National Football League contract to include additional apparel categories, (iii) increased
fan interest in both the National Football League and Major League Baseball, (iv) acquisition of a
business having rights to market licensed

Harley-Davidson

â

branded apparel and (v)
use of VF’s retail floor space management and replenishment capabilities to put the right product
assortment on the retailers’ sales floor in each geographic
market.

Looking forward we intend to drive occupational apparel and activewear growth by leveraging Imagewear’s ability to
manage a complex mix of products where speed-to-market, product customization and superior service
give us a competitive advantage.


Sportswear Coalition

The

Nautica

â

brand is the principal lifestyle brand of the Sportswear Coalition.

Nautica

â

sportswear is marketed in the department store and specialty
store channels of distribution in the United States. The department store channel has undergone significant consolidation in the
last three years, resulting in numerous store closings and negatively impacting sales of

Nautica

â

brand products. The
principal

Nautica

â

product line is men’s sportswear, noted for its classic
styling.

Nautica

â

is the number two men’s sportswear brand in
department stores. Other men’s

Nautica

â

product lines include men’s
outerwear, underwear, swimwear and sleepwear. The

Nautica Jeans
Company

â

line features fashionable jeanswear and related tops for younger
male consumers. A collection of

Nautica

â

women’s sportswear was launched in a limited number of department
store doors in Fall 2006, with additional doors added in 2007.

Nautica

â

women’s sportswear has not met our
expectations, but we are refining the product offerings and assortments to position this line for
the future.

The Sportswear Coalition operates approximately 120

Nautica

â

retail outlet stores
in better outlet malls across the United States. These stores also  carry

Nautica

â

merchandise for men, women, boys and girls. The product styles sold in the outlet stores are
different from the

Nautica

â

styles sold to department and specialty store
wholesale customers. These outlet stores also carry

Nautica

â

merchandise from
licensees to complete their product assortment. In addition, independent licensees operate over

Nautica

â

brand retail stores across the world.

The

Nautica

â

brand is licensed in the United States for apparel categories
not produced by VF (e.g., tailored clothing, dress shirts, neckwear, women’s swimwear, accessories
such as fragrances, watches, eyewear) and for nonapparel categories (e.g., bedroom and bathroom
linens).

Nautica

â

products are licensed for sale in over
40 countries outside the United States.  Wholesale sales of

Nautica

â

licensed products
total approximately $500 million on an annual basis.

The

John Varvatos

â

brand is a rapidly growing luxury apparel and accessories
collection for men, including tailored clothing, sportswear, footwear and accessories. The

John
Varvatos

¯

USA

â

line of tailored clothing, sportswear and
accessories was introduced in 2006 to appeal to a younger consumer at
somewhat more accessible price points. Products are sold through
upscale department and specialty stores primarily in the United States, as well as through five
showcase

John Varvatos

â

retail locations. This business is 80% owned by VF, with
the balance owned by Mr. John Varvatos.

The Sportswear Coalition also includes the

Kipling

â

business in North America

.

Kipling

â

handbags and accessories are sold through specialty stores, department
stores and VF-operated retail stores. About two-thirds of products are the same as those sold in
Europe, with the remainder designed specifically for the U.S. market.

We believe
there is growth potential in each of our Sportswear brands.

Contemporary Brands Coalition

Contemporary
Brands, our newest coalition, is focused on upscale lifestyle brands. Formed in August 2007,
it is currently composed of the

7 For All Mankind

â

and

lucy

â

brands.

7 For All Mankind

â

is a Los Angeles-based brand of luxury denim jeans and related
products — knit and woven tops, sweaters, jackets and  accessories — for women and men. Products are
noted for their fit and for innovation in design, fabric and finish. The

7 For All
Mankind

â

brand is the leading premium jeans brand in the United States, with the
premium segment defined as jeans retailing for $100 or more. Retail price points for the brand’s
core jeans range from $149 - $199 for basics, with higher price points for more fashion-forward
products. With approximately three-fourths of sales in the United States, the
brand is marketed


through upscale department stores, such as Bloomingdale’s, Macy’s, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and
Saks, and through specialty stores. International sales, primarily in Europe, are through
department stores, such as Harrods, and specialty stores. We are
pursuing growth opportunities in several areas
— direct-to-consumer expansion through company-operated retail stores and ecommerce, additional
sportswear product offerings, geographic expansion and licensing.

Based in Portland, Oregon, the

lucy

â

brand of women’s lifestyle apparel is
marketed through approximately 60

lucy

â

branded retail stores across the United
States and via the internet.

lucy

â

is an activewear brand designed for
versatility, comfort and fit for today’s active
woman.

While other activewear brands are targeted primarily at serious athletes or male
consumers,

lucy

â

is a functional and stylish brand that women can wear from
workout to weekend. Currently approximately 85% of the products in the

lucy

â

retail stores are

lucy

â

branded, with the balance of the offerings being
complementary lines, including

Reef

â

sandals. Looking forward, we expect that substantially all of the products in the stores will be

lucy

â

branded, and we plan to significantly expand the number of retail stores.

We expect
to grow the

7 For All Mankind

â

brand through retail and international
expansion and new product lines.

lucy

â

will grow through opening stores in new markets. We also expect that there are
opportunities to leverage VF’s supply chain capabilities for
both brands for future profitability improvements.

Direct-To-Consumer Operations

VF-operated
retail stores are an integral part of our strategy for growing VF’s brands,
particularly our  lifestyle brands. Our full price retail stores allow us to showcase
a brand’s full line of current season products, with fixturing and imagery that support the brand’s
positioning. These stores provide high visibility for our brands and products and enable us to
stay close to the needs and preferences of consumers. The proper presentation of products in our
retail stores also helps to increase consumer purchases of VF products at
our wholesale customers. VF-operated retail stores provide strong
operating profits and a good return on our investment. In
addition, outlet stores serve an important role in our overall inventory management by allowing VF
to effectively sell a significant portion of discontinued and out-of-season products at better
prices than are otherwise available from outside parties, while maintaining the integrity of our
brands.

Our
growing global retail operations include 560 stores that sell

The
North Face

â

, Vans

â

, Napapijri

â

,
Kipling

â

,

7 For All Mankind

â

,

lucy

â

,

Nautica

â

,
Lee

â

or

Wrangler

â

products.
Most of these
retail stores offer products at full price, while some are in outlet locations offering products at
discounted prices. These stores are generally monobrand stores,
meaning that only one brand’s products are offered in each
store. In addition to these primarily monobrand retail and outlet stores, we operate 76 VF Outlet stores
across the United States that sell a broad selection of excess quantities of first quality VF
products (plus women’s intimate apparel and childrenswear, both product categories that VF has
exited in recent years but which consumers expect to find in VF Outlet stores).


Across the
globe, internet sales (i.e., ecommerce) comprise a small but growing portion of total retail
apparel, footwear and accessories sales. Ecommerce sales of apparel and footwear have become the
second largest category of ecommerce purchases in the United States
(behind travel purchases). At VF, ecommerce is a growing portion of
our revenues as we
currently market the

Lee

â

,

Vans

â

,

7 For
All
Mankind

â

,

lucy

â

and

Kipling

â

brands directly to
consumers. Additional ecommerce sites, including sites offering

The North
Face

â

and

Nautica

â

products, will be rolled out for consumers in
2008.

Total retail store and ecommerce sales accounted for 14% of
VF’s consolidated Total Revenues in both 2007 and 2006. We expect our direct-to-consumer business
to continue to grow at a faster pace than VF’s overall growth
rate.  Capital
investments of approximately $60 million are planned for leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment for approximately
100 new retail locations during 2008.

In
addition to the direct-to-consumer venues operated by VF, our licensees, distributors and other independent
parties currently sell several of our brands through over 900 independently-operated monobrand
retail stores located primarily in Eastern Europe and Asia.

Licensing Arrangements

As part of our business strategy of expanding market penetration of owned brands, we enter into
licensing agreements for specific apparel and complementary product categories in identified
geographic regions if such arrangements with independent parties can provide more effective
manufacturing, distribution and marketing of such products than could be achieved internally.
These licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of VF brands and
are for fixed terms of generally five years, with conditional renewal options. Each licensee pays royalties to VF based
on its sales of licensed products, with most agreements providing
for a minimum royalty requirement. Royalties
generally range from 5% to 7% of the licensing partners’ net sales of licensed
products. Gross Royalty Income was approximately $78 million in each of 2007 and 2006, with the
largest contribution from the

Nautica

Ò

brand.

In addition, licensees are generally required to spend a specified amount to advertise VF’s
products ranging from 1% to 5% of their net licensed product sales. In some cases, these
advertising amounts are remitted to VF for advertising on behalf of the licensees. We provide
support to these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand names by taking
an active role in the design, quality control, advertising, marketing and distribution of each
licensed product.

VF has also entered into license agreements to use third-party trademarks. Apparel is marketed
under licenses granted by Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the National
Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Inc., NASCAR,
ESPN, Inc. and major colleges, most of which contain minimum annual licensing and advertising
requirements.

We believe that the loss of any license, with VF as either licensor or licensee, would not have a
material adverse effect on VF.

Manufacturing, Sourcing and Distribution


Product design, fit, fabric, finish and
 quality are important in all of our businesses. These functions are
performed by employees located within each of our branded businesses across the globe.

VF’s centralized global supply chain
organization sources product and ultimately bears the
responsibility to deliver product to our customers. VF is
highly skilled in managing the complexity associated with the
supply chain — 600 million units and 600,000 SKUs
spread over 30 brands, 40 VF-operated and 1,400 contractor manufacturing facilities, over 30
distribution centers and over 600 retail stores. Managing this complexity is made possible by our
use of information systems technologies — with best-of-breed systems for product development,
forecasting, order management, warehouse management, etc. attached to our core enterprise resource
management platform.

Our
domestic Jeanswear and Imagewear businesses operate owned manufacturing facilities (primarily
cutting, sewing and finishing) principally located in Mexico and Central America. Our
international jeanswear businesses operate manufacturing facilities located in Poland and Turkey.
For these owned production plants, we purchase raw materials from numerous domestic and
international suppliers to meet scheduled production needs. Raw materials include fabrics made from cotton,
synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn, as well as thread and trim (product
identification, buttons, zippers and snaps). In some limited
instances we contract the sewing of VF-owned raw materials into
finished product with independent contractors in the United States, Mexico and
Central America. While we obtain fixed
price commitments for denim and certain supplies for up to one year in advance, specific purchase
obligations with suppliers are typically limited to the succeeding
two to six months. Our only long-term  contract for the purchase of raw materials or finished products is a commitment in connection with the sale of VF’s childrenswear
business in 2004. This agreement requires VF to
purchase approximately $93 million of finished product for sale through our VF
Outlet stores, with a minimum  commitment of $15 million per year. No single supplier represents more than 3%
of our total cost of sales.

Our current sourcing strategy for products sold in the United States
includes a balance of VF-owned production in the Western
Hemisphere, contracted production in the Western Hemisphere and
contracted production from Asia. Owned production generally has a lower cost than
contracted production. Product obtained from contractors in the Western Hemisphere generally has
 higher cost but gives us greater flexibility and shorter lead times and
allows for  lower inventory
levels as compared with production obtained from the Far East and other more distant resources.
Approximately 44% of units sold in the
United States and 28% of the dollar value of domestic Net Sales in 2007 were manufactured in
VF-owned facilities, primarily in Mexico and Central America, with the balance obtained from
contractors, primarily in Asia. This combination of VF-owned and contracted production, along with different geographic regions and
cost structures, provides a balanced approach to product sourcing.

To an increasing extent, we are using independent contractors who own the raw materials and ship
only finished, ready-for-sale products to VF. These contractors are engaged through VF sourcing
hubs in Hong Kong (with several satellite offices across Asia) and Miami. These hubs are
responsible for product procurement, product quality assurance, supplier management, transportation
and shipping functions in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, respectively. Substantially all
products in the Outdoor and Sportswear Coalitions, as well as a growing portion of product
requirements for our Jeanswear and Imagewear Coalitions, are obtained through these sourcing hubs.
For most products in our Contemporary Brands Coalition, we currently contract the sewing and
finishing of VF-owned raw materials through a network of independent domestic and international
contractors; some of this volume will be shifted to the VF sourcing hubs during 2008.

Today, 26% of our total Net Sales relates to products manufactured in VF-owned facilities in
Mexico, Europe and Central America and 74% relates to products obtained from contractors, primarily
in Asia. Where we manufacture in VF-owned facilities, our product costs are lower than any
available on a global basis for like products. We believe a combination of VF-owned and contracted
production from different geographic regions provides flexibility and a competitive advantage in
our product sourcing.

Management continually monitors new developments and risks related to duties, tariffs and quotas.  We limit VF’s sourcing
exposure through, among other measures, (i) extensive geographic diversification with a mix of
VF-operated and contracted production, (ii) shifts of production among countries and contractors, (iii) allocation of
production to merchandise categories where the free flow of product is available and (iv) sourcing
from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements. We will continue to manage our
supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production
environment.

All contracted production must meet VF’s high quality standards. Further, each of the
approximately 1,400 independent contractor facilities that manufacture products for VF must be
pre-certified prior to performance of any production on VF’s behalf. This pre-certification
includes passing a factory inspection and signing a VF Terms of Engagement agreement. These
requirements provide strict standards covering age of workers, hours


of work, health and safety conditions and conformity with local laws. We also require our
independent licensees and their contractors to comply with these standards. We maintain an ongoing
audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated internal and
outsourced staff. Additional information about VF’s Global Compliance Principles, Terms of
Engagement, Factory Audit Procedure and Factory Compliance Guidelines, along with a Global
Compliance Report, are available on the VF website at www.vfc.com.

VF did not experience difficulty in filling its raw material and contracting production needs
during 2007. We do not anticipate difficulties in  meeting our raw materials and contracting
production requirements during 2008. The loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a
significant adverse effect on our business.

Product is
shipped from our independent suppliers and VF-operated manufacturing
plants to many
distribution centers in the United States and international markets, as well as directly to our
customers. Product is inspected, sorted and stored in our distribution centers until needed for
packing and shipping to our wholesale customers or our retail stores. Most distribution centers
support multiple brands. Our distribution centers use computer-controlled inventory management
technology for efficient tracking and movement of products.


Seasonality

With its diversified product offerings, VF’s operating results are somewhat seasonal. On
a quarterly basis and excluding the effect of businesses acquired during 2007, consolidated Total
Revenues for 2007 ranged from a low of approximately 21% of full year revenues in the second
quarter to a high of 29% in the third quarter. This disparity results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues
of our Outdoor Coalition. Approximately 19% of Outdoor Coalition
revenues occurred in the second quarter and 34% in the third quarter of 2007. With recent acquisitions,
growth of our retail operations and other changes in our business, historical quarterly revenue and
expense trends may not be indicative of future trends, and the
portion of annual revenues occurring in the second half
of the year is expected to increase.

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital increases during the first
half of the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then decreases
during the second half of the year as those inventories are sold. Cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the
second half of the year due to higher net income and reduced working capital requirements during
that period.

Advertising and Customer Support

We support VF’s brands through extensive advertising and promotional programs that promote specific
products or convey a lifestyle image for a specific brand. We advertise in consumer and trade
publications, on national and local radio and television and on the internet. We also participate
in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print media, radio and
television. We sponsor various sporting, music and other special events and sponsor a number of
athletes and other personalities. In addition, we provide point-of-sale fixtures and signage to
our wholesale customers to enhance the presentation of our products in their retail locations.
This includes shop-in-shops, which are separate retail sales areas for a specific VF brand within a
department store or other retail customer location.

We also participate in various retail customer incentive programs. These incentive programs with
retailers include discounts, cooperative advertising funds and margin support funds. We also offer
sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of rebate and coupon offers. Sales incentive offers with retailers and with consumers are recognized as sales discounts in
arriving at reported Net Sales (except that cooperative advertising reimbursements of retailer
advertising costs, which are documented and independently verified to support their fair value, are
reported as Advertising Expense).

During 2007, we spent $362 million on advertising and
promoting our brands, a 12% increase from the
2006 level. We employ marketing sciences to optimize both the level and impact of advertising and
promotional spending and to identify the types of spending that provide the greatest return on our
marketing investments.

Internet web sites are maintained for most of our brands. Some of them are business-to-consumer
ecommerce sites where consumers can order VF products. Other consumer web sites only provide information
about our brands and products and, in many cases, direct consumers to our wholesale customers where
they can purchase


our products. We also operate several business-to-business sites where our retail customers can order
VF products.

Our
Jeanswear, Outdoor, Sportswear and Contemporary Brands Coalitions employ a staff of in-store marketing and
merchandising coordinators located in major cities across the United States. These individuals
visit our customers’ retail locations to inform the customers’ sales force about our products and
related promotions and to ensure that our products, and those of our licensees, are properly
presented on the merchandise sales floor.

Other Matters

Competitive Factors

Our business depends on our ability to stimulate consumer demand for VF’s brands and products. VF
is well-positioned to compete in the apparel industry by developing consumer-connected and
innovative products at competitive prices, producing high quality merchandise, providing high
levels of service, ensuring product availability to the retail sales floor and enhancing
recognition of its brands. We continually strive to improve on each of these areas. Many of VF’s
brands have long histories and enjoy high recognition within their respective consumer segments.

Trademarks

Trademarks, patents and domain names, as well as their related logos, designs and graphics, have
substantial value in the marketing of VF’s products. We have registered this intellectual property
in the United States and in other countries where our products are manufactured and/or sold. We
vigorously monitor and enforce VF’s intellectual property against counterfeiting, infringement and
violations of other rights where and to the extent legal, feasible and appropriate. In addition,
we grant licenses to other parties to manufacture and sell products utilizing our intellectual
property in product categories and geographic areas in which VF does not operate.

Customers

VF products are primarily sold through our sales force and independent sales agents and
distributors. VF’s customers are specialty stores, department stores, national chains and mass
merchants in the United States and in international markets, primarily in Europe. Sales to VF’s
ten largest customers, all of which are retailers based in the United States, amounted to 27% of
Total Revenues in 2007, 30% in 2006 and 31% in 2005. These larger customers included (in
alphabetical order) Kohl’s Corporation, Macy’s, Inc., J.C. Penney Company, Inc., Sears Holding
Corporation, Target Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Sales to the five largest customers
amounted to approximately 22% of Total Revenues in 2007, 24% in 2006 and 25% in 2005. Sales to
VF’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., totaled 12% of Total Revenues in 2007, 13% in 2006
and 14% in 2005, substantially all of which were in the Jeanswear Coalition. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and to each of the ten largest and five largest customer groups have increased in both
2007 and 2006 but are a smaller percentage of Total Revenues in 2007 and 2006 due to higher growth
rates in our lifestyle businesses, which have a greater portion of their sales to other customers.

Employees

VF employed approximately 54,200 men and women at the end of 2007, of which approximately 20,000
were located in the United States. Approximately 1,000 employees in the United States are covered
by a collective bargaining agreement. In international markets, a significant percentage of
employees are covered by trade-sponsored or governmental bargaining arrangements. Employee
relations are considered to be good.

Backlog

The dollar amount of VF’s order backlog as of any date is not meaningful, may not be indicative of
actual


future shipments and, accordingly, is not material for an understanding of the business of VF taken
as a whole.

The following are the executive officers of VF Corporation as of February 9, 2008, other than
George N. Derhofer who was an executive officer of VF until January 1, 2008. The executive officers are

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating VF’s business and
the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could
materially adversely affect VF’s business, its operating results and its financial condition.


RISKS SPECIFIC TO VF CORPORATION

A substantial portion of VF’s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large
customers. The loss of any of these customers could substantially reduce VF’s profits.

A few of VF’s customers account for a significant portion of revenues. Sales to VF’s ten largest
customers were 27% of Total Revenues in fiscal 2007, with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounting for 12%
of revenues. Sales are generally on a purchase order basis, and we do not have long-term
agreements with any of our customers. A decision by any of VF’s major customers to decrease
significantly the number of products purchased from VF could substantially reduce revenues and have
a material adverse effect on VF’s financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the
retail industry has experienced consolidation and other ownership changes, such as the merger of
Federated Department Stores, Inc. and The May Department Stores Company in 2005 and the merger of
Sears, Roebuck and Company and Kmart Holding Corporation in 2005. In the future, retailers may
further consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations, realign their affiliations or
reposition their stores’ target market. These developments could reduce the number of stores
that carry VF’s products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry. These
changes could both impact VF’s opportunities in the market and increase VF’s reliance on a smaller
number of large customers.

VF’s business could be adversely affected by financial instability experienced by its customers.

During the past several years, various retailers have experienced significant financial
difficulties, which in some cases have resulted in bankruptcies, liquidations and store closings. The financial difficulties of a customer
could result in reduced business with that customer. VF may also assume higher credit risk
relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty. If these developments
occur, our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on VF’s trade accounts
receivable from a major customer could substantially reduce VF’s income and have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition and results of operations.

The apparel industry is highly competitive, and VF’s success depends on its ability to respond to
constantly changing fashion trends and consumer demand. Reduced sales or prices resulting from
competition could have a material adverse effect on VF.

VF competes with numerous brands and manufacturers of apparel. Some of our
competitors may be larger and have more resources than VF in certain product categories. In
addition, VF competes directly with the private label brands of its wholesale customers. VF’s
ability to compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on its ability to:

The failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing markets and trends could
have a material adverse effect on VF’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, if we misjudge fashion trends and market conditions, we could be faced with significant
excess inventories for some products that we may have to sell at a loss or missed opportunities that may result in lost sales.

VF’s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins.


The apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including
intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the
costs of products and changes in consumer demand. These factors may cause us to reduce our sales
prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause VF’s gross margin to decline if we are unable
to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in operating costs. If VF’s sales prices
decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, VF’s
profitability will decline. This could have a material adverse effect on VF’s results of
operations, liquidity and financial condition.

VF
has entered into license agreements to use the trademarks of others.
Loss of a license could have an adverse effect on VF’s operating
results.

VF has
entered into agreements to market products under licenses granted by
third parties, including Major League Baseball, the National Football
League and Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Inc. Some of these
licenses are for a short term and do not contain renewal options,
although we anticipate being able to renew those licenses before the
agreements expire. Loss of a license, which in certain cases could result in
an impairment charge for related intangible assets, could have a material adverse effect
on VF’s operating results.

VF may not succeed in implementing its growth strategy.

One of our key strategic objectives is growth. We seek to grow through both organic growth and
acquisitions, building new growing lifestyle brands, expanding our share with winning customers,
stretching VF’s brands and customers to new geographies, fueling the growth by leveraging our
supply chain and information technology capabilities across VF, expanding our direct-to-consumer
business and building new growth enablers by identifying and developing high potential employees.
We may not be able to grow our existing businesses or achieve planned cost savings from ongoing
businesses. We may have difficulty identifying acquisition targets, and we may not be able to
successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve any expected cost savings or synergies
from such integration. We may not be able to expand our market share with winning customers,
expand our brands geographically or achieve the expected results from our supply chain initiatives.
We may also have difficulty recruiting or developing qualified managers. The failure to implement
its growth strategies may have a material adverse effect on VF’s business.

If VF encounters problems with its distribution system, VF’s ability to deliver its products to the
market would be adversely affected.

VF relies on its distribution facilities to warehouse and, using its own employees or in some cases
independent contractors, to ship product to its customers. VF’s distribution system includes
computer-controlled and automated equipment, which means its operations are complicated and may be
subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of
software and hardware, electronic or power interruptions or other system failures. Because
substantially all of VF’s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations,
VF’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes, floods, fires or other natural disasters
near its distribution centers. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not
adequately protect VF from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in
VF’s distribution facilities, such as the long-term loss of customers or an erosion of brand image.
In addition, VF’s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by
third parties, including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities. If
we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to meet customer expectations,
manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be
materially adversely affected.

VF relies significantly on information technology. Any inadequacy, interruption, integration
failure or security failure of that technology could harm VF’s ability to effectively operate its
business.

Our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on its information
technology systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with
transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, difficulty in integrating new systems or systems
of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the
operations of VF’s business. Moreover, VF and its customers could suffer harm if customer
information were accessed by third parties due to a security failure in VF’s systems. It could
also require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure, problem or breach.

VF uses foreign suppliers and manufacturing facilities for a substantial portion of its raw
materials and finished products, which poses risks to VF’s business operations.

During fiscal 2007, approximately 74% of VF’s products sold were produced by and purchased or
procured from independent manufacturers primarily located in Asia, with substantially all of the remainder produced by VF-owned
and operated


manufacturing
facilities located in Eastern Europe, Mexico and Central America. Although no
single supplier and no one country is critical to VF’s production needs, any of the following could
materially and adversely affect our ability to produce or deliver VF products and, as a result,
have a material adverse effect on VF’s business, financial condition and results of operations:

If VF’s suppliers fail to use acceptable ethical business practices, VF’s business could suffer.

We require third party suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and
regulations regarding working conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance.
Additionally, we require all suppliers making VF-branded apparel, whether directly for VF or for
its licensees, to comply with VF’s Terms of Engagement and Global Compliance Principles. Our staff
and third parties retained for such purposes periodically visit and audit the operations of VF’s
owned and operated facilities and those of independent contractors manufacturing product for VF to
determine compliance. However, we do not control independent manufacturers or their labor and
other business practices. If one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws or
implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical in the United
States, the shipment of finished products to VF could be interrupted, orders could be cancelled,
relationships could be terminated, and VF’s reputation could be damaged. Any of these events could
have a material adverse effect on VF’s revenues and, consequently, its results of operations.

VF’s results of operations could be materially harmed if VF is unable to accurately forecast demand
for its products.

We often schedule internal production and place orders for products with independent manufacturers
before our customers’ orders are firm. Therefore, if we fail to accurately forecast customer
demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our
customers. Factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products
include:

•

An increase or decrease in consumer demand for VF’s products or for products of its
competitors;

•

Our failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance of new products;

•

New product introductions by competitors;

•

Unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in
cancellations of orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by
retailers;


•

Weak economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could
reduce demand for discretionary items such as VF’s products; and

•

Terrorism or acts of war, or the threat of terrorism or acts of war, which could adversely
affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product
and raw materials.

Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs and the sale of
excess inventory at discounted prices, which could have an adverse effect on VF’s results of
operations and financial condition. In addition, if we underestimate demand for our products, our
manufacturing facilities or third party manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet
customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost
revenues, as well as damage to VF’s reputation and customer relationships. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to successfully manage inventory demand to meet future order and
reorder requirements.

The loss of members of VF’s executive management and other key employees could have a material
adverse effect on its business.

VF depends
on the services and management experience of its executive officers
and business leaders who have substantial
experience and expertise in VF’s business. VF also depends on other key employees involved in the
operation of its business. Competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense.
The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals
could have a material adverse effect on VF.

VF may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights.

VF’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its
competitive position. VF is susceptible to others imitating its products and infringing its
intellectual property rights. With the shift in product mix to higher priced brands, VF is more
susceptible to infringement of its intellectual property rights. Some of VF’s brands, such as

The
North Face

â

,

JanSport

â

,

Nautica

â

,
Wrangler

â

and

Lee

â

brands, enjoy significant worldwide consumer
recognition, and the generally higher pricing of such products creates additional risk of
counterfeiting and infringement.

Infringement or counterfeiting of VF’s products or its other intellectual property rights could
diminish the value of our brands or otherwise adversely affect VF revenues. Actions we have taken
to establish and protect VF’s intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation
of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its trademarks or block
sales of VF’s products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others.
In addition, unilateral actions in the United States or other countries, such as changes to or the
repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property
rights, could have an impact on
VF’s ability to enforce those rights.

The value of VF’s intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in, or ownership of,
trademarks and other intellectual property rights of VF, or in trademarks that are similar to VF’s
trademarks, or trademarks that VF licenses and/or markets. We may be unable to successfully
resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, there may be trademark owners
who have prior rights to VF’s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not
protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. In
other cases, there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks. VF is from time to
time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some items of its
intellectual property.

VF obtains licensing royalties and relies on its licensees to maintain the value of its brands.

Only a relatively small portion of VF’s revenues, $78 million or 1.1%, was derived from
licensing royalties in 2007. Although VF generally has significant control over its licensee
products and advertising, we rely on them for, among other things, operational and
financial controls over their businesses. Failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace existing licensees


could adversely affect VF’s revenues, both directly from reduced royalties
received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. Risks are also associated with a
licensee’s ability to:

•

Obtain capital;

•

Manage its labor relations;

•

Maintain relationships with its suppliers;

•

Manage its credit risk effectively; and

•

Maintain relationships with its customers.

In addition, VF relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands. Although we make
every attempt to protect VF’s brands through, among other things, approval rights over design,
production processes and quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion
of its products, we cannot completely control the use of licensed VF brands by our licensees. The
misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand.

VF’s balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill. A decline in
the estimated fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge, which would
be recorded as an operating loss in VF’s Consolidated Statement of Income.

Under current accounting standards, we estimate the fair value of acquired assets, including
intangible assets, and assumed liabilities arising from a business acquisition. The excess, if
any, of the cost of the acquired business over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired is
goodwill. The goodwill is then assigned to a business unit or
“reporting unit” within VF, which depends on whether the acquired business will be operated as a
separate business unit or integrated into an existing VF business unit.

At December 2007, VF had approximately $1.0 billion of trademark intangible assets and $1.3 billion
of goodwill on its balance sheet. These assets are not required to be amortized under current accounting
rules. In addition, VF had approximately $0.5 billion of intangible
assets that are being amortized under current accounting rules. The
combined amounts represent 42% of VF’s Total Assets and 76% of Common Stockholders’
Equity.

Trademark intangible assets that are not amortized and goodwill must be tested for impairment at
least annually. The impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of VF’s business units
and related intangible assets, primarily using discounted cash flow methodologies based on forecasted
revenues and cash flows that will be derived from a business unit or
trademark. Intangible assets that are being amortized must be tested
for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their
carrying value might not be recoverable.

If the carrying value of goodwill or of intangible assets were to
exceed its fair value, the asset would be written down to its fair value, with the impairment loss
recognized as a noncash charge in the Consolidated Statement of Income. We have not had any
significant impairment charges. However, a future impairment loss could have a material adverse
effect on VF’s results of operations and financial condition.

RISKS APPLICABLE TO THE APPAREL INDUSTRY

VF’s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel, which is sensitive
to general economic conditions and other factors affecting consumer confidence.

The apparel industry has historically been subject to cyclical variations and is
particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy. The success of VF’s operations
depends on consumer spending. Consumer spending is influenced by a number of factors, including
actual and perceived economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income (such as unemployment
and wages), business conditions, interest rates, energy prices, availability of credit and tax
rates in the international, national, regional and local markets where VF’s products are sold. Any
significant deterioration in general economic conditions, recession or increases in interest rates
could reduce the level of consumer spending and inhibit consumers’ use of credit. A significant
decline in the securities markets could materially affect consumer confidence, the financial
condition of VF’s


customers and VF’s operating costs through higher contributions to its pension plan. In addition,
natural disasters, war, terrorist activity or the threat of war or terrorist activity could
adversely affect consumer spending and thereby have a material adverse effect on VF’s financial
condition and results of operations.

Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could increase costs and cause
service delays.

Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of fabrics or other raw materials used by VF in
its manufactured apparel could have a material adverse effect on VF’s cost of sales or its ability
to meet its customers’ demands. The prices for such fabrics depend on demand and market prices for
the raw materials used to produce them, particularly cotton. The price and availability of such
raw materials may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, including crop yields and
weather patterns. In the future, VF may not be able to pass all or a portion of such higher raw
materials prices on to its customers.

VF’s business is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations.

Approximately 28% of VF’s Total Revenues is derived from international markets. VF’s foreign
businesses operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates. In addition, VF sources and manufactures most of its products overseas. As a
result, the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant
currencies. Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the U.S. dollar value of the
foreign currency denominated amounts at which VF’s international businesses purchase products,
incur costs or sell products. Furthermore, VF’s international sales and licensing revenue are
derived from sales in foreign currencies. Although we hedge some exposures to changes in foreign
currency exchange rates arising in the ordinary course of business, foreign currency fluctuations
could have a material adverse impact on VF’s financial condition and results of operations.

VF’s ability to sell products in international markets may be affected by legal, regulatory,
political and economic risks.

Our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets and
to capitalize on growth in new international markets is subject to risks associated with
international operations. These include the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and
regulations, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, new tariffs or other barriers to some
international markets.

We cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes or other similar restrictions will be imposed by
the United States, the European Union, Japan or other countries upon
the import or export of our
products in the future, or what effect any of these actions would have on VF’s business, financial
condition or results of operations. Changes in regulatory, geopolitical policies and other factors
may adversely affect VF’s business or may require us to modify our current business practices.

Item 2. Properties.

VF owns certain facilities used in manufacturing and distribution activities and leases a
distribution center under a capital lease. Other facilities are leased under operating leases that
generally contain renewal options. We believe all facilities and machinery and equipment are in
good condition and are suitable for VF’s needs. Manufacturing, distribution and administrative
facilities being utilized at the end of 2007 are summarized below by reportable segment:

facilities.

In addition to the above, VF owns or leases retail or outlet locations totaling 5,000,000 square
feet. VF also owns facilities having 200,000 square feet of space formerly used in operations but
now held for sale and leases 500,000 square feet of space that is subleased to a third party
through the end of the lease term.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

There are no pending material legal proceedings, other than ordinary, routine litigation incidental
to the business, to which VF or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of their
property is the subject.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

There were no share repurchases during the fourth quarter of
2007. We will continue to  evaluate future
share repurchases considering funding required to support business
acquisitions, our common stock price and levels of stock option
exercises. Also, under the Mid-Term Incentive Plan
implemented under VF’s 1996 Stock Compensation Plan, VF must withhold from the shares of Common
Stock issuable in settlement of a participant’s performance-based restricted stock units. The
number of shares to withhold is based on the aggregate fair market value equal to any minimum
statutory federal, state and local withholding or other tax that VF is required to withhold, unless
the participant has made other arrangements to pay such amounts. There were no shares withheld
under the Mid-Term Incentive Plan during the fourth quarter of 2007.

Item 6. Selected Financial Data.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Overview

VF
Corporation is a leading global marketer of branded lifestyle and
other apparel products. (Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “VF,”
“we,” “us,” and “our” used herein refer to VF Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.)
Management’s vision is to grow VF by building leading lifestyle brands that excite consumers around
the world. Lifestyle brands, representative of the activities that consumers aspire to, will
generally extend across multiple geographic markets and product categories and therefore have
greater opportunities for growth.

VF owns a diverse portfolio of brands with strong market positions in several consumer product
categories. In addition, we market occupational apparel to resellers and major corporate and
government customers. VF has a broad customer base, with products distributed through leading
specialty stores, upscale and traditional department stores, national chains and mass merchants,
plus VF-operated retail stores and internet web sites.

We are organized around our principal product categories and major brands within those categories.
These groupings of businesses, referred to as “coalitions,” are summarized as follows:

Discontinued Operations

VF sold its women’s intimate apparel business in April 2007 for net cash proceeds of $348.7
million. The decision to exit this business was part of the Board of Directors’ and our strategic
plan to shift VF’s portfolio mix to higher growth, higher margin lifestyle brands. VF’s intimate
apparel business included brands such as

Vanity Fair

â

, Lily of
France

â

, Vassarette

â

, Bestform

â

and

Curvation

â

in the United States and

Lou

â

, Gemma

â

and

Belcor

â

in Europe. Because VF has sold this business, the operating results,
assets, liabilities and cash flows of the global intimate apparel business have been separately
presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods
presented.

During 2007 (prior to its sale in April), 2006 and 2005, the operations of the global intimate
apparel business contributed $2.9 million, $35.3 million and $35.9 million, respectively, to VF’s
net income. In addition, we recorded charges for the loss on disposal of the intimate apparel
business of $24.6 million in 2007 and $36.8 million in 2006. The book value of the net assets sold included $117.5 million of goodwill and $32.1 million for accumulated foreign currency translation losses.

See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for further details about the discontinued
operations.

Unless otherwise stated, the remaining sections of this discussion and analysis of
results of operations and financial condition relate only to continuing operations.

Long-term Financial Targets

In January 2008, we revised our long-term financial targets. We expect attainment of these targets
to drive increases in total shareholder return (“TSR”), which is the total of stock price
appreciation and dividends received by our shareholders. These targets are summarized below:

•

Revenue growth of 8% to 10% per year

– We increased our long-term target revenue growth
from 6% to 8% annually to 8% to 10% per year, with approximately 6% to 7% coming from organic
growth and 2% to 3% from acquisitions. We have met this overall objective with growth in
revenues of 16% in 2007 and 10% in 2006. Key drivers of further growth include a continuation
of the strong growth we have experienced in our outdoor businesses, international expansion
and continued growth in our direct-to-consumer business. Our international revenues are
expected to expand approximately 13% annually and account for a third of our total revenues by
2012, compared with 28% in 2007. Our direct-to-consumer business should grow by approximately
18% annually and represent 22% of revenues by 2012, compared with 14% in 2007. We also have
many programs in place to


continue to drive organic growth and will continue to aggressively search for opportunities to
acquire branded lifestyle apparel businesses that meet our strategic and financial goals.

•

Operating income of 15% of revenues

– We increased our long-term targeted operating margin
from 14% to 15%. Our operating margins have approached 14% – achieving 13.4% in 2007 and
13.3% in 2006, with margins in each of those years negatively impacted by 0.2% from specific
actions taken to reduce product costs, enhance product development processes, strengthen our
sales and marketing organization and maximize our distribution infrastructure across some of
our businesses, primarily in our international jeans operations. We expect continued
improvement in our operating margin as we (i) leverage our costs across an expanded revenue
base, (ii) grow our international and retail businesses, which have high operating margins and
(iii) continue our relentless focus on cost reduction.

Our two largest coalitions currently exceed the 15% target. We will continue to evaluate our existing businesses to ensure that they
meet our strategic and financial objectives and may in the future decide to exit a business that
does not meet those objectives, as demonstrated by the sale of the global intimate apparel
business in 2007.

•

Earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% per year

– We established a new target of 10% to
11% annual growth in diluted earnings per share. Earnings per share are expected to grow at a
faster rate than revenues, reflecting continued expansion in our operating margins. Our
earnings per share increased 14% in 2007 and 12% in 2006.

In addition to the new targets discussed above, we maintained the following long-term targets:

•

Return on invested capital of 17%

– We believe that a high return on capital is closely
correlated with enhancing TSR. We calculate return on invested capital as follows:

Income from continuing operations before net interest expense, after income
taxes,

Average common stockholders’ equity, plus average short and long-term debt

VF earned a 14.8% return on invested capital in 2007 and a 14.7% return in 2006. Our returns in
recent years have been impacted by acquisitions during those periods, as it often takes a period
of years to achieve the targeted 17% rate of return for acquired businesses. Nevertheless, we
will continue to pursue this ambitious target.


•

Debt to capital of less than 40%

– To maintain a conservative financial position, we
have established a goal of keeping our debt to less than 40% of our total capitalization, with
capitalization defined as our common stockholders’ equity, plus combined short and long-term
debt. Despite spending over $1 billion on acquisitions in 2007, this ratio was 26.4% at the
end of the year. This low debt to capital ratio, given our significant acquisition spending,
dividend payments to stockholders, share repurchase activity and a cash balance of
approximately $320 million at the end of 2007, demonstrates VF’s ability to generate strong
cash flow from operations.

•

Dividend payout ratio of 40%

– Our target is to return approximately 40% of earnings to our
stockholders through a consistent dividend policy. The 2007 dividend payout ratio was 42.7%
of Net Income. VF has increased its dividends paid per share each year for the past 35 years.

Strategic Objectives

We have developed a growth plan that we believe will enable VF to achieve its long-term revenue and
earnings targets. Our growth strategy consists of six drivers:

1.

Build more global, growing lifestyle brands

.

Focus on building more growing, global
lifestyle brands with an emphasis on younger consumers and on female consumers.

2.

Expand our share with winning customers

.

Adapt our organizational structure to a more
customer-specific focus to expand market share and leverage new business opportunities with
successful retailers through cross-coalition coordination, planning and execution.

3.

Stretch brands to new geographies.

Grow our international presence, particularly in rapidly
expanding economies such as those in Europe, China, India and Russia.

4.

Expand our direct-to-consumer business.

Increase the portion of revenues obtained from

Highlights of 2007

There were several notable actions and achievements in 2007:

•

Revenues, income, earnings per share and cash provided by operating activities were each at
record levels.

•

We formed a new lifestyle brand coalition, Contemporary Brands, currently composed of two
acquisitions completed in 2007 – Seven For All Mankind, LLC (“Seven For All Mankind”) and lucy
activewear, inc. (“lucy activewear”). Seven For All Mankind markets the rapidly growing

7 For
All Mankind

â

brand of women’s and men’s premium denim jeanswear and related
apparel products in the United States and Europe. lucy activewear is a rapidly growing chain
of retail stores marketing

lucy

â

brand women’s activewear.

•

We completed three additional acquisitions in 2007 – Majestic Athletic, Inc. (“Majestic”),
which currently holds exclusive on-field uniform rights for all 30 major league baseball teams
including supplying each team with on-field

MLB Authentic Collection

™ outerwear, batting
practice jerseys, T-shirts, shorts and fleece; Eagle Creek, Inc. (“Eagle Creek”), maker of

Eagle Creek

â

brand adventure travel gear, including accessories, luggage and
daypacks; and the brand-related assets of a former licensee who had rights to market VF’s

The
North Face

â

brand in China and Nepal (“The North Face – China”). These
acquisitions, together with Seven For All Mankind and lucy activewear, are collectively
referred to as the “2007 Acquisitions.”

•

Total Revenues increased 16% to $7,219.4 million, driven by higher revenues in our outdoor,
jeanswear and imagewear businesses, with 10% coming from organic growth and 6% from
acquisitions.

•

Income from Continuing Operations increased 15% to $613.2 million, and earnings per share
from continuing operations increased 14% to $5.41 per diluted share. (All per share amounts
below are presented on a diluted basis.) The biggest contributions to these increases were
the strong performance of our global outdoor businesses, particularly driven by superior
growth within

The North Face

â

and

Vans

â

branded businesses,
and jeanswear branded businesses.

•

We sold our women’s intimate apparel business for $348.7 million in cash in April 2007.

•

Net Income (including our global intimate apparel
business reported as discontinued operations) increased 11% in 2007 to a
record $591.6 million, or $5.22 per diluted share.

•

We increased our quarterly dividend rate from $0.55 to $0.58 per share.

Total Revenues consist of Net Sales of products and Royalty Income from licensees. Revenues in
most of our ongoing businesses increased in 2007 and 2006, due primarily to unit volume increases,
with the largest growth in our outdoor and jeanswear businesses. Additional details on revenues
are provided in the section titled “Information by Business Segment.”

In translating foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar, the weaker U.S. dollar in relation to the
functional currencies where VF conducts the majority of its business (primarily the European euro
countries) benefited revenue by $130 million in 2007 relative to 2006 and by $11 million in 2006
relative to 2005. The weighted average translation rate for the euro was $1.36 per euro during
2007, compared with $1.25 during 2006 and 2005. With the weakening of the U.S. dollar in recent
months, reported revenues in 2008 may be positively impacted compared with 2007.

Gross margins increased to 43.5% of revenues in 2007, compared with 43.4% in 2006 and 43.2% in
2005. Gross margins benefited 0.3% in 2007 over 2006 from the mix impact of our higher
margin lifestyle businesses representing a higher percentage of total revenues. The 2007


comparison also benefited by 0.1% due to the special items in 2007 and 2006 (higher expense in
2006), discussed in the operating margin section of Long-term Financial Targets above. These
benefits to 2007 were partially offset by higher levels of distressed sales, with lower gross
margins, in 2007.

Gross margins also benefited 0.4% in 2006 over 2005 as a result of the mix impact resulting from
our growing lifestyle businesses. This increase was partially offset by the impact of an
adjustment in 2005 to reduce certain postemployment benefit accruals in Mexico, which did not recur
in 2006.

Today, 26% of our total Net Sales relates to products manufactured in VF-owned facilities in
Mexico, Europe and Central America and 74% relates to products obtained from contractors, primarily
in Asia. Where we manufacture in VF-owned facilities, our product costs are lower than any
available on a global basis for like products. We believe a combination of VF-owned and contracted
production from different geographic regions provides flexibility and a competitive advantage in
our product sourcing.

Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses as a percent of revenues were 30.1% of revenues in
2007 and 2006 and 29.7% in 2005. This ratio increased 0.4% in 2007 and 2006 due to a shift in the
mix of our businesses toward those with higher expense percentages, specifically toward our growing
lifestyle branded businesses. The 2007 ratio also increased 0.2% due to the impact of the 2007
Acquisitions, whose operations have not yet been fully integrated within VF. In addition, the
specific actions discussed in the operating margin section of Long-term Financial Targets above
increased this ratio by 0.2% in 2007 and 0.1% in 2006. The increases in 2007 and 2006 over the
respective prior years were offset by the impact of beneficial revenue growth in many of our
businesses, resulting in improved leverage of operating expenses.

We include costs of cooperative advertising, licensing, retail stores and shipping and handling in
Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses, as stated in our significant accounting policies in
Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Some other apparel companies classify cooperative
advertising costs or licensing costs as a reduction of Net Sales or Royalty Income, respectively,
while some classify retail store and shipping and handling costs in Cost of Goods Sold.
Accordingly, our gross margins and operating expenses may not be directly comparable with other
apparel companies.

Interest income increased $3.3 million in 2007 due to an increase in interest rates and higher cash


levels resulting primarily from the timing of the sale of the global intimate apparel business and
cash generated from operations. Interest expense (including amortization of debt discount and
debt issuance costs, net of amortization of the gain on an interest rate hedging contract) increased $14.9 million
in 2007 due to (i) higher borrowings needed to fund acquisition activity and (ii) higher interest
rates on short-term debt. Interest expense decreased $13.3 million in 2006 due to lower average
interest rates and lower average debt outstanding. Average interest-bearing debt outstanding
totaled approximately $1,080 million for 2007, $900 million for 2006 and $1,030 million for 2005.
The weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 6.4% for 2007, 6.1% for 2006 and 6.7%
for 2005.

The effective income tax rate was 32.3% in 2007, compared with 31.2% in 2006 and 32.2% in 2005.
During 2007 and 2006, we recorded tax benefits of $12.0 million and $16.9 million, respectively,
for the favorable audit outcomes on certain tax matters and from expiration of statutes of
limitations outside of the United States. These benefits lowered our annual tax rates by 1.3% and
2.2%, respectively. The 2005 rate benefited from favorable settlements of prior years’
foreign and state tax returns.

Income from Continuing Operations increased 15% to $613.2 million ($5.55 per share) in 2007 and by
11% to $535.1 million ($4.83 per share) in 2006. After considering the effects of discontinued
operations and a cumulative effect charge for the change in accounting policy for stock-based
compensation in 2005, VF reported net income of $591.6 million ($5.22 per share) in 2007, $533.5
million ($4.72 per share) in 2006 and $506.7 million ($4.44 per share) in 2005. In translating
foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar, the weaker U.S. dollar had a $0.11 favorable impact on
earnings per share in 2007 compared with 2006 and a $0.02 favorable impact in 2006 compared with
2005. Also, the 2007 Acquisitions added $0.09 per share to the 2007 results, and the Reef
acquisition (acquired in 2005) had a $0.03 favorable impact to earnings per share in 2006 compared with 2005.

Information by Business Segment

VF’s businesses are grouped into five product categories, and by brands within those product
categories, for management and internal financial reporting purposes. These groupings of
businesses are referred to as “coalitions.” Both management and VF’s Board of Directors evaluate
operating performance at the coalition level. These coalitions represent VF’s reportable segments.

For business segment reporting purposes, Coalition Revenues and Coalition Profit represent net


sales, royalty income and operating expenses under the direct control of an individual coalition,
along with amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and its share of centralized
corporate expenses directly related to the coalition. Corporate expenses not apportioned to the
coalitions and net interest expense are excluded from Coalition Profit. Importantly, this basis of
performance evaluation is consistent with that used for management incentive compensation.

See Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our results of operations and
other information by coalition, along with a reconciliation of Coalition Profit to Income from
Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes. Coalition results are not necessarily indicative of
operating results that would have been reported had each business coalition been an independent,
stand-alone entity during the periods presented. Further, VF’s presentation of Coalition Profit
may not be comparable with similar measures used by other companies.

Jeanswear:

The Jeanswear Coalition consists of our global jeanswear businesses, led by the

Wrangler

â

and

Lee

â

brands. Overall jeanswear revenues were up 4%
in 2007 and 3% in 2006. Domestic jeanswear revenues were flat in 2007 compared with 2006, with a
3% increase in our mass market business offset by slight declines in our

Lee

â

and
specialty businesses. In 2006 domestic jeanswear revenues increased 3% led by the turnaround of
the

Lee

â

brand, which posted a 6%
increase over 2005. Also, our domestic mass market revenues increased by 4% in 2006. These
increases were partially offset by the exit of the Earl Jean business in early 2006.


Jeanswear revenues in international markets, including Europe, Canada, Mexico, Latin America and
Asia, increased 13% in 2007 over 2006. Foreign currency translation positively impacted 2007
Jeanswear revenues by $57 million, or 6%. Revenues from the joint venture in India, established in
September 2006, contributed 3% of the increase. Revenues increased in all geographic areas in 2007
with the exception of our Latin America operations, where revenues were flat. International
jeanswear revenues increased 3% in 2006 over 2005. Approximately 2% of the 2006 increase resulted
from our joint venture in India. Revenues increased in all geographic areas in 2006 compared with
2005 other than Canada, which was flat.

Jeanswear Coalition operating margins were 16.6% in 2007 and 15.5% in 2006. The operating margin
improvement in 2007 was attributed to higher gross margins resulting from (i) growth in our
international jeans businesses, where gross margins are higher than our domestic businesses, (ii)
improved operating efficiencies and (iii) actions taken in the prior year to reduce product cost
and improve product development capabilities. Jeanswear operating results include expenses of $8.0
million in 2007 and $14.5 million in 2006 related to these capacity reduction and other actions,
which negatively impacted operating margins in those years by 0.3% and 0.5%, respectively. In
addition, approximately 0.2% of the improvement in operating margin in 2007 was driven by the gain
on the sale of

H.I.S

â

trademarks and related intellectual property during 2007.

Jeanswear Coalition operating margins were 15.5% in 2006 compared with 16.8% in 2005. The
reduction in margin percentage primarily resulted from the 0.5% negative impact in 2006 for the
capacity reduction and other actions discussed above, combined with the impact of reducing Mexican
postemployment benefit accruals in 2005 (0.6% positive impact in 2005), which management had
determined were greater than required under local laws. The remaining decline in operating margins
in 2006 resulted from increased domestic spending on advertising and investments in retail stores
overseas.

Outdoor:

The Outdoor Coalition consists of VF’s outdoor-related businesses including

The North
Face

â

brand apparel, footwear and equipment,

JanSport

â

and

Eastpak

â

daypacks and apparel,

Vans

â

performance and casual
footwear and apparel,

Kipling

â

bags and accessories,

Napapijri

â

outdoor-based sportswear,

Reef

â

beach-inspired footwear and apparel and

Eagle
Creek

â

adventure travel gear. Revenues increased 28% in 2007, with 25% organic growth and the remainder
from the Eagle Creek and The North Face – China acquisitions. The organic growth


was led by global unit volume increases and strong consumer demand for our

The North
Face

â

,

Vans

â

,

Kipling

â

and

Napapijri

â

brands. The growth in these brands, particularly

The North Face

â

and

Vans

â

, included geographic expansion, opening additional owned retail locations
and entering new product categories.

Revenues also increased 28% in 2006 primarily through organic growth, led by unit volume increases
for

The North Face

â

and

Vans

â

products in the United States and
international markets. The acquisition of Reef also added $47 million to 2006 revenues (for the
period prior to its acquisition anniversary date). Revenues in 2007 and 2006 benefited from the
favorable effects of foreign currency translation by $73 million and $8 million, respectively.

Coalition Profit increased 31% in 2007, with operating margins increasing to 16.4% in 2007 from
16.0% in 2006. The increase was driven by strong revenue growth, resulting in improved leverage of
operating expenses including distribution and product development. Also, revenue growth was more
significant in our international and retail operations, where operating margins are typically
higher. These items were offset by higher levels of distressed sales and additional investments in
our retail operations.

Coalition Profit increased 28% in 2006, consistent with the revenue increase above. The operating
margins in both 2006 and 2005 for the Outdoor Coalition were 16.0%. The 2005 acquisition of Reef
added approximately $5 million, or 2%, to Coalition Profit in 2006.

Imagewear:

The Imagewear Coalition includes VF’s occupational (industrial, career and safety) apparel
business, as well as our licensed apparel business. Revenues in the occupational apparel business
declined 3% as many of our industrial customers continue to internalize their manufacturing. This
reduction included the impact of exiting our underperforming commodity fleece and T-shirt business.
Excluding this business, revenues in our occupational apparel business increased slightly in 2007
over 2006.

Revenues in the licensed apparel business increased 59% due to the acquisition of Majestic, which
added $156 million to revenues in 2007. Excluding the impact of the Majestic acquisition,
licensed apparel revenues increased 6% led by growth in the licensed National Football League and
Major League Baseball businesses.

Coalition Revenues increased 3% in 2006 with occupational apparel revenues increasing 2% and


licensed apparel revenues increasing 4%. Excluding the impact of the phaseout of our
underperforming commodity fleece and T-shirt business, occupational apparel revenues increased 6%
in 2006 with increased revenues in industrial, career and safety apparel. Licensed apparel
revenues increased 4% in 2006 led by growth in the licensed National Football League business.

Coalition Profit declined to 14.4% in 2007 from 16.2% in 2006, resulting from competitive factors
impacting the pricing of our new programs within the occupational apparel businesses and the impact
of the Majestic acquisition, which had lower operating margins than Imagewear Coalition averages.

Coalition Profit increased 6% in 2006 with substantially all of the growth in licensed sports
apparel. Profits in the occupational apparel business were flat in 2006 compared with 2005.
Operating margin for the Imagewear Coalition increased from 15.7% in 2005 to a record 16.2% in
2006, resulting from lower advertising costs and lower increases in administrative and other fixed
costs in relation to revenue growth.

Sportswear:

The Sportswear coalition consists of our

Nautica

â

lifestyle brand, the

John
Varvatos

â

luxury collection for men and the

Kipling

â

brand
business in North America (whereas the

Kipling

Ò

brand is managed as part of the
Outdoor Coalition internationally). Coalition Revenues were flat in 2007 compared with 2006, with
a 4% decrease in our

Nautica

â

brand revenues offset by double-digit gains in our

John Varvatos

â

and

Kipling

Ò

brand businesses. The overall
decline in Nautica revenues resulted from lower menswear business due to challenging conditions in
department stores and higher promotional activity in our Nautica retail stores in the second half
of 2007. This decrease was offset by increased revenues in our

Nautica

â

brand
women’s sportswear.

Coalition Revenues increased 5% in 2006, including a 4% increase in our

Nautica

â

brand revenues and strong growth in our

John Varvatos

â

and

Kipling

Ò

brand businesses.

Sportswear Coalition operating margins declined to 9.6% in 2007 from 13.3% in 2006 due to the
impact of revenue decreases in the

Nautica

â

brand without comparable expense
reduction and increased promotional activity in our owned outlet stores and the department store
channel in 2007. Both 2007 and 2006 include significant investments in our

Nautica

â

brand women’s sportswear business. Operating losses
resulting from the

Nautica

â

women’s initiative lowered the overall
coalition operating


margins by
approximately 2% in both years.

Sportswear Coalition operating margins were 13.3% in 2006 and 15.4% in 2005. Coalition Profit
declined in 2006 from 2005 primarily due to the investments behind the Fall 2006 introduction of
the

Nautica

â

brand women’s sportswear collection.

Contemporary Brands:

This coalition was formed in August 2007 with two newly acquired businesses — Seven For All
Mankind and its

7 For All Mankind

â

brand of premium denim jeanswear and related
apparel and lucy activewear and its

lucy

â

brand of women’s activewear. The Contemporary Brands Coalition operating margin of 17.5% was driven by the high profitability of
Seven For All Mankind, a high gross margin business. The lucy activewear business is not currently
profitable due to start-up costs for new stores and high promotional activity exceeding the
earnings contribution of their retail locations. With the roll-out of additional stores,
profitability is expected in 2009.

Other:

The Other business segment includes the VF Outlet business unit of company-operated retail outlet
stores in the United States that sell a broad selection of excess quantities of first quality VF
products and other branded products. Revenues and profits of VF products are reported as part of
the operating results of the applicable coalitions, while revenues and profits of non-VF products
(primarily women’s intimate apparel, childrenswear, hosiery, underwear and accessories, which
provide a broader selection of merchandise to attract consumer traffic) are reported in this
business segment. The increase in revenues in 2007 was due to VF
Outlet’s sale of women’s intimate apparel products obtained
from independent suppliers following VF’s sale of its intimate
apparel business in April 2007 (whereas such revenues prior to
April 2007 were reported as part of discontinued operations).

Reconciliation of Coalition Profit to Consolidated Income from Continuing Operations Before
Income Taxes:

There are two types of costs necessary to reconcile total Coalition Profit, as discussed in the
preceding paragraphs, to Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes. These costs,
discussed below, are Interest and Corporate and Other Expenses. See also Note R to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest Expense, Net was discussed in the previous “Consolidated Statements of Income” section.
Interest is excluded from Coalition Profit because substantially all of our financing costs are
managed at the corporate office and are not under the control of coalition management.


Corporate and Other Expenses consists of corporate headquarters’ and similar costs that are not
apportioned to the operating coalitions. These expenses are summarized as follows:

Information Systems and Shared Services

– Included are costs of our management information systems
and our centralized shared services center, which includes common financial, supply chain, human
resources and customer management services that support our worldwide operations. Operating costs
of information systems and shared services are charged to the coalitions based on utilization of
those services, such as minutes of computer processing time, number of transactions or number of
users. Costs to develop new computer applications that will be used across VF are not allocated to
the coalitions. The growth in the information systems and shared services costs in 2007 and 2006
over the 2005 level is related to increased information systems development, additions to
information technology infrastructure and higher centralized supply and sales chain management
costs. Also, a greater proportion of management information systems and other costs were allocated
to the coalitions in 2006 and 2007, primarily related to new information system implementations
during those periods.

Corporate Headquarters’ Costs

– Headquarters’ costs include compensation and benefits of corporate
management and staff, certain legal and professional fees, and administrative and general expenses,
which are not apportioned to the coalitions.  The increase in these costs from 2006 to 2007 was
driven by higher compensation and other costs.

Trademark Maintenance and Enforcement

– Legal and other costs of registering, maintaining and
enforcing the majority of VF’s trademarks, plus related costs of licensing administration, are
controlled by a centralized trademark and licensing staff and are not allocated to the coalitions.


Other

– This category includes (i) adjustments to convert the earnings of certain business units
using the FIFO inventory valuation method for internal reporting to the LIFO method for
consolidated financial reporting, (ii) miscellaneous costs that result from corporate programs or
corporate-managed decisions that are not allocated to the business units for internal management
reporting and (iii) other consolidating adjustments.

Analysis of Financial Condition

Balance Sheets

Accounts Receivable increased 20% in 2007 due to a 22% increase in fourth quarter revenues over
2006 and slight improvement in our days’ sales outstanding.

Inventories increased by 19% in 2007 over the prior year. Inventories increased by (i) 13% due to
the impact of the 2007 Acquisitions (ii) 3% from the effects of a weaker U.S. dollar and (iii) 3%
due to higher levels of inventory in our organic businesses.

Property, Plant and Equipment increased in 2007 due to the 2007 Acquisitions and capital spending
in 2007 exceeding depreciation expense by $19 million. Capital spending in 2007 supported the
growth of our businesses and specifically included an increased level of spending to support new
retail store roll-outs.

Intangible Assets and Goodwill each increased in 2007 due to the 2007 Acquisitions and the impact
of foreign currency translation (a weaker U.S. dollar). Other Assets increased in 2007 due to (i)
the recognition of a $27 million pension asset for the overfunded status of our qualified defined
benefit pension plan in accordance with FASB Statement No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

(“Statement 158”) and (ii) an increase in assets
held under deferred compensation plans. See Notes B, G, H and I to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

In October 2007, VF entered into a $1.0 billion domestic senior unsecured committed revolving bank
credit agreement that supports issuance of up to $1.0 billion in commercial paper. This agreement
replaced a similar $750 million agreement. Also in October 2007, certain international
subsidiaries, with VF as guarantor, entered into a

€

250.0 million (U.S. dollar equivalent of
$367.9 million) international senior unsecured committed revolving bank credit agreement, which
also replaced a similar

€

175.0 million agreement.


Short-term Borrowings at
December 2007 included $92.7 million outstanding under the international credit agreement.
Short-term borrowings at December 2007 were higher than December 2006 because a portion of the 2006
borrowings under the international credit agreement were classified as long-term debt because it
was expected to remain outstanding for at least 12 months.

Accounts Payable increased in 2007 compared with 2006 due to higher inventory levels and the timing
of inventory purchases and the related vendor payments at fiscal year-end. Accrued Liabilities
increased in 2007 due to the 2007 Acquisitions and higher incentive compensation accruals.

Long-term Debt increased from 2006 to 2007 due to the issuance of $600.0 million of senior notes in
October 2007 (see Note O to the Consolidated Financial
Statements), offset by payment of a note related to the Nautica acquisition and payment of amounts classified in 2006 as
long-term under the international credit agreement.

Other Liabilities increased due to an increase in deferred tax liabilities arising from foreign
currency translation, offset in part by an improvement in the funded status of our defined benefit
pension plans in accordance with Statement 158. This standard, effective for December 2006,
requires that the funded status of a defined benefit plan, measured as the difference between the
fair value of plan assets and projected benefit obligations, be recorded in the balance sheet. At
the end of 2006, an unfunded pension liability of $143.8 million was recorded in Other Liabilities.
This long-term liability decreased to $74.4 million at the end of 2007 due primarily to actuarial
gains arising from an increase in the discount rate and favorable investment returns on plan
assets.

See Note N for a discussion of asset, liability and equity balances related to defined benefit
pension plans in VF’s 2007 and 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheets.

For the ratio of debt to total capital, debt is defined as short-term and long-term borrowings, and
total capital is defined as debt plus common stockholders’ equity. Our ratio of net debt to total
capital, with net debt defined as debt less cash and equivalents, was 21.1% at the end of 2007.

VF’s primary source of liquidity is its strong cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash
flow from operating activities of continuing operations, which was $833.6 million in 2007, $454.1
million in 2006 and $533.7 million in 2005, is primarily dependent on the level of Income from
Continuing Operations and changes in investments in inventories and other working capital
components. Income from Continuing Operations was $613.2 million, $535.1 million and $482.6
million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income from Continuing Operations in each year
included noncash stock-based compensation expense of $62.4 million, $46.4 million and $40.5 million
in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Also, we did not make a discretionary contribution to our
qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2007 (because our qualified plan was fully funded based
on projected benefit obligations), while operating cash flows included discretionary contributions
of $75.0 million in 2006 and $55.0 million in 2005.

The net change in operating asset and liability components was a cash usage of $4.2 million in
2007, compared with cash usage of $200.6 million in 2006 and $109.7 million in 2005. Much of the
improvement in this area was due to a specific focus on working capital leverage by management at
the end of 2007. Major reasons for changes in the year-to-year cash impact from operating asset
and liability accounts in 2007 compared with 2006 included (i) higher than normal accounts
receivable at the end of 2006, resulting from very strong international sales near the end of the
year to customers with longer payment terms, (ii) unusually low accounts payable at the end of 2006
due to the timing of inventory receipts and (iii) unusually high accrued income taxes at the
beginning of 2006 due to required tax payments for the prior year.

To finance its ongoing operations and most unusual circumstances that may arise, VF anticipates


relying upon continued future strong cash generation. In addition, VF has significant existing
liquidity from its available cash balances and debt capacity, supported by its strong credit
rating. At the end of 2007, $989.9 million was available for borrowing under VF’s $1.0 billion
senior unsecured committed revolving bank credit facility, with $10.1 million of standby letters of
credit issued under the agreement. Also at the end of 2007, $275.2 million was available for
borrowing under VF’s

€

250.0 million (U.S. dollar equivalent of $367.9 million) senior unsecured
committed international revolving bank credit facility.

We paid cash of $1,060.6 million, $39.3 million and $211.8 million for acquisitions in 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively, net of cash balances in the acquired companies. The 2007 Acquisitions were
funded with existing VF cash balances, short-term commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings.
Commercial paper borrowings were repaid from proceeds of the long-term notes issued in October 2007
and cash flows from operations. In addition, we received $348.7 million in proceeds from the sale
of our intimate apparel business in 2007.

Capital expenditures were $113.9 million in 2007, compared with $127.2 million and $103.0 million
in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capital expenditures in each of these years primarily related to
retail and distribution, as well as maintenance spending across our global manufacturing network.
We expect that capital spending could reach $145 million in 2008, with the increase related to
higher retail store investments. Capital spending will be funded by cash flow from operations.

During 2007, VF received $592.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of 5.95% senior notes due in
2017 and 6.45% senior notes due in 2037. VF repaid $78.1 million under the international
bank credit agreements in 2007 and a $33.0 million note related to the Nautica acquisition in
each of 2007 and 2006. During 2005, VF repaid $401.3 million of long-term debt at scheduled
maturity dates. See Notes J and L to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In October 2007, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services affirmed its ‘A minus’ corporate credit rating,
‘A-2’ commercial paper rating and ‘stable’ outlook for VF. Standard & Poor’s also assigned its ‘A
minus’ senior unsecured debt rating to VF’s $600.0 million unsecured senior notes issued in October
2007. In August 2007, Moody’s Investors Service affirmed VF’s long-term debt rating of ‘A3’,
commercial paper rating of ‘Prime-2’ and ‘stable’ outlook. Existing long-term debt agreements do
not contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings. However,
for the $600.0 million of senior notes issued in 2007, if there were a change in control of VF and, as a result of
the change in control

,

the notes were rated below investment


grade by recognized rating agencies,
then VF would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of
notes repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

During 2007, VF purchased 4.1 million shares of its Common Stock in open market transactions at a
cost of $350.0 million (average price of $85.03), using the proceeds from the sale of our intimate
apparel business, and in 2006 purchased 2.0 million shares at a cost of $118.6 million
(average price of $59.29 per share). In addition, VF purchased 4.0 million shares of its Common
Stock in 2005 at a cost of $229.0 million (average price of $57.25 per share). The primary
objective of our share repurchase program is to offset, on a long-term basis, dilution caused by
awards under equity compensation plans. Under its current authorization from the Board of
Directors, VF may purchase an additional 5.2 million shares. The Company expects to repurchase 2.0
million shares in 2008. We will continue to evaluate future share repurchases considering funding
required to support business acquisitions, our common stock price and levels of stock option
exercises.

Cash dividends totaled $2.23 per common share in 2007, compared with $1.94 in 2006 and $1.10 in
2005. Our dividend payout rate was 42.7% in 2007, compared with payout rates of 41.1% in 2006 and
24.2% in 2005. Going forward, we expect to pay dividends of approximately 40% of our diluted
earnings per share. The current indicated annual dividend rate for 2008 is $2.32 per share.

Following is a summary of VF’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of

(1)

Long-term debt, including the current portion, consists of both required principal and
related interest obligations. Also included are payment obligations for capital leases.

(2)

Operating leases represent required minimum lease payments. Most real estate leases also
require payment of related operating expenses such as taxes, insurance, utilities and
maintenance. Such costs, which are not included above, average approximately 18% of the
stated minimum lease payments.

(3)

Minimum royalty payments include any required minimum advertising commitments under license
agreements.

(4)

Inventory purchase obligations represent binding commitments for finished goods, raw
materials and sewing labor in the ordinary course of business that are payable upon
satisfactory receipt of the inventory by VF. Included is a remaining commitment to purchase
$92.5 million of finished goods from one supplier, with a minimum of $15.0 million per year.
The reported amount excludes inventory purchase liabilities included in Accounts Payable at
December 2007.

(5)

Other obligations represent other commitments for the expenditure of funds, some of which
do not meet the criteria for recognition as a liability for financial statement
purposes. These commitments include future cash payments for Other Liabilities, as presented
and classified as noncurrent liabilities in VF’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as (i)
forecasted amounts related to contracts not involving the purchase of inventories, such as the
noncancelable portion of service or maintenance agreements for management information systems,
and (ii) capital expenditures for approved projects. Forecasted cash requirements for
components of Other Liabilities include (i) portions of those liabilities classified in
Current Liabilities and (ii) payments of deferred compensation and other employee-related
benefits, income taxes, product warranty claims and other liabilities based on historical and
forecasted cash outflows.

We have other financial commitments at the end of 2007 that are not included in the above table but
may require the use of funds under certain circumstances:

•

We made discretionary contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plan of $75.0
million in 2006 and $55.0 million in 2005. We did not make any contribution to this plan in
2007. We are not required to and do not anticipate making a discretionary contribution during
2008 because the plan is fully funded at the end of 2007 based on projected benefit
obligations. Future discretionary pension funding contributions are not included in the table
because of uncertainty over whether further contributions will be required.

•

VF has entered into $79.4 million of surety bonds, standby letters of credit and
international bank guarantees representing contingent guarantees of performance under
self-insurance and other programs. These commitments would only be drawn upon if VF were to
fail to meet its claims obligations.


•

Purchase orders in the ordinary course of business represent authorizations to purchase
rather than binding commitments and are therefore excluded from the table.

During 2007 VF met its obligations when due by issuing commercial paper for operating activities,
borrowing under a short-term bank facility, issuing $600.0 million principal amount of
publicly traded notes and entering into new domestic and international credit agreements on terms
substantially similar to its previous agreements. Credit market conditions and the general
contraction of liquidity in the United States and global capital markets during the last half of
2007 caused by subprime mortgage risk exposures did not have a significant impact on VF.
Management believes that VF’s cash balances and funds provided by operating activities, as well as
unused committed bank credit lines, additional borrowing capacity and access to equity markets,
taken as a whole, provide (i) adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and long-term
obligations when due, (ii) adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain our
dividend payout policy and (iii) flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise.

We do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships
established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes.

Risk Management

VF is exposed to a variety of market risks in the ordinary course of business, and we regularly
assess these potential risks. We manage our exposures to these risks through our operating and
financing activities and, when appropriate, by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures
within VF or by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are contracts whose value is based on, or “derived” from, changes
in the value of an underlying currency exchange rate, interest rate or other financial asset or
index. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

We limit the risk of interest rate fluctuations on net income and cash flows by managing our mix of
fixed and variable interest rate debt. In addition, we may also use derivative financial
instruments to minimize our interest rate risk. Since all of our long-term debt has fixed interest
rates, our primary interest rate exposure relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate
borrowings, which averaged approximately $396 million during 2007. However, any change in interest
rates would also affect interest income earned on VF’s cash equivalents on deposit. Based on
average amounts of borrowings having variable interest rates and cash on deposit during 2007, the
effect of a hypothetical 1.0% change in interest rates on reported net income


would not be
material.

VF is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations. Approximately 28%
of our revenues in 2007 were generated in international markets. Substantially all of our foreign
businesses operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities in
these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. During
2007, we entered into a new international bank credit agreement that provides for euro-denominated
borrowings. At the end of 2007, euro borrowings under this agreement totaled

€

63 million ($92.7
million), which reduces exposure to currency rate changes for our euro-denominated net assets. Net
advances to our foreign businesses, primarily in Europe, Latin American and Asia, are considered to
be long-term, and accordingly, foreign currency translation effects on those net assets are
deferred as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in Common Stockholders’
Equity. We do not hedge these net investments and do not hedge the translation of foreign currency
operating results into the U.S. dollar.

We monitor net foreign currency market exposures and may in the ordinary course of business enter
into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate fluctuations
for specific foreign currency transactions or a portion of our anticipated foreign currency cash
flows. Use of these financial instruments allows us to reduce the overall exposure to exchange
rate movements on VF’s U.S. dollar cash flows, since gains and losses on these contracts will
offset losses and gains on the transactions or cash flows being
hedged. Our practice is to hedge a portion of our net foreign currency cash flows anticipated during the following 12 months (relating
to cross-border inventory purchases, production costs, product sales and intercompany royalty
payments) by buying or selling U.S. dollar contracts against various currencies. Although VF is
exposed to risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to these foreign
exchange contracts, we believe these counterparties are creditworthy financial institutions and do
not anticipate nonperformance.

If there were a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% compared with
rates at the end of 2007, the expected effect on the change in fair value of the hedging contracts
outstanding would result in an unrealized loss of approximately $30 million. Based on changes in
the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate movements, the actual unrealized loss could
differ. However, any such change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would also result in
an offsetting change in the value of the underlying transactions or anticipated cash flows being
hedged.


VF is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton and other fibers, which indirectly impacts
fabric prices. We manage our fabric prices by obtaining fixed price commitments for denim and
other fabrics in some cases for up to one year in advance. VF has not historically managed, nor do
we currently intend to manage, commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments.

VF has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities accrued for the plans’
participants are based on market values of investment funds that are selected by the participants.
The risk of changes in the market values of the participants’ investment selections is hedged by
VF’s investment in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the investment selections
underlying the deferred compensation liabilities. Increases and decreases in deferred compensation
liabilities are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value
of VF’s investments, resulting in a negligible net exposure to our operating results and financial
position.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report
VF’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. We apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our
significant accounting policies are summarized in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The application of these accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions about
future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, contingent assets and liabilities, and related disclosures. These estimates,
assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate these estimates
and assumptions and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation in areas such as
allocation of the purchase price of acquired businesses, equity compensation, pension benefits and
self-insured liabilities. Because our business cycle is relatively short (i.e., from the date that
we place an order for inventory until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is
collected), actual results related to most of these estimates are known within a few months after
any balance sheet date. If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions
are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known.

We believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant estimates, assumptions


and management judgments used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements or are the
most sensitive to change from outside factors. We have discussed the application of these critical
accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

Inventories

Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost includes all material, labor
and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods. Overhead allocated to
manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of our plants and does not include amounts
related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies. Market value is based on a
detailed review in each business unit, at least quarterly, of all inventories on the basis of
individual styles or individual style-size-color stockkeeping units (“SKUs”) to identify slow
moving or excess products, discontinued and to-be-discontinued products, and off-quality
merchandise. This review matches inventory on hand, plus current production and purchase
commitments, with current and expected future sales orders. For those units in inventory that are
identified as slow-moving or excess quantities, we estimate their market value based on historical
experience and current realization trends. This evaluation, performed using a systematic and
consistent methodology, requires forecasts of future demand, market conditions and selling prices.
If the forecasted market value, on an individual style or SKU basis, is less than cost, we provide
an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory. This methodology recognizes inventory
exposures, on an individual style or SKU basis, at the time such losses are evident rather than at
the time goods are actually sold. Historically, these estimates of future demand and selling
prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to our timely identification and rapid
disposal of these reduced value inventories.

Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis. We provide for estimated inventory losses
that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date. Historically, our physical
inventory shrinkage has not been significant.

Long-lived Assets

We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the underlying tangible and intangible
assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, based on their respective fair values, with any excess
purchase price recorded as Goodwill. The process of assigning fair values, particularly to
acquired intangible assets, is highly subjective, as the fair value assessments are based on
forecasts of future cash flows. We use the same assumptions of future cash flows for assigning
fair values to these assets that we used for evaluation of the business acquisition.


Our depreciation policies for property, plant and equipment and our amortization policies for
definite-lived intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated economic lives of these assets.
Specifically for customer-related intangible assets, we review historical attrition patterns for
various groups of customers, and for license-related intangible assets, we review historical trends
and expected license renewal rates. We review these assets for possible impairment whenever events
or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. We
measure recoverability of the carrying value of these assets by comparison with estimated
undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. This review requires estimates and
assumptions about the forecasted amount and duration of future cash flows and residual value, if
any, attributable to the assets being tested. These evaluations have not resulted in any
significant impairment charges during the past three years.

We evaluate indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets and goodwill in all business units at
least annually, or more frequently if there is an indication of possible impairment. We measure
recoverability of the carrying value of intangible assets by comparison with the fair value of the
indefinite-lived trademark. The recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill is assessed by
comparing the book value of the underlying business to its fair value. Since fair value is
generally based on discounted cash flows, it requires management’s assumptions and judgment
regarding business strategies, future revenues and profitability, and a discount rate that reflects
the risk inherent in those future cash flows.

If the estimated fair value of a business reporting unit were to decline, or if we were to decide
to discontinue use of a trademark or to dispose of a business, we may be exposed to an impairment
charge, which could be material, related to intangible assets or goodwill. For each of the last
three years, the indicated fair value of the indefinite-lived trademark assets and goodwill in the
business units exceeded the respective carrying amount of those assets. For the reporting unit
whose estimated fair value was closest in dollar terms to its carrying value, the estimated fair
value exceeded its respective carrying value by approximately 18%.

Stock Options

Since our adoption of Statement 123(R) in 2005, we have been using a lattice option-pricing model
to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the
Board of Directors. We believe that a lattice model provides a refined estimate of the fair value
of options because it can incorporate (i) historical patterns and future assumptions about the
exercise of stock options for each of several groups of option holders in relation to changes in
the price of VF Common Stock and (ii) inputs that vary over time, such as


assumptions for interest
rates and volatility. We performed a rigorous review of all assumptions and believe that the
assumptions employed in each valuation are reflective of our outstanding options and underlying
Common Stock and of our groups of option participants. Our lattice valuation is based on the
assumptions listed in Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

One of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of
the options before exercise. In each year, we based our estimates on evaluations of the historical
and expected option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders that have
historically exhibited different option exercise patterns. These evaluations included (i)
voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of VF
Common Stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and (ii) involuntary
exercise patterns resulting from turnover, retirement and mortality.

Volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment. In each year, we based our estimate
of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility. Implied volatility was
based on short-term (up to 6 – 9 months) publicly traded near-the-money options on VF Common Stock.
We measured historical volatility over a ten year period, corresponding to the contractual term of
the options, using daily stock price observations. Our assumption for valuation purposes was that
expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the
historical volatility over the remainder of the ten year option term.

Pension Obligations

VF sponsors defined benefit pension plans as a key retirement benefit for most domestic employees
employed on or before December 31, 2004. The selection of appropriate actuarial assumptions for
determination of our accumulated and projected pension benefit liabilities and of our annual
pension expense is significant due to the long time period over which benefits are
accrued and paid. We review annually the principal economic actuarial assumptions, summarized in
Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and modify them based on current rates and trends.
We update annually participant demographics and the amount and timing of benefit payments. We
also periodically review and modify as necessary other plan assumptions such as rates of
retirement, termination, disability and mortality. Specifically during 2006 we updated the
assumptions for future compensation increases, retirement and turnover, and during 2005 we updated
the mortality assumption to a version of the RP 2000 mortality table that includes a provision for
improvements in life expectancy through 2015. We believe these assumptions are reflective of the
employee base covered by the plans and result in


the best estimate of the plans’ future experience.
Actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used.

One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate. The discount
rate is used to estimate the present value of our accumulated and projected benefit obligations at
each valuation date. We adjust, as necessary, our discount rate assumption at each annual
valuation date based on current market interest rates. We select our discount rate based on
matching high quality corporate bond yields to the projected benefit payments and duration of
obligations for participants in our pension plans. We use the population of U.S. corporate bonds
rated ‘Aa’ by Moody’s Investors Service (approximately 500 such bonds that are noncallable or with
make-whole provisions) and exclude the highest and lowest yielding bonds. The plans’ projected
benefit payments are matched to spot interest rates over the expected payment period, and a present
value is developed that produces a single equivalent discount rate that recognizes our plans’
distinct liability characteristics. We believe our 2007 discount rate of 6.40% appropriately
reflects current market conditions and the long-term nature of projected benefit payments to
participants in our pension plans. The discount rate for our plans may be higher than rates used
for plans at some other companies because of our plans’ higher percentage of female participants
with a longer life expectancy and higher percentage of inactive participants who will not begin
receiving vested benefits for many years.

Another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected long-term rate of return on
investment assets in our pension trust. Our investment objective is to maximize the long-term
return on a diversified portfolio of assets at an acceptable level of risk. The rate of return is
the weighted average of expected long-term asset return assumptions for the various classes of
assets held by the plan. Return assumptions are based on several factors, including the mix of
investment assets, historic and projected market returns by asset class and current market
conditions. Our rate of return assumption was 8.25% in 2007 and 2006 and 8.50% in 2005, which were
less than our actual compounded annual return over the preceding 15 years. During 2008, the target
mix of investment assets will be altered, with part of the change being to increase the portion of
fixed income investments and to lengthen the average duration of those investments to more closely
match expected benefit payments. The purpose of this change in plan investments is to better match
the effect of interest rate changes on the value of our plan’s
investment assets with the benefit obligations they are intended to fund, thereby reducing the year-to-year variability of our plan’s funded
status and resulting pension expense. Based on these planned


changes in investment mix, an
evaluation of market conditions and projected market returns, we will be lowering the rate of
return assumption to 8.00% for 2008.

The sensitivity of changes in valuation assumptions on our annual pension expense and on our plans’
projected benefit obligations (“PBO”), all other factors being equal, is illustrated by the
following:

Differences between actual results and actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over
future periods. During the last several years, actual results have differed significantly from
actuarial assumptions, resulting in $87.2 of accumulated net unrecognized actuarial losses at our
2007 valuation date. These accumulated losses arose primarily because (i) our pension plan
liabilities increased substantially as a result of the overall decline in the discount rate from
7.5% in 2001 to 6.4% in 2007 and (ii), while our actual investment return on pension plan assets
exceeded the actuarially assumed rate in the last three years, significant investment losses were
incurred in 2002 and 2001 due to the overall decline in the securities markets. Our policy is to
amortize unrecognized actuarial gains and losses to pension expense as follows: amounts in excess
of 20% of PBO at the beginning of the year are amortized over five years; amounts
totaling 10% to 20% of PBO are amortized over the expected average remaining service of active
participants; and amounts totaling less than 10% of the lower of investment assets or PBO at the
beginning of the year are not amortized.

The cost of pension benefits earned by our covered employees (commonly called “service cost”) has
averaged $21.4 million per year over the last three years. Pension expense recognized in our
financial statements was $13.1 million in 2007, $37.5 million in 2006 and $35.1 million in 2005.
Expense in each of 2006 and 2005 was significantly higher than the average annual service cost
because those years included a significant cost component for amortization of accumulated net


unrecognized actuarial losses (as discussed in the preceding paragraph). Our pension expense for
2007 decreased significantly due to reduced amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses and
increased plan investment assets arising from discretionary funding contributions of $75.0 million
and $55.0 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, and improved investment performance. Our pension
expense for 2008 is expected to be comparable to the 2007 level.

In our qualified defined benefit pension plan, the fair value of plan assets exceeded projected
benefit obligations, which resulted in a $27.4 million pension asset at our most recent valuation
date. Our unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan resulted in a $77.5 million pension
liability. The funded status of our plans recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheets could
change significantly in future years depending on securities market fluctuations, interest rates
and the level of VF contributions to the qualified plan.

Effective December 31, 2004, VF’s domestic defined benefit plans were amended to close the existing
plans to new entrants. The amendments did not affect the benefits of current plan participants or
their accrual of future benefits. Domestic employees hired after that date, plus employees at
certain acquired businesses not covered by those plans, now participate in a new defined
contribution arrangement with VF contributing amounts based on a percentage of eligible
compensation. Funds contributed under this new benefit arrangement are invested as directed by the
participants. This defined contribution feature did not have a significant effect on our pension
expense, or total retirement benefit expense, over the last three years. However, over a period of
years, the expense of our defined benefit plans is expected to decline as a percentage of our total
retirement benefit expense, and the year-to-year variability of our retirement benefit expense
should decrease.

Income Taxes

VF’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.
These audits may result in proposed adjustments. We have reviewed all issues raised upon
examination, as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations. We have
evaluated these potential issues under the “more-likely-than-not” standard of FASB Interpretation
No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

.
A tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of
benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Such judgments and estimates may change
based on audit settlements, court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations. To the
extent we prevail in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position
for which accruals have been established, or to the extent we are required to


pay amounts greater
than established accruals, our income tax expense could be materially affected in the period of
resolution. We do not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate
resolution of income tax uncertainties. There are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses.

We have recorded deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss
carryforwards. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in
specific jurisdictions, the amount and timing of which are uncertain, possible changes in tax laws
and tax planning strategies. If in our judgment it appears that we will not be able to generate
sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods, we
have recorded valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be
ultimately realized. An adjustment to income tax expense would be required in a future period if
we determine that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded
amount.

We have not provided U.S. income taxes on a portion of our foreign subsidiaries’ undistributed
earnings because we intend to invest those earnings indefinitely. If we were to decide to remit
those earnings to the United States in a future period, our provision for income taxes could
increase in that period.

The balance sheet classifications and amounts of accrued income taxes related to assets and
liabilities of acquired companies were based on assumptions that could change depending on the
ultimate resolution of certain tax matters. Since these income tax accruals were established in
the allocation of the purchase price of acquired businesses, future changes in these amounts could

Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements

From time to time, we may make oral or written statements, including statements in this Annual
Report that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities
laws. These include statements concerning plans, objectives, projections and expectations relating
to VF’s operations or economic performance, and assumptions related thereto.
Forward-looking statements are made based on our expectations and beliefs concerning future events
impacting VF and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We caution that
forward-looking statements are not guarantees and actual results could differ materially from those
expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.


Known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results of
operations or financial condition of VF to differ materially from those expressed or implied by
such forward-looking statements are summarized in Item 1.A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, VF conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of VF’s “disclosure controls and
procedures” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934
(the “Exchange Act”) as of December 29, 2007. These require that VF ensure that information
required to be disclosed by VF in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in the
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to VF’s
management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on VF’s evaluation, the principal executive
officer and the principal financial officer concluded that VF’s disclosure controls and procedures
are effective.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

VF’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). VF’s management conducted an
assessment of VF’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework described in

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, VF’s management has determined that VF’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 29, 2007. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 29, 2007 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

See “Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedules” at the end of
this annual report on page F-1 for “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting.”

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of VF Corporation (“VF”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). VF’s management conducted an assessment of VF’s internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework described in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

, issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, VF’s management has determined that VF’s internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 29, 2007.

Management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of VF’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2007 has been audited
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included herein.

F-2

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of V.F. Corporation (the “Company”):

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item
15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of V.F. Corporation and its
subsidiaries at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 29, 2007 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2)
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 29, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s
management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

As more fully described in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner
in which it accounts for (i) stock-based compensation effective January 2, 2005; (ii) uncertain tax
positions effective December 31, 2006; and (iii) defined benefit pension and

F-3

other postretirement plans effective December 30, 2006, as well as the measurement date for the
related plan assets and benefit obligations effective December 31, 2006.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 2007

Note A — Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business:

VF Corporation (and its subsidiaries, collectively known as “VF”) is a
global apparel company based in the United States. VF designs and manufactures or sources from
independent contractors a variety of apparel and footwear for all
ages. Products are marketed primarily under VF-owned brand names. VF has significant market
shares in jeanswear, outdoor apparel and sportswear.
VF is also a leader in daypacks, backpacks and technical outdoor equipment and in occupational
apparel.

VF markets these products to a broad customer base throughout the world. Products having various
price points are sold through multiple channels of distribution, including specialty stores,
department stores, national chains, mass merchants and VF-operated retail stores. VF’s ten largest
customers, all U.S.-based retailers, accounted for 27% of 2007 total revenues and 27% of total 2007
accounts receivable. Sales are made on an unsecured basis under customary terms that may vary by
product, channel of distribution or geographic region. VF continuously monitors the
creditworthiness of its customers and has established internal policies regarding customer credit
limits. The breadth of product offerings, combined with the large number and geographic diversity
of its customers, limits VF’s concentration of risks.

Basis of Presentation:

All financial statements and related disclosures are presented in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of VF and its subsidiaries, after
elimination of intercompany transactions and balances. For subsidiaries that are not wholly owned,
the minority owners’ interest in net income, which is not significant, is reported in
Miscellaneous, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, and the minority ownership interest in
net assets is reported in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Investments in
20-50% owned companies in which VF does not exercise control are accounted for using the equity
method of accounting.

In April 2007, VF sold its intimate apparel business consisting of its domestic and international
women’s intimate apparel business units. Accordingly, the Consolidated Statements of Income and
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows have been reclassified to present the intimate apparel
businesses as discontinued operations for all periods. General interest expense has not been
allocated to the discontinued operations. Similarly, the assets and liabilities of the
discontinued operations have been separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts
presented herein, unless otherwise stated, relate to continuing operations. See Note C.

Fiscal Year:

VF operates and reports using a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest
to December 31 of each year. All references to “2007”, “2006” and “2005” relate to the 52 week
fiscal years ended on December 29, 2007, December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively.
Certain foreign subsidiaries report using a December 31 year-end due to local statutory
requirements. For presentation purposes in this report, all fiscal years are presented as ended in
December.

Foreign Currency Translation:

Financial statements of most foreign subsidiaries are measured using
the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign
currency are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date,
and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. Resulting
translation gains and losses, and transaction gains and losses on long-term advances to foreign
subsidiaries, are reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). For a foreign
subsidiary that uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency, the effects of remeasuring assets
and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in the Consolidated Statements of
Income. Net
transaction gains of $6.8 million in 2007 and $11.6 million in 2006 and losses of $2.5 million in
2005 arising from transactions denominated in a
currency other than the functional currency of a particular entity are included in the Consolidated
Statements of Income.

F-11

Cash and Equivalents

include demand deposits and temporary investments that are readily convertible
into cash and will mature within three months of their purchase. There is no significant valuation
risk due to subprime mortgage credit exposures.

Accounts Receivable:

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts, less estimated
allowances for trade terms, sales incentive programs, customer markdowns and charge-backs, and
returned products. Allowances are based on evaluations of specific product and customer
circumstances, retail sales performance, historical and anticipated trends and current economic
conditions. Royalty receivables are recorded at amounts earned based on the licensees’ sales of
licensed products, subject in some cases to minimum annual amounts from individual licensees. VF
maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of
customers and licensees to make required payments. All accounts are subject to ongoing review for
ultimate collectibility. An allowance is provided for specific customer accounts where collection
is doubtful and for the inherent risk in ultimate collectibility of total balances due considering
the aging of balances, anticipated trends and economic conditions. Receivables are charged against the allowance when it is probable the amounts will not be recovered. There is no
off-balance sheet credit exposure related to customer receivables.

Inventories

are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is net of any purchase discounts or
rebates received from vendors. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method for
73% of total 2007 inventories and 69% of total 2006 inventories. For remaining inventories, cost
is determined on the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method (primarily due to Internal Revenue Service
conformity requirements where LIFO is used for income tax purposes). The LIFO method is used for
jeanswear, wholesale sportswear and occupational apparel inventories located in the United States
and Canada. The value of inventories stated on the LIFO method is not significantly different from
the value determined under the FIFO method. Market value for materials and supplies is replacement
cost. Market value for finished goods is the expected net realizable value considering the quantity
and quality of inventories, forecasted demand and historical and expected realization trends.

Long-lived Assets:

Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill are stated at
cost. Improvements to property, plant and equipment that substantially extend the useful life of
the asset, and interest costs incurred during construction of major assets, are capitalized.
Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Goodwill represents the excess of costs
over the fair value of net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of businesses
acquired. Goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, which at VF is either a reportable segment or one level below a reportable segment.

Depreciation of owned assets and amortization of assets under capital leases are computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from 3 to 10 years for
machinery and equipment and up to 40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are depreciated
over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term. Intangible assets having
indefinite lives (trademarks and tradenames) and goodwill are not amortized. Intangible assets
having definite lives (primarily customer relationships, contracts to license acquired trademarks
to third parties and contracts to license trademarks from third parties) are amortized over their
estimated useful lives, ranging from less than one year to 30 years, using straight-line or
accelerated methods consistent with the expected realization of benefits to be received.
Depreciation and amortization expense related to producing or otherwise obtaining finished goods
inventories is included in Cost of Goods Sold, and other depreciation and amortization expense is
included in Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses. Upon retirement or disposition, the
asset cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts, and
a gain or loss is recognized based on the difference between the net proceeds received and the
asset’s net carrying value.

VF’s policy is to evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment
at least annually and to evaluate all long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
Goodwill is evaluated for possible impairment by
comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including the goodwill assigned
to that reporting unit. Fair value of a reporting unit is generally estimated using an approach in
which forecasted cash flows of a reporting unit are discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks of
those cash flows. An impairment charge would be

F-12

recorded if the carrying value of the goodwill
exceeds its implied fair value. Intangible assets with indefinite lives (trademarks) are evaluated
for possible impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. Fair value
for these assets is estimated as the discounted value of future revenues arising from a trademark,
using a royalty rate that a third party would pay for use of that trademark. The amount of
impairment charge would be the excess of the trademark’s carrying value over its estimated fair
value. An impairment loss for property and intangible assets with identified useful lives would be
recorded if forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset or asset group are not
expected to be adequate to recover the asset’s carrying value. The amount of impairment charge for
these assets would be the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value.

In connection with the decision near the end of 2006 to exit the women’s intimate apparel business,
VF recorded an impairment charge for the difference between the recorded book value of the
long-lived assets of this business and the expected net sales proceeds. See Basis of Presentation
above and Note C.

Revenue Recognition:

Revenue is recognized when (i) there is a contract or other arrangement of
sale, (ii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, (iii) title and the risks of ownership have
been transferred to the customer and (iv) collection of the receivable is reasonably assured. Net
Sales to wholesale customers and sales through the internet are generally recognized when the
product has been received by the customer. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are
included in Net Sales. Net Sales are recorded after reduction of estimated allowances for trade
terms, sales incentive programs, customer markdowns and charge-backs, and product returns. Sales
incentive programs with retail customers include stated discounts. Sales incentive programs
directly with consumers include rebate and coupon offers. These allowances are estimated based on
evaluations of specific product and customer circumstances, retail sales performance, historical
and anticipated trends, and current economic conditions; historically, they have not differed
significantly from actual results. Net Sales at VF-operated retail stores, after reduction of an
estimated allowance for returns, are recognized at the time products are purchased by consumers.
Sales taxes and value added taxes collected from customers and remitted directly to governmental
authorities are excluded from Net Sales.

Royalty income is recognized as earned based on the greater of contractual minimum royalty levels
or licensees’ sales of licensed products at rates specified in the licensing contracts.

Cost of Goods Sold

for VF-manufactured goods includes all materials, labor and overhead costs
incurred in the production process. Cost of Goods Sold for contracted or purchased finished goods
includes the purchase costs and related overhead. In both cases, overhead includes all costs
related to manufacturing or purchasing finished goods, including costs of planning, purchasing,
quality control, freight, duties, royalties paid to third parties and shrinkage. For product lines
having a lifetime warranty, a provision for estimated future repair or replacement costs, based on
historical and anticipated trends, is recorded when these products are sold. Sales incentives to
consumers in the form of free products are included in Cost of Goods Sold.

Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses

include costs of product development, selling,
marketing and advertising, VF-operated retail stores, warehousing, shipping and handling, licensing
and administration. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $362.1 million in 2007,
$321.9 million in 2006 and $303.0 million in 2005. Advertising costs include cooperative
advertising payments made to VF’s retail customers as direct reimbursement of documented
advertising costs incurred by those retailers for advertising VF’s products. Cooperative
advertising costs, totaling $37.4 million in 2007, $39.4 million in 2006 and $34.4 million in 2005,
are independently verified to support the fair value of advertising reimbursed by VF. Shipping and
handling costs for inventory totaled $213.0 million in 2007, $201.5 million in 2006 and $186.0
million in 2005. Expenses related to royalty income, including amortization of licensing
intangible assets, were $23.6 million in 2007, $22.5 million in 2006 and $24.0 million in 2005.

Rent Expense:

VF enters into noncancelable operating leases for retail stores, distribution,
office and other real estate and for equipment. Leases for real estate have initial terms ranging
from 3 to 15 years, generally with renewal options. Leases for equipment typically have initial
terms ranging from 2 to 5 years. Most leases have fixed rentals, with many of the real estate
leases providing for additional payments based on sales volume or for payments of real estate
taxes and occupancy-related costs. Contingent rent expense, based on Net Sales at individual
retail store

F-13

locations being in excess of a stated base amount, is recognized when the liability is
probable. Rent expense for leases having rent holidays or scheduled rent increases is recorded on
a straight-line basis over the lease term beginning when VF has possession or control of the leased
premises. Lease incentives received from landlords and the difference between straight-line rent
expense and scheduled rent payments are deferred in Other Liabilities and amortized as a reduction
of rent expense over the lease term.

Self-insurance:

VF is primarily self-insured for employee group medical, workers’ compensation,
vehicle, property and general liability exposures. Liabilities for self-insured exposures are
accrued at the present value of amounts expected to be paid based on historical claims experience
and actuarial data for forecasted settlements of claims filed and for incurred but not yet reported
claims. Accruals for self-insured exposures are included in current and noncurrent liabilities
based on the expected period of payment. Excess liability insurance has been purchased to cover
claims in excess of self-insured amounts.

Income Taxes

are provided on Net Income for financial reporting purposes. Income Taxes are based
on amounts of taxes payable or refundable in the current year and on expected future tax
consequences of events that are recognized in the financial statements in different periods than
they are recognized in tax returns. As a result of timing of recognition and measurement
differences between financial accounting standards and income tax laws, temporary differences arise
between amounts of pretax financial statement income and taxable income and between reported
amounts of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and their respective tax
bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets
reflect estimated future tax effects attributable to these temporary differences and to net
operating loss and net capital loss carryforwards, based on tax rates expected to be in effect for
years in which the differences are expected to be settled or realized. Realization of deferred tax
assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions. Valuation allowances are
used to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts considered likely to be realized. U.S. deferred
income taxes are not provided on undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries where such earnings
are considered to be permanently invested. Accrued income taxes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets
include unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, appropriately
classified as current or noncurrent. The provision for Income Taxes also includes estimated
interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

Earnings Per Share:

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Diluted
earnings per share considers the effect of potentially dilutive securities such as stock options,
restricted stock, restricted stock units and Preferred Stock (prior to its conversion into Common
Stock during 2006). Stock options are included in diluted earnings per share when the average
market price of VF Common Stock during the quarter exceeds the exercise price of the option.
Performance-based restricted stock units are included in diluted earnings per share in the quarter
in which the underlying performance conditions have been satisfied.

Changes in Accounting Policies:

Defined benefit pension plans — In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued FASB Statement No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans

(“Statement 158”). Statement 158, effective for December 2006, required that
(i) the funded status of a defined benefit plan, measured as the difference between the fair value
of plan assets and projected benefit obligations, be recorded in the balance sheet and (ii) gains
and losses for differences between actuarial assumptions and actual results, and unrecognized prior
service costs, be recorded as a component of Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income. Accordingly, VF recorded a charge of
$55.5 million (net of income taxes of $34.5 million) to
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) effective at the end of
2006. Statement 158
did not change the measurement of plan assets and benefit obligations or the measurement of benefit
expense in the statement of income.

Further, Statement 158 required VF to change its September measurement date for valuation of plan
assets and projected benefit obligations to its December fiscal year-end date before the end of
2008. VF elected for 2007 to change its plans’ measurement date to December and accordingly
recorded, effective at the beginning of 2007, (i) a charge of
$3.8 million (net of income taxes of $2.4 million) to
Retained Earnings for pension expense for the period October to
December 2006 and (ii) a credit of $22.5 million (net of
income taxes of $14.0 million) to Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the changes in plan assets and
projected benefit obligations for that period. See Note N for the effect on the pension plans’ assets and
projected benefit obligations of the change in measurement date from September 2006 to December
2006.

F-14

Liability
for uncertain tax positions — In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”), which
clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions. FIN 48 prescribed the
recognition threshold an income tax provision is required to meet before being recorded in the
financial statements and provided guidance on classification and disclosures of tax positions. VF
adopted FIN 48 by recording a cumulative effect charge of $2.3 million (net of $0.2 million income
tax effect) to Retained Earnings at the beginning of 2007, a $2.8 million reduction in Goodwill and
a $0.5 million reduction in unrecognized income tax benefits, in accordance with the provisions of
FIN 48. See Note Q.

Stock-based compensation — VF has three types of stock-based employee compensation — stock
options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock — which are described in Note P. VF
adopted FASB Statement No. 123(Revised),

Share-Based Payment

(“Statement 123(R)”) effective as of
the beginning of 2005, which principally required the recognition of stock option expense in the
statement of income. Using the modified retrospective method of adoption, VF recorded in the 2005
Consolidated Statement of Income a noncash charge of $11.8 million (net of income taxes of $7.9
million) as the Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Policy for periods prior to January
2005. This 2005 charge represented $0.11 per basic share and $0.10 per diluted share.
Accordingly, under this Statement, stock-based compensation in 2007, 2006 and 2005 consisted of (i)
the cost, net of estimated forfeitures, recognized for stock-based payments granted during 2007,
2006 and 2005 based on their grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of
Statement 123(R) plus (ii) the cost recognized for stock-based payments granted prior to but not
vested as of the beginning of 2005 based on grant date fair values estimated in accordance with the
prior accounting rules.

Details of the stock compensation plans and of the fair value assumptions used for stock options
granted in 2007, 2006 and 2005 are described in Note P.

Derivative Financial Instruments

are measured at their fair value and are recognized as Other
Current Assets or Accrued Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. VF formally documents
hedged transactions and hedging instruments and assesses, both at the inception of a contract and
on an ongoing basis, whether the hedging instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in
cash flows of the hedged transactions. Derivative financial instruments are used for risk
management and are not used for trading or speculative purposes.

If certain criteria are met, a derivative may be specifically designated and accounted for as (i) a
hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows for a forecasted transaction or (ii) a hedge of the
exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm
commitment. The criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are (i)
whether an appropriate hedging instrument has been designated and identified to reduce an
identified exposure and (ii) whether there is a high correlation between changes in the fair value
of the hedging instrument and the identified exposure. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
accounted for as cash flow hedges are deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income until the
hedged transaction affects earnings, at which point the amount is reclassified to Net Income
(primarily in Cost of Goods Sold) as an offset to the earnings impact of the hedged transaction.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges are recognized in Net
Income as an offset to the earnings impact of the hedged item. These hedging transactions are
evaluated each quarter, with changes in fair value deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income or reported in Net Income, depending on the nature of the hedged item or risk and the
effectiveness of the hedge. The impact of a hedging instrument that is not effective in hedging
the intended cash flows or values, which has not been significant, is recorded immediately in
earnings. Hedging cash flows are classified in the Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows in the same category as the items being hedged. If a derivative instrument does not
meet the criteria for hedge accounting, which would be rare, any change in fair value is recognized
in Miscellaneous Income or Expense when it occurs.

Legal and Other Contingencies:

Management periodically assesses, based on the latest information
available, liabilities and contingencies in connection with legal proceedings and other claims that
may arise from time to time. When it is probable that a loss has been or will be incurred, we
record the loss, or a reasonable estimate of the loss, in

F-15

the consolidated financial statements.
Estimates of losses are adjusted in the period in which additional information becomes available or
circumstances change. We disclose a contingent liability when there is at least a reasonable
possibility that a loss has been incurred. Management believes that the outcome of any outstanding
or pending matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on
the consolidated financial statements.

Use of Estimates:

In preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those
estimates.

Reclassifications:

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2007
presentation.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards:

In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“Statement 157”), and in February 2007 issued FASB Statement No. 159,

The
Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 115

(“Statement 159”). Statement 157, which does not require any new fair value
measurements, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets
and liabilities and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Statement 159 permits
entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.
Statements 157 and 159 are effective for VF’s 2008 fiscal year. VF is currently evaluating the
impact of adopting Statements 157 and 159.

In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 141(Revised),

Business Combinations

(“Statement 141(R)”), which revises how business combinations are accounted for, both at the
acquisition date and in subsequent periods. Statement 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a
business combination to (i) recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in either a full or a partial acquisition, (ii) measure all assets acquired and liabilities
assumed at their fair value at the acquisition date, (iii) expense transaction and restructuring
costs and (iv) provide additional disclosures. Statement 141(R) is effective for transactions in
which VF obtains control of a business beginning in its 2009 fiscal year. The impact on VF of
adopting Statement 141(R) will depend on the nature, terms and size of business combinations
completed after the effective date.

Also in December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51

(“Statement 160”). Statement 160
requires a company to classify noncontrolling (minority) interests as equity instead of as a
liability and provides guidance on the accounting for transactions between an entity and
noncontrolling interests. Statement 160, effective for VF’s 2009 fiscal year, requires retroactive
adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements, with all other requirements to be applied
prospectively. VF is currently evaluating the impact of adopting Statement 160.

In June 2007, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) of the FASB issued EITF 06-11,

Accounting for
Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards.

EITF 06-11 requires that the tax
benefit related to dividend equivalents declared on restricted stock units that are expected to
vest be recorded as an increase in additional paid-in capital. EITF 06-11 is to be applied
prospectively for tax benefits on dividends declared beginning in VF’s 2008 fiscal year. The
impact of adopting EITF 06-11, based on VF’s 2007 transactions, would have been to increase the
2007 provision for Income Taxes (i.e., reduce Net Income) and increase Additional Paid-in Capital
by approximately $0.6 million.

Note B — Acquisitions

On February 28, 2007, VF acquired substantially all the operating assets of Majestic Athletic, Inc.
(“Majestic”) and related companies for a cost of
$131.5 million. Majestic currently holds exclusive on-field
uniform rights for all 30 major league baseball teams, including supplying each team
with on-field

MLB Authentic Collection

™

outerwear, batting practice jerseys, T-shirts,
shorts and fleece. Majestic also markets

Majestic

â

brand baseball-related
consumer apparel to wholesale accounts. On August 27, 2007, VF acquired lucy activewear, inc.
(“lucy activewear”), a chain of retail stores marketing

lucy

â

brand women’s
activewear, for a cost of $114.1 million. On

F-16

August 31, 2007, VF acquired Seven For All Mankind,
LLC (“Seven For All Mankind”), marketer of the

7 For All Mankind

â

brand of women’s
and men’s premium denim jeanswear and related apparel products in the United States and Europe, for
a cost of $773.1 million. The lucy activewear business and the Seven For All Mankind business
together formed the foundation for a new lifestyle-based coalition called Contemporary Brands. In
addition, VF acquired Eagle Creek, Inc. (“Eagle Creek”), maker of

Eagle Creek

â

brand adventure travel gear that includes accessories, luggage and daypacks, and the brand-related
assets of a former licensee who had rights to market VF’s

The North Face

â

brand in
China and Nepal (“The North Face — China”). Because the licensing arrangement represented an
arms-length contract, no gain or loss was recognized at the acquisition date. The total cost of
these acquisitions, collectively referred to as the “2007 Acquisitions,” was $1,070.3 million, plus
the assumption of $11.6 million of debt.

The Majestic, lucy activewear, Seven For All Mankind and Eagle Creek acquisitions are consistent
with VF’s goal of acquiring strong lifestyle brands that have high growth potential within their
target markets. The acquisition of The North Face — China gives VF control of one of its leading
brands in one of the fastest growing markets in the world.

In the Majestic acquisition, the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase price
by $14.0 million. Since there is a maximum of $10.0 million of contingent consideration based on
growth in revenues that may result in the recognition of additional purchase cost, that amount was
accrued as a deferred credit, with the remaining $4.0 million excess fair value at the acquisition
date applied to reduce on a pro rata basis amounts initially assigned to noncurrent assets. At
December 2007, $1.5 million of the contingent consideration was earned and payable, with the
additional $8.5 million maximum contingent consideration that can be earned through 2009 recorded
as a deferred credit in Other Liabilities. If the final contingent consideration earned is less
than the $10.0 million maximum, the difference will be recognized as a pro rata reduction of
amounts initially assigned to noncurrent assets. Contingent consideration for Eagle Creek, with no
maximum amount, is payable at the end of 2008 and 2009 based on a measure of profitability over
those periods. Any contingent consideration earned will be recorded as additional Goodwill.

On September 1, 2006, VF acquired a 60% interest in a newly formed joint venture to design, market
and distribute VF-branded products in India for a total cost of $33.2 million. Prior to the
transaction, the joint venture partner marketed the

Lee

â

,

Wrangler

â

,

Nautica

â

,

JanSport

â

and

Kipling

â

brands under license or distribution agreements. Because all preexisting
relationships were arms-length contracts, no gain or loss was recognized upon formation of the
joint venture.

VF acquired the common stock of Reef Holdings Corporation (“Reef”) on April 14, 2005 for a total
cost of $187.7 million. Reef designs and markets surf-inspired products, including sandals,
apparel, shoes and accessories under the

Reef

â

brand. This acquisition is
consistent with VF’s strategy of acquiring strong lifestyle brands with high growth potential. VF
also acquired substantially all of the net assets of Holoubek, Inc. (“Holoubek”) on January 3,
2005. Holoubek has rights to manufacture and market certain apparel products, including t-shirts
and fleece, under license from Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Inc. The cost was $26.3 million,
consisting of $23.8 million in cash payments and $2.5 million in notes payable over a five-year
period. In addition, $2.5 million in contingent consideration is payable in 2008 upon the
occurrence of certain events. Any contingent consideration earned will be recorded as additional
Goodwill.

Management has allocated the purchase price of each acquisition to acquired tangible and intangible
assets, and assumed liabilities, based on their respective fair values. The purchase price
allocations for certain of the 2007
Acquisitions are subject to possible adjustment for income tax matters and, for the Seven For All
Mankind acquisition, valuation of intangible assets. The following table summarizes the estimated
fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the 2007 Acquisitions and the 2006
acquisition at their respective dates of acquisition:

For the 2007 Acquisitions, management believes the

7 For All Mankind

â

lucy

,

Majestic

â

and

Eagle Creek

â

trademarks and
tradenames have indefinite lives. Amounts assigned to amortizable intangible assets included
$223.8 million of customer relationships and $49.7 million of licensing contracts. Customer
relationships are being amortized using accelerated methods over their estimated weighted average
useful lives of 19 years, and licensing contracts are being amortized using straight-line and
accelerated methods over their estimated weighted average useful
lives of 18 years. For the 2006 acquisition in India, amounts assigned to amortizable intangible assets included
customer relationships, which are being amortized using an
accelerated method over their weighted
average useful life of 15 years.

Except for the Majestic and Holoubek transactions, the purchase price of each acquisition exceeded
the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, with the excess purchase price
recorded as Goodwill. Factors that contributed to recognition of Goodwill included (i) expected
growth rates and profitability of the acquired companies, (ii) the ability to expand the brands
within their markets or to new markets, (iii) their experienced workforce, (iv) VF’s strategies for
growth in sales, income and cash flows and (v) expected synergies with existing VF business units.
Approximately $165.3 million of Goodwill in the 2007 Acquisitions is expected to be deductible for
income tax purposes.

Operating results of the acquisitions have been included in the consolidated financial statements
since their respective acquisition dates.

The following pro forma results of operations assume that the Majestic and Seven for All Mankind
acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of 2006. These pro forma amounts should not be relied
on as an indication of the results of operations that VF
would have achieved had the acquisitions
taken place at a different date or of future results that VF

might achieve. Pro forma operating
results for the other 2007 acquisitions and for the one acquisition in 2006, for periods prior to
their respective dates of acquisition, are not provided because these acquisitions, in the
aggregate, are not material to VF’s results of operations.

Sale of Intimate Apparel Business Classified as Discontinued Operations:

In December 2006,
management and the Board of Directors decided to exit VF’s domestic and international women’s
intimate apparel business (formerly referred to as the Intimate Apparel Coalition, a reportable
business segment). On April 1, 2007, VF sold the net assets of this business (except for an
investment in marketable securities of an intimate apparel supplier) for $348.7 million, plus $28.8
million related to the business unit’s Cash and Equivalents. The transaction was consistent with
VF’s stated objective of focusing on lifestyle businesses having high growth and profit potential.
The results of operations and cash flows of the intimate apparel business are separately presented
as discontinued operations for all periods in accordance with FASB Statement No. 144,

Accounting
for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

(“Statement 144”). Similarly, the assets and liabilities of this
business have been reclassified and reported as held for sale for all periods presented.

VF recorded a charge of $42.2 million in 2006, computed in accordance with Statement 144, for the
difference between the recorded book value of the intimate apparel business and the expected net
sales proceeds. The recorded book value included $117.5 million of Goodwill and $32.0 million of
foreign currency translation losses, net of income tax benefit, deferred in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income (Loss). The charge was recorded as a valuation allowance against noncurrent
assets of the intimate apparel business. In addition, VF recorded a noncash partial pension plan
curtailment charge of $5.6 million for the withdrawal of intimate apparel participants from VF’s
defined benefit pension plans. The writedown to expected net sales proceeds, plus the pension
curtailment charge, were recorded in 2006 as a loss on disposal of the intimate apparel business,
net of an income tax benefit of $10.9 million. Included in the determination of the $42.2 million
impairment charge in 2006 was a $17.2 million unrealized gain on the investment in marketable
securities of a supplier to our former intimate apparel business mentioned above. However, those
marketable securities were not included in the final sales transaction. Accordingly, the loss on
disposal in 2007 of $24.6 million consisted of (i) a $17.2 million increase in the loss related to
the unsold marketable securities, (ii) final determination of the sales price and (iii) income tax
adjustments of the sales price allocation. Future changes to the loss on disposal may result from
the impact, if any, of settling income tax or other retained liabilities.

Since the marketable securities remain unsold at the end of 2007, in accordance with FASB Statement
No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

, they continue to be
classified as available for sale and recorded at market value, with unrealized appreciation of $7.7
million at December 2007 recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.

Other
investment securities at December 2007 included common stock of a supplier to our former
intimate apparel business. These securities had a market value of $12.1 million and a cost of $4.4
million at December 2007; these securities were included as part of discontinued operations (Note
C) at December 2006. Remaining investment securities at December 2007 and 2006 consisted primarily
of life insurance contracts held in an irrevocable trust to partially fund liabilities under the
supplemental defined benefit pension plan (Note N). Both the common stock of a supplier to our
former intimate apparel business and the life insurance contracts are considered to be
available-for-sale securities and, accordingly, are recorded at fair value.

Short-term borrowings had a weighted average interest rate of 6.4% at the end of 2007 and 8.0% at
the end of 2006.

In October 2007, VF entered into a $1.0 billion senior domestic unsecured committed revolving bank
credit agreement that supports issuance of up to $1.0 billion in commercial paper, with any unused
portion available for general corporate purposes. This agreement, which replaced a similar
agreement, expires in October 2012 and can be extended by VF for one additional year on both the
first and second anniversary dates, with approval of the lenders. The agreement requires VF to pay
a facility fee of 0.06% per year and contains a financial covenant requiring VF’s ratio of
consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization to remain below 60%. The agreement
contains other covenants and events of default, including limitations on liens, subsidiary
indebtedness, sales of assets, and a cross-acceleration event of default if more than $100.0
million of other debt is in default and has been accelerated by the lenders. If VF fails in the
performance of any covenant under this agreement, the banks may terminate their obligation to lend,
and any bank borrowings outstanding under this agreement may become due and payable. At the end of
2007, VF was in compliance with all covenants, and the entire amount of the credit agreement was
available for borrowing, except for $10.1 million related to standby letters of credit issued
under the agreement on behalf of VF.

In
October 2007, certain international subsidiaries, with VF
Corporation as guarantor, entered into a

€

250.0
million (U.S. dollar equivalent of $367.9 million at December 2007) senior international unsecured
committed revolving bank credit agreement, which replaced a similar agreement. The new agreement,
which expires in October 2012, can be extended by VF for one additional year on both the first and
second anniversary dates, with approval of the lenders. The agreement has a 0.06% facility fee.
The terms and conditions of the international bank credit agreement are substantially the same as
those of VF’s $1.0 billion domestic credit agreement. At the end of 2007, VF was in compliance
with all covenants, and the equivalent of $275.2 million was available for borrowing under the agreement.

All notes, along with any amounts outstanding under the domestic bank credit agreement or the
international bank credit agreement (Note J), rank equally as senior obligations of VF. All notes
contain customary covenants and events of default, including limitations on liens and
sale-leaseback transactions and a cross-acceleration event of default. The cross-acceleration
provision of the 2010 and 2033 notes is triggered if more than $50.0 million of other debt is in
default and has been accelerated by the lenders. For the 2017 and 2037 notes, the
cross-acceleration trigger is $100.0 million. If VF fails in the performance of any covenant under
the indenture that governs the respective notes, the trustee or lenders may declare the principal
due and payable immediately. At the end of 2007, VF was in compliance with all covenants.
Existing long-term debt agreements do
not contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings. However,
for the $600.0 million of senior notes issued in 2007, if there were a change in control of VF and, as a result of
the change in control

,

the notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies,
then VF would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of
notes repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. VF may
redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to (i) 100% of the principal amount, plus
accrued interest to the redemption date, and (ii) a premium for
any excess of the U.S. Treasury rate
over the stated rate for the notes, plus an additional 20 basis points for the 2017 notes and 25
basis points for the 2037 notes.

The 6.00% notes, having a principal balance of $300.0 million, are recorded net of unamortized
original issue discount. Interest Expense on these notes is recorded at an effective annual
interest rate of 6.19%, including

F-25

amortization
of the original issue discount, deferred gain on an interest rate hedging contract
(Note U) and debt issuance costs.

The amount outstanding at the end of 2006 under the international revolving credit agreement was
classified as long-term because it was expected to remain outstanding for at least 12 months. The
entire amount was repaid when that agreement was replaced with a new credit agreement during 2007.
See Note J.

Capital
leases and other included a capital lease obligation of $43.3 million at the end of 2007
and $46.2 million at the end of 2006, at an effective interest rate of 5.06%. Also included at the
end of 2006 was a $33.0 million noninterest-bearing note at a carrying value of $32.2 million. The
noninterest-bearing note, which was paid in 2007, was recorded at a discount reflecting VF’s
incremental borrowing rate at the time the debt was incurred, with the discount amortized as
Interest Expense over the life of the note.

The scheduled payments of long-term debt and future minimum lease payments for capital leases at
the end of 2007 are summarized as follows:

Note N — Retirement and Savings Benefit Plans

VF has several retirement and savings benefit plans covering eligible employees. VF retains the
right to amend any aspect of the plans, or to curtail or discontinue any of the plans, subject to
local regulations.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans:

VF sponsors a noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension
plan covering most full-time domestic employees initially employed before 2005. For employees
covered by this plan, VF also sponsors an unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan that
provides benefits that exceed limitations imposed by income tax regulations. These defined benefit
plans provide pension benefits based on compensation levels and years of service. The effect of
these pension plans on income was as follows:

VF incurred a $5.6 million partial pension plan curtailment charge in 2006 related to the sale of
the intimate apparel business, with a related decrease in projected
benefit obligations of $26.6
million. See Note C.

The following provides a reconciliation of the changes in fair value of the pension plans’ assets
and projected benefit obligations, and the plans’ funded status, based on a December 31 measurement

Projected benefit obligations at any pension plan measurement date are the present value of vested
and unvested pension benefits, based on both past and projected future employee service and
compensation levels. Accumulated benefit obligations are the present value of vested and unvested
pension benefits earned through the measurement date, without projection to future periods. VF’s
two defined benefit pension plans are summarized as follows:

Differences between actual results and amounts estimated using actuarial assumptions are deferred
and amortized as a component of future years’ pension expense. These unrecognized actuarial gains
and losses are amortized to pension expense as follows: amounts in excess of 20% of projected
benefit obligations at the beginning of the year are amortized over five years; amounts totaling
10% to 20% of projected benefit obligations are amortized over the expected average remaining
service of active participants; and amounts totaling less than 10% of the lower of plan assets or
projected benefit obligations are not amortized. Under Statement 158, the deferred actuarial loss
and the deferred prior service cost were recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).
The estimated amounts of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to be amortized to pension
expense in 2008 are as follows: deferred actuarial loss — $1.4 million and deferred prior service
cost — $2.7 million.

Management’s investment strategy is to invest the plan’s assets in a diversified portfolio of
domestic and international equity, fixed income and real estate securities to provide long-term
growth in plan assets at an acceptable level of risk. This strategy, the resulting allocation of
plan assets and the selection of independent investment managers are reviewed periodically. There
are no investments in VF debt or equity securities, and the plan’s exposure to subprime mortgage
credit risk is not significant.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was based on the weighted average of the
expected returns for the major asset classes in which the plan invests. Expected returns by asset
class were developed through analysis of historical market returns, current market conditions,
inflation expectations and other economic factors. The 8.25% assumed rate of return on plan assets
in 2007 was lower than actual long-term historical returns. The actual allocations by asset class
at the latest measurement dates, and the revised target allocation for 2008, were as follows:

VF makes contributions to the plan sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable
laws, plus discretionary amounts as considered prudent. VF is not required under applicable
regulations, and does not currently intend, to make a contribution to the qualified pension plan
during 2008 but does intend to make contributions totaling $3.2 million to fund payments under the
nonqualified pension plan. Estimated future benefit payments, including benefits attributable to
estimated future employee service, are approximately $49.4 million in 2008, $51.4 million in 2009,
$53.6 million in 2010, $56.7 million in 2011, $60.5 million in 2012 and $353.5 million for the
years 2013 through 2017.

Deferred Compensation Plans:

VF sponsors a nonqualified retirement savings plan for employees
whose contributions to a tax qualified 401(k) plan would be limited by provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code. This plan

F-29

allows participants to defer receipt of a portion of their salary and
incentive compensation and to receive matching contributions for a portion of the deferred amounts.
Expense under this plan was $4.3 million in 2007, $4.1 million in 2006 and $3.8 million in 2005.
Participants earn a return on their deferred compensation based on investment earnings of
participant-selected mutual funds and VF Common Stock. Changes in the market value of the
participants’ investment selections are recorded as an adjustment to deferred compensation
liabilities, with an offset to compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Deferred compensation, including accumulated earnings on the participant-directed investment
selections, is distributable in cash at participant-specified dates or upon retirement, death,
disability or termination of employment. Similarly, under a separate nonqualified plan,
nonemployee members of the Board of Directors may elect to defer their Board compensation and
invest it in VF Common Stock equivalents. At December 2007, VF’s liability to participants of the deferred
compensation plans was $253.6 million, of which
$24.2 million expected to be paid in 2008 was
recorded in Accrued Liabilities (Note K) and $229.4 million expected to be paid beyond one year was
recorded in Other Liabilities (Note M).

VF has purchased (i) specific mutual funds and VF Common Stock in the same amounts as the
participant-directed investment selections underlying the deferred compensation liabilities or (ii)
variable life insurance contracts that, in turn, invest in mutual funds that are substantially the
same as other participant-directed investment selections. These investment securities, held in an
irrevocable trust, and earnings thereon are intended to provide (i) a source of funds to meet the
deferred compensation obligations, subject to claims of creditors in the event of VF’s insolvency,
and (ii) an economic hedge of the financial impact of changes in deferred compensation liabilities
based on changes in market value of the participant-selected investments underlying the
liabilities. The mutual funds and life insurance investments are recorded at fair value. At
December 2007, the fair value of the mutual fund and life insurance investments was $245.8 million,
of which $24.2 million expected to be liquidated to fund payments to participants in 2008 was
recorded in Other Current Assets and $221.6 million was recorded in Other Assets (Note I). The VF
Common Stock purchased to match participant-directed investment selections is treated for financial
accounting purposes as treasury stock (Note O), which is the primary reason for the difference in
carrying value of the investment securities and the recorded deferred compensation liabilities.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses on the mutual fund and life insurance investments (other
than VF Common Stock) are recorded in compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income
and substantially offset losses and gains resulting from changes in deferred compensation
liabilities to participants.

Other Retirement and Savings Plans

: VF also sponsors defined contribution retirement and savings
plans. For domestic employees not covered by VF’s defined benefit plans or a collective
bargaining agreement, VF contributes a specified percentage of an employee’s gross earnings to a
qualified retirement plan. VF also sponsors 401(k) and other retirement and savings plans for
certain domestic and foreign employees where cash contributions are based on a specified percentage
of employee contributions. Expense for these plans totaled $11.3 million in 2007, $9.1 million in
2006 and $6.3 million in 2005.

Note O — Capital

Common Stock

outstanding is net of shares held in treasury, and in substance retired. There were
10,042,686 treasury shares at the end of 2007, 5,775,810 at the end of 2006 and 4,962,478 at the
end of 2005. The excess of the cost of treasury shares acquired over the $1 per share stated value
of Common Stock is deducted from Retained
Earnings. In addition, 284,103 shares of VF Common Stock at the end of 2007, 261,458 shares at the
end of 2006 and 269,043 shares at the end of 2005 were held in trust for deferred compensation
plans (Note N). These shares held for deferred compensation plans are treated for financial reporting purposes as treasury
shares at a cost of $11.8 million, $9.8 million and $9.9 million at the end of 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

Preferred Stock

consists of 25,000,000 authorized shares at $1 par value.

Series A Preferred Stock

-

At the end of 2007, 2,000,000 shares were designated as Series A
Preferred Stock, of which none had been issued. Each outstanding share of Common Stock had a
Series A Preferred Stock purchase right attached to it, which entitled each holder of Common Stock
to certain rights if an outside party acquired 15% or more of VF’s Common Stock. The rights
expired in January 2008 and were not replaced.

Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock

-

The 6.75% Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock, which
had been owned by a VF employee stock ownership plan, was converted into Common Stock during 2006.
Each share of Series B Preferred Stock had a redemption value and liquidation value of $30.88 plus
cumulative accrued dividends, was convertible into 1.6 shares of Common Stock and was entitled to
two votes per share along with the Common Stock. Changes in shares of Preferred Stock outstanding
are summarized as follows:

assets in 2007,
accumulated translation gains of $3.9 million, net of related income taxes, were recognized in the

Note P — Stock-based Compensation

VF may grant nonqualified stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock to
officers and key employees and also to nonemployee members of VF’s Board of Directors under the
amended and restated 1996 Stock Compensation Plan approved by stockholders. All stock-based
compensation awards are classified as equity awards, which are accounted for in Common
Stockholders’ Equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Compensation cost for all awards expected
to vest is recognized over the shorter of the requisite service period or the vesting period. For
stock option awards that vest in equal annual installments over a three year period, compensation
cost is recognized during each individual vesting period. Total compensation cost (including cost
recognized for stock options) and the related income tax benefits for those awards recognized in
the Consolidated Statements of Income were $62.4 million and
$23.0 million for 2007, $46.4 million
and $17.1 million for 2006 and $40.5 million and $14.9 million for 2005, respectively (exclusive of
amounts included in the 2005 Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Policy; see Note A).
Stock-based compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory was $0.5 million at December 2007
and 2006. At the end of 2007, there was $34.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
related to nonvested stock-based compensation arrangements, of which
$21.9 million, $9.3 million, $1.7 million and
$1.1 million are expected to be recognized in 2008, 2009, 2010
and 2011, respectively.

F-31

At the end
of 2007, there were 8,797,750 shares available for future grants of stock options and
stock awards under the 1996 Stock Compensation Plan. VF has a practice of repurchasing shares of
Common Stock in the open market to offset, on a long-term basis, dilution caused by awards under
equity compensation plans.

Stock Options:

Stock options are granted at a price equal to the average of the high and low price
of VF Common Stock on the date of grant. Employee stock options vest in equal annual installments
over three years of continuous service after the date of grant and expire ten years after the date
of grant. The fair value on the date of grant of each option award is calculated using a lattice
option-pricing valuation model, which incorporates a range of assumptions for inputs between the
grant date of the options and the date of expiration. The assumptions used and the resulting
weighted average fair value of stock options granted are summarized below:

Volatility is the measure of change in the market price of VF Common Stock from period to period.
Expected volatility over the contractual term of an option was based on a combination of the
implied volatility from publicly traded options on VF Common Stock and the historical volatility of
VF Common Stock. The expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected
to be outstanding before exercise. VF used historical data to estimate both voluntary and
involuntary option exercise behaviors and to estimate employee terminations. Groups of employees
that have historically exhibited similar option exercise behaviors were considered separately in
estimating the expected term. Dividend yield represents expected dividends on VF Common Stock for
the contractual life of the options. Risk-free interest rates for the periods during the
contractual life of the option were the implied yields at the date of grant from the U.S. Treasury
zero coupon yield curve.

of VF Common Stock exceeds the exercise price of the stock option. The total intrinsic value of
stock options exercised during 2007 was $31.7 million, during 2006 was $74.9 million and during
2005 was $53.6 million.

F-32

Restricted Stock Units:

VF has granted performance-based RSUs and nonperformance-based RSUs to key
employees as a long-term incentive. For performance-based RSUs, participants are eligible to
receive shares of VF Common Stock at the end of a three year performance period. Each RSU has a
potential final value ranging from zero to two shares of VF Common Stock. The number of shares
earned by participants is based on achievement of performance goals for profitability and revenue
growth set by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Shares are issued to
participants in the year following the end of each three year performance period. For
nonperformance-based RSUs, each RSU entitles the holder to one share of VF Common Stock. These
RSUs vest generally four years after grant. Dividend equivalents, payable in additional shares of
VF Common Stock, accrue without compounding on the two types of RSUs.

$77.00, $55.32 and $54.80, respectively, which was equal to the market value of the underlying VF
Common Stock. The total value of awards outstanding at the end of
2007 was $78.7 million, of which
a total of 420,536 shares of VF Common Stock having a value of $32.8 million was earned, subject to
final confirmation approval of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, for the three
year performance period ended in 2007 and distributable in early 2008. Similarly, 405,696 shares
of VF Common Stock with a value of $31.2 million were earned for the performance period ended in
2006, and 36,921 shares of VF Common Stock with a value of $2.0 million were earned for the

The grant date fair value of each nonperformance-based RSU granted during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was
$80.08, $75.97 and $54.80, respectively, which was equal to the market value of the underlying VF
Common Stock. The total value of awards outstanding at the end of 2007 was $2.9 million.

Certain participants have elected to defer receipt of shares earned upon vesting. Dividend
equivalents, payable in additional shares, accrue on deferred shares. A total of 114,216 shares of
Common Stock are issuable in future years for such deferrals.

Restricted Stock:

VF has granted restricted shares of VF Common Stock to certain members of
management. The fair value of the restricted shares at the grant date was the market value of VF
Common Stock. Dividends are payable in additional restricted shares at the time the restricted
share grants vest, generally four years after grant.

Foreign rate differences included $10.6 million in tax benefit in 2007 and $16.9 million in 2006
from the favorable audit outcomes on certain tax matters and from expiration of statutes of
limitations outside of the United States. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (“the Act”)
contained a one-time incentive for repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 at a 5.25% effective
income tax rate. During 2005, VF repatriated $153.0 million of foreign earnings subject to the Act
and recorded an incremental income tax expense of $5.2 million.
The 2005 rate benefited from favorable settlements of prior
years’ foreign and state tax returns.

As of the end of 2007, VF has not provided deferred U.S. income taxes on $507.7 million of
undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be
permanently invested. The undistributed earnings would become taxable in the United States if
management decided to repatriate earnings for business, tax or foreign exchange reasons. If this
were the case, U.S. income taxes would be provided net of foreign taxes already paid.

VF has been granted a lower effective income tax rate on taxable earnings in one foreign subsidiary
based on meeting certain increased investment and employment level requirements. This lower rate,
when compared with the country’s statutory rate, resulted in an income tax reduction of $15.4
million ($0.14 per diluted share) in 2007, $13.6 million ($0.12 per share) in 2006 and $15.2
million ($0.13 per share) in 2005. The tax status providing this benefit is scheduled to expire at
the end of 2009, although discussions to extend this benefit are ongoing.

VF has potential tax benefits totaling $89.0 million for foreign operating loss carryforwards, with
$0.5 million expiring in 2008, $1.3 million in 2009, $0.5 million in 2010, $0.5 million in 2011 and
$1.5 million in 2012. Of the remainder, $79.1 million have an unlimited carryforward life. In
addition, there are $34.6 million of potential tax benefits for federal operating loss
carryforwards that expire between 2008 and 2020 and $14.8 million of benefits for state operating
loss carryforwards that expire between 2008 and 2025. Some of the foreign and substantially all of
the federal and state operating loss carryforward amounts relate to acquired companies for periods
prior to their acquisition by VF. A valuation allowance has been provided where it is more likely
than not that the deferred tax assets related to those loss carryforwards will not be realized.
Valuation allowances totaled $76.6 million for available foreign carryforwards, $13.3 million for
available federal carryforwards and $7.7 million for available state carryforwards. In addition,
VF has the potential benefit of $39.9 million for federal capital loss carryforwards at the end of
2007. Included in this amount is $25.2 million related to discontinued operations sold in 2007
(Note C), upon which a full valuation allowance was provided. Of the remaining amount, $10.1
million will be realized in cash in 2008.

Includes $6.2 million as a reduction of Goodwill (Note H).

Included in unrecognized tax benefits at December 2007 is $81.8 million of tax benefits that, if
recognized, would reduce our annual effective tax rate. VF recognizes accrued interest and
penalties, as appropriate, related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision.
During 2007, VF accrued interest and penalties of $0.6 million,
net of income tax benefit, in the income tax provision related
to these unrecognized tax benefits.

VF files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as separate and combined income tax
returns in numerous state and foreign jurisdictions. In the United States, Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) examinations for tax years 1995 through 1999 have been settled, resulting in income
tax refunds that will be carried forward to offset potential future assessments by the IRS. The
statute of limitations has expired for tax years 2000 and 2001. Tax years 2002 and 2003 are in the
appeals process with the IRS, and management expects to resolve open matters during 2008. VF
expects the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits to be reduced by approximately $2.8 million in
cash payments related to this resolution. In 2008, the IRS is expected to commence an examination
of tax years 2004, 2005 and 2006. The United Kingdom’s Inland Revenue has examined tax years 2001
through 2004, and settlement discussions are underway. Inland Revenue has indicated its intent to
examine the 2005 taxable year. VF expects to settle the years under examination in 2008 and
expects the settlement to include the 2006 taxable year for certain items under discussion. Tax
years 1998 to 2002 are under examination by the State of North Carolina, and tax years 2003 to 2005
are under examination by the State of Alabama. VF is also currently subject to examination by
various other taxing authorities. Management believes that some of these audits and negotiations
will conclude during the next 12 months. During 2008, management believes that it is reasonably
possible that the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits may decrease by $25 million, which
includes $18 million that would reduce income tax expense due to settlement of audits and
expiration of statutes of limitations.

F-37

Note R — Segment Information

For internal management and reporting purposes, VF’s businesses are grouped principally by product
categories, and by brands within those product categories. These groupings of businesses are
referred to as “coalitions.” These coalitions, as described below, represent VF’s reportable
segments:

Since their dates of acquisition in 2007, operating results of Eagle Creek and The North Face —
China are included in the Outdoor Coalition, results of Majestic are included in the Imagewear
Coalition, and results of Seven For All Mankind and lucy activewear are included in the
newly-formed Contemporary Brands Coalition.

Management at each of the coalitions has direct control over and responsibility for its revenues,
operating income and assets, hereinafter termed “Coalition Revenues,” “Coalition Profit” and
“Coalition Assets,” respectively. VF management evaluates operating performance and makes
investment and other decisions based on Coalition Revenues and Coalition Profit. Accounting
policies used for internal management reporting at the individual coalitions are consistent with
those stated in Note A, except as stated below and except that inventories are valued on a FIFO
basis. Common costs such as information systems processing, retirement benefits and insurance are
allocated to the coalitions based on appropriate metrics such as usage or employment. Prior years’
information has been reclassified to present the women’s intimate apparel business as discontinued
operations; see Note C.

Corporate costs, other than costs directly related to the coalitions, and net interest expense are
not controlled by coalition management and are therefore excluded from the Coalition Profit
performance measure used for internal management reporting. These items are separately presented
in the reconciliation of Coalition Profit to Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes.

Corporate and Other Expenses (presented separately in the following table) consists of corporate
headquarters expenses that are not allocated to the coalitions (including compensation and benefits
of corporate management and staff, certain legal and professional fees, and administrative and general) and other expenses
related to but not allocated to the coalitions for internal management reporting (including
development costs for management information systems, costs of maintaining and enforcing certain of
VF’s trademarks, adjustments for the LIFO method of inventory valuation and miscellaneous
consolidating adjustments).

Coalition Assets, for internal management purposes, are those used directly in or resulting from
the operations of each business unit, such as accounts receivable, inventories, property, plant and
equipment. Corporate assets include investments held in trusts for
deferred compensation plans,
information systems assets and a pension asset representing the overfunded defined benefit pension plan.

minimum advertising requirements. Future minimum royalty payments, including any required
advertising payments, are $65.5 million, $77.0 million, $80.6 million, $78.6 million and $78.7
million for the years 2008 through 2012, respectively, and $102.1 million thereafter.

VF in the ordinary course of business has entered into purchase commitments for raw materials,
sewing labor and finished products. These agreements, typically ranging from 2 to 6 months in
duration, require total payments of $690.0 million in 2008. In addition, VF has a remaining
commitment to purchase $92.5 million of finished product, with a minimum of $15.0 million per year,
in connection with the sale of a business in a prior year.

VF has entered into commitments for (i) service and maintenance agreements related to its
management information systems, (ii) capital spending and (iii) advertising. Future payments under
these agreements are $39.1 million, $15.3 million, $11.0 million, $1.4 million and $0.4 million for

Note U — Financial Instruments

The fair value of VF’s long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $1,137.5
million at the end of 2007, compared with its carrying value of $1,148.6 million. At the end of
2006, the fair value was $719.6 million, compared with its carrying value of $704.2 million. Fair
value was estimated based on quoted market prices or values of comparable borrowings. The carrying
amounts of VF’s other financial assets and liabilities, principally cash and equivalents, accounts
receivable, marketable securities, life insurance contracts, short-term borrowings and foreign
currency exchange contracts, approximated their fair value.

VF monitors net foreign currency exposures and may enter into foreign currency forward exchange
contracts with highly credited financial institutions. These contracts hedge against the effects
of exchange rate fluctuations on

F-42

anticipated cash flows relating to a portion of VF’s foreign
currency cash flows for inventory purchases and production costs, product sales and intercompany
royalty payments anticipated for the following 12 months. Other contracts hedge against the
effects of exchange rate fluctuations on specific foreign currency transactions, primarily
intercompany financing arrangements. Use of hedging contracts allows VF to reduce its overall
exposure to exchange rate movements since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses
and gains on the transactions being hedged. All foreign currency contracts are reviewed on a
regular basis to ensure that each contract is effective in hedging the intended exposure, and
financial institution counterparties are monitored for their credit worthiness.

The following summarizes, by currency, the contractual amounts of VF’s foreign currency
forward exchange contracts, translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at the reporting
date. The “bought” amounts represent the net U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to purchase
foreign currencies, and the “sold” amounts represent the net U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments
to sell foreign currencies. The contracts, all of which mature in less than one year, are reported
at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with the net unrealized gain, by individual
counterparty, included in Current Assets and the net unrealized loss included in Current
Liabilities.

primarily in Cost of Goods Sold in the Consolidated Statements of Income. At the end of 2007, net
pretax losses of $4.3 million were deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. These net
deferred losses will be reclassified into Net Income during 2008 at the time the underlying hedged
transactions are recognized in earnings. Hedge ineffectiveness was not significant in any period.

VF may also enter into derivative financial instrument contracts to hedge interest rate risks. VF
entered into a contract to hedge the interest rate risk for a notional amount of $150.0 million
shortly before the issuance of $300.0 million of long-term debt in 2003. This contract was settled
concurrent with the issuance of the debt, with the gain of $3.5 million deferred in Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income. As a result of the deferred gain, VF recognized $0.1 million during
each of 2007, 2006 and 2005 as a reduction of Interest Expense. At the end of 2007, a pretax gain
of $3.0 million was deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which will be reclassified
into earnings over the remaining term of the debt.
