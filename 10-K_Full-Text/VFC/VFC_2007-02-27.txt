PART I

Item 1. Business

VF Corporation, organized in 1899, is a worldwide leader in branded lifestyle apparel and related
products. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “we,” “us,” “our” and “VF” used herein
refer to VF Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.

For over 100 years, VF has grown by offering consumers high quality, high value branded apparel and
other products. Our stated vision is: VF will grow by building lifestyle brands that
excite consumers around the world. Lifestyle brands are those brands that connect closely with
consumers because they are aspirational and inspirational; they reflect consumers’ specific
activities and interests. Lifestyle brands generally extend across multiple product categories and
have greater potential for growth. For several years, VF has been implementing a growth plan
designed to transform its mix of business to include more higher growth, higher margin lifestyle
brands. As part of its growth plan, VF has acquired such lifestyle brands as

Nautica

Ò

,

Vans

Ò

,

Reef

Ò

,

Kipling

Ò

and

Napapijri

Ò

and has also invested heavily behind several other brands to
maximize their growth potential.

We generally target a VF brand to specific groups of consumers within specific channels of
distribution. VF’s diverse portfolio of brands and products serves consumers shopping in specialty
stores, department stores, national chains and mass merchants. In addition, many products are sold
directly to consumers through VF-operated retail stores, as well as monobrand retail stores
operated by independent parties. A global company,


VF derives 26% of its revenues from outside the United States, primarily in Europe, Canada, Latin
America and the Far East, with VF products sold in certain geographic areas through our licensees
and distributors. To provide these products across numerous channels of distribution in different
geographic areas, we have implemented a strategy that combines efficient and flexible
internally-owned manufacturing with sourcing of finished goods from independent contractors.

As part of our strategic plan to shift VF’s portfolio mix to higher growth, higher margin lifestyle
brands, management and the Board of Directors decided in late 2006 to dispose of the women’s
intimate apparel business. On January 22, 2007, VF entered into a definitive agreement to sell the
business. This business included all of VF’s domestic and international women’s intimate apparel
business units, which are being separately reported as discontinued operations in this Annual
Report. Intimate apparel products include bras, panties, daywear, shapewear and sleepwear. In the
United States, intimate apparel products are sold in department and mid-tier stores under the

Vanity Fair

Ò

and

Lily of France

Ò

brands and in discount stores
under the

Vassarette

Ò

,

Bestform

Ò

,

Curvation

Ò

and
licensed

Ilusion

Ò

brands. Certain of these brands are marketed in Mexico and
Canada through joint ventures in which VF maintains a controlling interest. In the European
market, women’s intimate apparel is marketed to department and specialty stores under the

Lou

â

,

Bolero

â

,

Gemma

â

,

Intima
Cherry

â

,

Vanity Fair

â

and

Belcor

â

brands
and in discount stores under the

Variance

â

,

Vassarette

â

and

Bestform

â

brands.

The remaining discussion of VF’s business, unless otherwise stated, is focused on VF’s continuing
operations. See additional discussion in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
at Item 8 of this report regarding our discontinued operations.

VF’s continuing
businesses are organized into four product categories, and by brands within those product
categories, for both management and internal financial reporting purposes. These groupings of
businesses are called “coalitions” and consist of the following: Jeanswear, Outdoor, Imagewear and
Sportswear. These coalitions are treated as reportable segments for financial reporting purposes.
Coalition management has the responsibility to build and develop brands, with certain financial and
administrative support and disciplines provided by VF corporate management.

The following table summarizes VF’s primary owned and licensed brands by coalition:

included as part of Item 8 of this report.

Jeanswear Coalition

Jeanswear and related shirts and casual products are marketed in the United States and in many
international markets. The largest of these brands, the

Lee

â

and

Wrangler

â

brands, have long-standing traditions as authentic American jeans brands
as they were established in 1889 and 1947, respectively, and have strong market positions.

Lee

â

and

Wrangler

â

products are sold in nearly every
developed country. In fact, including all of its jeanswear brands, VF sells more jeans than any
other company in the world.

In addition to these brands, VF markets the

Wrangler Hero

â

,

Rustler

â

and

Riders

â

brands in the United States. These brands
have continued to grow despite significant competitive activity and retail consolidation in the
discount channel of distribution. Knit and woven tops have helped to extend these brands. We
also market cotton casual pants under the

Lee Casuals

â

,

Timber Creek by
Wrangler

â

and

Wrangler

â

Khakis

brands.

In domestic markets,

Lee

â

products are sold through department stores, mid-tier
stores and specialty stores.

Wrangler

â

westernwear is marketed through western
specialty stores. The

Wrangler Hero

â

,

Rustler

â

and


Riders

â

brands are marketed to mass merchant and regional discount stores.
Overall, VF’s jeans brands are positioned in the U.S. marketplace where there is significant volume
and less fashion risk.

We believe our vendor managed inventory and retail floor space management initiatives with several
of our major retailer customers give us a competitive advantage in our domestic jeanswear business.
We receive point-of-sale information from these customers on a daily basis, on an individual store
and style-size-color stockkeeping unit (“SKU”) level. We then replenish their retail selling space
based on that data to ensure their selling floors are well stocked. Our systems capabilities allow
us to analyze sales data and work with our customers to maximize the assortment and stock inventory
levels of our products on their selling floor. For our retail customers, this leads to higher
sales of our products, along with lower inventory levels and fewer out-of-stock SKUs.

Jeanswear in most international markets is more fashion-oriented and has a higher relative price
than similar products in the United States. The jeans market internationally is also more
fragmented than in the U.S., with competitors ranging from global brands to a number of smaller
brands sold in single country or regional markets.

VF’s largest international jeanswear business is located in Western Europe.

Lee

â

,

Wrangler

â

and

H.I.S

â

jeanswear products are sold through
department stores and specialty stores, while the

Hero by Wrangler

â

,

Maverick

â

and

Old Axe

â

products are sold to hypermarket and
discount stores. We also market the

Lee

â

and

Wrangler

â

products
to mass market and specialty stores in Canada and Mexico, as well as to department stores
and specialty stores in South America through businesses based in Chile, Brazil, Argentina and
Peru. In many international markets, we are expanding our marketing of jeans products through
VF-operated retail stores, an increasingly important vehicle for presenting our brands’ image and
marketing story directly to consumers.

Lee

â

products are also manufactured and marketed in Spain and Portugal through a
50%-owned joint venture. We are continuing to expand our jeanswear brands into emerging markets,
such as China and Russia, and in 2006 entered into a majority-owned joint venture to design and
market VF-branded products in India, including the

Lee

â

and

Wrangler

â

brands. In foreign markets where VF does not have owned operations,

Lee

â

and

Wrangler

â

jeanswear and related products are marketed
through distributors, agents or licensees.

We believe our jeanswear brands can continue to grow by extending into additional categories and
geographies and by investing more heavily in marketing programs that enhance the brands’ equity and
stimulate consumer buying.

Outdoor Coalition

The Outdoor Coalition, VF’s fastest growing business, is a group of outdoor activity-based
businesses that represent a collection of lifestyle brands. Product offerings include outerwear,
sportswear, footwear, equipment, backpacks, daypacks and luggage.

The North Face

â

high performance outdoor apparel, equipment and footwear is sold
across the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia

.

The North Face

â

apparel
products consist of outerwear, snow sports gear and functional sportswear for men, women and
children. Equipment consists of tents, sleeping bags, backpacks, daypacks and accessories.

The
North Face

â

products are designed for extreme applications, such as high altitude
mountaineering and ice and rock climbing, although many consumers purchase those products because
they represent a lifestyle to which they aspire.

The North Face

â

products are
marketed through specialty outdoor and premium sporting goods stores in the United States, Canada
and Europe and select department stores in the United States. In addition, these products are sold
through 25 VF-operated full price retail and outlet stores in the United States and Europe, as well
as monobrand stores operated by independent third parties


dedicated to selling

The North
Face

â

products in Europe and Asia, except in Japan and South Korea where

The
North Face

â

trademarks and patent rights are owned by a third party.

JanSport

â

backpacks and luggage are sold through department and mid-tier stores,
as well as sports specialty stores and college bookstores in the United States.

JanSport

â

daypacks have a leading market share in the United States.

Eastpak

â

and

JanSport

â

backpacks are sold primarily through
department and specialty stores in Europe, where the

Eastpak

Ò

brand is the leading
backpack brand. A technical line of

JanSport

â

backpacks is sold through outdoor
and sporting goods stores.

JanSport

â

fleece and T-shirts imprinted with college
logos are sold through college bookstores and department stores in the United States. In addition,
we launched a

JanSport

â

apparel line in the United States and a limited

Eastpak

â

branded apparel collection in Europe in 2005. The

JanSport

â

and

Eastpak

â

brands are also marketed throughout Asia
by licensees and distributors.

VF Outdoor, Inc. manufactures and markets

Vans

â

performance and casual footwear
and apparel for skateboard, bicycle motocross (“BMX”), surf and snow sports participants and
enthusiasts. Products are sold on a wholesale basis through mid-tier stores in the United States and through
skate and surf shops, specialty stores and VF-operated retail stores in the United States and
Europe. The brand’s retail strategy includes over 150 full price retail stores and outlet stores.
These retail stores carry a wide variety of

Vans

â

footwear, along with a growing
assortment of apparel and accessory items, most of which bear the

Vans

â

trademarks.

Vans

â

full-price retail stores currently operate in the United
States, primarily on the West Coast, and in key European markets, and are located in a mix of mall
and freestanding locations. There are also

Vans

â

outlet stores in the United
States, the United Kingdom, Austria, Spain, France and Puerto Rico. The

Vans

â

brand is the sponsor and
majority owner of the

Vans Warped Tour

Ò

, a traveling music festival, which
presents over 50 alternative rock and heavy metal bands in performances in over 40 cities across
North America each summer.

Napapijri

â

premium casual outdoor apparel products are primarily positioned in the
mid-to-high price range and sold on a wholesale basis, primarily to European specialty shops such
as sport stores and fashion boutiques. In addition, these products are sold in Europe through
VF-operated stores in Italy, France and Germany, as well as stores operated by licensees and
distributors. The

Napapijri

â

brand enjoys especially strong consumer awareness in
Italy, where it was created, and is well known across Europe. The brand was recently voted “Cool
Brand of the Year” in Italy by the Superbrands Organization, which identifies and recognizes
apparel brands, particularly lifestyle and fashion brands that have become highly desirable among
style leaders and influencers, in 55 countries. In addition to continued growth overseas, the

Napapijri

â

brand is being introduced in the United States through upper-tier
department stores and VF-operated retail stores. Asia, particularly Japan, is targeted for growth
in 2007. The sportswear design talent for the

Napapijri

â

brand was utilized to
develop

Nautica

â

apparel in Europe, which was launched in 2006.

Kipling

Ò

luggage, shoulder bags, backpacks, handbags and accessories are stylish,
colorful and fun products designed for women and girls, yet the products are practical and durable.
The brand name comes from the author of

The Jungle Book

, Rudyard Kipling, and that provides the
connection to the

Kipling

Ò

monkey mascot, which symbolizes fun and adventure. A
colorful monkey key ring is attached to every bag, with a different monkey design for each product
collection. Products are sold through specialty stores in Europe, Asia and South America, as well
as through VF-operated and independently-operated retail stores. The

Kipling

Ò

business in North America is managed as part of the Sportswear Coalition.

In 2005, VF acquired the

Reef

Ò

brand, comprising surf-inspired products, including
sandals, apparel, shoes and accessories that are marketed primarily to sporting goods and specialty
stores and surf shops. This acquisition was consistent with our strategy of acquiring strong
lifestyle brands with superior growth potential.

Reef

Ò

branded apparel is
expected to be expanded in 2007.

We expect continued healthy growth in our Outdoor business as we acquire additional activity-based
lifestyle brands, acquire certain of our international licensees and distributors, launch new
product categories, open additional retail stores and expand geographically.


Imagewear Coalition

VF produces workwear, career and safety apparel sold under the

Red
Kap

â

,

Bulwark

â

,

The Force™

and

Chef Designs™

brands.
Over one-half of these sales are to industrial laundries that in turn supply work clothes to
employers, primarily on a rental basis, for on-the-job wear by production, service and white-collar
personnel. Products include work pants, slacks, work and dress shirts, overalls, jackets and
smocks. Since industrial laundries maintain minimal inventories of work clothes, a supplier’s
ability to offer rapid delivery is an important factor in this market. Our commitment to customer
service, supported by an automated central distribution center with satellite locations, has
enabled customer orders to be filled within 24 hours of receipt and has helped the

Red
Kap

â

brand obtain a significant share of the industrial laundry rental business.

The Imagewear Coalition also markets corporate image uniforms and casual apparel to selected
national accounts through the internet. We operate over 30 catalog web sites for major business
customers (e.g., FedEx Corporation, Air Canada, Continental Airlines and American Airlines) and
governmental organizations (e.g., U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Transportation Security
Administration, National Park Service, New York City Fire Department and New York City Transit
Authority). These secure web sites give more than 600,000 employees of these customers the
convenience of shopping and paying for their work and career apparel via the internet.

The Imagewear Coalition also includes VF’s activewear apparel businesses. We design and market
decorated sports apparel under licenses granted by the National Football League, Major League
Baseball, National Hockey League, Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Inc., NASCAR and most major
colleges and universities. These adult and youth-sized sports apparel products are distributed
through department, sporting goods, athletic specialty and discount stores primarily under the

Lee
Sport

â

label. Growth in recent years has been driven by acquisitions of two
businesses that marketed

Harley-Davidson

â

licensed apparel and by a five year
contract signed in 2002 with the National Football League, which was subsequently extended to 2008
for adult men’s and women’s apparel. Outerwear was added to the National Football League contract
in 2006. Under the agreement, VF is the exclusive supplier for selected men’s and women’s tops and
bottoms bearing NFL team logos marketed to mid-tier department stores, specialty stores and
discount stores. We also entered into a five year contract with Major League Baseball in 2004.

In the third quarter of 2006, Imagewear announced a new agreement with ESPN, Inc. to manufacture
and market a line of

College GameDay

Ò

apparel, including tees, fleece crews and
hoods. The line launched in September at leading sports specialty and sporting goods stores,
department stores and college campus retailers and online at www.espnshop.com.

We believe that Imagewear’s ability to manage a complex mix of products with very short lead times
and at superior service levels can be leveraged to support continued growth in both existing and
new businesses.

Sportswear Coalition

The

Nautica

â

brand is the principal lifestyle brand of the Sportswear Coalition.

Nautica

â

sportswear is marketed in the department store and specialty
store channels of distribution, with approximately one-half of wholesale sales to Federated
Department Stores, Inc.

The principal

Nautica

â

product line is men’s sportswear, noted for its classic
styling. The

Nautica Jeans Company

â

line features fashionable jeanswear and
related tops for younger male consumers. Other product lines sold under the

Nautica

â

brand include men’s outerwear, underwear, swimwear and sleepwear
and women’s sleepwear and panties. A collection of women’s sportswear was launched in a limited
number of department store doors in Fall 2006, with an expanded rollout planned for 2007.


VF Sportswear operates more than 125

Nautica

â

retail outlet stores in better
outlet malls across the United States. These stores carry

Nautica

â

merchandise
for men, boys and girls. The product styles sold in the outlet stores are different from the

Nautica

â

styles sold to department and specialty store wholesale customers. In
addition, these outlet stores carry

Nautica

â

merchandise from licensees to
complete their product assortment.

The

John Varvatos

â

brand is a luxury apparel and accessories collection for men,
including tailored clothing, sportswear, leather accessories and footwear. These products are sold
through upscale department and specialty stores, as well as through five showcase

John
Varvatos

â

retail locations. This business is 80% owned by VF, with the balance
owned by Mr. John Varvatos.

The Sportswear Coalition also includes the

Kipling

â

business in North America

.

Kipling

â

bags and accessories are marketed to department stores and through
VF-operated retail stores.

We believe there is growth potential in the

Nautica

Ò

brand, particularly in the
women’s sportswear category and in retail expansion, and significant growth potential in the

John
Varvatos

Ò

and

Kipling

Ò

brands.

Direct-To-Consumer Operations

VF-operated retail stores are an integral part of our strategy for building VF’s brands. Our full
price retail stores allow us to showcase a brand’s full line of current season products, with
fixturing and imagery that support the brand’s positioning. These stores provide high visibility
for our brands and products and enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of consumers.
We believe the proper presentation of these products in our retail stores enhances our business
with our wholesale customers. In addition, outlet stores serve an important role in our overall
inventory management by allowing VF to effectively sell a significant portion of discontinued and
out-of-season products at better prices than are otherwise available from outside parties, while
maintaining the integrity of our brands.

Our global retail operations comprise approximately 460 stores that sell specific brands such as

The North Face

â

, Vans

â

, Napapijri

â

,
Kipling

â

,

Nautica

â

, Lee

â

or

Wrangler

â

. Some of these retail stores offer products at full price, with the
remainder being outlets offering products at discounted prices. We plan to open 75

-

100 new
retail stores during 2007. In addition to these monobrand retail and outlet operations, we operate
78 VF Outlet stores across the United States that sell a broad selection of VF products. Sales and
profits of VF products sold through VF Outlet stores are reported as part of the operating results
of the respective coalitions.

Certain of our brands such as

Lee

â

jeanswear and

Vans

â

footwear
are sold directly to consumers via the internet. In many of our other web sites, we provide
information about our brands and products, and visitors are directed to VF’s wholesale customers
for purchase of our products. In addition, our Imagewear Coalition operates a number of catalog
web sites where employees of several national corporate and governmental accounts can purchase
their uniforms and other casual apparel. These internet sales represented approximately 2% of
consolidated Total Revenues in 2006. Total retail and internet sales directly to consumers
accounted for approximately 16% and 14% of VF’s consolidated Total Revenues in 2006 and 2005,
respectively. We expect our retail business to continue to grow and are planning a capital
investment of approximately $45 million for improvements, fixtures and equipment in new retail
space during 2007

In addition to our direct to consumer venues, we have granted the right to sell several of our
brands through over 200 independently-operated monobrand retail stores located primarily in Europe
and Asia. Our products are also sold through concession stores or shops in Europe and Asia, where
dedicated retail space is owned or leased by a department store or other independent party but the
inventory is owned by VF.


Licensing Arrangements

As part of our business strategy of expanding market penetration of owned brands, we enter into
licensing agreements for certain apparel and complementary product categories in specific
geographic regions if such arrangements with independent parties can provide more effective
manufacturing, distribution and marketing of such products than could be achieved internally.
These licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of VF brands and are for fixed terms that may
include renewal options. In addition, certain licensees and distributors have been granted the
right to open retail stores under the licensed brand name and sell only licensed branded products
in these stores. Each licensee pays royalties to VF based on its sales of branded products, with
most agreements providing for a minimum royalty. These payments generally range from 5% to 7% of
the licensing partners’ net sales of the licensed products. Gross Royalty Income was $78 million
and $72 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

In addition, licensees are generally required to spend a specified amount ranging from 1% to 5% of
their sales to advertise VF’s products. In some cases, these advertising amounts are remitted to
VF for advertising on behalf of the licensees. We provide support to these business partners and
seek to preserve the integrity of brand names by taking an active role in the design, quality
control, advertising, marketing and distribution of each licensed product, most of which are
subject to our prior approval and continuing oversight.

Licensing activities exist in all coalitions. The

Nautica

Ò

brand is the largest
contributor to licensing revenue, representing approximately 45% of gross Royalty Income. The

Nautica

â

brand is licensed in the United States for apparel categories not
produced by VF (e.g., tailored clothing, dress shirts, neckwear, women’s swimwear, accessories such
as fragrances, watches, eyewear) and for nonapparel categories (e.g., furniture, bedroom and
bathroom linens). In addition,

Nautica

â

apparel and certain nonapparel products
are licensed for sale in over 60 countries outside the U.S. Wholesale sales of such

Nautica

â

licensed products total approximately $475 million annually.

VF has also entered into license agreements to use third-party trademarks. Apparel is marketed
under licenses granted by the National Football League, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey
League, NASCAR and Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Inc. Some of these license arrangements contain
minimum annual licensing and advertising requirements. Some are for a short term and may not
contain specific renewal options.

We believe that the loss of any license, with VF as either licensor or licensee, would not have a
material adverse affect on VF.

Manufacturing and Sourcing

Product design and merchandising functions are carried out by a skilled staff located at each of
the operating coalitions.

Our domestic jeanswear and imagewear businesses operate owned manufacturing facilities (primarily
cutting, sewing and finishing) principally located in Mexico and Central America. Our
international jeanswear businesses operate manufacturing facilities located in Poland, Turkey and
Malta. For these owned production plants, we purchase raw materials from numerous domestic and
international suppliers for scheduled production. Raw materials include fabrics made from cotton,
synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn, as well as thread and trim (product
identification, buttons, zippers and snaps). In most cases, purchased fabric is cut and sewn into
finished apparel, and in limited cases we contract the sewing of VF-owned raw materials into
finished product to independent contractors in Mexico and Central America. While in some
cases we have obtained fixed price commitments for up to one year, specific purchase obligations
with suppliers are typically limited to the succeeding two to six months. We do not have any
long-term supplier contracts for the purchase of raw materials or finished products, except for a
commitment in connection with the sale of VF’s childrenswear business in 2004 to purchase a
remaining total of approximately $111 million of finished product for sale through our VF Outlet
stores, with a minimum of $15 million per year. No single supplier represents more than 4% of our
total cost of sales.


Over the last several years, VF has shifted production from the United States to lower cost
locations. As a result of this shift in sourcing, approximately 32% of our domestic Net Sales in
2006 were manufactured in VF-owned facilities, primarily in Mexico
and Central America, and 67%
were obtained from contractors, primarily in Asia. Similarly, European jeanswear sourcing has been
shifting from owned plants in Western Europe to lower cost owned production outside of Western
Europe and contracted production in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.

To an increasing extent, we are using independent contractors who own the raw materials and ship
only finished, ready-for-sale products to VF. These contractors are engaged through VF sourcing
hubs in Hong Kong and Miami. These hubs are responsible for product procurement, product quality
assurance and supplier management and handling functions in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres,
respectively. All products in the Outdoor and Sportswear Coalitions, as well as a growing portion
of product requirements for our other coalitions, are obtained through these sourcing hubs.

All contracted production must meet VF’s high quality standards. Further, each of the over 1,500
independent contractors that manufacture apparel products for VF must be pre-certified and sign a
Terms of Engagement
agreement prior to performance of any production on VF’s behalf. These requirements provide strict
standards covering hours of work, age of workers, health and safety conditions and conformity with
local laws. We also require our independent licensees and their contractors to comply with these
standards. We maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by
using dedicated internal and outsourced staff.

The current sourcing strategy for products sold in the United States allows us to balance our needs
with a mix of VF-owned and contracted production in the Western Hemisphere, combined with
contracted production primarily from Asia. Owned production generally has a lower cost than
contracted production. Overall, product obtained from the Western Hemisphere has somewhat higher
cost but gives us greater flexibility, shorter lead times and lower inventory levels as compared
with production obtained from the Far East and other more distant resources. This combination of
VF-owned and contracted production, along with different geographic regions and cost structures,
provides a balanced approach to product sourcing.

VF did not experience difficulty in filling its raw material and contracting production needs
during 2006. Management does not anticipate difficulties in obtaining its raw materials and
contracting production requirements during 2007. The loss of any one supplier or contractor would
not have a significant adverse effect on our business.

Imports and Import Restrictions

VF is exposed to certain risks of doing business outside of the United States. We import goods
from VF-owned manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Central America and from suppliers in those
areas, as well as suppliers in Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East. These import transactions
had been subject to the constraints imposed by bilateral agreements between the United States and a
number of governments. These agreements were negotiated either under the framework established by
the World Trade Organization (“WTO”) or other applicable statutes, which imposed quotas that
limited the amount of certain categories of merchandise from these countries that could be imported
into the United States and the European Union. All restrictions under these agreements had ended
as of December 31, 2004.

Pursuant to a 1995 Agreement on Textiles and Clothing under the WTO, effective January 1, 2005 the
United States and other WTO member countries were required, with few exceptions, to remove quotas
on goods from WTO member countries. The complete removal of quotas may benefit VF, as well as
other apparel companies, in the long run by allowing them to source products, without quantitative
limitation, from any country. The


only significant exceptions to the removal of quota that could
affect VF are Vietnam and China. Vietnam is a WTO member as of
January 11, 2007 but with restraints on Vietnam production that
would allow the United States to impose antidumping duties in
certain circumstances. Safeguard quotas pursuant to the terms of China’s
Accession Agreement to the WTO have been imposed against Chinese exports and will last through
2008. These new restraints include products that VF imports and sells. However, we are well aware
of developments with regards to safeguards and have made sourcing decisions accordingly. Any
effect of the imposition of safeguards is not expected to be material to VF.

Management continually monitors new developments and risks related to duties, tariffs and quotas.
In response to the changing import environment resulting from the elimination of quotas, management
has chosen to continue its balanced approach to manufacturing and sourcing. We limit VF’s sourcing
exposure through, among other measures, (i) extensive geographic diversification with a mix of
VF-operated and contracted production, (ii) shifts of production among countries and contractors,
(iii) allocation of production to merchandise categories where the free flow of product is
available and (iv) sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements. We
will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes
in the global production environment.

Seasonality

The apparel industry in the United States has four primary retail selling seasons — Spring,
Summer, Back-to-School and Holiday, while international markets typically have Spring and Fall
selling seasons. Sales to retail customers generally precede the retail selling seasons, although
demand peaks have been reduced as more products are being sold to retailers on a replenishment
basis.

Overall, with its diversified product offerings, VF’s operating results are somewhat seasonal. On
a quarterly basis, consolidated Total Revenues for 2006 ranged from a low of approximately 22% of
full year revenues in the second quarter to a high of 29% in the third quarter. This disparity
results primarily from revenues of the Outdoor Coalition, which are more seasonal in nature.
Approximately 20% of Outdoor Coalition revenues occurred in the second quarter and 35% in the third
quarter.

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital increases during the first
half of the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and, accordingly, decreases
during the second half. Cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the
second half of the year due to higher net income and reduced working capital requirements during
that period.

Advertising and Customer Support

We support VF’s brands through extensive advertising and promotional programs. We advertise on
national and local radio and television and in consumer and trade
publications, and participate in
cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in radio, television and print
media. We sponsor various sporting, music and other special events and sponsor a number of
athletes and other personalities. In addition, we provide point-of-sale fixtures and signage to
our wholesale customers to enhance the presentation of our products at retail locations. We spent
$322 million advertising and promoting our products in 2006, an increase of 6% from the 2005 level.

We also participate in various retail customer incentive programs. These incentive programs with
retailers include discounts, cooperative advertising funds and margin support funds. We also offer
sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of rebate and coupon offers. These
sales incentive offers with retailers and with consumers are recognized as sales discounts in
arriving at reported Net Sales (except that cooperative advertising
reimbursements of documented and independently verified retailer
costs are reported as Advertising Expense).

Internet web sites are maintained for most of our brands. The web
sites provide information about our products and, in many cases, direct
consumers to our wholesale customers where they can purchase our
products.

Our Jeanswear, Outdoor and Sportswear Coalitions employ a staff of in-store marketing and
merchandising coordinators located in major cities across the United States. These individuals
visit our customers’ retail locations to inform the customers’ sales force about our products and
related promotions and to ensure that our
products, and those of our licensees, are properly
presented on the merchandise sales floor.


Other Matters

Competitive Factors

Our business depends on our ability to stimulate consumer demand for VF’s brands and products. VF
is well-positioned to compete in the apparel industry by developing consumer-connected and
innovative products at competitive prices, producing high quality merchandise, providing high
levels of service, ensuring product availability to the retail sales floor and enhancing
recognition of its brands. We continually strive to improve on each of these areas. Many of VF’s
brands have long histories and enjoy high recognition within their respective consumer segments.

Trademarks

Trademarks and trade names, and their related logos, designs and graphics, have substantial value
in the marketing of VF’s products. We have registered these trademarks in the United States and
with governmental agencies in other countries where our products are manufactured and/or sold. We
vigorously monitor and protect these trademarks against infringement and dilution where legally feasible and appropriate.
In addition, we grant licenses to other parties to manufacture and sell products using our
trademarks in product categories and in geographic areas in which VF does not operate.

Customers

VF products are primarily sold through our sales force and independent sales agents and
distributors. VF’s customers are specialty stores, department stores, national chains and mass
merchants in the United States and in international markets, primarily in Europe. Sales to VF’s
ten largest customers, all of which are retailers based in the United States, amounted to 30% of
Total Revenues in 2006, 31% in 2005 and 35% in 2004. These larger customers included (in
alphabetical order) Federated Department Stores, Inc., Kohl’s Corporation, J.C. Penney Company,
Inc., Sears Holding Corporation, Target Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Sales to the five
largest customers amounted to approximately 24% of Total Revenues in 2006, 25% in 2005 and 28% in
2004. Sales to VF’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., totaled 13.2% of Total Revenues in
2006, 14.0% in 2005 and 13.5% in 2004, substantially all of which were in the Jeanswear Coalition.

Employees

VF employed approximately 45,500 men and women in its continuing operations at the end of 2006, of
which 17,300 were located in the United States. (Excluded are approximately 8,700 employees of the
intimate apparel businesses accounted for as discontinued operations at the end of 2006.)
Approximately 300 employees in the United States are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
In international markets, a significant percentage of employees are covered by trade-sponsored or
governmental bargaining arrangements. Employee relations are considered to be good.

Backlog

The dollar amount of VF’s order backlog as of any date is not meaningful and may not be indicative
of actual future shipments and, accordingly, is not material for an understanding of the business
of VF taken as a whole.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating VF’s business and
the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could
materially adversely affect VF’s business, its operating results and its financial condition.

RISKS SPECIFIC TO VF CORPORATION

A substantial portion of VF’s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large
customers. The loss of any of these customers could substantially reduce VF’s profits.


A few of VF’s customers account for a significant portion of revenues. Sales to VF’s ten largest
customers were 30% of Total Revenues in fiscal 2006, with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounting for
13.2% of revenues. Sales are generally on a purchase order basis, and we do not have long-term
agreements with any of our customers. A decision by any of VF’s major customers to decrease
significantly the number of products purchased from VF could substantially reduce revenues and have
a material adverse effect on VF’s financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the
retail industry has experienced consolidation and other ownership changes, such as the merger of
Federated Department Stores, Inc. and The May Department Stores Company in 2005 and the merger of
Sears, Roebuck and Company and Kmart Holding Corporation in 2005. In the future, retailers may
further consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations, realign their affiliations or
reposition their stores’ target market. These developments could decrease the number of stores
that carry VF’s products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry. These
changes could both impact VF’s opportunities in the market and increase VF’s reliance on a smaller
number of large customers.

VF’s business could be adversely affected by financial instability experienced by its customers.

During the past several years, various retailers have experienced significant financial
difficulties, which in some cases have resulted in bankruptcies, liquidations and store closings.
VF sells a large portion of its products on open account to national and regional department,
mid-tier and mass market stores in the United States. The financial difficulties of a customer
could result in reduced business with that customer. VF may also assume
higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty. If
these developments occur, our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on VF’s
trade accounts receivable from a major customer could substantially reduce VF’s income and have a
material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.

The apparel industry is highly competitive, and VF’s success depends on its ability to respond to
constantly changing fashion trends and consumer demand. Reduced sales or prices resulting from
competition could have a material adverse effect on VF.

VF competes with numerous domestic and foreign brands and manufacturers of apparel. In addition,
VF competes directly with the private label brands of its wholesale customers. VF’s ability to
compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on its ability to:

We attempt to minimize risks associated with competition, including risks related to changing style
trends and product acceptance, by studying consumer and retail sales trends. The failure, however, to compete
effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing markets and trends
could have a material  adverse
effect on VF’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we
misjudge fashion trends and market conditions, we could be faced with significant excess
inventories for some products that we may have to sell at a loss or missed opportunities with other
products that may result in lost sales.

VF’s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins.

The apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including
intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the
costs of products and changes in consumer demand. These factors may cause us to reduce our sales
prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause VF’s gross margin to decline if we are unable
to offset price reductions with comparable


reductions in its operating costs. If VF’s sales prices
decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, VF’s
profitability will decline. This could have a material adverse effect on VF’s results of
operations, liquidity and financial condition.

VF may not succeed in implementing its growth strategy.

One of our key strategic objectives is growth. We seek to grow through both organic growth and
acquisitions, building new growing lifestyle brands, expanding our share with winning customers,
stretching VF’s brands and customers to new geographies, fueling the growth by leveraging our
supply chain and information technology capabilities across VF, expanding our direct-to-consumer
business and building new growth enablers by identifying and developing high potential employees.
We may not be able to grow our existing businesses or achieve planned cost savings from ongoing
businesses. We may have difficulty identifying acquisition targets, and we may not be able to
successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve any expected cost savings or synergies
from such integration. We may not be able to expand our market share with winning customers,
expand our brands geographically or achieve the expected results from our supply chain initiatives.
We may also have difficulty recruiting or developing qualified managers. The failure to implement
its growth strategies may have a material adverse effect on VF’s business.

If VF encounters problems with its distribution system, VF’s ability to deliver its products to the
market would be adversely affected.

VF relies on its distribution facilities to warehouse and, using its own employees or in some cases
independent contractors, to ship product to its customers. VF’s distribution system includes
computer-controlled and automated equipment, which means its operations are complicated and may be
subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of
software and hardware, electronic or power interruptions or other system failures. Because
substantially all of VF’s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations,
VF’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes, floods, fires or other natural disasters
near its distribution centers. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not
adequately protect VF from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in
VF’s distribution facilities, such as the long-term loss of customers or an erosion of brand image.
In addition, VF’s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by
third parties, including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities. If
we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to meet customer expectations,
manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be
materially adversely affected.

VF relies significantly on information technology. Any inadequacy, interruption, integration
failure or security failure of that technology could harm VF’s ability to effectively operate its
business.

Our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on its information
technology systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with
transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, difficulty in integrating new systems or systems
of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the
operations of VF’s business. It could also require significant expenditures to remediate any such
failure, problem or breach.

VF uses foreign suppliers and manufacturing facilities for a substantial portion of its finished
products and raw materials, which poses risks to VF’s business operations.

During fiscal 2006, in excess of 65% of VF’s products sold were produced by and purchased or
procured from independent manufacturers primarily located in Asia and more than 30% were produced
by VF-owned and operated manufacturing facilities primarily located in Europe, Mexico and Central
America. Although no single supplier and no one country is critical to VF’s production needs, any
of the following could materially and adversely affect our ability to produce or deliver VF
products and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on VF’s business, financial condition and
results of operations:


•

Political or labor instability in countries where VF’s facilities, contractors and suppliers
are located;

•

Political or military conflict involving the United States, which could cause a delay in the
transportation of raw materials and products to VF and an increase in transportation costs;

•

Heightened terrorism security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to
additional, more frequent or more thorough inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or
impoundment of goods for extended periods or could result in decreased scrutiny by customs
officials for counterfeit goods, leading to lost sales, increased costs for VF’s
anticounterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of its brands;

•

Disease epidemics and health-related concerns, such as the
SARS, bird flu, mad cow and hoof-and-mouth disease outbreaks in recent years, which could result in closed factories, reduced
workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargo of VF’s goods produced in
infected areas;

•

Imposition of regulations and quotas relating to imports and our ability to adjust timely to
changes in trade regulations, which, among other things, could limit our ability to produce
products in cost-effective countries that have the labor and expertise needed; and

•

Imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports.

If VF’s suppliers fail to use acceptable ethical business practices, VF’s business could suffer.

We require third party suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and
regulations regarding working conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance.
Additionally, we require all suppliers making VF-branded apparel, whether directly for VF or for
its licensees, to comply with VF’s Terms of Engagement and Global Compliance Principles. Our staff
and third parties retained for such purposes periodically visit and audit the operations of VF’s
owned and operated facilities and of independent contractors manufacturing product for VF to
determine compliance. However, we do not control independent manufacturers or their labor and
other business practices. If one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws or
implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical in the United
States, the shipment of finished products to VF could be interrupted, orders could be cancelled,
relationships could be terminated, and VF’s reputation could be damaged. Any of these events could
have a material adverse effect on VF’s revenues and, consequently, its results of operations.

VF’s results of operations could be materially harmed if VF is unable to accurately forecast demand
for its products.

We often schedule internal production and place orders for products with independent manufacturers
before our customers’ orders are firm. Therefore, if we fail to accurately forecast customer
demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our
customers. Factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products
include:

•

An increase or decrease in consumer demand for VF’s products or for products of its
competitors;

•

Our failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance for new products;

•

New product introductions by competitors;

•

Unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in
cancellations of orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by
retailers;

•

Weak economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could
reduce demand for discretionary items such as VF’s products; and

•

Terrorism or acts of war, or the threat of terrorism or acts of war, which could adversely
affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product
and raw materials.


Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs and the sale of
excess inventory at discounted prices, which would have an adverse effect on VF’s results of
operations and financial condition. In addition, if we underestimate demand for our products, our
manufacturing facilities or third party manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet
customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost
revenues, as well as damage to VF’s reputation and customer relationships. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to successfully manage inventory demand to meet future order and
reorder requirements.

The loss of members of VF’s executive management and other key employees could have a material
adverse effect on its business.

VF depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers who have substantial
experience and expertise in VF’s business. VF also depends on other key employees involved in the
operation of its business. Competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense.
The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could materially adversely
affect VF.

VF may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights.

VF’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its
competitive position. VF is susceptible to others imitating its products and infringing its
intellectual property rights. With the shift in product mix to higher priced brands, VF is more
susceptible to infringement of its intellectual property rights. Some of VF’s brands, such as

The
North Face

â

,

JanSport

â

,

Nautica

â

,
Wrangler

â

and Lee

â

brands, enjoy significant worldwide consumer
recognition, and the generally higher pricing of such branded products creates additional risk of
counterfeiting and infringement.

Imitation or counterfeiting of VF’s products or infringement of its intellectual property rights
could diminish the value of our brands or otherwise adversely affect VF revenues. Actions we have
taken to establish and protect VF’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be
adequate to prevent imitation of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to
invalidate its trademarks or block sales of VF’s products as a violation of the trademarks and
intellectual property rights of others.

The value of VF’s intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in, or ownership of,
trademarks and other intellectual property rights of VF, or in trademarks that are similar to VF’s
trademarks, or trademarks that VF licenses and/or markets. We may be unable to successfully
resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, there may be trademark owners
who have prior rights to VF’s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not
protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. In
other cases, there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks. VF is from time to
time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some items of its
intellectual property.

VF obtains licensing royalties and relies on its licensees to maintain the value of its brands.

Although
only a relatively small portion of VF’s revenues,
$78 million or 1.3%, was derived from
licensing royalties in 2006 and although VF generally has significant control over its licensee’s
products and advertising, we rely on our licensees for, among other things, operational and
financial controls over their businesses. Failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed
products or our inability to replace existing licensees could adversely affect VF’s revenues, both
directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of its other products.
Risks are also associated with a licensee’s ability to:

•

Obtain capital;

•

Manage its labor relations;

•

Maintain relationships with its suppliers;


•

Manage its credit risk effectively; and

•

Maintain relationships with its customers.

In addition, VF relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands. Although we make
every attempt to protect VF’s brands through, among other things, approval rights over design,
production processes and quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion
of its products, we cannot completely control the use by our licensees of licensed VF brands. The
misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand.

RISKS APPLICABLE TO THE APPAREL INDUSTRY

VF’s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel, which is sensitive
to general economic conditions and other factors affecting consumer confidence.

The apparel industry has historically been subject to substantial cyclical variations and is
particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy. The success of VF’s operations
depends on consumer spending. Consumer spending is influenced by a number of factors, including
actual and perceived economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income (such as unemployment
and wages), business conditions, interest rates,
energy prices, availability of credit and tax rates in the international, national, regional and
local markets where VF’s products are sold. Any significant deterioration in general economic
conditions, recession or increases in interest rates could reduce the level of consumer spending
and inhibit consumers’ use of credit. A significant decline in the securities markets could
materially affect consumer confidence, the financial condition of VF’s customers and VF’s operating
costs through higher contributions to its pension plan. In addition, natural disasters, war,
terrorist activity or the threat of war or terrorist activity could adversely affect consumer
spending and thereby have a material adverse effect on VF’s financial condition and results of
operations.

Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could increase costs and cause
delay.

Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of the fabrics or other raw materials used by
VF in its manufactured apparel could have a material adverse effect on VF’s cost of sales or its
ability to meet its customers’ demands. The prices for such fabrics depend on demand and market
prices for the raw materials used to produce them, particularly cotton. The price and availability
of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, including crop yields
and weather patterns. In the future, VF may not be able to pass all or a portion of such higher raw
materials prices on to its customers.

VF’s business is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations.

Approximately 26% of VF’s Total Revenues is derived from international markets. VF’s foreign
businesses operate in functional currencies other than the United States dollar. Assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, VF sources and manufactures most of its products
overseas. As a result, the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the
relevant currencies. Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the U.S. dollar value of
the foreign currency denominated amounts at which VF’s international businesses purchase products,
incur costs or sell products. Furthermore, VF’s international sales and licensing revenue are
derived from sales in foreign currencies. Although we hedge some exposures to changes in foreign
currency exchange rates arising in the ordinary course of business, foreign currency fluctuations
could have a material adverse impact on VF’s financial condition and results of operations.

VF’s ability to sell products in international markets may be affected by legal, regulatory,
political and economic risks.


Our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets and
to capitalize on growth in new international markets is subject to risks associated with
international operations. These include the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and
regulations, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, new tariffs or other barriers to some
international markets.

We cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes or other similar restrictions will be imposed by
the United States, the European Union, Japan or other countries upon the import or export of its
products in the future, or what effect any of these actions would have on VF’s business, financial
condition or results of operations. Changes in regulatory, geopolitical policies and other factors
may adversely affect VF’s business or may require us to modify our current business practices.

Item 2. Properties.

VF owns certain facilities used in manufacturing and distribution activities and leases a
distribution center
under a capital lease. Other facilities are leased under operating leases that generally contain
renewal options. We believe all facilities and machinery and equipment are in good condition and
are suitable for VF’s needs. Manufacturing, distribution and administrative facilities being
utilized at the end of 2006 are summarized below by reportable segment:

administrative and showroom facilities. VF also owns or leases 538 retail or outlet locations
totaling 3,800,000 square feet. In addition to the above, VF owns facilities having 500,000 square
feet of space formerly used in operations but now held for sale.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

There are no pending material legal proceedings, other than ordinary, routine litigation incidental
to the business, to which VF or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of their

There were no share repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2006. We intend to
repurchase approximately 4.5 million shares in 2007 (representing shares to be purchased using
proceeds of the sale of the Intimate Apparel Coalition), although the actual number purchased may
vary depending on stock option exercises and funding required to support business acquisitions and
other opportunities. Also, under the Mid-Term Incentive Plan implemented under VF’s 1996 Stock
Compensation Plan, VF must withhold from the shares of Common Stock issuable in settlement of a
participant’s performance-based restricted stock units the number of shares having an aggregate
fair market value equal to any minimum statutory federal, state and local withholding or other tax
that VF is required to withhold, unless the participant has made other arrangements to pay such
amounts. There were no shares withheld under the Mid-Term Incentive Plan during the three month
period ended December 30, 2006.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.

Overview

VF Corporation is a leading marketer of branded lifestyle apparel and related products in the
United States and in many international markets. (Unless the context indicates otherwise, the
terms “VF,” “we,” “us,” and “our” used herein refer to VF Corporation and its consolidated
subsidiaries.) Management’s vision is to grow VF by building leading lifestyle brands that excite
consumers around the world. Lifestyle brands, representative of the activities that consumers
aspire to, will generally extend across multiple product categories and therefore have greater
opportunities for growth. VF owns a diverse portfolio of brands with strong market positions in
several consumer product categories. In addition, we market occupational apparel to distributors
and major employers. VF has a broad customer base, with products distributed through leading
specialty stores, department stores, national chains and mass merchants, plus VF-operated retail
stores.

We are organized around our principal product categories and major brands within those
categories. These groupings of businesses, referred to as “coalitions,” are summarized as follows:

Discontinued Operations

As part of our strategic plan to shift VF’s portfolio mix to higher growth, higher margin lifestyle
brands, management and the Board of Directors decided in late 2006 to dispose of the women’s
intimate apparel business. VF’s intimate apparel business includes such leading brands as

Vanity
Fair

â

, Lily of France

â

,
Vassarette

â

, Bestform

â

and

Curvation

â

in the U.S., and

Lou

â

,
Gemma

â

and

Belcor

â

in Europe. On January 22,
2007 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the business for $350 million in cash. The
agreement is subject to government approvals and customary closing conditions and is expected to be
completed in the first quarter of 2007.

Because VF has decided to exit this business, the operating results, assets, liabilities and cash
flows of the global intimate apparel business were separately presented in 2006 as discontinued
operations in the consolidated financial statements, and amounts for prior periods were similarly
reclassified.

During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the operations of the global intimate apparel business contributed
$35.3 million, $35.9 million and $75.8 million to net income, respectively. A primary factor in
the strong performance in 2004 was a new program with a major private label customer. This private
label program declined significantly in 2005. The decline in profits in 2006 and 2005 was driven
by lower sales levels and the resulting impact from unused manufacturing capacity and lower
overhead cost absorption. In addition to the $35.3 million
income from operations in 2006, we recorded a charge of
$36.8 million (net of an income tax benefit of
$10.9 million) for the estimated loss on disposal of the
intimate apparel business. The financial impact of the global intimate apparel business on VF will not be
significant in 2007.

See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for further details about the discontinued
operations.

Unless otherwise stated, the remaining sections of this discussion and analysis of
results of operations and financial condition relate only to continuing operations.

Long-term Financial Targets

We have established several long-term financial targets that guide us in our strategic decisions.
We expect attainment of these targets to drive increases in total shareholder return. These
targets are summarized below:

•

Revenue growth of 8% per year

- On a longer term basis, we target revenue growth of 8% per
year, with approximately 5% coming from organic growth and 3% from acquisitions. We have met
this objective with growth in revenues of 10% in 2006 and 8% in 2005. We


have many programs in place to continue to drive organic growth and will continue to
aggressively search for opportunities to acquire branded lifestyle apparel businesses that meet
our strategic and financial goals.

•

Operating income of 14% of revenues

- Our gross margins and operating margins have improved
in recent years as we have focused on reducing our cost structure and have acquired branded
lifestyle businesses that earn higher margins. Our operating margin was 13.3% in 2006 and
13.6% in 2005. The decline of 0.3% from 2005 resulted from the impact of special items
reported in both 2005 and 2006. During 2005, we reported two special items including (i) the
reduction of certain postemployment benefit accruals in Mexico and (ii) restructuring charges.
The net impact on operating income of these special items in 2005 was $13.2 million,
benefitting the operating margin by 0.3%. During 2006, VF recorded $14.7 million of
restructuring charges, representing a negative impact to operating margin of 0.2%.

Many of our businesses currently exceed the 14% benchmark, and all of our coalitions report
double digit margins. We constantly pursue cost reduction opportunities in product,
distribution and administrative areas. We will continue to evaluate our existing businesses to
ensure that they meet our strategic and financial objectives, as demonstrated by our decision to
exit the global intimate apparel business in 2006.

•

Return on invested capital of 17%

- We believe that a high return on capital is closely
correlated with enhancing shareholder value. We calculate return on invested capital as
follows:

Income from continuing operations before net interest expense, after income
taxes

Average common stockholders’ equity, plus average short and long-term debt

VF
earned a 14.7% return on invested capital in 2006 and a 14.2% return in 2005. Our return in
recent years has been impacted by acquisition activity during those periods, as it often takes a
period of years to achieve the targeted 17% rate of return for acquired businesses.
Nevertheless, we will continue to pursue this ambitious target.

•

Debt to capital of less than 40%

- To maintain a conservative financial position, we have
established a goal of keeping our debt to less than 40% of our total capitalization, with
capitalization defined as our common stockholders’ equity, plus combined short and long-


term debt. We would, however, be willing to exceed this target ratio, on a short-term basis, to
support appropriate investment opportunities. Despite significant acquisition spending,
dividend payments to stockholders and share repurchases over the last three years, this ratio
was  19.5% at the end of 2006. All of these factors, plus net debt repayments over the
three years and almost $350 million in cash at the end of 2006, demonstrate VF’s ability to
generate strong cash flow from operations.

•

Dividend payout ratio of 40%

- Our target is to return approximately 40% of our earnings to
our stockholders through a consistent dividend policy. This target was raised in 2006 from
30% in prior years. Management and the Board of Directors increased the dividend by 90% in
the second quarter of 2006 — from a quarterly dividend rate of $0.29 to $0.55 per share. The
2006 dividend payout was 41.1% of Net Income. VF has increased its dividends paid per share
each year for the past 34 years. Management and the Board of Directors will continue to
evaluate our dividend policy.

Strategic Objectives

We have developed a growth plan that we believe will enable VF to achieve its long-term revenue and
earnings targets. Our growth strategy consists of six drivers:

1.

Build more global, growing lifestyle brands

.

Focus on building more growing, global
lifestyle brands with an emphasis on younger consumers and on female consumers.

2.

Expand our share with winning customers

.

Adapt our organizational structure to a more
customer-specific focus to expand market share and leverage new business opportunities with
successful retailers.

3.

Stretch brands  to new geographies.

Grow our international presence,
particularly in rapidly expanding economies such as those in the Far
East and Eastern Europe.

4.

Expand our direct-to-consumer business.

Increase the portion of revenues obtained from
VF-operated retail stores or other direct-to-consumer venues.

5.

Fuel the growth.

Leverage our supply chain and information technology capabilities across VF
to drive lower costs and inventory levels, increase productivity and integrate acquisitions
efficiently so that we can use these savings to invest in our brands.

6.

Build new growth enablers.

Support our growth plans by identifying and developing high
potential employees and by recruiting talented, qualified leaders with new skill sets.


Highlights of 2006

There were several notable actions and achievements in 2006:

Analysis of Results of Continuing Operations

Acquisitions

VF acquired a 60% interest in a newly formed joint venture to design, market and distribute
VF-branded products in India for a total cost of approximately $33 million. This acquisition added
$13 million to revenues and was neutral to earnings per share in 2006. This business is expected
to contribute at least $30 million in incremental revenues in
2007.

Subsequent to the end of 2006, we announced the acquisition of Eagle Creek, Inc., seller of

Eagle
Creek

â

brand packs, luggage, accessories and adventure travel gear, which is
expected to add approximately $30 million to revenues in 2007.

See Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our acquisitions over
the last three years.

Stock-Based Compensation

As discussed in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we adopted Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement No. 123(Revised),

Share-Based Payment


(“Statement 123(R)”), effective as of the beginning of 2005. This Statement requires the
recognition of compensation cost for grants of stock options and also modifies the accounting of
other forms of stock-based compensation. VF recorded in the 2005 Consolidated Statement of Income
a noncash charge of $11.8 million (net of income taxes of $7.9 million) as the Cumulative Effect of
a Change in Accounting Policy for periods prior to January 2005. Financial statements for 2004
were not restated. As a result of adopting this Statement, stock-based compensation increased from
$10.0 million in 2004 to $40.0 million in 2005 and $46.0 million in 2006.

Total Revenues consist of Net Sales of products and Royalty Income from licensees. Revenues
in all of our ongoing businesses increased in 2006, due primarily to unit volume increases, with
the largest growth in our outdoor and jeanswear businesses. Revenues also increased in 2005 over
2004 due to growth in the outdoor businesses. Royalty Income increased significantly in 2006 and
2005 from 2004 due to higher levels of licensing activity related to the

Nautica

â

brand. Additional details on revenues are provided in the
section titled “Information by Business Segment.”

The Reef acquisition in 2005 added $47 million to revenues in 2006 (prior to the 2006 anniversary
date of its acquisition) and $60 million to revenues in 2005. In January 2005, we acquired
Holoubek, a business having rights to manufacture and market T-shirts and fleece under the licensed

Harley-Davidson

â

brand, which added $40 million to 2005 sales. The Reef
and Holoubek acquisitions are collectively referred to as the “2005 Acquisitions.”


In translating foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar, the weaker U.S. dollar in relation to the
functional currencies where VF conducts the majority of its business (primarily the European euro
countries) improved revenue comparisons by $11 million in 2006 relative to 2005. For 2005, revenue
comparisons benefited by $32 million relative to 2004. The weighted average translation rate for
the euro was $1.25 per euro during 2006, compared with $1.25 during 2005 and $1.23 during 2004. If
the weakening of the U.S. dollar that has occurred in recent months continues throughout 2007,
reported revenues in 2007 will be positively impacted compared with 2006.

Gross margins increased to 43.4% of revenues in 2006, compared with 43.2% in 2005 and 41.2% in
2004. The increases in 2006 and 2005 primarily result from the revenue growth in our higher margin
businesses. This change in the mix of our business accounted for an increase in gross margin of
0.4% in 2006 over 2005, offset by the net impact of special items recorded in both 2006 and 2005,
discussed in the Long-term Financial Targets section above. Gross margins as a percent of Total
Revenues increased 2.0% in 2005 over 2004 driven primarily by margin improvement in our outdoor and
sportswear businesses resulting from lower sourced product costs.

Today, of Net Sales to customers in the United States, 32% relates to products manufactured in
VF-owned facilities in Mexico and Central America and 67% relates to products obtained from
contractors, primarily in Asia. Where we manufacture, it is management’s belief that our product
costs are generally lower in VF-owned facilities than any available on a global basis for like
products. We believe a combination of VF-owned and contracted production from different geographic
regions provides flexibility and a competitive advantage in our product sourcing.

Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses increased as a percent of revenues to 30.1% in
2006, compared with 29.7% in 2005 and 28.5% in 2004. The 2006 increase in percent of


revenues
resulted from additional spending on advertising in our Jeanswear Coalition and a shift in the mix
of our businesses toward those with higher expense percentages, specifically, toward our growing
lifestyle branded businesses. Our Outdoor businesses, including the more recently acquired brands
such as Reef, Vans, Kipling and Napapijri, have higher expense percentages than other VF
businesses. Approximately 0.5% of the increase in 2005 over 2004 was due to stock option expense
recognized under the new accounting policy adopted in 2005, with the remainder of the increase
primarily related to changes in the mix of our businesses similar to those discussed above.

We include costs of cooperative advertising, licensing, retail stores and shipping and handling in
Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses, as stated in our significant accounting policies in
Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Some other companies classify cooperative
advertising costs or licensing costs as a reduction of Net Sales or Royalty Income, respectively,
while some classify retail store and shipping and handling costs in Cost of Goods Sold.
Accordingly, our gross margins and operating expenses may not be directly comparable with other
companies.

Interest Expense (including amortization of debt discount, debt issuance costs and the gain on an
interest rate hedging contract) decreased by $13.3 million in 2006 and $5.4 million in 2005. The
decreases in both 2006 and 2005 were due to lower average interest rates and lower average debt
outstanding. Average interest-bearing debt outstanding totaled approximately $900 million for
2006, $1,030 million for 2005 and $1,050 million for 2004. The weighted average interest rate was
6.1% for 2006, 6.7% for 2005 and 7.0% for 2004.

The effective income tax rate was 31.2% in 2006, compared with 32.2% in 2005 and 33.0% in 2004.
During 2006, we recorded a $16.9 million tax benefit (2.2% tax rate benefit) from the favorable
audit outcome on certain tax matters outside of the United States. The effective income tax rate
declined in 2005 relative to 2004 due to increased income in international jurisdictions that was
taxed at lower rates and favorable settlements of prior years’ foreign and state income tax
returns, partially offset by additional taxes resulting from the repatriation of earnings from
foreign subsidiaries under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

Income from Continuing Operations increased 11% to $535.1 million in 2006 and by 21% to $482.6
million in 2005 from $398.9 million in 2004. After considering the operating results of our
discontinued global intimate apparel business and the expected loss on the sale of this
business of $36.8 million, VF reported net income of $533.5 million ($4.72 per share) in 2006.


This represented an increase of 5% over reported net income of $506.7 million ($4.44 per share) in
2005, which included an $11.8 million cumulative effect charge ($0.10 per share) for the change in
accounting policy for stock-based compensation. Net income in 2004 was $474.7 million ($4.21 per
share). In translating foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar, the weaker U.S. dollar had a $0.02
favorable impact on earnings per share in 2006 compared with 2005 and a $0.04 favorable impact in
2005 compared with 2004. In comparing 2006 to 2005, the Reef acquisition had a $0.03 favorable
impact to earnings per share.

Information by Business Segment

VF’s businesses are grouped into four product categories, and by brands within those product
categories, for management and internal financial reporting purposes. These groupings of
businesses are referred to as “coalitions.” Both management and VF’s Board of Directors evaluate
operating performance at the coalition level. These coalitions represent VF’s reportable segments.

For business segment reporting purposes, Coalition Revenues and Coalition Profit represent net
sales, royalty income and operating expenses under the direct control of an individual coalition,
along with amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and its share of centralized
corporate expenses directly related to the coalition. Corporate expenses not apportioned to the
coalitions and net interest expense are excluded from Coalition Profit. Importantly, this basis of
performance evaluation is consistent with that used for management incentive compensation.

See Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our results of operations and
other information by coalition, along with a reconciliation of Coalition Profit to Income from
Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes. Coalition results are not necessarily indicative of
operating results that would have been reported had each business coalition been an independent,
stand-alone entity during the periods presented. Further, VF’s presentation of Coalition Profit
may not be comparable with similar measures used by other companies.

during the last two years:

Jeanswear:

The Jeanswear coalition consists of our global jeanswear businesses, led by the

Wrangler

â

and

Lee

â

brands. Overall jeanswear revenues were up 3%
in 2006 over 2005. Revenues for 2005 versus 2004 were flat. A 3% increase in domestic jeanswear
revenues was led by the turnaround of the

Lee

â

brand, which posted a 6% increase
over 2005. This improvement resulted from more effective increased marketing investments, as well
as new products targeted at our core consumer. Our domestic mass market revenues increased by 4%
in 2006. These increases were partially offset by the exit of the Earl Jean business in early
2006. In 2005, domestic jeanswear revenues declined 2%, with gains in mass market and western
specialty products more than offset by a decline in the

Lee

â

brand business.
Approximately one-half of the sales decrease at Lee was due to the significant consolidation taking
place in the mid-tier channel of distribution in the U.S. The remainder of the decline was largely
due to lack of performance of new products at retail, particularly in the

Lee

â

brand’s traditionally strong women’s business.

Jeanswear revenues in international markets — Europe, Canada, Mexico, Latin America and Asia —
also increased 3% in 2006 over 2005. Approximately 2% of the increase resulted from our newly
established joint venture in India. Revenues increased in all foreign jurisdictions other than
Canada, which was flat. Jeanswear revenues in international markets increased by 5% in 2005, with
two-thirds of the increase due to a $25 million benefit from favorable foreign currency
translation.


Jeanswear Coalition operating margins were 16.8% in 2005 and 15.5% in 2006. The reduction
in margin percentage in 2006 primarily resulted from special items included in both the 2006 and
2005 periods. During 2006, actions were taken within our Jeanswear business to reduce product
costs and improve product development processes that cost Jeanswear $14.5 million and negatively
impacted 2006 operating margins by 0.5%. During 2005 profits benefited from a $14.7 million
reduction in Mexican postemployment benefit accruals, which management had determined were greater
than required under local laws. This item positively impacted 2005 operating margins by 0.6%. The
remaining decline in operating margins in 2006 resulted from increased domestic spending on
advertising and investments in retail stores overseas. Jeanswear Coalition Profit increased 2% in
2005 over 2004, with comparable increases in both domestic and international businesses. In the
United States, profits increased in our mass market business, which more than offset declines in
our

Lee

â

brand and our

Earl Jean

â

business (which was sold in
early 2006). In addition, profits in 2005 benefited from the $14.7 million reduction in Mexican
postemployment benefit accruals mentioned above.

Outdoor:

The Outdoor coalition consists of VF’s outdoor-related businesses including

The North
Face

â

brand apparel, footwear and equipment,

JanSport

â

and

Eastpak

â

daypacks and apparel,

Vans

â

performance and casual
footwear and apparel,

Kipling

â

bags and accessories,

Napapijri

â

outdoor-based sportswear and

Reef

â

beach-inspired footwear and apparel. Revenues
increased 28% in 2006 primarily through organic growth, led by unit volume increases from strong
consumer demand for

The North Face

â

and

Vans

â

products in the
United States and internationally. The acquisition of Reef also added $47 million to 2006 revenues
(for the period prior to its acquisition anniversary date). Revenues increased 44% in 2005, with
the Reef acquisition adding $60 million and the 2004 Outdoor coalition acquisitions adding $264
million (for the period prior to their respective acquisition anniversary dates). Revenues in both
years benefited from the favorable effects of foreign currency translation — $8 million in 2006 and
$6 million in 2005 relative to the respective prior years.

Coalition Profit increased 28% in 2006, consistent with the revenue increase above. The operating
margin in both 2006 and 2005 for the Outdoor coalition was 16.0%. The 2005 acquisition of Reef
added approximately $5 million, or 2%, to Coalition Profit in 2006. Coalition Profit increased 49%
in 2005 over 2004. Over one-half of the increase in 2005 was due to higher profits resulting from a
full year of operations in the Vans, Napapijri and Kipling businesses acquired during 2004.
Because Reef was acquired in April 2005, late in its seasonally strong sales season, its
contribution to Coalition Profit was minimal in 2005. The remainder of the 2005 increase was due
primarily to unit volume increases at The North Face.


Imagewear:

The Imagewear coalition includes VF’s occupational (industrial, career and safety) apparel
business, as well as our licensed apparel business. Coalition Revenues increased 3% in 2006.
Occupational apparel revenues were up 2%, led by growth in the public services and governmental
sector, offset by the exit of our underperforming commodity fleece and T-shirt business. Licensed
apparel revenues increased 4% in 2006 led by growth in the licensed National Football League
business. Coalition Revenues increased 5% in 2005, primarily from the acquisition of Holoubek in
early 2005. Occupational apparel revenues increased 3% in 2005, primarily in industrial workwear.
Sales of industrial workwear were up in 2005 with increased industrial employment in the U.S.
Revenues of the licensed business increased in 2005 with the acquisition of Holoubek and increases
in sales of products under license from the National Football League and Major League Baseball.

Coalition Profit increased 6% in 2006 with substantially all of the growth in licensed sports
apparel. Profits in the uniform/occupational apparel business were flat in 2006 compared with
2005. Operating margin for the Imagewear Coalition increased from 15.7% in 2005 to a record 16.2%
in 2006, resulting from lower advertising costs and lower increases in administrative and other
fixed costs in relation to revenue growth. Coalition Profit increased 8% in 2005 due to lower
product costs, improved operating efficiencies and the impact of the Holoubek acquisition.

Sportswear:

The Sportswear coalition consists of our

Nautica

â

lifestyle brand and
the

John Varvatos

â

luxury collection for men. The coalition also includes the

Kipling

â

brand business in North America
(whereas the

Kipling

® brand is managed as part of the Outdoor
Coalition in Europe). Coalition Revenues increased 5% in 2006, including
a 4% increase in our

Nautica

â

brand revenues and strong growth in our
John Varvatos and Kipling businesses. Coalition revenues increased 5% during 2005, including a 3%
increase in our

Nautica

â

brand revenues and the benefit of a full year
of

Kipling

â

brand revenues.

Sportswear Coalition operating margins were 13.3% in 2006 and 15.4% in 2005. Coalition Profit
declined in 2006 from 2005 primarily due to the investments behind the Fall 2006 introduction of a

Nautica

â

brand women’s sportswear collection. Coalition Profit for the

Nautica

â

brand increased significantly in 2005 over 2004 due to (i)
improved product performance at our wholesale customers resulting in fewer markdowns and returns,
(ii) cost reductions and (iii) other operating efficiencies. The Kipling business has been
profitable in


each of the last three years, while the John Varvatos business incurred losses, as planned, in each
year.

Other:

The Other business segment includes the VF Outlet business unit of company-operated retail outlet
stores in the United States that primarily sell excess quantities of first quality VF apparel
products. Revenues and profits of VF products are reported as part of the operating results of the
respective coalitions, while revenues and profits of non-VF products (primarily childrenswear,
hosiery, underwear and accessories, which provide a broader selection of merchandise to attract
consumer traffic) are reported in this business segment.

The Other business segment also includes the results of VF Playwear for 2005 and 2004. Trademarks
and certain operating assets of this business were sold in May 2004, with inventories and other
assets liquidated over the remainder of 2004 and in 2005. The segment loss in 2004 included net
charges of $9.5 million related to the disposal of this business. See Note C to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for a summary of VF Playwear’s revenues and
losses for 2005 and 2004.

Reconciliation of Coalition Profit to Consolidated Income Before Income Taxes:

There are two types of costs necessary to reconcile total Coalition Profit, as discussed in the
preceding paragraphs, to Income Before Income Taxes. These costs, discussed below, are Interest
and Corporate and Other Expenses. See also Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest Expense, Net was discussed in the previous “Consolidated Statements of Income” section.
Interest is excluded from Coalition Profit because substantially all of our financing costs are
managed at the corporate office and are not under the control of coalition management.

Corporate and Other Expenses consists of corporate headquarters’ and similar costs that are not
apportioned to the operating coalitions. These expenses are summarized as follows :

Information Systems and Shared Services

- Included are costs of our management information
systems and of our centralized shared services center, which includes common financial, supply
chain, human resources and customer management services that support our worldwide operations.
Operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the coalitions based on
utilization of those services, such as minutes of computer processing time, number of transactions
or number of users. Costs to develop new computer applications that will be used across VF are not
allocated to the coalitions. Approximately one-half of the increase in gross information systems
and shared services costs in 2006 related to information systems development and information
technology infrastructure costs. The remainder of the increase resulted from increased spending in
our supply chain and customer management groups. A
greater proportion of management information systems and other costs
was allocated to the
coalitions in 2006, primarily related to information systems activations across VF.

About two-thirds of the increase in 2005, net of amounts apportioned to the coalitions, related to
additional information systems costs for common systems implementation and additional consulting
costs, with the balance related to start-up costs for centralization of sourcing, distribution and
other efforts to improve efficiency and drive cost reduction.

Corporate Headquarters’ Costs

- Headquarters’ costs include compensation and benefits of corporate
management and staff, certain legal and professional fees, and administrative and general expenses,
which are not apportioned to the coalitions. The decrease in these costs from 2005 to 2006
resulted primarily from a reduction in severance costs from 2005. Approximately $8.8 million of
the increase from 2004 to 2005 was driven by the initial recognition of stock option expense for
corporate management upon adoption of a new accounting standard. In


addition, costs increased in
2005 over 2004 due to recruiting, relocation and compensation of additional corporate staff
positions to drive growth for VF and due to severance-related costs.

Trademark Maintenance and Enforcement

- Legal and other costs of registering, maintaining and
enforcing the majority of VF’s trademarks, plus related costs of licensing administration, are
controlled by a centralized trademark and licensing staff and are not allocated to the coalitions.
The increase in these costs in 2006 is consistent with the growth in our business and expansion of
our brand portfolio. Costs were higher in 2004 due to foreign currency hedging losses incurred on
licensing transactions.

Other

- This category includes (i) adjustments to convert the earnings of certain business units
using the FIFO inventory valuation method for internal reporting to the LIFO method for
consolidated financial reporting, (ii) miscellaneous costs that result from corporate programs or
corporate-managed decisions that are not allocated to the business units for internal management
reporting and (iii) other consolidating adjustments.

Analysis of Financial Condition

Balance Sheets

Accounts Receivable increased in 2006 due to a 9% increase in fourth quarter revenues over 2005 and
an 8% increase in the number of days’ sales outstanding. There was 20% sales growth during the
fourth quarter in our Europe and Asia businesses, where payment terms are substantially longer than
those of the U.S. businesses. This accounted for nearly all of the increase in the number of days’
sales outstanding. Finally, a weaker U.S. dollar accounted for 3% of the increase in the 2006
Accounts Receivable balance over 2005.

Inventories increased by 6% in 2006, which was lower than the percentage increase of sales in the
fourth quarter of 2006 and the anticipated increase in the first quarter of 2007, resulting in a
decline in days’ sales in inventory. In addition, the increase in 2006 included a 2% impact from
translating foreign inventories into U.S. dollars, considering the weaker dollar used in
translation at the end of 2006, and a 1% impact from the inclusion of the acquired inventory in the
joint venture in India.

Other Current Assets included an increase in value-added taxes arising in slower paying
jurisdictions. The additional amounts will be recoverable over the next year.


Property, Plant and Equipment increased in 2006. Capital spending in 2006 exceeded depreciation
expense. In addition, the 2006 balance increased due to the inclusion of a $43 million leased
facility for a new Outdoor Coalition distribution center, recorded as a capital
lease. The increase in property, plant and equipment spending was due to expenditures to support
the growth of our businesses, including a heavier spend to support new retail store rollouts.
Intangible Assets and Goodwill each increased in 2006 due to the impact of foreign currency
translation (weaker U.S. dollar) and the acquisition in India in 2006. Other Assets decreased in
2006 due to the elimination of a $42 million intangible asset recognized under previous pension
accounting rules. This decrease was offset in part by additional assets held under deferred
compensation plans. See Notes B, F, G, H and I to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accounts Payable was relatively flat in 2006 compared with 2005, despite higher overall inventory
levels. Accrued Liabilities declined in 2006 due to the 2005 balance including a $75.0 million
minimum pension liability accrued under prior accounting standards for defined benefit pension
plans.

During 2005, we entered into a new international bank credit agreement consisting of (i) a
euro-denominated five year revolving credit agreement for a U.S. dollar equivalent amount of $230.0
million, (ii) a euro-denominated two year term loan for a U.S. dollar equivalent of $52.6 million
and (iii) a U.S. dollar-denominated two year term loan for $40.0 million. At the end of 2005,
there was $220.2 million outstanding under the agreement, of which $100.1 million was classified as
Short-term Borrowings because of our intent to repay that amount during 2006 and $120.1 million was
classified as Long-term Debt under the revolving credit agreement because of our intent to continue
that amount outstanding through 2006. During 2006, we repaid the U.S. dollar-denominated term loan
of $40.0 million and $21.8 million of the euro-denominated term loan. As of the end of 2006, there
was $170.8 million outstanding under the international bank credit agreement, of which $39.4
million was classified as Short-term Borrowings and $32.8 million as Current Portion of Long-term
Debt because of our intent to repay those amounts during 2007. We
have no intention of paying down the
remaining $98.6 million outstanding under the revolving credit agreement in 2007, and accordingly,
that amount is classified as Long-term Debt.

The Current Portion of Long-term Debt is $68.9 million at the end of 2006, including the $32.8
million borrowing under the international credit facility discussed above and the discounted amount
of a $33.0 million principal installment due in connection with the 2003 Nautica


acquisition. The
Long-term Debt balance declined from 2005 to 2006 as a result of reclassifying $32.8 million of the
revolving credit borrowings under the international facility and the remaining installment under
the Nautica acquisition to current. These declines were offset by a
capital lease obligation for an Outdoor Coalition distribution center.

In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

(“Statement 158”). Statement 158, effective
for December 2006, requires that the funded status of a defined benefit plan, measured as the
difference between the fair value of plan assets and projected benefit obligations, be
recorded in the balance sheet. Statement 158 also requires that gains and losses for
differences between actuarial assumptions and actual results and that unrecognized prior
service costs be recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.

Statement 158 results in changes in the balance sheet recognition of defined benefit plans, but
does not change the measurement of plan assets and obligations or the measurement of benefit
expense in the statement of income. In accordance with Statement 158, prior period financial
statements were not restated. See Note N for a discussion of assets and liabilities related to
defined benefit plans in VF’s 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet, compared with their recognition in
the 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet under the prior rules.

Under the newly adopted Statement 158, at the end of 2006, $143.8 million of the total $146.8
million unfunded pension liability based on projected benefit obligations was recorded in Other
Liabilities, with the balance classified in current liabilities. Also in accordance with Statement
158, we recorded a pretax charge of $215.4 million in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
at the end of 2006. This represented the sum of deferred actuarial losses and deferred prior
service costs at that date. At the end of 2005, under the prior accounting rules, the excess of
accumulated benefit obligations over the sum of the fair value of plan assets and previously
accrued pension liabilities, termed the “minimum pension liability,” was $171.9 million. This
minimum pension liability resulted in a charge to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in
2005. In addition, $75.0 million of the minimum pension liability was classified as a current
liability because VF contributed that amount to the pension plan in early 2006.


Liquidity and Cash Flows

The financial condition of VF is reflected in the following:

Dollars in millions



Working capital

1,563.2

$

1,213.2

Current ratio

2.5 to 1

2.1 to 1

Debt to total capital

19.5

%

22.6

%

For the ratio of debt to total capital, debt is defined as short-term and long-term
borrowings, and total capital is defined as debt plus common stockholders’ equity. Our ratio of
net debt to total capital, with net debt defined as debt less cash and equivalents, was 12.1% at
the end of 2006.

VF’s primary source of liquidity is its strong cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash
flow from operating activities of continuing operations, which was $454.1 million in 2006, $533.7
million in 2005 and $646.4 million in 2004, is primarily dependent on the level of Income from
Continuing Operations and changes in investments in inventories and other working capital
components. Income from Continuing Operations was $535.1 million, $482.6 million and $398.9
million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Income from Continuing Operations in each year
included noncash stock-based compensation expense of $46.0 million, $40.0 million and $10.0 million
in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The significant increase in 2005 was due to the adoption of
Statement 123(R) requiring recognition of stock option expense, on a fair value basis, in the
financial statements. The net change in working capital components during 2006 was a cash usage of
$209.2 million, compared with cash usage of $94.6 million in 2005 and cash provided of $56.0
million in 2004. Major reasons for changes in the year-to-year cash impact from working capital
over this three year period related to (i) an increase in accounts receivable at the end of 2006,
as discussed in the “Balance Sheets” section above, (ii) increases in inventory in 2005 and 2006 due
to the growth in our businesses that are not offset by related changes in accounts payable, (iii)
increases in accrued incentive compensation (as amounts earned in a year are paid early in the
following year), (iv) increases in accrued income taxes due to higher net income and (v) in 2004,
approximately $40 million of cash provided by the liquidation of VF Playwear’s working capital
(Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

To finance its ongoing operations and most unusual circumstances that may arise, VF anticipates
continued future strong cash generation. In addition, VF has significant existing liquidity from
its available cash balance and debt capacity, supported by its strong credit rating. VF has a


$750.0 million unsecured committed bank facility that expires in September 2008. This bank
facility supports a $750.0 million commercial paper program. Any issuance of commercial paper
would reduce the amount available under the bank facility. At the end of 2006, $740.5 million was
available for borrowing under this credit agreement, with $9.5 million of standby
letters of credit issued under the agreement. VF also has a $230.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent
unsecured committed revolving facility under an international bank credit agreement. At the end of
2006, $85.4 million was available for borrowing under this credit agreement. Further, under a
registration statement filed in 1994 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, VF has the
ability to offer, on a delayed or continuous basis, up to $300.0 million of additional debt, equity
or other securities.

The principal investing activity over the last three years related to business acquisitions. We
paid cash of $69.8 million, $211.8 million and $649.1 million for acquisitions in 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively, net of cash balances in the acquired companies. Cash paid in 2006 included the
discounted amount of a $33.0 million installment note payment related to the Nautica acquisition in
2003. The acquisitions were funded with existing VF cash balances and short-term commercial paper
borrowings. All commercial paper borrowings, plus debt of the acquired companies of $28.8 million
in 2004, were repaid in the year of acquisition.

Capital expenditures were $127.2 million in 2006, compared with $103.0 million and $74.1 million in
2005 and 2004, respectively. Capital expenditures in each of these years generally related to
retail and distribution as well as maintenance spending in our worldwide manufacturing facilities.
We expect that capital spending could reach $145 million in 2007, with the increase related to
distribution projects and to higher retail store investments. Capital spending will be funded by
cash flow from operations. In addition during 2006, VF entered into a capital lease of a
distribution center with the present value of lease payments totaling approximately $43 million.

During 2005, VF repaid $401.3 million of long-term debt at scheduled maturity dates. Also during
2005, VF borrowed a total of $220.2 million under a new international bank credit agreement.
During 2006, VF repaid $61.8 million of our borrowings under the international bank credit
agreement. See Notes J and L to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition, Statement 123(R) requires that income tax benefits related to stock option exercises
be reported in the Financing Activities section of the Statements of Cash Flows. Accordingly,
$24.1 million and $17.7 million of such tax benefits for 2006 and 2005, respectively,


were
classified in the Financing Activities section, compared with $13.1 million classified in the
Operating Activities section under the prior rules in 2004.

In January 2007, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services affirmed its ‘A minus’ long-term corporate
credit and senior unsecured debt rating, ‘A-2’ commercial paper rating and ‘stable’ outlook for VF.
Standard & Poor’s also stated that the ratings and outlook would not be affected by the decision
to sell the global intimate apparel business. In June 2006, Moody’s Investors Service affirmed
VF’s long-term debt rating of ‘A3’ and commercial paper rating of ‘Prime-2’ and amended the ratings
outlook to ‘stable’ from ‘negative’. In January 2007, Moody’s Investors Service affirmed its
long-term debt rating of ‘A3’ and ratings outlook of ‘stable’ and stated that the ratings and
outlook would not be affected by the decision to sell the global intimate apparel business.
Existing debt agreements do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses based on changes in credit
ratings.

During 2006, VF purchased 2.0 million shares of its Common Stock in open market transactions at a
cost of $118.6 million (average price of $59.29 per share). In addition, VF purchased 4.0 million
shares of its Common Stock in 2005 at a cost of $229.0 million (average price of $57.25 per share).
The primary objective of our share repurchase program is to reduce the impact of dilution caused
by exercises of stock options. Under its current authorization from the Board of Directors, VF may
purchase an additional 9.3 million shares. We currently plan to use the $350 million estimated
proceeds from the sale of our intimate apparel business to repurchase shares during 2007.
However, the actual number purchased during 2007 may vary from current expectations depending
on funding required to support business acquisitions and other opportunities.

Cash dividends totaled $1.94 per common share in 2006, compared with $1.10 in 2005 and $1.05 in
2004. Prior to 2006, our target was to pay dividends representing 30% of our diluted earnings per
share on a long-term basis. In May 2006, we increased our quarterly dividend by 90%, from $0.29 to
$0.55 per share, with the first payment under the new rate beginning with the June 2006 payment
date. This resulted in a dividend payout rate of 41.1% in 2006, compared with payout rates of
24.2% in 2005 and 24.9% in 2004. We now expect to pay dividends of at least 40% of our diluted
earnings per share on a long-term basis. The current indicated annual dividend rate for 2007 is
$2.20 per share.

Following is a summary of VF’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end
of 2006 that will require the use of funds:

Long-term debt, including the current portion, consists of both required principal and
related interest obligations. For long-term debt having a variable interest rate, the rate at
the end of 2006 was used for all years. Amounts of long-term debt outstanding under the
international revolving credit facility are assumed to be repaid at the end of 2008. Also
included are payment obligations for capital leases.

**

Inventory purchase obligations represent binding commitments for finished goods, raw
materials and sewing labor in the ordinary course of business that are payable upon
satisfactory receipt of the inventory by VF. Included is a remaining commitment to purchase
$111.4 million of finished goods from one supplier, with a minimum of $15.0 million per year.

***

Other obligations represent other commitments for the expenditure of funds, some of
which do not meet the criteria for recognition as a liability for financial statement
purposes. These commitments include forecasted amounts related to (i) contracts not involving
the purchase of inventories, such as the noncancelable portion of service or maintenance
agreements for management information systems, (ii) capital expenditures for approved projects
and (iii) components of Other Liabilities, as presented and classified as noncurrent
liabilities in VF’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, that will require the use of cash. Projected
cash requirements for components of Other Liabilities include (i) portions of those
liabilities classified in Current Liabilities and (ii) payments of deferred compensation and
other employee-related benefits, income taxes, product warranty claims and other liabilities
based on historical and forecasted cash outflows.

We have other financial commitments at the end of 2006 that are not included in the above table but
may require the use of funds under certain circumstances:

•

We made discretionary contributions to our defined benefit pension
plan of $55.0 million in 2005 and $75.0 million in 2006. Future
discretionary pension funding contributions are not included in
the table because of uncertainty of their amounts and timing.


•

VF has entered into $75.0 million of surety bonds and standby
letters of credit representing contingent guarantees of
performance under self-insurance and other programs. These
commitments would only be drawn upon if VF were to fail to meet
its claims obligations.

•

Purchase orders in the ordinary course of business represent
authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements and are
therefore excluded from the table.

Management believes that VF’s cash balances and funds provided by operating activities, as well as
unused committed bank credit lines, additional borrowing capacity and access to equity markets,
taken as a whole, provide (i) adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and long-term
obligations when due, (ii) adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain our
dividend payout policy and (iii) flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise.

We do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships
established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes.

Risk Management

VF is exposed to a variety of market risks in the ordinary course of business. We regularly assess
these potential risks and manage our exposures to these risks through our operating and financing
activities and, when appropriate, by utilizing natural hedges or by creating offsetting positions
through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are
contracts in which the value is linked to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates or
other financial measures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes.

We limit the risk of interest rate fluctuations on net income and cash flows by managing our mix of
fixed and variable interest rate debt. In addition, we may also use derivative financial
instruments to minimize our interest rate risk. Since 81% of our total long-term debt has fixed
interest rates, our primary interest rate exposure relates to changes in interest rates on
short-term borrowings (including short-term notes classified as long-term under the international
revolving credit agreement), which averaged approximately $329 million during 2006. However, any
change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on VF’s cash equivalents on
deposit. Based on average amounts of borrowings having variable interest rates and of cash on
deposit during 2006, the effect of a hypothetical 1.0% change in interest rates on reported net
income would not be material.

Approximately 26% of our business in 2006 was conducted in international markets.


Substantially all of our foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the United
States dollar. Assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates. During 2005, we entered into an international bank credit
agreement that provides for euro-denominated borrowings. At the end of 2006, euro borrowings under
this agreement totaled

€

130 million (approximately $170.8 million), which reduces exposure to
currency rate changes for our net euro-denominated assets. Net investments in our primarily
European and Latin American international businesses are considered to be long-term investments,
and accordingly, foreign currency translation effects on those net assets are included in a
component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in Common Stockholders’ Equity. We do
not hedge these net investments and do not hedge the translation of foreign currency operating
results into the United States dollar.

A majority of our total product needs to support our businesses are manufactured in our plants in
foreign countries or by independent foreign contractors. We monitor net foreign currency market
exposures and may in the ordinary course of business enter into foreign currency forward exchange
contracts to hedge specific foreign currency transactions or anticipated cash flows. Use of these
financial instruments allows us to reduce VF’s overall exposure to exchange rate movements, since
gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the transactions being hedged.
Our practice is to hedge a portion of our net foreign currency cash flows (relating to cross-border
inventory purchases and production costs, product sales and intercompany royalty payments
anticipated during the following 12 months) by buying or selling United States dollar contracts
against various currencies.

We monitor VF’s foreign currency exposures and may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to
hedge against the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for a portion of our anticipated foreign
currency cash flows. If there were a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange
rates of 10% compared with the end of 2006, the expected effect on the change in fair value of the
hedging contracts outstanding would result in an unrealized loss of approximately $29 million.
Based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate movements, the actual
unrealized loss could differ. However, any such change in the fair value of the hedging contracts
would also result in an offsetting change in the value of the transactions or anticipated cash
flows being hedged.

VF is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton and other fibers, which indirectly affects
fabric prices. We manage our fabric prices by ordering denim and other fabrics several months in
advance, but we have not historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative
instruments.


VF has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities accrued for the plans’
participants are based on market values of investment funds that are selected by the participants.
The risk of changes in the market values of the participants’ underlying investment selections is
hedged by VF’s investment in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the investment
selections underlying the deferred compensation liabilities. These VF-owned investment securities
are held in irrevocable trusts. Increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are
substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of VF’s
investments, resulting in a negligible net exposure to our operating results and financial
position.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly
report VF’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. We apply these accounting policies in a consistent
manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note A to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The application of these accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, contingent assets and
liabilities, and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical and
other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate these estimates and
assumptions and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation in areas such as
allocation of purchase price of acquired businesses, equity compensation or retirement benefits.
If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results
of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known.

We believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant management judgments and
estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to
change from outside factors. We have discussed the application of these critical accounting
policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.


Inventories

Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost includes all material, labor
and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods. Overhead allocated to
manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of our plants and does not include amounts
related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies. Market value is based on a
detailed review, at least quarterly, of all inventories on the basis of individual style-size-color
stockkeeping units (“SKUs”) to identify slow moving or excess products, discontinued and
to-be-discontinued products, and off-quality merchandise. This review matches inventory on hand
plus current production and purchase commitments with current and expected future sales orders.
For those units in inventory that are identified as slow-moving or in excess, we estimate their
market value based on historical experience and current realization trends. This evaluation,
performed using a systematic and consistent methodology, requires forecasts of future demand,
market conditions and selling prices. If the forecasted market value, on an individual SKU basis,
is less than cost, we provide an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory. This
methodology recognizes inventory exposures, on an individual SKU basis, at the time such losses are
evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold. Historically, these estimates of future
demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to our timely
identification and rapid disposal of these reduced value inventories.

Long-lived Assets

Our depreciation policies for property, plant and equipment and our amortization policies for
definite-lived intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated economic lives of these assets.
We review these assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. We measure recoverability of the
carrying value of these assets by comparison with estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be
generated by the assets. This review requires estimates and assumptions about the forecasted
amount and duration of future cash flows and residual value, if any, attributable to the assets
being tested. These evaluations have not resulted in any significant impairment charges during the
past three years.

We evaluate indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets and goodwill in all business units at
least annually, or more frequently if there is an indication of possible impairment. We measure
recoverability of the carrying value of these assets by comparison with estimated discounted cash
flows attributable to the trademark or the business to which the goodwill relates. For each of the
last three years, the indicated fair value of the indefinite-lived trademark assets and goodwill in
the business units exceeded the respective carrying amount of those assets.


If actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, or if we were to decide to
discontinue use of a trademark or to dispose of a business, we may be exposed to an impairment
charge related to certain assets or goodwill.

We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the underlying tangible and intangible
assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, based on their respective fair values, with any excess
recorded as Goodwill. The process of assigning fair values, particularly to acquired intangible
assets, is highly subjective, as several of the fair value assessments are based on forecasts of
future cash flows. We use the same assumptions for assigning fair values to these assets that we
used for evaluation of the business acquisition.

Stock Options

In connection with the adoption of Statement 123(R) in 2005, we began using a lattice
option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and
nonemployee members of the Board of Directors. We believe that a lattice model provides a more
refined estimate of the fair value of options than the Black-Scholes model used in prior years.
More specifically, a lattice model can better incorporate (i) historical patterns and future
assumptions about the exercise of stock options, done separately by groups of options holders, in
relation to changes in the price of VF Common Stock and (ii) inputs that vary over time, such as
assumptions for interest rates and volatility. We performed a rigorous review of all assumptions
and believe that the assumptions employed in our 2006 valuation are reflective of our outstanding
options and underlying Common Stock and of our groups of option participants. Our lattice
valuation is based on the assumptions listed in Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

One of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of
the options before exercise. In 2006 and 2005, we based our estimates on evaluations of the
historical and expected option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders that
have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns. These evaluations included (i)
voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of VF
Common Stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and (ii) involuntary
exercise patterns resulting from turnover, retirement and mortality. The average life of stock
options was less in 2004 due to different employee exercise behaviors, caused primarily by higher
employee turnover related to restructuring actions taken.


Volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment. In 2006 and 2005, we based our
estimate of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility. Implied
volatility was based on publicly traded at-the-money options on VF Common Stock. We measured
historical volatility over a ten year period, corresponding to the contractual term of the options,
using daily stock price observations. Our assumption for valuation purposes was that volatility
will start at a level equal to the implied volatility and gradually increase to the historical
volatility over the ten year option term. The assumption for volatility was higher in 2004 because
the assumption in that year was based only on historical volatility.

Pension Obligations

VF sponsors defined benefit pension plans as a key retirement benefit for most domestic employees
employed on or before December 31, 2004. The selection of appropriate actuarial assumptions for
determination of our accumulated and projected pension benefit liabilities and of our annual
pension expense is significant due to the long time period over which benefits are accrued and
paid. We review annually the principal economic actuarial assumptions, summarized in Note N to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, and modify them based on current rates and trends. We update
annually participant demographics and the amount and timing of benefit payments. We also
periodically review and modify as necessary other plan assumptions such as rates of retirement,
termination, death and disability. Specifically during 2006 we updated the assumptions for future
compensation increases, retirement and turnover, and during 2005 we updated the mortality
assumption to a version of the RP 2000 mortality table that includes a provision for improvements
in life expectancy through 2015. We believe these assumptions are reflective of the employee base
covered by the plans and represent the best estimate of the plans’ future experience. Actual
results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used.

One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate. The discount
rate is used to estimate the present value of our accumulated and projected benefit obligations at
each valuation date. We evaluate our discount rate assumption at each annual valuation date and
adjust it as necessary based on current market interest rates. We select our discount rate based
on matching high quality corporate bond yields to the projected benefit payments and duration of
obligations for participants in our pension plans. We use the population of U.S. corporate bonds
rated ‘Aa’ by Moody’s Investors Service (over 500 such bonds) and exclude the highest and lowest
yielding bonds. The plans’ projected benefit payments are matched to spot interest rates


over the expected payment period, and a present value is developed that produces a single
equivalent discount rate that recognizes our plans’ distinct liability characteristics. We believe
our 2006 discount rate of 6.0% appropriately reflects current market conditions and the long-term
nature of projected benefit payments to participants in our pension plans. The discount rate for
our plans may be higher than rates used for plans at some other companies because of our plans’
higher percentage of female participants with a longer life expectancy and higher percentage of
inactive participants with vested benefits who will not begin receiving benefits for many years.

Another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected long-term rate of return on
investment assets in our pension trust. Because the rate of return is a long-term assumption, it
generally does not change significantly each year. This rate is based on several factors,
including the mix of investment assets, historic and projected market returns on those assets and
current market conditions. Our rate of return assumption was 8.25% in 2006 and 8.50% in 2005 and
2004, which were all less than our actual compounded annual return over the preceding 15 years.
The rate of return assumption was lowered in 2006 based on a current evaluation of market
conditions and projected market returns.

The sensitivity of changes in valuation assumptions on our annual pension expense and on our plans’
projected benefit obligations (“PBO”), all other factors being equal, is illustrated by the
following:

Differences between actual results and actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized
over future periods. During the last several years, actual results have differed significantly
from actuarial assumptions, resulting in $195.3 million of accumulated net unrecognized actuarial


losses at our 2006 valuation date. These accumulated losses arose primarily because (i) our
pension plan liabilities increased substantially as a result of the overall decline in the discount
rate from 7.5% in 2001 to 6.0% in 2006 and (ii), although our actual investment return on pension
plan assets exceeded the actuarially assumed rate in the last three years, significant investment
losses were incurred in 2002 and 2001 due to the overall decline in the securities markets. Our
policy is to amortize unrecognized actuarial gains and losses to pension expense as follows:
amounts in excess of 20% of PBO at the beginning of the year are amortized over five years; amounts
totaling 10% to 20% of PBO are amortized over 10 years; and amounts totaling less than 10% of the
lower of investment assets or PBO at the beginning of the year are not amortized.

The cost of pension benefits earned by our employees (commonly called “service cost”) has averaged
$21.7 million per year over the last three years. However, pension expense recognized in our
financial statements over that period has significantly exceeded the average annual service cost.
Our recorded pension expense was $37.5 million in 2006,
$35.1 million in 2005 and $49.6 million
(including a partial plan curtailment charge of $7.1 million) in 2004. Expense in each of the last
three years was higher than the average annual service cost because those years included a
significant cost component for amortization of accumulated net unrecognized actuarial losses (as
discussed in the preceding paragraph). However, our pension expense for 2007 is expected to
decrease to approximately $13 million due to significant discretionary funding contributions of $75
million and $55 million in January 2006 and 2005, respectively, and improved investment
performance.

Our projected benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets at our most recent
valuation date. Accordingly, under the provisions of Statement 158, which was effective at the end
of 2006, we recorded a pension liability of $146.8 million representing the underfunded status of
our two defined benefit pension plans. The amount of the liability could change significantly in
future years depending on securities market fluctuations, interest rates and the level of VF
contributions to the plan.

Effective December 31, 2004, VF’s domestic defined benefit plans were amended to close the existing
plans to new entrants. The amendments did not affect the benefits of current plan participants or
their accrual of future benefits. Domestic employees hired after that date, plus
employees at certain acquired businesses not covered by those plans, now participate in a new
defined contribution arrangement with VF contributing amounts based on a percentage of eligible
compensation. Funds contributed under this new benefit arrangement are invested as


directed by the
participants. This defined contribution feature did not have a significant effect on the 2006
expense for our defined benefit pension plans. Over a period of years, however, the expense of our
defined benefit plans is expected to decline as a percentage of our total retirement benefit
expense. In addition, the year-to-year variability of our retirement benefit expense should also
decrease.

Income Taxes

VF’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.
These audits may result in proposed adjustments. We have reviewed all issues raised upon
examination as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations and have
recorded amounts that reflect our best estimates of the probable outcomes related to any such
matters. Such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements, court cases and
interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Adjustments are recorded when these events occur. We
do not anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax
uncertainties. There are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses.

We have recorded deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss
carryforwards. If in our judgment it appears that we will not be able to generate sufficient
taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods, we have recorded
valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately
realized. An adjustment to income tax expense would be required in a future period if we determine
that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount.

We have not provided United States income taxes on a portion of our foreign subsidiaries’
undistributed earnings because we intend to invest those earnings indefinitely. If we were to
decide to remit those earnings to the United States in a future period, our provision for income
taxes could increase in that period. During 2005, we repatriated certain foreign undistributed
earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which contained provisions for a
temporary incentive for repatriation of foreign earnings, and accordingly recorded the incremental
income tax expense related to the repatriation in our 2005 financial statements.

The balance sheet classifications and amounts of accrued income taxes related to assets and
liabilities of acquired companies were based on assumptions that could change depending on the
ultimate resolution of certain tax matters. Since these income tax accruals were established in
the allocation of the purchase price of acquired businesses, future changes in these amounts could
result in adjustments to Goodwill.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN
48”), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions. FIN 48 prescribes
the recognition threshold an income tax provision is required to meet before being recorded in the
financial statements and provides guidance on classification and disclosures of tax positions. The
provisions of FIN 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. VF is
currently evaluating the impact of FIN 48 on its financial statements. When FIN 48 is adopted in
the first quarter of 2007, the adjustment to the liability for unrecognized tax
benefits and to beginning Retained Earnings is not expected to be
material.


Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements

From time to time, we may make oral or written statements, including statements in this Annual
Report that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities
laws. These include statements concerning plans, objectives, projections and expectations relating
to VF’s operations or economic performance, and assumptions related thereto.
Forward-looking statements are made based on our expectations and beliefs concerning future events
impacting VF and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We caution that
forward-looking statements are not guarantees and actual results could differ materially from those
expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.

Known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results of
operations or financial condition of VF to differ materially from those expressed or implied by
such forward-looking statements are summarized in Item 1.A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

A discussion of VF’s market risks is incorporated by reference to “Risk Management” in “Item 7.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, VF conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of VF’s “disclosure controls and
procedures” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934
(the “Exchange Act”) as of December 30, 2006. These require that VF ensure that information
required to be disclosed by VF in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in the
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to VF’s
management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on VF’s evaluation, the principal executive
officer and the principal financial officer concluded that VF’s disclosure controls and procedures
are effective.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

VF’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). VF’s management conducted an
assessment of VF’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework described in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework,

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, VF’s management has determined that VF’s internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 30, 2006. Management’s assessment
of the effectiveness of VF’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2006 has
been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which appears herein.

See
“Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and Financial
Statement Schedules” at the end of this annual report on
page F-1 for “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.”


Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in VF’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during its
last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
VF’s internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of VF Corporation (“VF”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). VF’s
management conducted an assessment of VF’s internal control over financial reporting based on the
framework described in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework,

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, VF’s management has
determined that VF’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 30,
2006.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of VF’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 30, 2006 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report included herein.

F - 2

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of VF Corporation (“VF”):

We have completed integrated audits of VF’s consolidated financial statements and of its internal
control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2006, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item
15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of VF and its
subsidiaries at December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2006 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2)

presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

As more fully described in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, VF changed the manner
in which it accounts for stock-based compensation effective January 2, 2005. Also, as described in
Note A to the consolidated financial statements, effective
December 30, 2006 the Company adopted the recognition provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and
132(R).

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2006 based on criteria established
in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those
criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2006, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of
internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about

F-3

whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 2006

Note A — Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business:

VF Corporation (and its subsidiaries, collectively known as “VF”) is a
global apparel company based in the United States. VF designs and manufactures or sources from
independent contractors a variety of apparel and footwear for all ages. VF has significant market
shares in jeanswear, outdoor apparel and sportswear marketed primarily under VF-owned brand names.
VF is also a leader in occupational apparel and in daypacks, backpacks and technical outdoor
equipment.

VF markets these products to a broad customer base throughout the world. Products having various
price points are sold through multiple channels of distribution, including specialty stores,
department stores, national chains, mass merchants and VF-operated retail stores. VF’s ten largest
customers, all U.S.-based retailers, accounted for 30% of 2006 total revenues and 24% of total 2006
accounts receivable. Sales are made on an unsecured basis under customary terms that may vary by
product, channel of distribution or geographic region. VF continuously monitors the
creditworthiness of its customers and has established internal policies regarding customer credit
limits. The breadth of product offerings, combined with the large number and geographic diversity
of its customers, limits VF’s concentration of risks.

Basis of Presentation:

All financial statements and related disclosures are presented in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of VF and its subsidiaries, after
elimination of intercompany transactions and balances. For subsidiaries that are not wholly owned,
the minority owners’ interest in net income, which is not significant, is reported in
Miscellaneous, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, and the minority ownership interest in
net assets is reported in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Investments in
20-50% owned companies in which VF does not exercise control are accounted for using the equity
method of accounting.

In December 2006, management decided to dispose of VF’s intimate apparel business consisting of its
domestic and international women’s intimate apparel business
units. Accordingly, the Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows have
been reclassified to present the intimate apparel businesses as discontinued operations for all
periods. General interest expense has not been allocated to the discontinued operations.
Similarly, the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations held for sale have been
separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts presented herein, unless
otherwise stated, relate to continuing operations. See Note C.

Fiscal Year:

VF operates and reports using a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest
to December 31 of each year. All references to “2006”, “2005” and “2004” relate to the 52
week fiscal years ended on December 30, 2006, December 31,
2005 and January 1, 2005, respectively. Certain foreign subsidiaries report using a December 31 year-end
due to local statutory requirements. For presentation purposes in this report, all fiscal years are presented as ended in December.

Foreign Currency Translation:

Financial statements of most foreign subsidiaries are measured using
the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign
currency are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date,
and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Resulting
translation gains and losses, and transaction gains and losses on
long-term investments and advances to foreign
subsidiaries, are reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). For a foreign
subsidiary that uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency, the effects of remeasuring assets
and liabilities into U.S. dollars are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Net
transaction gains of $11.6 million in 2006, losses
of $2.5 million in 2005 and gains of $0.3 million in 2004 arising from transactions denominated in
a currency other than the functional currency of a particular entity are included in the
Consolidated Statements of Income.

F - 11

Cash and Equivalents

include demand deposits and temporary investments that are readily convertible
into cash and will mature within three months of their purchase.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at
invoiced amounts, less estimated allowances for returns, discounts, sales incentive programs,
customer markdowns and charge-backs. Allowances are based on specific product and customer
circumstances and on evaluations of historical and anticipated trends and of current economic
conditions. Royalty receivables are recorded at amounts earned based on the licensees’ sales of
licensed products, subject in some cases to minimum amounts from individual licensees. VF
maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of
customers and licensees to make required payments. All accounts are subject to ongoing review for
ultimate collectibility. An allowance is provided for specific customer accounts where collection
is doubtful and for the inherent risk in ultimate collectibility of total balances due considering
the aging of balances, anticipated trends and economic conditions. Receivables are charged off
against the allowance when it is probable the amounts will not be recovered. There is no
off-balance sheet credit exposure related to customer receivables.

Inventories

are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is net of any purchase discounts or
rebates received from vendors. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method for
69% of total 2006 inventories and 66% of total 2005 inventories. For remaining inventories, cost
is determined on the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method (primarily due to Internal Revenue Service
conformity requirements where LIFO is used for income tax purposes). The LIFO method is used for
jeanswear, wholesale sportswear and occupational apparel inventories located in the United States
and Canada. The value of inventories stated on the LIFO method is not significantly different from
the value determined under the FIFO method. Market value for materials and supplies is replacement
cost. Market value for finished goods is expected net realizable value considering the quantity
and quality of inventories, forecasted demand and historical and expected realization trends.

Long-lived Assets:

Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill are stated at
cost. Improvements to property, plant and equipment that substantially extend the useful life of
the asset, and interest costs incurred during construction of major assets, are capitalized.
Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Goodwill represents the excess of costs
over the fair value of net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of businesses
acquired.

Depreciation of owned assets and amortization of assets under capital leases are computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from 3 to 10 years for
machinery and equipment and up to 40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are depreciated
over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or the lease term. Intangible assets, other than
those having indefinite lives, are amortized over the estimated useful lives, ranging from less
than one year to 30 years, using straight-line or accelerated methods consistent with the expected
realization of benefits to be received. The useful lives of property and intangible assets are
reviewed annually. Depreciation and amortization expense related to producing or otherwise
obtaining finished goods inventories is included in Cost of Goods Sold, and other depreciation and
amortization expense is included in Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses. Goodwill is
not amortized. Upon retirement or disposition, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation
or amortization are removed from the accounts, and a gain or loss is recognized based on the
difference between any proceeds received and the asset’s net carrying value.

VF’s policy is to evaluate intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment at least annually
and to evaluate all long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded for property
and intangible assets with identified useful lives (and therefore are being amortized) if
forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset or asset group are not expected to
be adequate to recover the asset’s carrying value. An impairment loss for intangible assets with
indefinite
lives (and therefore are not being amortized) and for goodwill is recorded if the asset’s carrying
value is in excess of its estimated fair value.

F - 12

In connection with the decision near the end of 2006 to exit the women’s intimate apparel business,
VF recorded an impairment charge for the difference between the recorded book value of the
long-lived assets of this business and the expected net sales proceeds. See Basis of Presentation
above and Note C.

Self-insurance:

VF is primarily self-insured for employee group medical, workers’ compensation,
vehicle, property and general liability exposures. Liabilities for self-insured exposures are
accrued at the present value of amounts expected to be paid based on historical claims experience
and actuarial data for forecasted settlements of claims filed and for incurred but not yet reported
claims. Accruals for self-insured exposures are included in current and noncurrent liabilities
based on the expected period of payment. Excess liability insurance has been purchased to cover
claims in excess of self-insured amounts.

Revenue Recognition:

Revenue is recognized when (i) there is a contract or other arrangement of
sale, (ii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, (iii) title and the risks of ownership have
been transferred to the customer and (iv) collection of the receivable is reasonably assured. Net
Sales to wholesale customers and sales through the internet are generally recognized when the
product has been received by the customer. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are
included in Net Sales. Net Sales are recorded after reduction of allowances for trade terms,
volume and other discounts, customer markdowns and charge-backs, sales incentive programs and
estimated returns, based on customer commitments and historical experience. Sales incentive
programs with retail customers include stated discounts. Sales incentive programs directly with
consumers include rebate and coupon offers. Net Sales at VF-operated retail stores are recognized
at the time products are purchased by consumers. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected from
customers and remitted directly to governmental authorities are excluded from Net Sales.

Royalty income is earned and recognized based on the licensees’ sales of licensed products at rates
specified in the licensing contracts.

Cost of Goods Sold

for VF-manufactured goods includes all materials, labor and overhead costs
incurred in the production process. Cost of Goods Sold for contracted or purchased finished goods
includes the purchase costs and related overhead. In both cases, overhead includes all costs
related to manufacturing or purchasing finished goods, including costs of planning, purchasing,
quality control, freight, duties, royalties paid to third parties and shrinkage. For product lines
having a lifetime warranty, a provision for estimated future repair or replacement costs, based on
historical and anticipated trends, is recorded when these products are sold. Sales incentives to
consumers in the form of free products are included in Cost of Goods Sold.

Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses

include costs of marketing and advertising,
VF-operated retail stores, warehousing, shipping and handling, licensing, administrative and
general and, in 2004, charges of $9.5 million related to the disposal of a business unit (Note C).
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $321.9 million in 2006, $303.0 million in
2005 and $275.8 million in 2004. Advertising costs include cooperative advertising payments made
to VF’s retail customers as direct reimbursement of documented advertising costs incurred by those
retailers for advertising VF’s products. Cooperative advertising costs, totaling $29.5 million in
2006, $34.4 million in 2005 and $33.8 million in 2004, are independently verified to support the
fair value of advertising reimbursed by VF. Shipping and handling costs for inventory totaled
$201.5 million in 2006, $186.0 million in 2005 and $190.2 million in 2004. Expenses related to
royalty income, including amortization of licensing intangible assets, were $22.5 million in 2006,
$24.0 million in 2005 and $20.0 million in 2004.

Income Taxes

are provided on Net Income for financial reporting purposes. Income Taxes are based
on amounts of taxes payable or refundable in the current year and on expected future tax
consequences of events that are recognized in the financial statements in different periods than
they are recognized in tax returns. As a result of timing of recognition and measurement
differences between financial accounting standards and income tax laws, temporary differences arise
between the amounts of pretax financial statement income and taxable income and between reported
amounts of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and their respective tax
bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets
reflect estimated future tax effects attributable to these temporary differences and carryforwards,
based on tax rates expected to be in effect for

F - 13

the years in which the differences are expected to be settled or realized. Valuation allowances
are used to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts considered likely to be realized. U.S. deferred
income taxes are not provided on undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries where such earnings
are considered to be permanently invested. The provision for Income Taxes also includes estimated
interest and penalties related to tax deficiencies and assessments.

Changes in Accounting Policies:

Defined benefit pension plans — In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued FASB Statement No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans

(“Statement 158”). Statement 158, effective for December 2006,
requires that the funded status of a defined benefit plan, measured as the difference between
the fair value of plan assets and projected benefit obligations, be recorded in the balance
sheet. Statement 158 requires that gains and losses for differences between actuarial
assumptions and actual results and that unrecognized prior service costs be
recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.

Statement 158 results in changes in the balance sheet recognition of defined benefit plans but does
not change the measurement of plan assets and obligations and the measurement of benefit expense in
the statement of income. In accordance with Statement 158, prior period financial statements were
not restated. See Note N for a discussion of assets and liabilities related to defined benefit
plans in VF’s 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet, compared with their recognition in the 2005
Consolidated Balance Sheet under the prior rules.

Further under Statement 158, before the end of 2008, VF must change its current September
measurement date for valuation of plan assets and projected benefit obligations to its December
fiscal year-end date. VF has elected for 2007 to change its plans’ measurement date to December
and accordingly will record a charge of $6.2 million to Retained Earnings effective at the
beginning of 2007.

Stock-based compensation — VF has three types of stock-based employee compensation — stock options,
restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock — which are described in Note P. Prior to
2005, VF accounted for these plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of APB Opinion
No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“Opinion 25”). Under those rules, compensation
cost was not required for stock options as all options granted had an exercise price equal to the
market value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant. For grants of performance-based
RSUs, compensation cost equal to the market value of the shares expected to be issued was
recognized over the three year performance period being measured. For grants of restricted stock
and RSUs that were not performance-based, compensation cost equal to the market value of the shares
at the date of grant was recognized over the vesting period.

FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(“Statement 123”), modified Opinion
25 by (i) requiring that compensation expense be recognized for the fair value of stock options,
either in the income statement or disclosed on a pro forma basis in a note to the financial
statements, and (ii) changing the measurement of compensation expense for performance-based
restricted stock units to a grant date fair value model. For 2004, as permitted by Statement 123,
VF elected to continue to recognize and measure stock-based compensation cost in the financial
statements under Opinion 25 and to provide pro forma disclosure of compensation expense recognized
on the fair value method under Statement 123. Statement 123 was superseded by FASB Statement No.
123(Revised),

Share-Based Payment

(“Statement 123(R)”).

VF adopted Statement 123(R) effective as of the beginning of 2005 using the modified retrospective
method. Under this method of adoption, VF recorded in the 2005 Consolidated Statement of Income a
noncash charge of $11.8 million (net of income taxes of $7.9 million) as the Cumulative Effect of a
Change in Accounting Policy for periods prior to January 2005. This 2005 charge represented $0.11
per basic share and $0.10 per diluted share. Accordingly, under this Statement, stock-based
compensation in 2006 and 2005 consisted of (i) the cost recognized for stock-based
payments granted prior to but not vested as of the beginning of 2005 based on grant date fair
values estimated in accordance with the original provisions of Statement 123 and (ii) the cost, net
of estimated forfeitures, recognized for stock-based payments granted during 2006 and 2005 based on
the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of Statement 123(R).
Financial statements for 2004 were not restated.

Details of the stock compensation plans and of the fair value assumptions used for stock

Derivative Financial Instruments

are measured at their fair value and are recognized as Other
Current Assets or Accrued Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. VF formally documents
hedged transactions and hedging instruments and assesses, both at the inception of a contract and
on an ongoing basis, whether the hedging instruments are effective in offsetting changes in cash
flows of the hedged transactions. Derivative financial instruments are used for risk management
and are not used for trading or speculative purposes.

If certain criteria are met, a derivative may be specifically designated and accounted for as (i) a
hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows for a forecasted transaction or (ii) a hedge of the
exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm
commitment. The criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are (i)
whether an appropriate hedging instrument has been designated and identified to reduce an
identified exposure and (ii) whether there is a high correlation between changes in the value of
the hedging instrument and the identified exposure. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
accounted for as cash flow hedges are deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income until the
hedged transaction affects earnings, at which point the amount is reclassified to Net Income as an
offset to the earnings impact of the hedged transaction. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
accounted for as fair value hedges are recognized in Miscellaneous Income or Expense as an offset
to the earnings impact of the hedged item. These hedges are evaluated each quarter, with changes
in fair value deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income or reported in Net Income,
depending on the nature of the hedged item or risk and the effectiveness of the hedge. Any
ineffectiveness in a hedging relationship is recorded immediately in earnings. Hedging cash flows
are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same category as the items being
hedged. For those limited number of derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge
accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in Miscellaneous Income or Expense as they occur.

Legal and Tax Contingencies:

Management periodically assesses, based on the latest information
available, liabilities and contingencies in connection with legal and income tax proceedings and
other claims that may arise from time to time. When it is probable that a loss has been or will be
incurred, we record the loss, or a reasonable estimate of the loss, in the consolidated financial
statements. Estimates of losses are adjusted in the period in which additional information becomes
available or circumstances change. We disclose a contingent liability when there is

F - 15

at least a
reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. Management believes that the outcome of
these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial statements.

Use of Estimates:

In preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in
the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards:

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN
48”), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions. FIN 48 prescribes
the recognition threshold an income tax provision is required to meet before being recorded in the
financial statements and provides guidance on classification and disclosures of tax positions. The
provisions of FIN 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. VF is
currently evaluating the impact of FIN 48 on its financial statements. When FIN 48 is adopted in
the first quarter of 2007, the adjustment to the liability for unrecognized tax
benefits and to beginning Retained Earnings is not expected to be
material.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“Statement 157”),
which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and
liabilities and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of Statement 157
are effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. VF is currently evaluating the
impact of adopting Statement 157.

Note B — Acquisitions

On September 1, 2006, VF acquired a 60% interest in a newly formed joint venture to design, market
and distribute VF-branded products in India for a total cost of $33.2 million. Prior to the
transaction, the joint venture partner marketed the

Lee

â

,

Wrangler

â

,

Nautica

â

,

JanSport

â

and

Kipling

â

brands under
license or distribution agreements. Because all preexisting relationships were arms-length
contracts, no gain or loss was recognized upon formation of the joint venture.

VF acquired the common stock of Reef Holdings Corporation (“Reef”) on April 14, 2005 for a total
cash cost of $187.7 million. Reef designs and markets surf-inspired products, including sandals,
apparel, shoes and accessories under the

Reef

â

brand. This
acquisition is consistent with VF’s strategy of acquiring strong lifestyle brands with superior
growth potential. VF also acquired substantially all of the net assets of Holoubek, Inc.
(“Holoubek”) on January 3, 2005. Holoubek has rights to manufacture and market certain apparel
products, including t-shirts and fleece, under license from Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Inc.
The cost was $26.3 million, consisting of $23.8 million in cash payments and $2.5 million in notes
payable over a five-year period. In addition, $2.5 million in contingent consideration is payable
in 2008 upon the occurrence of certain events. Any contingent consideration earned and paid will
be allocated to intangible assets. The acquisitions of Reef and Holoubek are together referred to
as the “2005 Acquisitions.”

During 2004, VF acquired the following businesses for a total cash cost, including transaction
costs, of $661.5 million:

•

The most significant transaction was the acquisition on June 30,
2004 of 100% of the common stock of Vans, Inc. (“Vans”) for a
total cost of $373.1 million. Vans designs and markets

Vans

â

performance and casual footwear
and apparel for skateboarders and other action sports participants
and enthusiasts.

•

VF acquired the operating assets of

Kipling

â

bags, backpacks and
accessories (“Kipling”) on June 14, 2004. Including the
acquisition of the brand rights in the United States in late 2004,
the total cost was $185.0 million.

•

On May 31, 2004, VF acquired 100% of the common stock of Green
Sport Monte Bianco S.p.A., makers of

Napapijri

â

premium casual outdoor
sportswear (“Napapijri”), for a total cost of $103.4 million.

F - 16

The Reef, Vans, Kipling and Napapijri businesses added lifestyle brands having global growth
potential. Their brands are targeted to specific consumer groups, and their products extend across
multiple categories. Reef, Vans and Kipling provided expertise and growth opportunities in two new
product categories for VF — footwear and women’s accessories.

Operating results of these acquisitions have been included in the consolidated financial statements
since their respective acquisition dates. Pro forma operating results for the 2006 acquisition and
the 2005 Acquisitions for periods prior to their respective dates of acquisition are not provided
because the amounts are not significant.

The purchase price of each acquisition was allocated to the fair values of net tangible and
intangible assets. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed for the 2006 acquisition and the 2005 Acquisitions at their respective
dates of acquisition:

Amounts assigned to intangible assets acquired were based on management’s evaluation of
their fair values. Amounts assigned to major trademarks and tradenames that management believes
have indefinite lives totaled $80.0 million for the 2005 Acquisitions. Amounts assigned to
amortizable intangible assets for the 2006 acquisition totaled $5.9 million and consisted
principally of customer relationships. These assets were estimated to have weighted average
useful lives of 14 years and are being amortized primarily using accelerated methods. Amortizable
intangible assets for the 2005 Acquisitions totaled $54.7 million and consisted principally of
$23.0 million of customer relationships and $30.7 million of licensing contracts having weighted
average useful lives of 24 years and 19 years, respectively.

Any excess purchase price related to these acquisitions was recorded as Goodwill. Factors that
contributed to recognition of Goodwill for these acquisitions included (i) expected growth rates
and profitability of the acquired
companies, (ii) the ability to expand the brands globally, (iii) their experienced workforce, (iv)
VF’s strategies for growth in sales, income and cash flows and (v) expected synergies with existing VF business units.

F - 17

Business Acquisitions in the 2006 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows included the discounted
amount of a $33.0 million installment note payment related to a 2003 business acquisition. See
Note L.

Note C — Discontinued Operations

In December 2006, management and the Board of Directors decided to exit the women’s intimate
apparel business. VF entered into a definitive agreement on January 22, 2007 to sell all of VF’s
domestic and international women’s intimate apparel business units (referred to as the
Intimate Apparel Coalition, formerly a reportable business segment)
for $350.0 million, subject to a working capital level
adjustment. The transaction, expected to close in early 2007, is consistent with VF’s
stated objective of focusing on lifestyle businesses having higher growth and profit potential.
As part of the agreement, VF will provide transition services at its cost for a limited number
of months after closing. VF management has concluded that the direct cash flows resulting from the
transition services agreement will not be material to VF. Further, VF management will not have any
continuing ownership interest or other influence over the intimate apparel business following the
closing. Accordingly, the results of operations and cash flows of the intimate apparel business
are separately presented as discontinued operations for all periods in accordance with FASB
Statement No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

(“Statement
144”). Similarly, the assets and liabilities of this business have been reclassified and reported
as held for sale for all periods presented.

VF recorded a charge of $42.2 million in 2006, computed in accordance with Statement 144,
for the difference between the recorded book value of the intimate apparel business and the
expected net sales proceeds. The recorded book value included $32.0 million of foreign currency
translation losses, net of income tax benefit, deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
(Loss). The charge was recorded as a valuation allowance against noncurrent assets of the intimate
apparel business. In addition, VF recorded a noncash partial pension plan curtailment charge of
$5.6 million for the expected withdrawal of intimate apparel participants from VF’s defined benefit
pension plans. The writedown to expected net sales proceeds, plus the pension curtailment charge,
were recorded as loss on disposal of the intimate apparel business, net of an income tax benefit of
$10.9 million. Other gains or losses including purchase price adjustments in the sale agreement,
changes in the estimated income tax allocation of the sales proceeds, sale of certain segment
assets held for sale but not included in the sale transaction (primarily marketable securities of
an intimate apparel supplier) and settlement of retained liabilities will be recorded in
discontinued operations when realized.

The children’s playwear business (“VF Playwear”) was sold in 2004 for cash and notes
totaling $17.1 million. Under the sale agreement, VF agreed to purchase from the acquirer over a
10 year period $150.0 million of branded childrenswear for sale in its outlet stores. Due to this
ongoing involvement, VF Playwear did not qualify for treatment as a discontinued operation. VF
Playwear contributed revenues of $87.5 million in 2004 and incurred operating losses
of $0.5 million and $14.0 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Operating results in 2004
included net charges of $9.5 million related to the disposal of the business.

Cost and accumulated amortization of $0.9 million and $5.2 million were eliminated from
Trademarks and Other in 2006 and 2005, respectively, because the underlying intangible assets
became fully amortized in those years.

Amortization expense was $18.0 million in 2006, $16.7 million in 2005 and $15.4 million in 2004
(including an impairment charge of $1.1 million for a miscellaneous intangible asset). Estimated

Short-term borrowings, all from foreign banks, had a weighted average interest rate of 8.0%
at the end of 2006 and 5.5% at the end of 2005. The international bank credit agreement is a
committed facility. All other arrangements may be terminated at any time by either VF or the
banks.

VF maintains a $750.0 million unsecured committed revolving bank credit agreement that supports
issuance of up to $750.0 million in commercial paper, with any unused portion available for general
corporate purposes. This agreement, which expires in September 2008, requires VF to pay a facility
fee of 0.09% per year and contains a financial covenant requiring VF’s ratio of consolidated
indebtedness to consolidated capitalization to remain below 60%. The agreement also contains other
covenants and events of default, including limitations on liens, subsidiary indebtedness and sales
of assets, and a $50.0 million cross-acceleration event of default. If VF fails in the performance
of any covenant under this agreement, the banks may terminate their obligation to lend, and any
bank borrowings outstanding under this agreement may become due and payable. At the end of 2006,
VF was in compliance with all covenants. Also at the end of 2006, the entire amount of the credit
agreement was available for borrowing, except for $9.5 million related to standby letters of credit
issued under the agreement on behalf of VF.

The notes contain customary covenants and events of default, including limitations on liens
and sale-leaseback transactions and a cross-acceleration event of default. The cross-acceleration
provision is triggered for all notes if more than $50.0 million of other debt is in default and has
been accelerated by the lenders. If VF fails in the performance of any covenant under the
indenture that governs the respective notes, the trustee or lenders may declare the principal due
and payable immediately. At the end of 2006, VF was in compliance with all covenants. VF may
redeem the 8.50% and the 6.00% notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of the
principal amount, plus accrued interest to the redemption date and a premium (if any) relating to
the then-prevailing treasury yield over the remaining life of the obligations.

The 6.00% notes, having a principal balance of $300.0 million, are recorded net of unamortized
original issue discount. Interest Expense is recorded at an effective annual interest rate of
6.19%, including amortization of the original issue discount, deferred gain on the interest rate
hedging contract (Note U) and debt issuance costs.

During 2005, certain international subsidiaries, with VF as guarantor, entered into an
international bank credit agreement consisting of three unsecured committed credit facilities. The
credit facilities consisted of (i) a euro-denominated five year revolving credit agreement for a
U.S. dollar equivalent amount of $230.0 million, (ii) a euro-denominated two year term loan for a
U.S. dollar equivalent of $52.6 million and (iii) a U.S. dollar-denominated two year term loan for
$40.0 million. All borrowings under the agreement are short-term (up to six months) notes that can
be continued for the full term of the respective credit facility. The full amount of the revolving
credit agreement will be available for the five year period, while amounts borrowed and repaid
under the two year term loans cannot be continued. During 2006, $21.8 million U.S. dollar
equivalent of the euro-denominated term loan and the entire amount of the U.S. dollar term loan
were repaid. The terms and conditions of the international bank credit agreement are similar to
those of VF’s existing $750.0 million domestic credit agreement (Note J). The revolving credit
facility is available for general working capital purposes. Amounts under the revolving credit
agreement expected to be repaid during the following year and all amounts under the two year term
loans were classified as Short-term Borrowings at the end of each year (Note J). Of the total
outstanding under the five year revolving credit agreement, VF has no intent to pay down $98.6
million throughout 2007, and accordingly, that amount was classified as Long-term Debt. The
remaining amount of $32.8 million was classified as a current liability. Borrowings classified as
long-term under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at 4.0% at the end of 2006 and 2.7%
at the end of 2005. When borrowings exceed two-thirds of the maximum amount available under the
revolving credit agreement, there is an annual utilization fee of 0.05% for amounts borrowed. In
addition, there is an annual commitment fee of 0.06% for unborrowed amounts.

Capital leases and other at the end of 2006 included a capital lease obligation of $41.8 million at
an effective interest rate of 5.06% and a $33.0 million note payable in 2007 to a former officer of
a business acquired in 2003. During 2006, $33.0 million was paid to this former officer. These
2006 and 2007 noninterest-bearing installments were recorded at
discounts of 3.25% and 3.84%, respectively, reflecting VF’s incremental borrowing rates for those
periods at the time this debt was incurred. The discounts are amortized as Interest Expense over
the lives of these

F - 24

obligations. The carrying value of this debt was $32.2 million at the end of
2006 and $63.3 million at the end of 2005.

Note N – Retirement and Savings Benefit Plans

VF has several retirement and savings benefit plans covering eligible employees. VF retains the
right to amend any aspect of the plans, or to curtail or discontinue any of the plans, subject to
local regulations.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans:

VF sponsors a noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension
plan covering most full-time domestic employees initially employed before 2005. For employees
covered by this plan, VF also sponsors an unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan that
provides benefits that exceed limitations
imposed by income tax regulations. These defined benefit plans provide pension benefits based on
compensation levels and years of service. The effect of these pension plans on income was as
follows:

Projected benefit obligations at any pension plan measurement date are the present value of
vested and unvested pension benefits, based on both past and projected future employee service and
compensation levels. Accumulated
benefit obligations are the present value of vested and unvested pension benefits earned through
the measurement date, without projection to future periods. Accumulated benefit obligations earned
through the respective measurement dates for these plans totaled $1,061.8 million in 2006 and
$1,079.8 million in 2005. VF’s two defined benefit plans were underfunded at the end of 2006 and
2005 based on both projected benefit obligations and accumulated benefit obligations. Under the
newly adopted Statement 158, at the end of 2006, $143.8 million of the

F - 27

total $146.8 million
underfunded pension liability based on projected benefit obligations was recorded in Other
Liabilities, with the balance classified in current liabilities. At the end of 2005, under the
prior accounting rules, the excess of accumulated benefit obligations over the sum of the fair
value of plan assets and previously accrued pension liabilities, termed the “minimum pension
liability,” was $171.9 million. This minimum pension liability resulted in a charge to Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), with $75.0 million of the minimum pension liability classified
as a current liability because VF contributed that amount to the pension plan in early 2006.

Differences between actual results and amounts estimated using actuarial assumptions are deferred
and amortized as a component of future years’ pension expense. These unrecognized actuarial gains
and losses are amortized to pension expense as follows: amounts in excess of 20% of projected
benefit obligations at the beginning of the year are amortized over five years; amounts totaling
10% to 20% of projected benefit obligations are amortized over ten years; and amounts totaling less
than 10% of the lower of plan assets or projected benefit obligations are not amortized. Under the
newly adopted Statement 158, the deferred actuarial loss and the deferred prior service cost at the
end of 2006 were recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). The estimated amounts
of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to be amortized to pension expense in 2007 are as
follows: deferred actuarial loss — $5.2 million and deferred prior service cost — $2.7 million.

Management’s investment strategy is to invest the plan’s assets in a diversified portfolio of
domestic and international equity, fixed income and real estate securities to provide long-term
growth in plan assets. This strategy, the resulting allocation of plan assets and the selection of
independent investment managers are reviewed periodically. There are no investments in VF debt or
equity securities.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was based on the weighted average of the
expected returns for the major asset classes in which the plan invests. Expected returns by asset
class were developed through analysis of historical market returns, current market conditions,
inflation expectations and other economic factors. The 8.25% assumed rate of return on plan assets
in 2006 was lower than actual long-term historical returns. The target allocation by asset class
and the actual asset allocations at the latest measurement dates were as follows:

VF makes contributions to the plan sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under
applicable laws, plus additional amounts as recommended by VF’s independent actuary. VF is not
required and does not currently intend to make a contribution to the qualified pension plan during
2007 under applicable regulations. Estimated future benefit payments, including benefits
attributable to estimated future employee service, are approximately $47.1 million in 2007, $49.8
million in 2008, $52.4 million in 2009, $55.4 million in 2010, $59.4 million in 2011 and $362.5
million for the years 2012 through 2016.

Deferred Compensation Plans:

VF sponsors a nonqualified retirement savings plan for employees
whose contributions to a tax qualified

401(k)

plan would be limited by provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code. This plan allows participants to defer receipt of a portion of their salary and
incentive compensation and to receive matching

F - 28

contributions for a portion of the deferred amounts.
Expense under this plan was $4.1 million in 2006, $3.8 million in 2005 and $2.9 million in 2004.
Participants earn a return on their deferred compensation based on investment earnings of
participant-selected mutual funds and VF Common Stock. Changes in the market value of the
participants’ investment selections are recorded as an adjustment to deferred compensation
liabilities, with an offset to compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Deferred compensation, including accumulated earnings on the participant-directed investment
selections, is distributable in cash at participant-specified dates or upon retirement, death,
disability or termination of employment. Similarly, under a separate nonqualified plan, members of
the Board of Directors may elect to defer their Board compensation and invest it in VF Common
Stock. At December 2006, VF’s liability to the participants of the deferred compensation plans was
$244.7 million, of which $26.4 million expected to be paid in 2007 was recorded in Accrued
Liabilities (Note K) and $218.3 million expected to be paid beyond one year was recorded in Other
Liabilities (Note M).

VF purchases mutual funds, variable life insurance contracts and VF Common Stock that are
substantially the same as the participant-directed investment selections underlying the deferred
compensation obligations. These investment securities and earnings thereon, held in an irrevocable
trust, are intended to provide (i) a source of funds to meet the deferred compensation obligations,
subject to claims of creditors in the event of VF’s insolvency, and (ii) an economic hedge of the
financial impact of changes in deferred compensation liabilities based on changes in market value
of the participant-selected investments underlying the liabilities. The mutual funds and life
insurance investments are recorded at fair value. At December 2006, the fair value of the mutual
fund and life insurance investments was $232.4 million, of which
$26.4 million expected to be liquidated to
fund payments to participants in 2007 was recorded in Other Current Assets and $206.0 million was
recorded in Other Assets (Note I). The difference between the carrying value of these securities
and the recorded deferred compensation liabilities resulted primarily from VF Common Stock purchased
to match participant-directed investment selections being treated for financial accounting purposes
as treasury stock (Note O). Realized and unrealized gains and losses on the mutual fund and life
insurance securities (other than VF Common Stock) are recorded in compensation expense in the
Consolidated Statements of Income and substantially offset losses and gains resulting from changes
in deferred compensation liabilities to participants.

Other Retirement and Savings Plans

: VF also sponsors defined contribution retirement and savings
plans. For domestic employees hired after 2004 and employees of businesses acquired in 2004 and
2003, VF contributes a specified percentage of an employee’s gross earnings to a qualified
retirement plan. VF also sponsors 401(k) and other savings and retirement plans for certain
domestic and foreign employees where cash contributions are based on a specified percentage of
employee contributions. Expense for these plans totaled $9.1 million in 2006, $6.3 million in 2005
and $4.5 million in 2004.

Note O – Capital

Common Stock

outstanding is net of shares held in treasury, and in substance retired. There were
5,775,810 treasury shares at the end of 2006, 4,962,478 at the end of 2005 and 1,098,172 at the end
of 2004. The excess of the cost of treasury shares acquired over the $1 per share stated value of
Common Stock is deducted from Retained Earnings. In addition, 261,458 shares of VF Common Stock at
the end of 2006, 269,043 shares at the end of 2005 and 256,088 shares at the end of 2004 were held
in trust for deferred compensation plans. These additional shares are treated for financial
reporting purposes as treasury shares at a cost of $9.8 million, $9.9 million and $9.2 million at
the end of 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Preferred Stock

consists of 25,000,000 authorized shares at $1 par value.

Series A Preferred Stock

-

At the end of 2006, 2,000,000 shares are designated as Series A
Preferred Stock, of which none has been issued. Each outstanding share of Common Stock has a
Series A Preferred Stock purchase right attached to it. If an outside party acquires 15% or more of
the Common Stock, each holder of Common Stock will be able to exercise the attached rights. After
a right is exercisable, its holder will be able to buy 1/100 share of

F - 29

Series A Preferred Stock for
$175. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock entitles the holder to receive (i) 100 times the
aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends declared on the Common Stock and (ii) 100 votes on
all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Alternatively, after an outside party acquires
15% or more of the Common Stock, each holder of a right (other than the acquirer) will be able to
(i) purchase, for $175, Common Stock having a market value of $350 or (ii) exchange each right for
a share of Common Stock. If VF is involved in a business combination or sale after an outside
party acquires 15% of the Common Stock, then each holder of a right (other than the acquirer) will
be able to purchase, for $175, common stock of the other party to the business combination or sale
having a market value of $350. The rights, which expire in January 2008, may be redeemed at $0.01
per right prior to their becoming exercisable.

Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock

-

Each share of 6.75% Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock
had a redemption value and liquidation value of $30.88 plus cumulative accrued dividends, was
convertible into 1.6 shares of Common Stock and was entitled to two votes per share along with the
Common Stock. All shares were owned by an employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”) that was part of
a VF-sponsored 401(k) plan. In June 2006, the Series B Preferred Stock was converted to Common
Stock because the indicated quarterly Common Stock dividend rate ($0.88 equivalent common dividend
per preferred share) significantly exceeded the stated quarterly dividend rate ($0.521 per share)
of the Series B Preferred Stock. Changes in shares of Preferred Stock outstanding are summarized
as follows:

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income:

Other comprehensive income consists of certain
changes in assets and liabilities that are not included in Net Income under generally accepted
accounting principles but are instead reported within a separate component of Common Stockholders’
Equity. Amounts comprising Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets, net of related income taxes, are summarized as follows:

Note P – Stock-based Compensation

VF may grant nonqualified stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock to
officers and key employees and also to nonemployee members of VF’s Board of Directors under the
1996 Stock Compensation Plan approved by stockholders. Compensation cost for all awards expected
to vest is recognized over the shorter of the

F - 30

requisite service period or the vesting
period. For stock option awards that vest in equal annual installments over a three year period,
compensation cost is recognized during each individual vesting period. VF has elected to use the
practical transition method for determining the historical pool of windfall tax benefits. Total
compensation cost (including cost recognized for stock options) and the related income tax benefits
for those awards recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income
were $46.0 million and $17.0
million for 2006 and $40.0 million and $14.7 million for 2005, respectively (exclusive of amounts
included in the 2005 Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting
Policy; see Note A). Total
compensation cost and related income tax benefits for stock-based compensation under the prior
rules (which did not require cost to be recognized for stock options)
were $10.0 million and $3.6
million, respectively, for 2004. Stock-based compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory
was $0.5 million at December 2006 and $0.8 million at December 2005. At the end of 2006, there was
$34.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based compensation
arrangements, of which $23.9 million, $10.8 million and $0.2 million are expected to be recognized
in 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively.

At the end
of 2006, there were 3,237,065 shares available for future grants of stock options and
stock awards under the 1996 Stock Compensation Plan, of which no more
than 1,236,691 may be grants
of restricted stock or shares delivered in settlement of RSUs. VF has a practice of repurchasing
shares of Common Stock in the open market to offset dilution caused by exercises of stock options
and other stock-based payments.

Stock
Options:

Stock options are granted at a price equal to the
average of the high and low price of VF Common Stock
on the date of grant. Employee Stock options vest in equal annual installments over three years of
continuous service after the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. Beginning
with the 2005 stock option grants, the fair value on the date of grant of each option award was
calculated using a lattice option-pricing valuation model, which incorporates a range of assumptions
for inputs between the grant date of the options and the date of expiration. For 2004 stock option
grants, fair value was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model in which each
assumption was based on a single average input instead of a range of inputs over the life of the
options. The assumptions used and the resulting weighted average fair value of stock options
granted during 2006 and 2005 using the lattice valuation model and for stock options granted during
2004 using the Black-Scholes valuation model are summarized below:

Volatility is the measure of change in the market price of VF Common Stock from period to
period. Expected volatility over the contractual term of an option was based on the implied
volatility from publicly traded options on VF Common Stock and the historical volatility of VF
Common Stock. The expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to
be outstanding before exercise. VF used historical data to estimate both voluntary and involuntary
option exercise behaviors and to estimate employee terminations. Groups of employees that have
historically exhibited similar option exercise behaviors were considered separately in estimating
the expected term. Dividend yield represents expected dividends on VF Common Stock for the
contractual life of the options. Risk-free
interest rates for the periods during the contractual life of the option were the implied yields at
the date of grant from the U.S. Treasury zero coupon yield curve.

The total fair value of stock options vested during 2006 was $25.4 million, during 2005 was
$18.5 million and during 2004 was $21.3 million. Intrinsic value is the amount by which the fair
value of VF Common Stock exceeds the exercise price of the stock option. The total intrinsic value
of stock options exercised during 2006 was $74.9 million, during 2005 was $53.6 million and during
2004 was $36.0 million.

Restricted Stock Units:

VF granted performance-based RSUs to certain key employees as a long-term
incentive. Participants are eligible to receive shares of VF Common Stock at the end of a three
year performance period. Each RSU has a potential final value ranging from zero to two shares of
VF Common Stock. The number of shares paid to participants is based on achievement of performance
goals for profitability and sales growth set by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors. Dividend equivalents, payable in additional shares of VF
Common Stock, accrue without compounding on the
RSUs. Shares are issued to participants in the year following the end of each three year
performance period.

of 2006 was $66.1 million, of which a total of 404,621 shares of VF Common Stock having a value of
$33.2 million was earned, subject to final confirmation approval of the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors, for the three year performance period ended in 2006 and distributable in early 2007.
Similarly, 36,921 shares of VF Common Stock with a value of $2.0 million were earned for the
performance period ended in 2005, and 23,727 shares of VF Common Stock with a value of $1.3 million
were earned for the performance period ended in 2004.

F - 32

VF granted an additional 10,000 RSUs in 2006 and 10,000 RSUs in 2005 to certain members of
management. Each RSU entitles the holder to one share of VF Common Stock upon vesting, without a
performance adjustment. These RSUs had grant date fair values of
$75.97 and $54.80 and will vest
in 2010 and 2007, respectively. The value of these RSUs, including 437 dividend equivalents, was
$1.7 million at the end of 2006.

In prior years, certain participants elected to defer receipt of shares earned upon vesting. A
total of 108,765 shares of Common Stock are issuable in future years for such deferrals.

Restricted Stock:

In 2006, VF granted restricted shares of VF Common Stock to certain members of

As of the end of 2006, VF has not provided deferred U.S. income taxes on $345.3 million of
undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be
permanently invested. The undistributed earnings would become taxable in the United States if
management decided to repatriate earnings for business, tax or foreign exchange reasons. Upon
meeting certain increased investment and employment level requirements, VF has been granted a lower
effective income tax rate on taxable earnings in one foreign subsidiary. This lower rate, when
compared with the country’s statutory rate, resulted in an income tax reduction of $13.6 million
($0.12 per diluted share) in 2006, $15.2 million ($0.13 per share) in 2005 and $12.1 million ($0.11
per share) in 2004. The tax status providing this benefit is scheduled to expire at the end of
2009.

VF has
$134.2 million of foreign operating loss carryforwards
(including discontinued operations), with $2.8 million expiring in 2007,
$0.8 million in 2008, $1.1 million in 2009,
$0.5 million in 2010, $3.8 million in 2011 and
$47.6 million between 2012 and 2021. Remaining carryforwards
have unlimited lives. In addition, there are $16.5 million of federal operating loss
carryforwards that expire between 2007 and 2020 and $14.2 million of state operating loss
carryforwards that expire between 2007 and 2025.

F - 35

Some of the foreign and substantially all of the
federal and state operating losses relate to acquired companies for periods prior to their
acquisition by VF. A valuation allowance has been provided where it is more likely than not, based on an
evaluation of current information, that the deferred tax assets related to those loss carryforwards
will not be realized. Valuation allowances totaled $124.2 million for available foreign
carryforwards and $11.5 million for available state
carryforwards. In addition, VF has $66.5 million of federal capital losses at the end of 2006. Included in
this amount is $44.8 million related to excess tax basis over book basis of the discontinued
operations to be sold in 2007, upon which a full valuation allowance was provided. Of the
remaining amount, $11.0 million will be carried back and offset against prior years’ capital gains,
and the remaining $10.7 million will be carried forward to be offset with expected future capital
gains.

VF files a consolidated federal income tax return in the United States. Tax years of 1994 and
prior are closed. Examination for tax years 1995 through 1999 are tentatively agreed upon between
VF and the United States government and are expected to close during 2007. The statutes of
limitation have expired for the 2000 and 2001 federal tax years. The 2002 through 2003 federal tax
audit period is in the appeals process with the Internal Revenue Service. The federal statute of
limitations for tax years 2004 and forward have not yet expired.

As of the end of 2006, VF has recorded $89.2 million for known income tax exposures that have been
raised, or that management has reason to believe will be raised, by various tax authorities.
Amounts recorded for current or anticipated expense include interest, net of the tax benefit of the
interest deductions. Approximately $16.0 million of these exposures relate to acquired companies
for periods prior to their acquisition by VF. Of the total, approximately $63.6 million is
expected to be paid in years after 2007, although VF attempts to resolve these matters as quickly
as possible.

Note R – Segment Information

For internal management and reporting purposes, VF’s businesses are grouped principally by product
categories, and by brands within those product categories. These groupings of businesses are
referred to as “coalitions.” These coalitions, as described below, represent VF’s reportable
segments:

The India joint venture, acquired in 2006, is included in the Jeanswear coalition.

Management at each of the coalitions has direct control over and responsibility for its revenues,
operating income and assets, hereinafter termed “Coalition Revenues,” “Coalition Profit” and
“Coalition Assets,” respectively. VF management evaluates operating performance and makes
investment and other decisions based on Coalition Revenues and Coalition Profit. Accounting
policies used for internal management reporting at the individual coalitions are consistent with
those stated in Note A, except as stated below and except that inventories are valued on a FIFO
basis. Common costs such as information systems processing, retirement benefits and insurance are
allocated to the coalitions based on appropriate metrics such as usage or employment. Prior years’
information has been reclassified to present the women’s intimate apparel business as discontinued
operations; see Note C.

Corporate costs, other than costs directly related to the coalitions, and net interest expense are
not controlled by coalition management and are therefore excluded from the Coalition Profit
performance measure used for internal management reporting. These items are separately presented
in the reconciliation of Coalition Profit to
Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes.

Corporate and Other Expenses (presented separately in the following table) consists of corporate
headquarters expenses that are not allocated to the coalitions (including compensation and benefits
of corporate management and

F - 36

staff, certain legal and professional fees, and administrative and general) and other expenses
related to but not allocated to the coalitions for internal management reporting (including
development costs for management information systems, costs of maintaining and enforcing certain of
VF’s trademarks, adjustments for the LIFO method of inventory valuation and miscellaneous
consolidating adjustments).

Coalition Assets, for internal management purposes, are those used directly in or resulting from
the operations of each business unit, such as accounts receivable, inventories, property, plant and
equipment. Corporate assets include investments held in trusts for deferred compensation plans and
information systems assets.

Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., substantially all in the Jeanswear Coalition, comprised
13.2% of Total Revenues in 2006, 14.0% in 2005 and 13.5% in 2004. Trade receivables from this
customer totaled $80.5 million at the end of 2006 and $83.8 million at the end of 2005.

Note S – Commitments

VF enters into noncancelable operating leases for retail stores and other facilities and for
equipment. Leases for real estate typically have initial terms ranging from 5 to 15 years, some
with renewal options. Leases for equipment typically have initial terms ranging from 2 to 5 years.
Most leases have fixed rentals; expense for leases having rent holidays or escalating rentals is
recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain leases contain requirements for
additional rent payments based on sales volume or for payments of real estate taxes and other
occupancy costs. Contingent rent expense, based generally on gross sales at individual retail
store locations being in excess of a stated base amount, is recognized when the liability is
probable. Lease incentives received are deferred and
amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the lease term. Rent expense included in the
Consolidated Statements of Income was as follows:

Future minimum lease payments are $113.9 million, $97.5 million, $80.8 million, $76.5
million and $54.8 million for the years 2007 through 2011, respectively, and $152.7 million
thereafter. Future payments presented have not been reduced by income of $14.5 million from
noncancelable subleases.

VF has entered into licensing agreements that provide VF rights to market products under trademarks
owned by other parties. Royalties under these agreements are recognized in Cost of Goods Sold in
the Consolidated Statements of Income. Certain of these agreements contain minimum royalty and
minimum advertising requirements. Future minimum royalty payments, including any required
advertising payments, are $21.3 million, $22.9 million, $11.3 million, $4.0 million and $2.0
million for the years 2007 through 2011, respectively.

VF in the ordinary course of business has entered into purchase commitments for raw materials,
sewing labor and finished products. These agreements, typically ranging from 2 to 6 months in
duration, require total payments of $621.6 million in 2007. In addition, VF has a remaining
commitment to purchase $111.4 million of finished product, with a minimum of $15.0 million per
year, in connection with the sale of a business (Note C).

VF has entered into commitments for (i) capital spending, (ii) advertising and (iii) service and
maintenance agreements related to its management information systems. Future payments under these
agreements are $47.4 million, $5.8 million, $4.0 million, $0.4 million and $0.3 million for the
years 2007 through 2011, respectively.

Surety bonds and standby letters of credit representing contingent guarantees of performance under
self-insurance and other programs totaled $75.0 million. These commitments would only be drawn
upon if VF were to fail to meet its claims obligations.

The fair value of VF’s long-term debt was estimated based on quoted market prices or values
of comparable borrowings. The fair value of the Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock was based on
the underlying value of the VF Common Stock issuable upon conversion. The carrying amounts of cash
and equivalents, accounts receivable,

F - 41

marketable securities, life insurance contracts, short-term borrowings and foreign currency
exchange contracts approximates their fair value.

VF monitors net foreign currency exposures and may enter into foreign currency forward exchange
contracts with highly credited financial institutions. These contracts hedge against the effects
of exchange rate fluctuations on anticipated cash flows relating to a portion of VF’s foreign
currency cash flows for inventory purchases and production costs, product sales and intercompany
royalty payments anticipated for the following 12 months. Other contracts hedge against the
effects of exchange rate fluctuations on specific foreign currency transactions, primarily
intercompany financing arrangements. Use of hedging contracts allows VF to reduce its overall
exposure to exchange rate movements since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses
and gains on the transactions being hedged. All foreign currency contracts are reviewed on a
regular basis to ensure that each contract is effective in hedging the intended exposure, and
financial institution counterparties are monitored for their credit worthiness.

The following summarizes, by major currency, the contractual amounts of VF’s foreign currency
forward exchange contracts, translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at the reporting
date. The “bought” amounts represent the net U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to purchase
foreign currencies, and the “sold” amounts represent the net U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments
to sell foreign currencies. The contracts, all of which mature in less than one year, are reported
at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with the net unrealized gain for an individual
counterparty included in Current Assets and the net unrealized loss included in Current
Liabilities.

For foreign currency hedging contracts that have settled, VF recognized net pretax gains of
$1.7 million and $2.9 million during 2006 and 2005, respectively, and net pretax losses of $8.8
million during 2004, primarily in Cost of Goods Sold in the Consolidated Statements of Income. At
the end of 2006, net pretax gains of less than $0.1 million were deferred in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income. These net deferred gains will be reclassified into Net Income during 2007 at
the time the underlying hedged transactions are recognized in earnings. Hedge ineffectiveness was
not significant in any period.

VF may also enter into derivative financial instrument contracts to hedge interest rate risks. VF
entered into a contract to hedge the interest rate risk for a notional amount of $150.0 million
shortly before the issuance of $300.0 million of long-term debt in 2003. This contract was settled
concurrent with the issuance of the debt, with the gain of $3.5 million deferred in Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income. As a result of the deferred gain, VF recognized $0.1 million during
each of 2006, 2005 and 2004 as a reduction of Interest Expense. At the end of 2006, a pretax gain
of $3.1 million was deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which will be reclassified
into earnings over the remaining term of the notes.
