PART I

Item 1.

Business.

V.F. Corporation, organized in 1899, is a worldwide leader in
    branded lifestyle apparel and related products. Unless the
    context indicates otherwise, the terms “VF,”
    “we,” “us” and “our” used herein
    refer to V.F. Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. Our
    stated vision is: VF will grow by building lifestyle brands that
    excite consumers around the world.

For over 100 years, VF has grown by offering consumers high
    quality, high value branded apparel and related products. Since
    2004, we have been implementing a strategy that is transforming
    VF’s mix of business to include more lifestyle brands.
    Lifestyle brands are those brands that connect closely with
    consumers because they are aspirational and inspirational; they
    reflect consumers’ specific activities and interests.
    Lifestyle brands generally extend across multiple product
    categories and have higher than average gross margins.
    Accordingly, this transformation has included the acquisitions
    of many lifestyle brands in recent years, including

and

    Moss

®

.

    At the same time, we have continued to support all of our
    businesses through product line extensions, geographic
    expansion, retail store openings, product innovation, consumer
    research and marketing.

VF is a highly diversified apparel company — across
    brands, product categories, channels of distribution and
    geographies. VF owns a broad portfolio of brands in the
    jeanswear, outerwear, packs, luggage, footwear, sportswear,
    occupational and performance apparel categories. These products
    are marketed to consumers shopping in specialty stores, upscale
    and traditional department stores, national chains and mass
    merchants. A growing portion of our revenues, currently 18%, is
    derived from sales to consumers through VF-operated stores and
    internet sites. VF derives 30% of its revenues from outside the
    United States, primarily in Europe, Asia, Canada and Latin
    America. VF products are also sold in many countries through
    independent licensees and distributors. To provide our products
    across multiple channels of distribution in different geographic
    areas, we balance efficient and flexible internally-owned
    manufacturing with sourcing finished goods from independent
    contractors. We utilize

state-of-the-art

technologies for inventory replenishment that enable us to
    effectively and efficiently get the right assortment of products
    which match consumer demand to our customers’ shelves.

VF’s businesses are organized primarily into product
    categories, and by brands within those categories, for both
    management and internal financial reporting purposes. These
    groupings of businesses are called “coalitions” and
    consist of the following: Outdoor & Action Sports,
    Jeanswear, Imagewear, Sportswear and Contemporary Brands. These
    coalitions are our reportable segments for financial reporting
    purposes. Coalition management has responsibility to build their
    brands, with certain financial, administrative and systems
    support and disciplines provided by central functions within VF.

We consider our Outdoor & Action Sports, Sportswear
    and Contemporary Brands coalitions to be our lifestyle
    coalitions, which have the potential to achieve higher long-term
    revenue, profit growth and profit margins than our other
    businesses. Our Jeanswear and Imagewear coalitions are our
    heritage businesses which have historically strong levels of
    profitability and cash flows but lower revenue growth rates.



The following table summarizes VF’s primary owned and
    licensed brands by coalition:

Outdoor &
    Action Sports Coalition

Our Outdoor & Action Sports Coalition, VF’s
    fastest growing business, is a group of authentic lifestyle
    brands which are outdoor and activity-based. Product offerings
    include outerwear, performance wear, sportswear, footwear,
    equipment, backpacks, luggage and accessories.

The North
    Face

®

is the largest brand in our Outdoor & Action Sports
    Coalition. Its high performance outdoor apparel, equipment and
    footwear are sold around the world. (In Japan and South Korea,

The North
    Face

®

trademarks are owned by a third party.)

The North
    Face

®

apparel lines consist of performance wear, outerwear, snow
    sports gear, functional sportswear and footwear for men, women
    and children. Its equipment line consists of tents, sleeping
    bags, backpacks and accessories. Many of

The North
    Face

®

products are designed for extreme applications, such as high
    altitude mountaineering and ice and rock climbing, although many
    consumers purchase these products because they represent a
    lifestyle to which they aspire.

The North
    Face

®

products are marketed



through specialty outdoor and premium sporting goods stores in
    the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia and select department
    stores in the United States. In addition, these products are
    sold through over 60 VF-operated full price and outlet stores in
    the United States and Europe and online at www.thenorthface.com.
    The brand is also sold through agents, distributors, and over

The North
    Face

®

stores operated by independent third parties outside the United
    States.

VF manufactures and markets

Vans

®

performance and casual footwear and apparel for skateboard,
    bicycle motocross (“BMX”), surf and snow sports
    participants and enthusiasts. Products are sold on a wholesale
    basis through national chain stores in the United States and
    through skate and surf shops and specialty stores in the United
    States, Canada, Europe and Asia. The brand’s products are
    also sold through over 270 owned

Vans

®

full-price and outlet stores in the United States and in key
    European markets. These retail stores carry a wide variety of

Vans

®

footwear, along with a growing assortment of apparel and
    accessory items. In 2010, we completed the acquisition of our
    former 50% owned joint venture that markets the

Vans

®

brand in Mexico. VF is the 70% owner of the

Vans Warped
    Tour

®

music festival, which presents over 40 punk rock bands in
    performances in over 40 cities across North America each
    summer as well as online at www.vans.com.

JanSport

®

backpacks, duffel bags, luggage and accessories are sold through
    department, office supply and national chain stores, as well as
    sports specialty stores and college bookstores in the United
    States.

JanSport

®

backpacks have a leading market share in the United States. A
    technical line of

JanSport

®

backpacks is sold through outdoor and sporting goods stores.

JanSport

®

fleece and T-shirts imprinted with college logos are sold
    through college bookstores and sporting goods stores in the
    United States. In Europe,

Eastpak

®

and

JanSport

®

backpacks, travel bags, luggage, and a line of

Eastpak

®

clothing are sold primarily through department and specialty
    stores.

Eastpak

®

is one of the leading backpack brands in Europe. The

JanSport

®

and

Eastpak

®

brands are also marketed throughout Asia by licensees and
    distributors.

Eagle
    Creek

®

adventure travel gear products include luggage, backpacks and
    accessories sold through specialty luggage stores, outdoor
    stores and department stores throughout the United States and
    Europe.

Kipling

®

handbags, shoulder bags, backpacks, luggage and accessories are
    stylish, colorful and fun products that are both practical and
    durable. The brand name comes from the author of

The Jungle
    Book

, Rudyard Kipling, and that provides the connection to
    the

Kipling

®

monkey mascot, which symbolizes fun and adventure. A colorful
    monkey key ring is attached to every bag, with a different
    monkey design for each product collection. Products are sold
    through specialty and department stores in Europe, Asia and
    South America, as well as through over 40 VF-operated and over
    175 independently-operated stores and at www.kipling.com. The

Kipling

®

business in North America is managed as part of the Sportswear
    Coalition.

Derived from the Finnish word for Arctic Circle, the

Napapijri

®

brand offers premium-priced performance skiwear and
    outdoor-inspired casual outerwear, sportswear and accessories
    for men, women and children. The

Napapijri

®

brand enjoys especially strong consumer awareness in Italy,
    where it was created, and is expanding across Europe. Products
    are sold on a wholesale basis primarily to European specialty
    shops, and through VF-operated and independently-operated stores
    in several countries in Europe. The

Napapijri

®

brand is marketed through a majority-owned joint venture in
    Japan.

The

Reef

®

brand of surf-inspired products includes sandals, shoes,
    swimwear and other casual apparel and accessories for men, women
    and children. Products are marketed primarily to surf shops,
    sporting goods and specialty chains, and department stores in
    the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. In recent years, we
    have expanded the

Reef

®

brand’s presence by acquiring rights previously held by
    independent distributors to market

Reef

®

products in Europe, Canada and the Caribbean.

The

lucy

®

brand is an authentic women’s activewear brand designed for
    style, performance and fit that can be worn by today’s
    active woman from workout to weekend.

lucy

®

apparel is sold in 65

lucy

®

branded stores across the United States and via the internet at
    www.lucy.com. The

lucy

®

stores emphasize the brand’s four core types of
    activity-based apparel — yoga, gym, running and
    exploration.

We expect continued long-term growth in our Outdoor &
    Action Sports Coalition as we extend our brands into new product
    categories, open additional stores, expand geographically, and
    acquire additional outdoor or activity-based lifestyle brands.



Jeanswear
    Coalition

Our Jeanswear Coalition markets jeanswear and related casual
    products in the United States and in many international markets.
    The largest of these brands, the

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

brands, have long-standing traditions as authentic American
    jeans brands as they were established in 1889 and 1947,
    respectively, and have strong market positions.

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

products are sold in nearly every developed country through a
    combination of wholesale accounts, owned stores and online
    through our brands’ websites. Products also include shorts,
    casual pants, knit and woven tops and outerwear, which are
    designed to complement the jeanswear products and extend our
    brands.

In domestic markets,

Lee

®

products are sold primarily through mid-tier department stores
    and specialty stores.

Wrangler

®

westernwear is marketed through western specialty stores. The

Wrangler

®

,

Rustler

®

and

Riders

®

brands are marketed to mass merchant and regional discount
    stores. Based on available data, we believe our key brands have
    been gaining market share despite significant competitive
    activity in all channels where they are distributed. Including
    all of our jeanswear brands, we believe VF has the largest unit
    market share of jeans in the United States and is one of the
    largest marketers of jeans in the world. We also market cotton
    casual pants under the

Lee
    Casuals

®

,

Timber Creek by
    Wrangler

®

and

Wrangler

®

brands.

Our vendor-managed inventory and retail floor space management
    programs with several of our major retailer customers give us a
    competitive advantage in our domestic jeanswear business. We
    receive

point-of-sale

information from these customers on a daily basis, at an
    individual store and style-size-color stockkeeping unit
    (“SKU”) level. We then ship products based on that
    customer data to ensure their selling floors are appropriately
    stocked with products that match their shoppers’ needs. Our
    systems capabilities allow us to analyze our retail
    customer’s sales, demographic and geographic data to
    develop product assortment recommendations that maximize the
    productivity of their jeanswear selling space and minimize their
    investment in inventory.

Jeanswear in most international markets is more fashion-oriented
    and has a higher selling price than similar products in the
    United States. The international jeans market is also more
    fragmented than the United States market, with competitors
    ranging from global brands to a number of smaller brands
    marketed in a specific country or region.

VF’s largest international jeanswear business is located in
    Western Europe.

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

jeanswear products are sold through department stores and
    specialty stores where we employ some of the same retail floor
    space management programs described above. We also market

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

products to mass market and specialty stores in Canada and
    Mexico, as well as to department stores and specialty stores in
    Asia and South America. In many international markets, we are
    expanding our reach through VF-operated stores, which are an
    important vehicle for presenting our brands’ image and
    marketing message directly to consumers. We are continuing to
    expand our jeanswear brands in emerging markets, and have
    experienced significant growth in China and India. In foreign
    markets where VF does not have owned operations,

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

products are marketed through distributors, agents or licensees.

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

products are sold in over 600 independently operated mono or
    multibrand stores primarily in Eastern Europe and Asia.

In the United States, we believe our Jeanswear Coalition is
    growing its jeans market share in the mass market, westernwear
    specialty, and national chain channels of distribution through
    superior consumer insight and marketing strategies and
    continuous product innovation. Internationally, growth will be
    driven by expansion of our existing businesses in Asia where we
    have averaged in excess of 21% revenue growth per year over the
    last three years, with India showing a revenue growth of 64% in
    2010.

Imagewear
    Coalition

Our Imagewear Coalition consists of the Image (occupational
    apparel and uniforms) and Licensed Sports (owned and licensed
    high profile sports and lifestyle apparel) businesses. Each
    business represents approximately one-half of coalition revenues.

The Image business provides uniforms and career occupational
    apparel for workers in North America and internationally, under
    the

Red
    Kap

®

brand (a premium workwear brand with more than 75 years of
    history), the

Bulwark

®

brand (flame resistant and protective apparel primarily for the
    petrochemical, utility and mining industries), the

Horace
    Small

®

brand (apparel for law enforcement and public safety personnel)
    and the

Chef



Designs

tm

brand (apparel for restaurant and food service staff). Products
    include work pants, slacks, work shirts, overalls, jackets and
    smocks. Image revenues are significantly affected by the overall
    level of U.S. industrial and service employment, which
    improved slightly in 2010 following two years of economic
    contraction. Approximately two-thirds of our Image revenues are
    from industrial laundries, resellers and distributors that in
    turn supply customized workwear to employers for

on-the-job

wear by production, service and white-collar personnel. Since
    industrial laundries and uniform distributors maintain minimal
    inventories of work clothes, VF’s ability to offer rapid
    delivery of products in a broad range of sizes is an important
    advantage in this market. Our commitment to customer service,
    supported by an automated central distribution center with
    several satellite locations, enables customer orders to be
    filled within 24 to 48 hours of receipt and has helped the

Red
    Kap

®

and

Bulwark

®

brands obtain a significant share of uniform apparel sold to
    laundries, resellers and other distributors.

Our Image business also develops and manages uniform programs
    through custom-designed websites for major business customers
    (e.g., FedEx Corporation, AT&T, Air Canada, Continental
    Airlines, American Airlines) and governmental organizations
    (e.g., U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Fire Department
    of New York City, Transportation Security Administration,
    National Park Service, New York City Transit Authority). These
    websites give these customers’ employees the convenience of
    shopping for their work and career apparel via the internet. We
    believe this business is the nation’s largest supplier of
    nonmilitary apparel to the U.S. government.

In the Licensed Sports business, we design and market sports
    apparel and fanwear under licenses granted by the major sports
    leagues, individual athletes and related organizations,
    including Major League Baseball, the National Football League,
    the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League,
    MLB Players Association, and selected major colleges and
    universities. Under license from Major League Baseball,

Majestic

®

brand uniforms are worn exclusively on-field by all 30 major
    league teams.

Majestic

®

brand adult and youth-size authentic, replica jersey and fanwear
    are sold through sporting goods and athletic specialty stores,
    department stores and major league stadiums. Adult and youth
    sports apparel products marketed under other licensed labels are
    distributed through department, mass market, sporting goods and
    athletic specialty stores. Our quick response capabilities allow
    us to deliver products to retailers within hours following major
    sporting events such as the Super Bowl, the World Series, and
    conference or division playoff championships. During the year,
    we extended our license agreement with the National Football
    League for an additional five year period to 2017 and also added
    apparel rights for the Canadian, European and Asian markets
    beginning in 2012. In addition, the Licensed Sports division is
    a major supplier of licensed

Harley-Davidson

®

apparel marketed to Harley-Davidson dealerships.

The opportunities to grow our Imagewear Coalition revenues
    include (i) extension of its product and service
    capabilities to new industrial and service apparel distribution
    channels, markets, and geographies, (ii) growth of our
    Major League Baseball and National Football League programs,
    (iii) market share gains in key licensed categories such as
    women’s sports apparel, (iv) expansion of our college
    and university fanware program, and (v) extension of
    VF’s floor space management and quick response retail
    replenishment capabilities to more retail doors, placing the
    right product assortments on the sales floor in each geographic
    market.

Sportswear
    Coalition

The

Nautica

®

brand is the primary lifestyle brand in the Sportswear
    Coalition.

Nautica

®

men’s sportswear, noted for its classic styling, is
    marketed through department stores, specialty stores and
    VF-operated outlet stores in premium and better outlet centers.
    The

Nautica Jeans
    Company

®

line features jeanswear and related tops for younger male
    consumers. We believe the

Nautica

®

brand is the number two men’s sportswear collection brand
    in department stores. Other

Nautica

®

product lines include men’s outerwear, underwear and
    swimwear and men’s and women’s sleepwear.

Nautica

®

women’s sportswear is marketed in the United States at most

Nautica

®

outlet stores and at www.nautica.com.

The Sportswear Coalition operates over 90

Nautica

®

outlet stores in premium and better outlet centers across the
    United States. These stores carry

Nautica

®

merchandise for men, women, boys, girls and infants. The
    products sold in the outlet stores are different from the

Nautica

®

styles sold to department and specialty store wholesale
    customers, although the design inspiration and color palette are
    consistent across both lines. These outlet stores also carry

Nautica

®

merchandise from licensees to complete their product assortment.
    The product assortment offered at www.nautica.com includes
    products from both the wholesale and retail lines as well as
    licensed merchandise. In



addition, independent licensees operate over 200

Nautica

®

brand stores across the world. About 80% of these are full price
    stores and 20% are outlet stores with the majority of these
    stores in southeast Europe, Central America and China.

The

Nautica

®

brand is licensed to independent parties in the United States
    for apparel categories not produced by VF (e.g., tailored
    clothing, dress shirts, neckwear, women’s swimwear and
    outerwear, children’s clothing) and for nonapparel
    categories (e.g., accessories, fragrances, watches, eyewear, bed
    and bath products, furniture).

Nautica

®

products are licensed for sale in over 50 countries outside the
    United States. Our licensees’ annual wholesale sales of

Nautica

®

licensed products are approximately $400 million.

The Sportswear Coalition also includes the

Kipling

®

business in North America whose products include

Kipling

®

brand handbags, luggage, backpacks, totes and accessories.

Kipling

®

has seen significant growth in 2010 from increased distribution,
    two new VF-operated stores, increased sales of its products at
    most existing customers, and a new

Kipling

®

handbags and accessories program during 2010 that is exclusive
    with Macy’s Inc. department stores.

Kipling

®

products are also sold in the United States through specialty
    luggage and bag stores, VF-operated stores and www.kipling.com
    and in Canada through specialty and department stores. About
    two-thirds of brand revenue is generated from products that are
    the same as those sold in Europe and other parts of the world,
    with the remainder designed and sold only in the United States.

We believe there is potential to improve

Nautica

®

brand revenue and profit performance through the growth of core
    Nautica sportswear products, increased pricing, improved product
    assortments and an enhanced customer experience at our

Nautica

®

outlet stores, growth in our online business, and expansion of
    the licensed business internationally. There is also potential
    for expansion of our

Kipling

®

brand through our handbag and accessories relationship with
    Macy’s Inc. as well as the opportunity to open additional
    VF-operated stores.

Contemporary

is a Los Angeles-based brand of premium denim jeans and related
    products for women and men. While the core business remains
    focused on denim, the collection also includes sportswear
    products, such as knit and woven tops, sweaters, jackets and
    accessories. Products are noted for their fit and for innovation
    in design, fabric and finish.

7 For All
    Mankind

®

is a leading premium jeans brand in the United States, with the
    premium segment defined as jeans retailing for $100 or more.
    Retail price points for the brand’s core jeans range from
    $150 — $199 for basics, with higher price points for
    more fashion-forward products. With two-thirds of its sales in
    the United States, the brand is marketed through premium
    department stores, such as Bloomingdale’s, Nordstrom,
    Neiman Marcus, Saks, Macy’s and through specialty stores.
    In addition, we opened 12 stores in the United States during
    2010, bringing the total to 39 stores. International sales are
    through department stores, such as Harrods in London, specialty
    stores, as well as VF-operated stores. We are pursuing growth of
    this brand through new stores,

e-commerce,

additional sportswear product offerings, licensing and
    increasing productivity in the wholesale channel. We are also
    focusing on international growth opportunities, primarily
    through company-operated and partnership stores and further
    geographic expansion in Europe and Asia.

retail locations and online at www.johnvarvatos.com. This
    business is 80% owned by VF, with the balance owned by
    Mr. Varvatos.

In March 2009, VF acquired the

Splendid

brand of women’s, men’s and children’s premium
    tops and casual apparel and

Ella
    Moss

®

brand of women’s premium sportswear. The brands, noted for
    their soft wearable fabrics and vibrant colors, are marketed to
    upscale department and specialty stores primarily in the United
    States. We have four

®

stores, along with

shop-in-shops

in some of our major retail accounts.

The recession significantly impacted sales of premium apparel
    products during 2008 and 2009, as many consumers reduced
    spending for luxury goods. This led to the closing of a
    significant number of specialty stores, as



well as a reduction in same store sales comparisons in the
    upscale department store channel. Although operating results of
    the upscale department stores have improved during 2010 the
    premium denim market remains particularly challenging. Further,
    the specialty store channel has not rebounded to pre-recession
    levels. However, we still see opportunities for growth through
    store openings, e-commerce, and wholesale, geographic and
    product expansion.

Direct-To-Consumer

Operations

VF-operated stores are part of our long-term strategy to drive
    revenue growth and profitability. Our full price stores allow us
    to showcase a brand’s full line of current season products,
    with fixtures and imagery that support the brand’s
    positioning. These stores provide high visibility for our brands
    and products and enable us to stay close to the needs and
    preferences of our consumers. The proper presentation of
    products in our stores, particularly in our showcase stores,
    also helps to increase consumer purchases of VF products sold
    through our wholesale customers. VF-operated full price stores
    generally provide operating margins that are equal to or above
    VF averages and a return on investment well above VF averages.
    In addition, VF operates outlet stores in both premium outlet
    malls and more traditional value-based locations. These outlet
    stores serve an important role in our overall inventory
    management and profitability by allowing VF to sell a
    significant portion of excess, discontinued and

out-of-season

products at better prices than are otherwise available from
    outside parties, while maintaining the integrity of our brands.

Our growing global retail operations include 786 stores at the
    end of 2010. Of that total, there are 711 monobrand stores
    (i.e., primarily one brand’s products offered in each
    store) that sell

Approximately 78% of these stores offer products at full price,
    with the remainder being outlet locations offering excess,
    discontinued and

out-of-season

products at discounted prices. We also operate 75 VF Outlet
    stores in the United States that sell a broad selection of
    excess quantities of VF-branded products, as well as
    women’s intimate apparel, childrenswear, other apparel and
    accessories. Approximately 75% of the VF-operated stores are
    located in the United States, with the remaining stores located
    in Europe, Latin America and Asia.

Across the globe, internet sales (i.e.,

e-commerce)

comprise a small but rapidly growing portion of apparel,
    footwear and accessories sales. At VF, we currently market

Total retail store and

revenues accounted for 18% of VF’s consolidated Total

    overall growth rate as we continue opening stores and expanding
    our

presence. During 2010, we opened 85 stores and are planning to
    open approximately 100 new retail locations in 2011. For 2011,
    retail capital investments of approximately $85 million
    will be concentrated where we see higher growth
    potential —

In addition, our licensees, distributors and other independent
    parties operate over 1,700 partnership stores which are
    primarily monobrand stores that have the appearance of
    VF-operated stores. These stores — most of which are
    in Eastern Europe and Asia — are focused on

Licensing
    Arrangements

As part of our business strategy of expanding market penetration
    of VF-owned brands, we may enter into licensing agreements for
    specific apparel and complementary product categories if such
    arrangements with independent parties can provide more effective
    manufacturing, distribution and marketing of such products than
    could be achieved internally. We provide support to these
    business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand



names by taking an active role in the design, quality control,
    advertising, marketing and distribution of licensed products.

Licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of VF brands.
    License agreements are for fixed terms of generally three to
    five years, with conditional renewal options. Each licensee pays
    royalties to VF based on its sales of licensed products, with
    most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement.
    Royalties generally range from 5% to 7% of the licensing
    partners’ net licensed products sales. Gross Royalty Income
    was $78.0 million in 2010, with the largest contributions
    from the

,

Vans

®

,

The North
    Face

®

,

John
    Varvatos

®

,

®

and

brands. In addition, licensees of our brands are generally
    required to spend from 1% to 5% of their net licensed product
    sales to advertise VF’s products. In some cases, these
    advertising amounts are remitted to VF for advertising on behalf
    of the licensees.

VF has also entered into license agreements to use trademarks
    owned by third parties. We market apparel under licenses granted
    by Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the
    National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League,
    Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Inc., major colleges and
    universities, and individual athletes and related organizations,
    most of which contain minimum annual licensing and advertising
    requirements.

Manufacturing,
    Sourcing and Distribution

Product design, fit, fabric, finish and quality are important in
    all of our businesses. These functions are performed by
    employees located in either our global supply chain organization
    or our branded business units across the globe.

VF’s centralized global supply chain organization sources
    product and is responsible for delivering products to our
    customers. VF is highly skilled in managing the complexities
    associated with the supply chain. VF’s revenues are
    comprised of over 400 million units spread across 30
    brands. VF operates 25 manufacturing facilities and utilizes at
    least 1,500 contractor manufacturing facilities in over 60
    countries. We operate approximately 30 distribution centers and
    786 retail stores. Managing this complexity is made possible by
    our use of information systems technologies — with
    sophisticated systems for product development, forecasting,
    order management and warehouse management, attached to our core
    enterprise resource management platform.

In 2010, 34% of our units were manufactured in VF-owned
    facilities and 66% were obtained from independent contractors,
    primarily in Asia. Products manufactured in VF facilities
    generally have a lower cost and shorter lead times than
    contracted production. Products obtained from contractors in the
    Western Hemisphere generally have a higher cost than products
    obtained from contractors in the Far East. But contracting in
    the Western Hemisphere gives us greater flexibility, shorter
    lead times and allows for lower inventory levels. This
    combination of VF-owned and contracted production, along with
    different geographic regions and cost structures, provides a
    well-balanced approach to product sourcing. We will continue to
    manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as
    needed to changes in the global production environment.

We operate manufacturing facilities (primarily cutting, sewing
    and finishing) located in Mexico, Central America and the Middle
    East. A significant percentage of our denim bottoms and
    occupational apparel are manufactured in these plants. For these
    owned production facilities, we purchase raw materials from
    numerous domestic and international suppliers to meet our
    production needs. Raw materials include fabrics made from
    cotton, synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn, as
    well as thread and trim (product identification, buttons,
    zippers and snaps). In some instances, we contract the sewing of
    VF-owned raw materials into finished product with independent
    contractors in the United States, Mexico and Central America.
    Owned manufacturing in the United States is primarily limited to
    screen printing and embroidery of jerseys, T-shirts and fleece
    products, including Major League Baseball uniforms and other
    products. While we obtain fixed price commitments for fabric and
    certain supplies for up to one year in advance, specific
    purchase obligations with suppliers are typically limited to the
    succeeding two to six months. Our only long-term contract is a
    commitment in connection with the sale of our childrenswear
    business in 2004 to purchase childrenswear for sale through our
    VF Outlet stores, with a minimum of $15.0 million per year
    through 2015. No single supplier represents more than 5% of our
    total cost of sales.

Our independent contractors generally own the raw materials and
    ship finished

ready-for-sale

products to VF. These contractors are engaged through VF
    sourcing hubs in Hong Kong (with satellite offices across Asia)
    and



Panama. These hubs are responsible for product procurement,
    product quality assurance, supplier management, transportation
    and shipping functions in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres,
    respectively. Substantially all products in the
    Outdoor & Action Sports and Sportswear Coalitions, as
    well as a portion of product requirements for our Jeanswear and
    Imagewear Coalitions, are obtained through these sourcing hubs.
    For most products in our Contemporary Brands Coalition, we
    contract the sewing and finishing of VF-owned raw materials
    through a network of independent domestic contractors.

Management continually monitors political risks and developments
    related to duties, tariffs and quotas. We limit VF’s
    sourcing exposure through, among other measures,
    (i) extensive geographic diversification with a mix of
    VF-operated and contracted production, (ii) shifts of
    production among countries and contractors,
    (iii) allocation of production to merchandise categories
    where the free flow of product is available and
    (iv) sourcing from countries with tariff preference and
    free trade agreements. VF does not directly or indirectly source
    products from suppliers in countries identified by the State
    Department as state sponsors of terrorism and subject to
    U.S. economic sanctions and export controls.

All VF-owned production facilities throughout the world, as well
    as all independent contractor facilities that manufacture
    VF-branded products, must comply with VF’s Global
    Compliance Principles. These principles, established in 1997 and
    consistent with international labor standards, are a set of
    strict standards covering legal and ethical business practices,
    workers’ ages, work hours, health and safety conditions,
    environmental standards, and compliance with local laws and
    regulations. In addition, our owned factories must also undergo
    certification by the independent, nonprofit organization,
    Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (“WRAP”),
    which promotes global ethics in manufacturing. VF, through its
    contractor monitoring program, audits the activities of the
    independent businesses and contractors that produce VF-branded
    goods at locations across the globe. Each of the over 1,500
    independent contractor facilities, including those serving our
    independent licensees, must be precertified prior to performance
    of any production on behalf of VF. This precertification
    includes passing a factory inspection and signing a VF Terms of
    Engagement agreement. We maintain an ongoing audit program to
    ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated
    internal and outsourced staff. Additional information about
    VF’s Code of Business Conduct, Global Compliance
    Principles, Terms of Engagement, Factory Compliance Guidelines,
    Factory Audit Procedure and Environmental Compliance Guidelines,
    along with a Global Compliance Report, is available on the VF
    website at www.vfc.com.

VF did not experience difficulty in filling its raw material and
    contracting production needs during 2010. It is possible that we
    could experience some challenges in our supply chain during 2011
    due to increases in demand and pricing for raw materials,
    primarily related to the cost of cotton. Although VF is not
    immune to these pressures, we believe that we will be able to
    retain our competitive advantage due to our scale and
    significance to our suppliers. The loss of any one supplier or
    contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on our
    business.

Product is shipped from our independent suppliers and
    VF-operated manufacturing plants to distribution centers in the
    United States and international markets. In limited instances,
    product is shipped directly to our customers. Product is
    inspected, sorted and stored in our distribution centers until
    needed for packing and shipping to our wholesale customers or
    our stores. Most distribution centers are operated by VF, and
    some support more than one brand. Our distribution centers use
    computer-controlled inventory management technology for
    efficient tracking, moving and shipping of products. A small
    portion of our distribution needs are met by contract
    distribution centers.

Seasonality

VF’s operating results vary from

quarter-to-quarter

throughout the year due to the differing sales patterns of our
    individual businesses. On a quarterly basis and excluding the
    effect of acquisitions, consolidated Total Revenues for 2010
    ranged from a low of 21% of full year revenues in the second
    quarter to a high of 29% in the third quarter, while
    consolidated Operating Income ranged from a low of 17% in the
    second quarter to a high of 35% in the third quarter. This
    variation results primarily from the seasonal influences on
    revenues of our Outdoor & Action Sports Coalition,
    where 18% of the Coalition’s revenues occurred in the
    second quarter and 33% in the third quarter of 2010. With
    changes in our mix of business and growth of our retail
    operations, historical quarterly revenue and



profit trends may not be indicative of future trends. We expect
    the portion of annual revenues and profits occurring in the
    second half of the year to continue to increase.

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working
    capital generally increases during the first half of the year as
    inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then
    decreases during the second half of the year as those
    inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected. Cash
    provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the
    second half of the year due to higher net income during that
    period and reduced working capital requirements, particularly
    during the fourth quarter.

Advertising
    and Customer Support

During 2010, our advertising and promotion spending was
    $426.8 million, representing 5.5% of Net Sales. We
    advertise in consumer and trade publications, on national and
    local radio and television and on the internet. We also
    participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis
    with major retailers in print media, radio and television. We
    sponsor sporting, musical and special events and sponsor a
    number of athletes and personalities. We employ marketing
    sciences to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional
    spending and to identify the types of spending that provide the
    greatest return on our marketing investments.

We provide

point-of-sale

fixtures and signage to our wholesale customers to enhance the
    presentation and brand image of our products. We utilize

shop-in-shops,

which are separate sales areas dedicated to a specific VF brand
    within our customers’ stores, to help differentiate and
    enhance the presentation of our products. We participate in
    concession arrangements with department store customers in China
    and other international markets. In a typical concession
    arrangement, the department store provides a dedicated sales
    area, along with check-out, credit and other retail services,
    while VF owns and bears the risk of inventory ownership.
    Concession sales associates may be employees of VF or the
    department store.

We participate in incentive programs with our retailer
    customers, including discounts, allowances and cooperative
    advertising funds. We also offer sales incentive programs
    directly to consumers in the form of rebate and coupon offers.

We maintain internet sites for most of our brands. Many of them
    are

e-commerce

sites where consumers can order products from VF. Other websites
    provide information about our brands and products and may direct
    consumers to our wholesale customers where they can purchase our
    products. We also operate several

business-to-business

sites where our retail customers can order VF products.

Many of our coalitions employ a staff of in-store marketing and
    merchandising coordinators located in major cities across the
    United States. These individuals visit our customers’
    retail locations to ensure that our products, and those of our
    licensees, are properly presented on the merchandise sales floor
    and to inform the customers’ sales associates about our
    products and related promotions.

In addition to sponsorships and activities that directly benefit
    our products and brands, VF and its associates actively support
    our communities and various charities. For example,

The North
    Face

®

has committed to programs that encourage and enable outdoor
    participation, such as Planet Explore (www.planetexplore.com),
    the Never Stop Exploring Award, and the Explore Your Parks
    program.

Nautica

®

has partnered with Oceana, a

not-for-profit

organization focused on ocean conservation. And 2010 marked the
    fifteenth year of support for

Lee National Denim
    Day

®

,

    one of the country’s largest

single-day

fund-raisers for breast cancer which has raised over
    $80 million to fight breast cancer since inception. VF also
    supports companywide sustainability efforts, and recognizes the
    “VF 100” as a means of honoring the 100 VF associates
    world-wide having the highest number of volunteer service hours
    during the year.



Other
    Matters

Competitive
    Factors

Our business depends on our ability to stimulate consumer demand
    for VF’s brands and products. VF is well-positioned to
    compete in the apparel industry by developing high quality
    innovative products at competitive prices which meet consumer
    needs, providing high service levels, ensuring the right
    products are on the retail sales floor to meet consumer demand,
    and investing significant amounts behind existing brands. We
    continually strive to improve each of these areas. Many of
    VF’s brands have long histories and enjoy high recognition
    within their respective consumer segments.

Trademarks

Trademarks, patents and domain names, as well as related logos,
    designs and graphics, provide substantial value in the marketing
    of VF’s products and are important to our continued
    success. We have registered this intellectual property in the
    United States and in other countries where our products are
    manufactured

and/or

sold.
    We vigorously monitor and enforce VF’s intellectual
    property against counterfeiting, infringement and violations of
    other rights where and to the extent legal, feasible and
    appropriate. In addition, we grant licenses to other parties to
    manufacture and sell products utilizing our intellectual
    property in product categories and geographic areas in which VF
    does not operate.

Customers

VF products are primarily sold through our sales force and
    independent sales agents and distributors. VF’s customers
    are specialty stores, department stores, national chains and
    mass merchants in the United States and in international
    markets. Of our Total Revenues, 30% are in international
    markets, the majority of which are in Europe, and 18% are

direct-to-consumer

through VF-operated stores and

e-commerce

sites (including stores and internet sites in international
    markets).

Sales to VF’s ten largest customers, all of which are
    retailers based in the United States, amounted to 26% of Total
    Revenues in 2010, 27% in 2009 and 26% in 2008. These larger
    customers included (in alphabetical order) Kohl’s
    Corporation, Macy’s, Inc., J.C. Penney Company, Inc., Sears
    Holdings Corporation, Target Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores,
    Inc. Sales to the five largest customers amounted to
    approximately 21% of Total Revenues in 2010, 2009 and 2008.
    Sales to VF’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,
    totaled 10% of Total Revenues in 2010 and 11% in 2009 and 2008,
    the majority of which were in the Jeanswear Coalition.

Employees

VF employed approximately 47,000 men and women at the end of
    2010, of which approximately 20,300 were located in the United
    States. Approximately 680 employees in the United States
    are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In
    international markets, a significant percentage of employees are
    covered by trade-sponsored or governmental bargaining
    arrangements. Employee relations are considered to be good.

Backlog

The dollar amount of VF’s order backlog as of any date is
    not meaningful, may not be indicative of actual future shipments
    and, accordingly, is not material for an understanding of the
    business of VF taken as a whole.



Executive
    Officers of VF

The following are the executive officers of VF Corporation as of
    February 19, 2011. The executive officers are generally
    elected annually and serve at the pleasure of the Board of
    Directors. There is no family relationship among any of the VF
    Corporation executive officers.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

The following risk factors should be read carefully in
    connection with evaluating VF’s business and the
    forward-looking statements contained in this

Form 10-K.

Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect
    VF’s business, its operating results and its financial
    condition.

VF’s
    revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending
    for apparel, which is sensitive to general economic conditions.
    A decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse
    effect on VF.

The apparel industry has historically been subject to cyclical
    variations and is particularly affected by adverse trends in the
    general economy. The success of VF’s business depends on
    consumer spending, and there are a number of factors that
    influence consumer spending, including actual and perceived
    economic conditions, disposable consumer income, interest rates,
    availability of credit, housing costs, stock market performance,
    energy prices and tax rates in the



international, national, regional and local markets where
    VF’s products are sold. Consumer spending advanced at a
    relatively slow pace during 2010 following the recessionary
    conditions of 2008 and early 2009. A decline in actual or
    perceived economic conditions or other factors could negatively
    impact the level of consumer spending.

The
    effects of a return to recessionary conditions could have a
    material adverse effect on VF.

The global recession — with rising unemployment,
    reduced availability of credit, increased savings rates and
    declines in real estate and securities values — had
    and is continuing to have a negative impact on retail sales of
    apparel and other consumer products. Reduced sales at our
    wholesale customers may lead to lower retail inventory levels,
    reduced orders to VF, or order cancellations. These lower sales
    volumes, along with the possibility of restrictions on access to
    the credit markets, may result in our customers experiencing
    financial difficulties including store closures, bankruptcies or
    liquidations. This may result in higher credit risk relating to
    receivables from our customers who are experiencing these
    financial difficulties. If these developments occur, our
    inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on
    VF’s trade accounts receivable could have a material
    adverse effect on VF’s financial condition and results of
    operations.

A growing portion of our revenues are

direct-to-consumer

through VF-operated stores and

e-commerce

websites. It is possible that reduced consumer confidence, along
    with a reduction in availability of consumer credit and
    increasing unemployment, could lead to a reduction in our

direct-to-consumer

sales channel. This could have a material adverse effect on
    VF’s financial condition and results of operations.

Fluctuations
    in the price, availability and quality of raw materials and
    finished goods could increase costs.

Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of fabrics
    or other raw materials used by VF in its manufactured apparel,
    or of purchased finished goods, could have a material adverse
    effect on VF’s cost of sales or its ability to meet its
    customers’ demands. The prices for fabrics depend on demand
    and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them,
    with the price of cotton currently having a significant negative
    impact. The price and availability of such raw materials may
    fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, including
    crop yields, weather patterns and speculation in the commodities
    markets. Prices of purchased finished products also depend on
    wage rates in Asia and other geographic areas where our
    independent contractors are located, as well as freight costs
    from those regions. In the future, VF may not be able to offset
    cost increases with other cost reductions or efficiencies or to
    pass higher costs on to its customers. In addition, increased
    costs could lead to reduced customer demand. These developments
    could have a material adverse effect on VF’s results of
    operations, liquidity and financial condition.

The
    apparel industry is highly competitive, and VF’s success
    depends on its ability to respond to constantly changing fashion
    trends and consumer demand. Reduced sales or prices resulting
    from competition could have a material adverse effect on
    VF.

VF competes with numerous apparel brands and manufacturers. Some
    of our competitors are larger and have more resources than VF in
    some product categories and geographies. In addition, VF
    competes directly with the private label brands of most of its
    wholesale customers. VF’s ability to compete within the
    apparel and footwear industries depends on our ability to:

•

Anticipate and respond to changing consumer trends in a timely
    manner;

•

Develop attractive, high quality products;

•

Maintain strong brand recognition;

•

Price products appropriately;

•

Provide

best-in-class

marketing support and intelligence;

•

Ensure product availability and optimize supply chain
    efficiencies; and

•

Obtain sufficient retail floor space and effectively present our
    products at retail.



If we misjudge fashion trends and market conditions, we could
    have insufficient levels of inventory that cause us to miss
    opportunities to make sales, or we could have significant excess
    inventories of products that we may have to sell at a loss.
    Failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly
    changing markets and trends could have a material adverse effect
    on VF’s business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

VF’s
    results of operations could be materially harmed if we are
    unable to accurately forecast demand for our
    products.

We often schedule internal production and place orders for
    products with independent manufacturers before our
    customers’ orders are firm. Factors that could affect our
    ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include:

•

An increase or decrease in consumer demand for VF’s
    products or for products of its competitors;

•

Our failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance of new
    products;

•

New product introductions by competitors;

•

Unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other
    factors, which result in cancellations of orders or a reduction
    or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailers;

•

Weak economic conditions or consumer confidence, which reduce
    demand for VF’s products; and

•

Terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, which adversely
    affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production
    and distribution of products and raw materials.

If we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand, we may
    experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product
    required to meet the demand. Inventory levels in excess of
    consumer demand may result in inventory write-downs and the sale
    of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could have an
    adverse effect on VF’s results of operations and financial
    condition. On the other hand, if we underestimate demand for our
    products, our manufacturing facilities or third party
    manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet
    consumer requirements, and this could result in delays in the
    shipment of products and lost revenues, as well as damage to
    VF’s reputation and relationships. There can be no
    assurance that we will be able to successfully manage inventory
    levels to meet our future order requirements.

A
    substantial portion of VF’s revenues and gross profit is
    derived from a small number of large customers. The loss of any
    of these customers could substantially reduce VF’s revenues
    and profits.

A few of VF’s customers account for a significant portion
    of revenues. Sales to VF’s ten largest customers were 26%
    of Total Revenues in fiscal 2010, with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
    accounting for 10% of revenues. Sales are generally on a
    purchase order basis, and we do not have long-term agreements
    with any of our customers. A decision by any of VF’s major
    customers to significantly decrease the volume of products
    purchased from VF could substantially reduce revenues and have a
    material adverse effect on VF’s financial condition and
    results of operations. Moreover, in recent years, the retail
    industry has experienced consolidation and other ownership
    changes. In the future, retailers may further consolidate,
    undergo restructurings or reorganizations, realign their
    affiliations or reposition their stores’ target markets.
    These developments could result in a reduction in the number of
    stores that carry VF’s products, increase ownership
    concentration within the retail industry, increase credit
    exposure or increase leverage over their suppliers. These
    changes could impact VF’s opportunities in the market and
    increase VF’s reliance on a smaller number of large
    customers.

VF’s
    profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on
    margins.

The apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure
    caused by many factors, including intense competition,
    consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to
    reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. If
    these factors cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers
    and consumers, and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product
    costs or operating expenses, VF’s profitability will
    decline. This could have a material adverse effect on VF’s
    results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.



VF may
    not succeed in implementing its growth strategy.

One of our key strategic objectives is growth. We seek to grow
    through both organic growth and acquisitions by building new
    growing lifestyle brands, expanding our share with winning
    customers, stretching VF’s brands to new geographies,
    managing costs, leveraging our supply chain and information
    technology capabilities across VF, expanding our

direct-to-consumer

business and identifying and developing high potential
    employees. We may not be able to grow our existing businesses.
    We may have difficulty completing acquisitions, and we may not
    be able to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or
    achieve the expected growth, cost savings or synergies from such
    integration. We may not be able to expand our market share with
    winning customers, expand our brands geographically or achieve
    the expected results from our supply chain initiatives. We may
    also have difficulty recruiting or developing qualified
    employees. Failure to implement our growth strategy may have a
    material adverse effect on VF’s business.

VF’s
    operations in international markets, and earnings in those
    markets, may be affected by legal, regulatory, political and
    economic risks.

Our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our
    existing international markets and to capitalize on growth in
    existing and new international markets is subject to risks
    associated with international operations. These include the
    burdens of complying with foreign laws and regulations,
    unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, new tariffs or
    other barriers in some international markets.

We cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes, exchange
    controls or other restrictions will be imposed by the United
    States, the European Union or other countries on the import or
    export of our products, or what effect any of these actions
    would have on VF’s business, financial condition or results
    of operations. We cannot predict whether there might be changes
    in our ability to repatriate earnings or capital from
    international jurisdictions. Changes in regulatory, geopolitical
    policies and other factors may adversely affect VF’s
    business or may require us to modify our current business
    practices.

Approximately 40% of VF’s net income is earned in
    international jurisdictions. VF is exposed to risks of changes
    in U.S. policy for companies having business operations
    outside the United States. The President and others in his
    Administration have proposed changes in U.S. income tax
    laws that could, among other things, accelerate the
    U.S. taxability of

non-U.S. earnings

or limit foreign tax credits. Although such proposals have been
    deferred, if new legislation were enacted, it is possible our
    U.S. income tax expense could increase, which would reduce
    our earnings.

VF
    uses foreign suppliers and manufacturing facilities for a
    substantial portion of its raw materials and finished products,
    which poses risks to VF’s business
    operations.

During fiscal 2010, approximately 66% of VF’s units were
    purchased from independent manufacturers primarily located in
    Asia, with substantially all of the remainder produced by
    VF-owned and operated manufacturing facilities located in
    Mexico, Central America and the Middle East. Although no single
    supplier and no one country is critical to VF’s production
    needs, any of the following could impact our ability to produce
    or deliver VF products and, as a result, have a material adverse
    effect on VF’s business, financial condition and results of
    operations:

•

Political or labor instability in countries where VF’s
    facilities, contractors and suppliers are located;

•

Political or military conflict could cause a delay in the
    transportation of raw materials and products to VF and an
    increase in transportation costs;

•

Heightened terrorism security concerns could subject imported or
    exported goods to additional, more frequent or more lengthy
    inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of
    goods for extended periods;

•

Decreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods,
    leading to more counterfeit goods and reduced sales of VF
    products, increased costs for VF’s anticounterfeiting
    measures and damage to the reputation of its brands;



•

Disease epidemics and health-related concerns, such as the H1N1
    virus, bird flu, SARS, mad cow and

hoof-and-mouth

disease outbreaks in recent years, could result in closed
    factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and
    scrutiny or embargo of VF’s goods produced in infected
    areas;

•

Imposition of regulations and quotas relating to imports and our
    ability to adjust timely to changes in trade regulations could
    limit our ability to produce products in cost-effective
    countries that have the labor and expertise needed;

•

Imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on
    imports; and

•

Imposition or the repeal of laws that affect intellectual
    property rights.

Our
    business is subject to national, state and local laws and
    regulations for environmental, employment, safety and other
    matters. The costs of compliance with, or the violation of, such
    laws and regulations by VF or by independent suppliers who
    manufacture products for VF could have an adverse effect on our
    operations and cash flows.

Numerous governmental agencies enforce comprehensive federal,
    state and local laws and regulations on a wide range of
    environmental, employment, safety and other matters. VF could be
    adversely affected by costs of compliance with or violations of
    those laws and regulations. In addition, the costs of products
    purchased by VF from independent contractors could increase due
    to the costs of compliance by those contractors. Further,
    violations of such laws and regulations could affect the
    availability of inventory, affecting our net sales.

If
    VF’s suppliers fail to use acceptable ethical business
    practices, VF’s business could suffer.

We require third party suppliers to operate in compliance with
    applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working
    conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance.
    However, we do not control the practices of our independent
    manufacturers. If one of our independent contractors violates
    labor or other laws or implements labor or other business
    practices that are generally regarded as unethical in the United
    States, it could impact VF’s reputation and relationships.
    Although the loss of a single supplier would not have a
    significant impact on our operations, it could result in
    interruption of finished goods shipments to VF, cancellation of
    orders by customers, and termination of relationships. This,
    along with the damage to our reputation, could have a material
    adverse effect on VF’s revenues and, consequently, its
    results of operations.

VF’s
    business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange
    rate fluctuations. VF’s hedging strategies may not be
    effective in mitigating those risks.

Approximately 30% of VF’s Total Revenues is derived from
    international markets. VF’s foreign businesses operate in
    functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes
    in currency exchange rates may affect the U.S. dollar value
    of the foreign currency-denominated amounts at which VF’s
    international businesses purchase products, incur costs or sell
    products. In addition, for VF’s

U.S.-based

businesses, the majority of products are sourced from
    independent contractors or VF plants located in foreign
    countries. As a result, the cost of these products may be
    affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies.
    Furthermore, much of VF’s licensing revenue is derived from
    sales in foreign currencies. Changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates could have an adverse impact on VF’s
    financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In accordance with our operating practices, we hedge a
    significant portion of our foreign currency transaction
    exposures arising in the ordinary course of business to reduce
    risks in our cash flows and earnings. Our hedging strategies may
    not be effective in reducing these risks, and no hedging
    strategy can completely insulate VF from foreign exchange risk.
    We do not hedge foreign currency translation rate changes.

Further, our use of derivative financial instruments may expose
    VF to counterparty risks. Although VF only enters into hedging
    contracts with counterparties having investment grade credit
    ratings, it is possible that the credit quality of a
    counterparty could be downgraded or a counterparty could default
    on its obligations, which could have a material adverse impact
    on VF’s financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.



VF
    borrows funds on a short-term basis, primarily to support
    seasonal working capital requirements. Long-term debt is part of
    VF’s total capital structure. Because of conditions in
    global credit markets, VF may have difficulty accessing capital
    markets for short or long-term financing.

Particularly in 2008 and continuing to a lesser extent during
    the last two years, global capital and credit markets have
    experienced extreme volatility and disruption, with government
    intervention, mergers or bankruptcies of several major financial
    institutions, and a general decline in global liquidity. Many
    corporate issuers have been unable to access credit markets.

We typically use short-term commercial paper borrowings to
    support seasonal working capital requirements, with amounts
    generally repaid by the end of each year from strong cash flows
    from operations. VF was able to continue to borrow in the
    commercial paper markets during the last three years, and our
    commercial paper borrowings in 2010 were minimal. In the future,
    VF may seek to access the long-term capital markets to replace
    maturing debt obligations or to fund acquisition or other growth
    opportunities. There is no assurance that the commercial paper
    markets or the long-term capital markets will continue to be
    reliable sources of financing for VF.

VF has
    domestic and international bank credit facilities. One or more
    of the participating banks may not be able to honor their
    commitments, which could have an adverse effect on VF’s
    business.

VF has $1.3 billion of domestic and international bank
    credit facilities that expire in October 2012. If the financial
    markets return to recessionary conditions, this could impair the
    ability of one or more of the banks participating in our credit
    agreements from honoring their commitments. This could have an
    adverse effect on our business if we were not able to replace
    those commitments or to locate other sources of liquidity on
    acceptable terms.

The
    loss of members of VF’s executive management and other key
    employees could have a material adverse effect on its
    business.

VF depends on the services and management experience of its
    executive officers and business leaders who have substantial
    experience and expertise in VF’s business. VF also depends
    on other key employees involved in the operation of its
    business. Competition for experienced and well-qualified
    personnel in the apparel industry is intense. The unexpected
    loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have
    a material adverse effect on VF.

VF may
    be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual
    property rights.

VF’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are
    important to its success and its competitive position. VF is
    susceptible to others imitating its products and infringing its
    intellectual property rights especially with the shift in
    product mix to higher priced brands and innovative new products
    in recent years. Some of VF’s brands, such as

The North
    Face

®

,

Vans

®

,

JanSport

®

,

Nautica

®

,

Wrangler

®

and

Lee

®

brands, enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition, and
    the higher pricing of those products creates additional risk of
    counterfeiting and infringement.

Counterfeiting of VF’s products or infringement on its
    intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our
    brands and adversely affect VF’s revenues. Actions we have
    taken to establish and protect VF’s intellectual property
    rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of its products
    by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its
    trademarks or block sales of VF’s products as a violation
    of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others. In
    addition, unilateral actions in the United States or other
    countries, including changes to or the repeal of laws
    recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights,
    could have an impact on VF’s ability to enforce those
    rights.

The value of VF’s intellectual property could diminish if
    others assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other
    intellectual property rights of VF, or trademarks that are
    similar to VF’s trademarks, or trademarks that VF licenses
    from others. We may be unable to successfully resolve these
    types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, there may
    be trademark owners who have prior rights to VF’s
    trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not
    protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do
    the laws of the United States. In other



cases, there may be holders who have prior rights to similar
    trademarks. VF is from time to time involved in opposition and
    cancellation proceedings with respect to some of its
    intellectual property rights.

VF is
    subject to the risk that its licensees may not generate expected
    sales or maintain the value of VF’s brands.

During 2010, $78.0 million of VF’s revenues were
    derived from licensing royalties. Although VF generally has
    significant control over its licensees’ products and
    advertising, we rely on our licensees for, among other things,
    operational and financial controls over their businesses.
    Failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed
    products or our inability to replace existing licensees, if
    necessary, could adversely affect VF’s revenues, both
    directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from
    reduced sales of our other products. Risks are also associated
    with a licensee’s ability to:

•

Obtain capital;

•

Manage its labor relations;

•

Maintain relationships with its suppliers;

•

Manage its credit risk effectively; and

•

Maintain relationships with its customers.

In addition, VF relies on its licensees to help preserve the
    value of its brands. Although we make every attempt to protect
    VF’s brands through approval rights over design, production
    processes, quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution,
    advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot
    completely control the use of licensed VF brands by our
    licensees. The misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a
    material adverse effect on that brand and on VF.

VF has
    entered into license agreements to use the trademarks of others.
    Loss of a license could have an adverse effect on VF’s
    operating results.

VF has entered into agreements to market products under licenses
    granted by third parties, including Major League Baseball, the
    National Football League and Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Inc.
    Some of these licenses are for a short term and do not contain
    renewal options. Loss of a license, which in certain cases could
    result in an impairment charge for related operating and
    intangible assets, could have an adverse effect on VF’s
    operating results.

VF
    relies significantly on information technology. Any inadequacy,
    interruption, integration failure or security failure of that
    technology could harm VF’s ability to effectively operate
    its business.

Our ability to effectively manage and operate our business
    depends significantly on information technology systems. The
    failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with
    transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, difficulty in
    integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses, or a
    breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the
    operations of VF’s business. Moreover, VF and its customers
    could suffer harm if customer information were accessed by third
    parties due to a security failure in VF’s systems. It could
    also require significant expenditures to remediate any such
    failure, problem or breach.

If VF
    encounters problems with its distribution system, VF’s
    ability to deliver its products to the market could be adversely
    affected.

VF relies on owned or independently-operated distribution
    facilities to warehouse and ship product to its customers.
    VF’s distribution system includes computer-controlled and
    automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks
    related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of
    software and hardware, power interruptions or other system
    failures. Because substantially all of VF’s products are
    distributed from a relatively small number of locations,
    VF’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes,
    floods, fires or other natural disasters near its distribution
    centers. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may
    not adequately protect VF from the adverse effects that could be
    caused by significant disruptions in VF’s distribution
    facilities, such as the



long-term loss of customers or an erosion of brand image. In
    addition, VF’s distribution capacity is dependent on the
    timely performance of services by third parties, including the
    transportation of product to and from its distribution
    facilities. If we encounter problems with our distribution
    system, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage
    inventory, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies
    could be materially adversely affected.

VF’s
    balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets
    and goodwill. A decline in the fair value of an intangible asset
    or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment
    charge, which would be recorded as an operating expense in
    VF’s Consolidated Statement of Income and could be
    material.

We evaluate goodwill and trademark intangible assets that are
    not amortized for possible impairment at least annually. In
    addition, intangible assets that are being amortized are tested
    for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that
    their carrying value might not be recoverable. For these
    impairment tests, we use various valuation methods to estimate
    the fair value of our business units and intangible assets. If
    the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value, we
    would recognize an impairment charge for the difference. During
    2010 and 2009, we recognized goodwill and intangible asset
    impairment charges totaling $201.7 million and
    $122.0 million, respectively.

At December 2010, VF had indefinite-lived intangible assets of
    approximately $1.0 billion related to trademarks and
    $1.2 billion of goodwill on its balance sheet. In addition,
    VF had approximately $0.5 billion of intangible assets that
    are being amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets combined
    represent 41% of VF’s Total Assets and 69% of
    Stockholders’ Equity.

It is possible that we could have an impairment charge for
    goodwill or trademark intangible assets in future periods if
    (i) overall economic conditions in 2011 or future years
    vary from our current assumptions, (ii) business conditions
    or our strategies for a specific business unit change from our
    current assumptions, (iii) investors require higher rates
    of return on equity investments in the marketplace or
    (iv) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded
    companies, or of actual sales transactions of comparable
    companies, were to decline, resulting in lower comparable
    multiples of revenues and EBITDA and, accordingly, lower implied
    values of goodwill and intangible assets. A future impairment
    charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material
    effect on our consolidated financial position or results of
    operations.

VF’s
    defined benefit pension plans were underfunded at the end of
    2010.

VF’s defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by
    $207.4 million at the end of 2010. This underfunding
    resulted from the decline in market value of the qualified
    plans’ investment portfolios resulting from the global
    financial and credit crisis that began near the end of 2007 and
    a reduction in the discount rate used to determine the present
    value of the plans’ projected benefit obligations.
    Differences between actual results and amounts estimated using
    actuarial assumptions (e.g., investment returns, discount rate,
    mortality) are deferred and amortized as part of future
    years’ pension cost. Deferred actuarial losses included in
    Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Stockholders’
    Equity totaled $415.2 million at December 2010. Primarily
    because of the amortization of these deferred actuarial losses,
    our pension cost was $67.6 million in 2010 and
    $98.0 million in 2009, a sharp increase from
    $10.8 million in 2008. We made $100 million of
    discretionary contributions to our pension plans during 2010 and
    $200 million in 2009, which increased the funded status of
    our pension plans to 85% at the end of 2010.

A further decrease in the value of our pension plans’
    assets or a decrease in the discount rate used to value the
    plans’ liabilities to participants could result in a
    further decrease in the plans’ funded status. In that case,
    VF would recognize additional pension liabilities and additional
    charges to Stockholders’ Equity in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet and higher pension expense in future years. Further, VF
    could be required to make additional cash funding contributions
    to return the funded status of the pension plans to a higher
    level over the next few years.

Properties.

VF owns certain facilities used in manufacturing and
    distribution activities and leases a distribution center under a
    capital lease. Other facilities are leased under operating
    leases that generally contain renewal options. We believe all
    facilities and machinery and equipment are in good condition and
    are suitable for VF’s needs. Manufacturing, distribution
    and administrative facilities being utilized at the end of 2010
    are summarized below by reportable segment:

    facilities. The remainder represents administrative and showroom
    facilities.

In addition to the above, VF owns or leases retail locations
    totaling 6,200,000 square feet. VF also leases
    500,000 square feet of space that was formerly used in its
    operations but is now subleased to a third party through the end
    of the lease term.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

Overview

VF Corporation is a worldwide leader in branded lifestyle
    apparel and related products. Management’s vision is to
    grow VF by building leading lifestyle brands that excite
    consumers around the world. Lifestyle brands, representative of
    the activities that consumers aspire to, generally extend across
    multiple geographic markets and product categories and therefore
    have greater opportunities for growth.

VF owns a diverse portfolio of brands with strong market
    positions in many consumer product categories. In addition, we
    market occupational apparel to resellers and major corporate and
    governmental customers. VF has a broad customer base, with
    products distributed through leading specialty stores, upscale
    and traditional department stores, national chains and mass
    merchants, plus

direct-to-consumer

channels.

VF’s businesses are grouped by product categories, and by
    brands within those product categories, for internal financial
    reporting used by management. These groupings of businesses
    within VF are referred to as “coalitions” and are the
    basis for VF’s reportable business segments, as described
    below:

Impact of
    the Current Global Economic Environment

The global recession from late 2007 through mid-2009 was the
    longest and most severe recession in the last several decades.
    This recession, with its

flat-to-falling

consumer income levels, sharp declines in real estate and
    securities markets, volatility in commodity and currency
    markets, significant increases in unemployment, numerous
    retailer and other bankruptcies and unprecedented government
    stimulus programs, led to a decline in consumer spending that
    impacted VF as well as most other companies.

The economic recovery in most developed countries over the last
    18 months has been slow. Consumer spending, representing
    about 70% of the U.S. economy, has advanced slowly during
    this period and has only recently returned to pre-recession
    levels. Some of these headwinds will continue to impact VF and
    our competitors.

In response to the challenging market conditions of the last
    three years, we have been aggressive in controlling our costs
    and operating with lean inventory levels. Our balance sheet,
    cash flows from operations and liquidity have remained strong.
    And we have continued to invest in our brands. During 2010, we
    increased our investments in advertising and product development
    by over $100 million compared with the prior year. These
    investments were



very targeted and were concentrated in our brands having the
    greatest opportunities for growth, including

The North
    Face

®

,

Vans

®

and our businesses in Asia. We will continue this higher level
    of investment spending during 2011, as we believe the strength
    of our brands is fundamental to our success in this economic
    climate.

Highlights
    of 2010

Following are the notable actions and achievements in 2010:

•

Revenues grew to a record $7.7 billion, an increase of 7%
    over the prior year, led by our Outdoor & Action
    Sports businesses. Revenues of

The North
    Face

®

and

Vans

®

rose 18% and 20%, respectively, over the prior year.

•

Our businesses in Asia continued to experience significant
    growth, with revenues up 31% over the prior year.

•

Our

direct-to-consumer

business revenues grew 13% over the prior year and represented
    18% of Total Revenues in 2010. We opened 85 stores during the
    year.

•

Gross margin reached a record level of 46.7%.

•

Marketing spending increased 30% over the prior year as we
    continued to invest in our high growth, highly profitable brands
    and initiatives.

•

Excluding noncash impairment charges related to goodwill and
    intangible assets discussed in the “Analysis of Results of
    Operations” section below, operating income reached a
    record level and was in excess of $1.0 billion. Also,
    excluding these charges, net income of $713.2 million and
    earnings per share of $6.46 per share were each at all-time
    highs. (All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis.)
    References to financial results excluding the impact of the
    impairment charges are non-GAAP measures and addressed below in
    the “Non-GAAP Financial Information” section.

•

Our record $1.0 billion of cash flow from operating
    activities allowed us to increase our cash balance, while
    funding (i) $412 million of repurchases of our Common
    Stock, (ii) $264 million of dividends,
    (iii) $203 million in payments of long-term debt,
    (iv) $150 million of investments in capital
    expenditures and acquisitions and (v) over
    $100 million in contributions to our pension plans.

•

We ended the year with $792 million of cash and
    equivalents. And with our “A minus” investment grade
    credit rating, we continued to have access to capital markets
    and had over $1.3 billion available under bank credit
    agreements.

•

We increased our dividends paid per share for the 38th
    consecutive year.

•

We purchased the remaining 50% equity interest of a joint
    venture that marketed the

Vans

®

brand in Mexico (“Vans Mexico”).

Total Revenues consist of Net Sales of products and Royalty
    Income from licensees. Revenues increased 7% in 2010, led by 14%
    growth in our Outdoor & Action Sports businesses. In
    addition, while not to the same extent, revenues increased in
    most of our other businesses. Revenues declined 6% in 2009, with
    2% of the decline due to foreign currency translation.
    Additional details on revenues are provided in the section
    titled “Information by Business Segment.”

In translating foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar, the
    stronger U.S. dollar in relation to the functional
    currencies of those countries where VF conducts the majority of
    its international business (primarily Europe/euro-based
    countries) negatively impacted revenue by $21 million in
    2010 relative to 2009 and $156 million in 2009 relative to
    2008. The weighted average translation rates for the euro were
    $1.33, $1.39 and $1.47 per euro for 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Approximately 1.3% of the improvement in gross margin percentage
    in 2010 over 2009 was due to (i) a greater percentage of
    our revenues coming from higher gross margin businesses,
    including our

direct-to-consumer

operations, and (ii) other areas of operational
    improvements, including retail and inventory efficiencies. The
    remaining 1.1% improvement resulted from product cost reductions.

The gross margin percentage increased 1.4% in 2009 over 2008
    from the impact of our growing

direct-to-consumer

operations, which have gross margin percentages higher than VF
    averages. In addition, gross margins improved in 2009 due to
    lower levels and improved profitability on disposal of
    distressed inventories. These increases were partially offset by
    lower gross margins in our European jeanswear and imagewear
    businesses. See the “Information by Business Segment”
    section below.

Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses as a percent of
    revenues increased 1.0% in 2010 over 2009 due to increased
    marketing spending in 2010, as discussed above, and 0.4% due to
    higher growth than average in our

direct-to-consumer

business, which has a higher expense ratio than our wholesale
    business. These increases were partially offset by lower
    domestic pension expense, which reduced the ratio by 0.6% in
    2010 compared with 2009.

Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses as a percent of
    revenues increased 1.2% in 2009 over 2008 due to higher domestic
    pension expense and 1.1% due to higher growth than average in
    our

direct-to-consumer

business. The 2009 comparison benefited from (i) the
    absence of charges from cost reduction actions, which increased
    Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses by 0.7% as a
    percent of revenues in 2008, and (ii) the benefit of these
    actions and other spending reductions in 2009.

We completed our annual impairment testing for goodwill and
    indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets in the fourth
    quarter of 2010 in conjunction with finalizing our strategic
    plan. Based on our assessment of current and expected economic
    conditions, trends and forecasted cash flows at each business
    unit, and assumptions representative of those that market
    participants would make in valuing our business units, VF
    management determined that the carrying values of its goodwill
    and trademark intangible asset at its

7 For All
    Mankind

®

business unit exceeded the respective fair values. Accordingly,
    VF recorded a noncash impairment charge totaling
    $201.7 million ($141.8 million net of related income
    tax benefits) to reduce the carrying values of goodwill and the
    trademark intangible asset of this business unit to their fair
    values. This charge represents all of the recorded goodwill for
    the

7 For All
    Mankind

®

business unit and 40% of the consolidated goodwill and
    nonamortized trademark balances for this business unit.
    Similarly, as a result of our annual impairment testing in the
    fourth quarter of 2009, VF management determined that the
    carrying values of goodwill at its

Reef

®

,

Nautica

®

,

    and

lucy

®

business units and trademark intangible assets at its

Reef

®

and

lucy

®

business units exceeded their respective fair values.
    Accordingly, VF recorded noncash impairment charges totaling
    $122.0 million ($114.4 million net of related income
    tax benefits) to



reduce these carrying values to their fair values. Of this
    total,

Reef

®

represented $36.7 million,

Nautica

®

represented $58.5 million and

lucy

®

represented $26.8 million (23%, 14% and 26%, respectively,
    of each businesses’ combined goodwill and nonamortized
    trademark intangible asset balances). For additional
    information, see Notes F, G and T to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements and the “Critical Accounting Policies
    and Estimates” section below.

Interest income was flat in 2010 compared with 2009, but
    decreased $3.9 million in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to
    lower interest rates. Interest expense decreased
    $8.2 million in 2010 from 2009 due to reduced short-term
    borrowing levels and the payment of $200 million of notes
    that matured in 2010. The $8.1 million decline in interest
    expense in 2009 from 2008 was due primarily to lower short-term
    borrowing levels. Average interest-bearing debt outstanding
    totaled $1,136 million for 2010, $1,364 million for
    2009 and $1,454 million for 2008, with Short-term
    Borrowings representing 4.0%, 16.2% and 21.2% of average debt
    outstanding for the respective years. The weighted average
    interest rate on outstanding debt was 6.6% for 2010, 6.1% for
    2009 and 6.3% for 2008. The increase in the weighted average
    interest rate in 2010 resulted from a reduction in commercial
    paper borrowings, which bear lower interest rates.

In connection with the Vans Mexico acquisition, we recognized a
    $5.7 million gain in Miscellaneous Income during 2010 from
    remeasuring our previous 50% investment in the joint venture to
    fair value.

Excluding the impairment charges discussed above, the tax rates
    for 2010 and 2009 were 24.9% and 26.2%, respectively, compared
    with 28.9% in 2008. During 2010, we recorded tax benefits of
    $20.5 million related to prior years’ refund claims
    and tax credits and $5.6 million of tax benefits related to
    expirations of statutes of limitations in international
    jurisdictions where accruals for uncertain tax positions had
    been recorded. These items lowered our 2010 annual tax rate by
    2.7%. During 2009, we recorded tax benefits of
    $17.5 million related to favorable outcomes of
    U.S. state tax audits and from expirations of statutes of
    limitations in several U.S. state and international
    jurisdictions where accruals for uncertain tax positions had
    been recorded. These items lowered our 2009 annual tax rate by
    2.3%. During 2008, we recorded tax benefits of
    (i) $24.6 million related primarily to favorable
    outcomes of foreign tax audits, expirations of statutes of
    limitations in foreign jurisdictions and other state tax
    benefits and (ii) $11.5 million to reflect updated
    assessments of previously accrued amounts. These items lowered
    our 2008 annual tax rate by 4.3%. After considering the impact
    of the unusual items discussed above, the remaining declines in
    the effective income tax rates in 2010 from 2009 and in 2009
    from 2008 were primarily attributed to growth in our
    international businesses in jurisdictions having effective tax
    rates that are substantially lower than rates in the United
    States.

Net Income Attributable to VF Corporation increased to
    $571.4 million in 2010 from $461.3 million in 2009,
    while earnings per share increased to $5.18 in 2010 from $4.13
    in 2009. Excluding the impairment charges noted above, earnings
    per share were $6.46 in 2010 and $5.16 in 2009. The increase in
    earnings per share in 2010 over 2009 resulted primarily from
    improved operating performance, as discussed in the
    “Information by Business Segment” section below, and
    lower domestic pension expense, which benefited earnings per
    share in 2010 by $0.20. These benefits were partially offset by
    cost reduction actions that negatively impacted earnings per
    share in 2010 by $0.09. There were no similar actions taken in
    2009.

Net Income Attributable to VF Corporation decreased to
    $461.3 million in 2009 from $602.7 million in 2008,
    while earnings per share decreased to $4.13 in 2009 from $5.42
    in 2008. Earnings per share in 2009 were $5.16 excluding
    impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets. Earnings
    per share in 2009 compared with 2008 were negatively impacted by
    (i) higher domestic pension expense of $0.48 and
    (ii) an unfavorable impact of $0.18 from translating
    foreign currencies into a stronger U.S. dollar. The
    earnings per share comparison in 2009 benefited from the absence
    of charges of $0.30 per share for cost reduction actions taken
    in 2008.

Information
    by Business Segment

Management at each of the coalitions has direct control over and
    responsibility for its revenues, operating income and assets,
    hereinafter termed “Coalition Revenues” and
    “Coalition Profit”, respectively. VF management
    evaluates operating performance and makes investment and other
    decisions based on Coalition Revenues and Coalition Profit.
    Common costs such as information systems processing, retirement
    benefits and insurance are allocated to the coalitions based on
    appropriate metrics such as usage or employment.



Corporate costs (other than costs charged directly to the
    coalitions), impairment charges and net interest expense are not
    controlled by coalition management and therefore are excluded
    from the Coalition Profit performance measure used for internal
    management reporting. See Note Q to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for a summary of our results of operations
    and other information by coalition, along with a reconciliation
    of Coalition Profit to Income Before Income Taxes. To leverage
    the scale of VF, there are a number of functions that are shared
    across all coalitions. Accordingly, coalition results are not
    necessarily indicative of operating results that would have been
    reported had each coalition been an independent, stand-alone
    entity during the periods presented.

The following tables present a summary of the changes in our
    Total Revenues and Coalition Profit by coalition during the last
    two years:

The Outdoor & Action Sports Coalition achieved record
    revenues, operating income and operating margin in 2010. The 14%
    increase in revenues was driven by growth in

The North
    Face

®

and

Vans

®

brands of 18% and 20%, respectively, over the prior year. These
    brands experienced growth in both domestic and international
    markets.

Direct-to-consumer

revenues for this coalition rose 20% in 2010 over 2009, with
    double-digit growth in

,

®

retail businesses as we benefited from new store openings,
    growth in comp store sales and expansion of our

e-commerce

business. Revenues in Asia increased 31% in 2010 over the prior
    year.

Coalition Revenues in 2009 increased slightly on a reported
    basis compared with 2008 and 3% on a constant currency basis.
    Reported global revenues of

The North
    Face

®

increased by 6% (including a negative impact of 3% from foreign
    currency translation) and

Vans

®

increased by 5% (including a negative impact of 2% from foreign
    currency translation). In addition, revenues in Asia increased
    by more than 50%, largely due to increases in the

Vans

®

brand, which was just introduced into China in 2008. These
    increases were offset by the impact of foreign currency
    translation and revenue declines in the other coalition
    businesses.

The operating margin improvement in 2010 over 2009 was driven by
    (i) a 2.5% increase in gross margin, reflecting
    improvements in retail store performance and improved
    profitability on the disposal of distressed inventories, and
    (ii) the leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues.
    These operating margin improvements were partially offset by a
    significant increase in marketing spending that negatively
    impacted operating margin comparisons by 1.2% in 2010 compared
    with 2009.

Approximately one-half of the operating margin improvement in
    2009 over 2008 resulted from an increased gross margin, with
    higher margin

direct-to-consumer

revenues making up a larger portion of total Coalition Revenues
    in 2009. In addition, the 2009 operating margin comparison
    benefited by 0.3% from a charge for cost reduction actions taken
    in 2008 that did not recur in 2009. The remainder of the
    operating margin improvement in 2009 over 2008 was due to lower
    spending, partially offset by continued investments to expand
    the

direct-to-consumer

business.

The Jeanswear Coalition consists of our global jeanswear
    businesses, led by the

Wrangler

®

and

Lee

®

brands.

Domestic jeanswear revenues increased 2% in 2010 over 2009, with
    3% growth in both our

Wrangler

®

and

Lee

®

brands reflecting the positive impact of new products introduced
    during the year. Domestic jeanswear revenues declined 4% in 2009
    from 2008 due to a difficult retail environment, including the
    loss of volume from customers who filed for bankruptcy in 2008
    and a reduction in noncore

Riders

®

brand plus size and seasonal programs (some of which were
    reinstated in 2010).

International jeanswear revenues, including Europe, Canada,
    Mexico, Latin America and Asia, declined 3% in 2010, with lower
    revenues in Europe partially offset by 36% revenue growth in
    Asia and double-digit growth in all other foreign markets. The
    decline in Europe resulted from the decision in 2009 to exit our
    mass market jeans business in Europe, as well as continued
    difficult business conditions in the overall European jeanswear
    market.

Jeanswear revenues in international markets declined 18% in 2009
    from 2008, with 8% of the decline resulting from the negative
    impact of foreign currency translation. The remainder of the
    decline was driven by recessionary conditions, especially in
    Europe, and the mass market jeans business exit in Europe. These
    declines were partially offset by a 14% increase in jeanswear
    revenues in Asia.



The improvement in operating margin in 2010 over 2009 resulted
    from a 2.6% higher gross margin reflecting (i) lower
    product costs, particularly in our U.S. jeanswear
    businesses, and (ii) lower levels of and improved
    profitability on the disposal of distressed inventories.
    Operating margin comparisons in 2010 also benefited from the
    2009 exit of the European mass market jeans business, which had
    operating margins that were well below the coalition average.
    These benefits were partially offset by increased marketing
    spending and charges for cost reduction actions that negatively
    impacted 2010 operating margin comparisons by 0.8% and 0.3%,
    respectively.

The Jeanswear operating margin in 2009, compared with 2008,
    benefited by 1.0% from charges for cost reduction actions taken
    in 2008 that did not recur in 2009. The negative impact of
    higher distressed inventory provisions in our European
    businesses in 2009 was offset by lower spending across the
    coalition due in part to the 2008 cost reduction actions.

The Imagewear Coalition consists of VF’s Image business
    (occupational apparel and uniforms) and Licensed Sports business
    (licensed high profile sports and lifestyle apparel).

Image business revenues increased 8% in 2010 over 2009 due to
    strength in the industrial and protective sectors resulting from
    the gradual economic recovery and the competitive advantage of
    our quick response service model. Licensed sports revenues
    increased 3% in 2010 over 2009 due primarily to growth in our
    licensed National Football League business.

Image business revenues declined 17% in 2009 from 2008 due to
    rising unemployment, particularly in the manufacturing and
    petrochemical sectors. Licensed sports revenues were down 8% in
    2009 from 2008, resulting from lower attendance at sporting
    events and the overall weak retail environment and the highly
    discretionary nature of consumer spending on these products.

Operating margin increased 1.5% in 2010 over 2009 due to higher
    gross margins, resulting primarily from an improved mix of
    business. The remainder of the increase was driven by improved
    leverage of operating expenses on a higher level of revenues.

Operating margin declined in 2009 from 2008 due to revenue
    declines that negatively impacted the expense to revenue ratio
    and economic factors that affected obligations under royalty
    agreements in our licensed sports business.

The Sportswear Coalition consists of our

Nautica

®

and

Kipling

®

brand businesses in North America (the

Kipling

®

brand outside of North America is managed by the
    Outdoor & Action Sports Coalition).

Sportswear Coalition Revenues were flat in 2010 compared with
    2009. A 2% decline in

Nautica

®

brand revenues during 2010 due to lower volume in our owned
    outlet stores was offset by 30% growth in our

Kipling

®

brand revenues. The increase in

Kipling

®

brand revenues resulted from growth in

direct-to-consumer

revenues, performance in specialty stores and the successful
    launch in early 2010 of a new program that is exclusive with
    Macy’s, Inc.



The decline in Coalition Revenues in 2009 from 2008 was driven
    by a 13% decrease in

Nautica

®

brand revenues, resulting from difficult market conditions in
    the department store channel and lower volume in our owned
    outlet stores.

The Sportswear Coalition operating margins were flat in 2010
    compared with 2009. An improvement in gross margin percentage of
    0.7% resulted from (i) lower markdown activity in the
    department store channel and our outlet store channel,
    (ii) lower levels of excess inventory coming into 2010 and
    (iii) a higher percentage of

Kipling

®

revenues, which have higher gross margins than the coalition
    average. This improvement was offset by higher marketing
    spending.

The Sportswear Coalition operating margin improved in 2009 from
    2008 due to aggressive cost and inventory reduction actions in
    our Nautica business. Also, the 2009 operating margin comparison
    benefited by 1.0% from charges for cost reduction actions taken
    in 2008 that did not recur in 2009, including the cost for the
    exit of the

Nautica

®

women’s wholesale sportswear business.

This coalition consists of the

7 For All
    Mankind

®

brand of premium denim jeanswear and related apparel and the

John
    Varvatos

®

luxury apparel collection for men. This coalition also includes
    the operating results of the

Splendid

®

and

Ella
    Moss

®

brands comprised of the earnings from our one-third equity
    investment from June 2008 through March 2009, when the remaining
    two-thirds equity interest was purchased, and the consolidated
    operating results thereafter.

The growth in Coalition Revenues in 2010 resulted from the 2009
    acquisition of the

Splendid

®

and

Ella
    Moss

®

brands, which contributed an incremental $24 million in
    revenues in 2010, and 10% revenue growth in our

John
    Varvatos

®

business. These increases were partially offset by a 3% decrease
    in global

7 For All
    Mankind

®

brand revenues, reflecting volume declines due to continued soft
    conditions in the premium denim market. Expanding the

7 For
    All
    Mankind

®

direct-to-consumer

business is an important part of our growth strategy for this
    brand, and in 2010 we opened 20 retail stores.

The increase in Coalition Revenues in 2009 was due to the
    acquisition of the

Splendid

®

and

Ella
    Moss

®

brands. This increase was partially offset by an 8% decline in
    global

7 For All
    Mankind

®

brand revenues, driven by challenging conditions in the
    U.S. upper tier department and specialty store channel. The

7 For All
    Mankind

®

brand grew in Asia, where revenues nearly doubled, and in the
    brand’s

direct-to-consumer

business, where revenues more than tripled.

The decline in operating margin in 2010 compared with 2009 was
    driven by investments in new

7 For All
    Mankind

®

retail stores, higher marketing spending, the write-off of
    fixtures at eight underperforming retail stores that had been
    opened in previous years and lower margins associated with
    selling excess quantities of inventory. The operating margin
    comparison was also negatively impacted by 1.5% due to the
    favorable resolution of a value-added tax and duty matter during
    2009 that did not recur in 2010. These decreases were partially
    offset by improved operating results in our

John
    Varvatos

®

business, which had a positive operating margin in 2010 after
    generating operating losses in prior years.

Operating margins were negatively impacted in 2009 compared with
    2008 by volume declines in our

7 For All
    Mankind

®

wholesale business that negatively impacted the expense to
    revenue ratio, increased retail investments across the coalition
    and higher operating losses in 2009 in our

John
    Varvatos

®

business. The 2009 operating margin comparison benefited by 1.5%
    from charges in 2008 related to a value-added tax and duty
    matter and cost reduction initiatives that did not recur.
    Operating margins for the

7 For All
    Mankind

®

and

Splendid

®

and

Ella
    Moss

®

brands in 2009 were above the coalition average, at 16% and 20%,
    respectively.

The Other business segment includes the VF Outlet business,
    which is a group of VF-operated outlet stores in the United
    States that sell a broad selection of excess quantities of VF
    products and other branded products. Revenues and profits of VF
    products are reported as part of the operating results of the
    applicable coalitions, while revenues and profits of non-VF
    products, which provide a broader selection of merchandise to
    attract consumer traffic, are reported in this business segment.
    While revenues in the Other business segment were flat in 2010
    compared with 2009, the decline in revenues in 2009 from 2008
    was due to the impact of the economic recession on consumer
    spending.

Reconciliation
    of Coalition Profit to Consolidated Income Before Income
    Taxes:

There are three types of costs necessary to reconcile total
    Coalition Profit, as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, to
    Income Before Income Taxes. These costs, discussed below, are
    Impairment of Goodwill and Trademarks, Interest, and Corporate
    and Other Expenses. See also Note Q to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Impairment of Goodwill and Trademarks and Interest Expense, Net
    were discussed in the previous “Consolidated Statements of
    Income” section. Impairment of Goodwill and Trademarks is
    excluded from Coalition Profit as they represent charges that
    are not a part of the ongoing operations of the respective
    businesses. See the “Non-GAAP Financial
    Information” section below. Interest is excluded from
    Coalition Profit because substantially all of our financing
    costs are managed at the corporate office and are not under the
    control of coalition management.

Information Systems and Shared Services

—
    Included are costs of our management information systems and our
    centralized shared services center, which includes common
    financial, supply chain, human resources and customer management
    services that support our worldwide operations. Operating costs
    of information systems and shared services are charged to the
    coalitions based on utilization of those services, such as
    minutes of computer processing time, number of transactions or
    number of users. Costs to develop new computer applications that
    will be used across VF are not allocated to the coalitions. The
    increase in information systems and shared services costs in
    2010 from 2009 resulted from the overall growth of our
    businesses, increased spending related to reconfiguring our
    western hemisphere sourcing organization and costs associated
    with changing third-party data center providers. The decrease in
    information systems and shared services costs in 2009 from 2008
    is primarily due to reductions in third-party data center
    charges and amortization.

Corporate Headquarters’ Costs

—
    Headquarters’ costs include compensation and benefits of
    corporate management and staff, certain legal and professional
    fees, and administrative and general expenses, which are



not apportioned to the coalitions. The increase in corporate
    headquarters’ costs in 2010 from 2009 was primarily driven
    by higher incentive compensation, increased contributions to the
    VF Foundation and significantly higher investments in strategy
    and innovation. The decline in corporate headquarters’
    costs in 2009 from 2008 was due to reduced spending as part of
    our cost reduction efforts.

Trademark Maintenance and Enforcement

— Legal
    and other costs of registering, maintaining and enforcing the
    majority of VF’s trademarks, plus related costs of
    licensing administration, are controlled by a centralized
    trademark and licensing staff and are not allocated to the
    coalitions.

Other

— This category includes (i) costs
    that result from corporate programs or corporate-managed
    decisions that are not allocated to the business units for
    internal management reporting, (ii) adjustments to convert
    the earnings of certain business units using the FIFO inventory
    valuation method for internal reporting to the LIFO method for
    consolidated financial reporting and (iii) other
    consolidating adjustments, the most significant of which is
    related to the expense of our centrally-managed
    U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Coalition Profit of the
    business units includes only their current year service cost
    component of pension expense. Pension costs totaling
    $46.9 million for 2010 and $83.1 million for 2009,
    primarily representing amortization of deferred actuarial
    losses, were recorded in “other” expense. These costs
    were not significant in 2008.

Analysis
    of Financial Condition

Balance
    Sheets

Accounts Receivable at December 2010 were in line with the
    balance at December 2009. Increases in accounts receivable
    related to higher wholesale revenues near the end of 2010
    compared with the 2009 period were offset by (i) an
    improvement in collections reflected in lower days’ sales
    outstanding and (ii) an increase in accounts receivable
    balances sold, as discussed in the “Liquidity and Cash
    Flows” section below and in Note C to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Inventories increased 12% at December 2010 over the December
    2009 balance due to (i) expected revenue growth in the
    first quarter of 2011 compared with the prior year period,
    (ii) rising inventory costs and (iii) accelerated
    purchases of fabric in anticipation of the expected price
    increases. These increases were partially offset by an
    improvement in our number of days of inventory on hand, compared
    with the end of 2009.

Property, Plant and Equipment at the end of 2010 was in line
    with the balance at the end of 2009 as the amount of
    depreciation expense approximated capital spending in 2010.

Total Intangible Assets and Goodwill decreased in 2010 due to
    the impairment charges discussed above, amortization of
    intangible assets and the impact of foreign currency
    translation, partially offset by the addition of intangible
    assets and goodwill related to the Vans Mexico acquisition.

Other Assets were higher at December 2010 due to an increase in
    deferred income tax assets, resulting primarily from the
    goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge discussed above.

Short-term Borrowings at December 2010 and December 2009
    consisted of $36.6 million and $45.5 million,
    respectively, under international borrowing agreements.

The Current Portion of Long-term Debt was lower at December 2010
    than December 2009 due to the payment of $200.0 million of
    8.5% notes upon their maturity in 2010.

The increase in Accounts Payable at December 2010 compared with
    December 2009 resulted from the timing of inventory purchases
    and other payments.

The increase in Accrued Liabilities at December 2010 over
    December 2009 was driven primarily by higher incentive
    compensation accruals and the overall growth of our businesses.

Other Liabilities at December 2010 decreased from 2009 due to
    (i) lower deferred income taxes and (ii) a reduction
    in the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans
    at the end of 2010, as discussed in the following paragraph.



The recessionary conditions during 2008 resulted in a
    significant decline in the value of the investment portfolios of
    our defined benefit pension plans. As a result, our pension
    liability was over $400 million higher than pension assets
    at December 2008. To improve the funded status of our pension
    plans, we contributed over $200 million to these plans
    during 2009 and over $100 million in 2010. Accordingly, the
    plans’ underfunded status reported in our 2009 and 2010
    Consolidated Balance Sheets was reduced to $250.9 million
    and $207.4 million, respectively. See Note M to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements and the “Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates” section below for a
    discussion of liability and equity balances related to defined
    benefit pension plans.

Liquidity
    and Cash Flows

The financial condition of VF is reflected in the following:

$

Current ratio

2.5 to 1

%

For the ratio of debt to total capital, debt is defined as
    short-term and long-term borrowings, and total capital is
    defined as debt plus stockholders’ equity. Our ratio of net
    debt to total capital, with net debt defined as debt less cash
    and equivalents and total capital defined as net debt plus
    stockholders’ equity, was 4.5% at the end of 2010.

VF’s primary source of liquidity is its strong cash flow
    provided by operating activities. Cash generated from
    operations, which was $1,001.3 million in 2010,
    $973.5 million in 2009 and $679.5 million in 2008, is
    primarily dependent on the level of Net Income, changes in
    accounts receivable, investments in inventories and other
    working capital components. Net Income was $573.5 million,
    $458.5 million and $602.8 million in 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. Net Income in 2010 and 2009 were negatively
    impacted by noncash pretax impairment charges for goodwill and
    intangible assets of $201.7 million and
    $122.0 million, respectively.

Operating cash flow for 2010 and 2009 included
    $100.0 million and $200.0 million, respectively, of
    discretionary contributions to our U.S. qualified defined
    benefit pension plan. There were no contributions to this plan
    in 2008. VF has adequate liquidity to meet future funding
    requirements. We will continue to evaluate the funded status of
    our retirement plans and future funding requirements.

The significant change in deferred income taxes for 2010 was
    driven by an increase in deferred income tax assets, resulting
    primarily from the goodwill and intangible asset impairment
    charges in 2010.

The net change in operating asset and liability components
    provided an increase to operating cash flow of
    $90.4 million in 2010 and $228.1 million in 2009, in
    contrast to reducing operating cash flows by $150.6 million
    in 2008. The positive cash generation from these components in
    2010 was due to higher incentive compensation accruals and other
    accrued liabilities resulting from business growth in 2010. The
    increase in accounts payable at the end of 2010 was primarily
    offset by higher inventory levels.

The positive cash generation from these components in 2009 was
    driven by our aggressive management of inventory levels and the
    sale of selected accounts receivable discussed in the paragraph
    below. The changes in operating cash flows from other current
    assets during 2009 resulted from an unusually high amount of
    prepaid income taxes at the end of 2008. Operating cash flow in
    2008 benefited from an additional week of collections on
    accounts receivable in the

rd

week

    of the fiscal year in that collections sharply exceeded credit
    sales in that week.

In 2009, VF entered into an agreement to sell selected trade
    accounts receivable, on a nonrecourse basis, to a financial
    institution. This agreement allows VF to have up to
    $192.5 million of accounts receivable held by the financial
    institution at any point in time. After the sale, VF continues
    to service and collect these accounts receivable on behalf of
    the financial institution but does not retain any other
    interests in the receivables. At the end of 2010 and 2009,
    accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets had been
    reduced by $112.3 million and $74.2 million,
    respectively, related to balances sold under this program. Net
    proceeds of this accounts receivable sale program are recognized
    as part of the change in accounts receivable in cash provided by
    operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows. This program resulted in increases of $38.1 million
    and $74.2 million in operating cash flow in 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.



VF will rely on its continued strong cash generation to finance
    ongoing operations as well as most other circumstances that may
    arise. VF has significant existing liquidity from its available
    cash balances and debt capacity, supported by its strong credit
    rating. At the end of 2010, $983.3 million was available
    for borrowing under VF’s $1.0 billion senior unsecured
    domestic revolving bank credit facility, with $16.7 million
    of standby letters of credit issued under the agreement. This
    credit facility is used primarily to support our seasonal
    commercial paper borrowings. Also at the end of 2010,
    €250.0 million (U.S. dollar equivalent of
    $334.2 million) was available for borrowing under VF’s
    senior unsecured international revolving bank credit facility.

VF’s liquidity position is also enhanced by its favorable
    credit agency ratings, which allow for access to additional
    capital at competitive rates. At the end of 2010, VF’s
    long-term debt ratings were ‘A minus’ by
    Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and
    ‘A3’ by Moody’s Investors Service, and commercial
    paper ratings were

‘A-2’

and ‘Prime-2’, respectively, by those rating agencies.
    Both agencies have a ‘stable’ outlook for VF. Existing
    long-term debt agreements do not contain acceleration of
    maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings.
    However, for the $600.0 million of senior notes issued in
    2007, if there were a change in control of VF and, as a result
    of the change in control, the notes were rated below investment
    grade by recognized rating agencies, then VF would be obligated
    to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal
    amount of notes repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid
    interest.

Cash of $38.3 million, $212.3 million and
    $93.4 million was used for acquisitions in 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively, which is net of cash balances in the
    acquired companies. These acquisitions were funded with existing
    VF cash balances.

Capital expenditures were $111.6 million in 2010, compared
    with $85.9 million in 2009 and $124.2 million in 2008.
    Capital expenditures in each of these years primarily related to
    our retail store rollout, distribution network and information
    systems. We expect that capital spending could reach
    $225 million in 2011, reflecting the need for office and
    distribution space for our expanding international and domestic
    outdoor businesses as well as an accelerated retail store
    opening plan. This spending will be funded by cash flow from
    operations.

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, VF purchased 5.1 million,
    1.6 million and 2.0 million shares, respectively, of
    its Common Stock in open market transactions. The cost of these
    transactions was $411.8 million, $112.0 million and
    $149.7 million with an average price of $81.11 in 2010,
    $71.80 in 2009 and $74.86 in 2008. Under its current
    authorization from the Board of Directors, VF may purchase an
    additional 6.6 million shares. We will continue to evaluate
    future share repurchases considering funding required for
    business acquisitions, our Common Stock price and levels of
    stock option exercises.

Cash dividends totaled $2.43 per common share in 2010, compared
    with $2.37 in 2009 and $2.33 in 2008. Our dividend payout rate
    was 46.9% of our diluted earnings per share in 2010, 57.4% in
    2009 and 43.0% in 2008 (37.6% in 2010 and 46.0% in 2009
    excluding the effects of the noncash goodwill and intangible
    asset impairment charges in those years). On a longer term
    basis, we expect to pay dividends of approximately 40% of our
    diluted earnings per share. The current indicated annual
    dividend rate for 2011 is $2.52 per share.

We have other financial commitments at the end of 2010 that are
    not included in the above table but may require the use of funds
    under certain circumstances:

•

An agreement to acquire the trademarks and related intellectual
    property of Rock and Republic Enterprises, Inc. for
    approximately $57 million, subject to customary conditions
    and entry of a confirmation order in the Bankruptcy Court for
    the Southern District of New York.

•

Funding contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are
    not included in the table because of uncertainty over whether or
    when further contributions will be required.

•

$89.9 million of surety bonds, standby letters of credit
    and international bank guarantees representing contingent
    guarantees of performance under self-insurance and other
    programs. These commitments would only be drawn upon if VF were
    to fail to meet its claims or other obligations.



•

Purchase orders for goods or services in the ordinary course of
    business that represent authorizations to purchase rather than
    binding commitments.

During 2010, VF used cash flows from operations to meet its
    obligations when due and, for seasonal needs, limited issuance
    of commercial paper; there were no borrowings under our domestic
    or international bank facilities during the year. Credit market
    conditions and the general contraction of liquidity in the
    United States and global capital markets during the second half
    of 2008 and continuing into 2009 had a significant impact on the
    ability of many companies to access the commercial paper and
    other capital markets. VF was able to issue commercial paper for
    seasonal working capital needs during this period reflecting our
    investment grade credit rating. If the commercial paper markets
    were not available, VF has a total of $1.3 billion of
    liquidity available under its domestic and international
    revolving bank credit agreements that do not expire until
    October 2012. Management believes that VF’s cash balances
    and funds provided by operating activities, as well as unused
    bank credit lines, additional borrowing capacity and access to
    equity markets, taken as a whole, provide (i) adequate
    liquidity to meet all of its current and long-term obligations
    when due, (ii) adequate liquidity to fund capital
    expenditures and to maintain our dividend payout policy and
    (iii) flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may
    arise.

We do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated
    entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate
    off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes.

Risk
    Management

VF is exposed to risks in the ordinary course of business. We
    regularly assess and manage our exposures to these risks through
    our operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, by
    (i) taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures
    within VF, (ii) purchasing insurance from commercial
    carriers or (iii) the use of derivative financial
    instruments. Some of our potential risks are discussed below:

Insured risks

— We self-insure a substantial
    portion of our employee group medical, worker’s
    compensation, vehicle, property, director and officer, and
    general liability exposures and purchase insurance from highly
    rated commercial carriers for losses in excess of retained
    exposures.

Cash and equivalents risks

— VF had
    $792.2 million of cash and equivalents at the end of 2010,
    which includes demand deposits, institutional money market funds
    that invest in obligations issued or guaranteed by the
    U.S. or foreign governments and short-term time deposits of
    foreign commercial banks. We continually monitor the credit
    ratings of VF’s financial institutions. Similarly, we
    monitor the credit quality of cash equivalents and fixed income
    investments in our defined benefit pension plan portfolio.

Defined benefit pension plan risks

— VF is
    subject to funding and earnings risks of its defined benefit
    pension plans. VF’s pension plans were substantially fully
    funded at the end of 2007. At the end of 2010, the plans are
    underfunded due primarily to substantial investment portfolio
    losses incurred in 2008 and an increase in projected benefit
    obligations because of a decline in the discount rate used to
    value those obligations. Declines in the funded status of our
    plans were offset in part by VF contributions of over
    $100 million to the plans during 2010 and over
    $200 million during 2009, as well as investment performance
    that has exceeded our actuarial return assumption. Accordingly,
    at the end of 2010, VF has a $207.4 million liability
    representing the underfunded status of the plans
    ($1,211.6 million of plan assets compared with a projected
    benefit obligation of $1,419.0 million) and a
    $433.8 million pretax balance in Accumulated Other
    Comprehensive Income (Loss) in Stockholders’ Equity. We
    will continue to evaluate the funded status of our retirement
    plans and future funding requirements. Further, as more fully
    described in the “Critical Accounting Policies and
    Estimates” section below, we have begun to take actions
    that will limit the risk in investments of our domestic defined
    benefit pension plans and reduce the

year-to-year

variability of our domestic plans’ funded status and
    resulting pension expense.

Interest rate risks

— We limit the risk of
    interest rate fluctuations by managing our mix of fixed and
    variable interest rate debt. In addition, we may use derivative
    financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk. Since
    all of our long-term debt has fixed interest rates, our interest
    rate exposure relates to changes in interest rates on our
    variable rate short-term borrowings, which averaged
    approximately $45 million during 2010. However, any change
    in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on
    VF’s cash equivalents. Based on the low levels of



variable rate borrowings and the levels of cash equivalents
    during 2010, the effect on reported net income of a hypothetical
    1.0% change in interest rates would not be significant.

Foreign currency exchange rate risks

— VF is a
    global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency
    fluctuations. Approximately 30% of our revenues in 2010 were
    generated in international markets. Most of our foreign
    businesses operate in functional currencies other than the
    U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar strengthened relative
    to the euro or other foreign currencies where we have
    operations, there would be a negative impact on VF’s
    operating results upon translation of those foreign operating
    results into the U.S. dollar. We do not hedge the
    translation of foreign currency operating results into the
    U.S. dollar, however we do hedge foreign currency
    transactions as discussed later in this section.

Assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject
    to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We have an
    international bank credit agreement that provides for up to
    €250.0 million (U.S. dollar equivalent of
    $334.2 million at December 2010) of euro-denominated
    borrowings. Although there were no borrowings under this
    agreement during 2010, borrowings under the agreement could be
    used to reduce the exposure to currency rate changes for our
    euro-denominated net assets. Net advances to and investments in
    our foreign businesses in Europe, Latin America and Asia are
    considered to be long-term, and accordingly, foreign currency
    transaction effects on those long-term advances are deferred as
    a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in
    Stockholders’ Equity. We do not hedge net investments in
    foreign subsidiaries, which could impact the U.S. dollar
    value of those investments.

We monitor net foreign currency market exposures and enter into
    derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of
    exchange rate fluctuations for a significant portion of our
    forecasted foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign
    currency transactions. Use of these financial instruments allows
    us to reduce the overall exposure to risks from exchange rate
    fluctuations on VF’s cash flows and earnings, since gains
    and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on
    the cash flows or transactions being hedged. Our practice is to
    hedge a portion of net foreign currency cash flows forecasted
    for periods of up to 20 months (relating to cross-border
    inventory purchases, production costs, product sales and
    intercompany royalty payments) by buying or selling primarily
    U.S. dollar contracts against various currencies.
    Currently, we use only forward exchange contracts but may use
    options or collars in the future.

For cash flow hedging contracts outstanding at the end of 2010,
    if there were a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange
    rates of 10% compared with rates at the end of 2010, it would
    result in a change in fair value of those contracts of
    approximately $80 million. However, any change in the fair
    value of the hedging contracts would result in an offsetting
    change in the fair value of the underlying balance sheet
    positions impacted by the currency rate changes.

Counterparty risks

— VF is exposed to
    credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by
    counterparties to derivative hedging instruments. To manage this
    risk, we have established counterparty credit guidelines and
    enter into derivative transactions only with financial
    institutions with ‘A minus/A3’ investment grade credit
    ratings or better. We continually monitor the credit rating of,
    and our hedging positions with, each counterparty. Additionally,
    we utilize a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize our
    exposure to potential counterparty defaults and will adjust our
    positions if necessary. We also monitor counterparty risk for
    derivative contracts within our defined benefit pension plans.

Commodity price risks

— VF is exposed to market
    risks for the pricing of cotton and other fibers, which may
    impact fabric prices. To manage risks of fabric prices, we
    negotiate prices for denim and other fabrics in advance when
    possible. We have not historically managed commodity price
    exposures by using derivative instruments.

Deferred compensation and related investment security
    risks

— VF has nonqualified deferred compensation
    plans in which liabilities to the plans’ participants are
    based on the market values of investment funds selected by the
    participants. The risk of changes in the market values of the
    participants’ investment selections is hedged by VF’s
    investment in a portfolio of securities that substantially
    mirror the participants’ investment selections. Increases
    and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are
    substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in
    the market value of VF’s investments, resulting in an
    insignificant net exposure to our operating results and
    financial position.



Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are
    appropriate to accurately and fairly report VF’s operating
    results and financial position in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States. We apply
    these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our
    significant accounting policies are summarized in Note A to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The application of these accounting policies requires that we
    make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply
    judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, revenues, expenses, contingent assets and
    liabilities, and related disclosures. These estimates,
    assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience,
    current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under
    the circumstances. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions
    on an ongoing basis. Because our business cycle is relatively
    short (i.e., from the date that we place an order to manufacture
    or purchase inventory until that inventory is sold and the trade
    receivable is collected), actual results related to most
    estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet
    date. In addition, we may retain outside specialists to assist
    us in valuations of business acquisitions, impairment testing of
    goodwill and intangible assets, equity compensation, pension
    benefits and self-insured liabilities. If actual results
    ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are
    included in results of operations in the period in which the
    actual amounts become known.

We believe the following accounting policies involve the most
    significant management estimates, assumptions and management
    judgments used in preparation of our Consolidated Financial
    Statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside
    factors. We have discussed the application of these critical
    accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of
    our Board of Directors.

Inventories

Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value.
    Cost includes all material, labor and overhead costs incurred to
    manufacture or purchase the finished goods. Overhead allocated
    to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of our
    plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or
    abnormal production inefficiencies. Market value is based on a
    detailed review at each business unit, at least quarterly, of
    all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual
    style-size-color stock-keeping units (“SKUs”) to
    identify slow moving or excess products, discontinued and
    to-be-discontinued products, and off-quality merchandise. This
    review matches inventory on hand, plus current production and
    purchase commitments, with current and expected future sales
    orders. For those units in inventory that are identified as
    slow-moving or excess or off-quality, we estimate their market
    value based on historical experience and current realization
    trends. This evaluation, performed using a systematic and
    consistent methodology, requires forecasts of future demand,
    market conditions and selling prices. If the forecasted market
    value, on an individual style or SKU basis, is less than cost,
    we provide an allowance to reflect the lower value of that
    inventory. This methodology recognizes inventory exposures, on
    an individual style or SKU basis, at the time such losses are
    evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold.
    Historically, these estimates of future demand and selling
    prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to
    our timely identification and rapid disposal of these reduced
    value inventories.

Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis. We
    provide for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred
    since the last physical inventory date. Historically, our
    physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant.

Long-lived
    Assets

We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the
    fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed, with any excess purchase price recorded as
    goodwill. We evaluate fair value using three valuation
    techniques — the replacement cost, market and income
    methods — and weight the valuation methods based on
    what is most appropriate in the circumstances. The process of
    assigning fair values, particularly to acquired intangible
    assets, is highly subjective.

Our depreciation policies for property, plant and equipment
    reflect judgments on their estimated economic lives and residual
    value, if any. Our amortization policies for intangible assets
    reflect judgments on the estimated



amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be
    generated by those assets. In evaluating expected benefits to be
    received for customer-related intangible assets, we consider
    historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers.
    For license-related intangible assets, we consider historical
    trends and anticipated license renewal periods based on our
    experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements,
    regardless of whether there are explicit renewal provisions.

We review property and definite-lived intangible assets for
    possible impairment on an ongoing basis to determine if events
    or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than
    not that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully
    recoverable. We test for possible impairment at the asset or
    asset group level, which is the lowest level for which there are
    identifiable cash flows that are largely independent. We measure
    recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group
    by comparison with estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to
    be generated by the asset. If the forecasted total of
    undiscounted cash flows exceeds the carrying value of the asset,
    there is no impairment charge. If the undiscounted cash flows
    are less than the carrying value of the asset, we estimate the
    fair value of the asset based on the present value of its future
    cash flows and recognize an impairment charge for the excess of
    the asset’s carrying value over its fair value.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting of major
    trademarks, and goodwill are not subject to amortization.
    Rather, we evaluate those assets for possible impairment as of
    the beginning of the fourth quarter as part of our annual
    strategic planning process, or more frequently if events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than
    not that the carrying value of an asset may exceed its fair
    value. Fair value of an indefinite-lived trademark intangible
    asset is based on an income approach using the
    relief-from-royalty method. Under this method, forecasted global
    revenues for products sold with the trademark are assigned a
    royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark (in
    lieu of ownership) from an independent party, and fair value is
    the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by
    owning the trademark. If the fair value of the trademark
    intangible asset exceeds its carrying value, there is no
    impairment charge. If the fair value of the trademark is less
    than its carrying value, an impairment charge would be
    recognized for the difference.

We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill
    at each reporting unit having goodwill using the required
    two-step approach. Our reporting units are either our coalitions
    or a business unit if discrete financial information is
    available and reviewed by coalition management. Two or more
    business units may be aggregated for impairment testing if they
    have similar economic characteristics. In the first step of the
    goodwill impairment test, we compare the carrying value of a
    business unit, including its recorded goodwill, to the fair
    value of the business unit. We estimate the fair value of a
    business unit using both income-based and market-based valuation
    methods. The principal method used is an income-based method in
    which the business unit’s forecasted future cash flows are
    discounted to their present value. In the market-based valuation
    method, the fair value of a business unit is estimated using
    multiples of revenues and of earnings before interest, taxes,
    depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) for
    (i) a group of comparable public companies and
    (ii) recent transactions, if any, involving comparable
    companies. Based on the range of fair values developed from the
    income and market-based methods, we determine the appropriate
    estimated fair value for the business unit. If the fair value of
    the business unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is
    not impaired and no further review is required. However, if the
    fair value of the business unit is less than its carrying value,
    we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to
    determine the impairment charge, if any. The second step
    involves a hypothetical allocation of the fair value of the
    business unit to its net tangible and intangible assets
    (excluding goodwill) as if the business unit were newly
    acquired, which results in an implied fair value of the
    goodwill. The amount of the impairment charge is the excess of
    the recorded goodwill over the implied fair value of the
    goodwill.

The income-based fair value methodology requires
    management’s assumptions and judgments regarding economic
    conditions in the markets in which we operate and conditions in
    the capital markets, many of which are outside of
    management’s control. At the business unit level, fair
    value estimation requires management’s assumptions and
    judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions
    on the specific business unit,



along with assessment of the business unit’s strategies and
    forecasts of future cash flows. Forecasts of individual business
    unit cash flows involve management’s estimates and
    assumptions regarding:

•

Annual cash flows arising from future revenues and
    profitability, changes in working capital, capital spending and
    income taxes for at least a 10 year forecast period. The
    forecast assumes that the business has matured and long-term
    growth levels have been reached by the end of this period.

•

A terminal growth rate for years beyond our initial forecast
    period. The terminal growth rate is generally comparable to
    historical growth rates for overall consumer spending and, more
    specifically, for apparel spending.

•

A discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in realizing
    the forecasted cash flows. A discount rate considers the
    risk-free rate of return on long-term Treasury securities, the
    risk premium associated with investing in equity securities of
    comparably-sized companies, beta obtained from comparable
    companies and the cost of debt for investment grade issuers. In
    addition, the discount rate considers any company specific risk
    in achieving the prospective financial information.

Under the market-based fair value methodology, judgment is
    required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions.
    Management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment
    tests are representative of those that would be used by market
    participants performing similar valuations of our business units.

In our 2010 evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived
    trademark intangible assets, we concluded that the carrying
    values of goodwill and of trademark intangible assets at our

7 For All
    Mankind

®

business unit exceeded their respective fair values based on the
    analysis of current and expected future economic conditions in
    conjunction with finalizing our strategic plan in the fourth
    quarter of 2010. Accordingly, we recognized impairment charges
    in our 2010 Consolidated Statement of Income of
    $195.2 million to write down the carrying value of the
    goodwill and $6.6 million to write down the carrying value
    of the nonamortized trademark intangible assets. Similarly in
    the prior year, we concluded that the carrying values of
    goodwill at our

Reef

®

,

Nautica

®

and

lucy

®

business units and the carrying values of trademark intangible
    assets at our

Reef

®

and

lucy

®

business units exceeded their respective fair values.
    Accordingly, we recognized impairment charges in our 2009
    Consolidated Statement of Income of $101.9 million to write
    down the carrying value of their goodwill and $20.1 million
    to write down the carrying value of their trademark intangible
    assets. The noncash charges of $201.7 million in 2010 and
    $122.0 million in 2009 did not have a significant impact on
    our financial position or debt covenants and no impact on our
    liquidity. The charges were based on estimates and judgments;
    changes to the fair value assumptions potentially would have
    resulted in different goodwill or intangible asset impairment
    charges. See Notes F, G and T of the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for additional information about the impairment
    charges recorded for these business units.

At the date of our most recent impairment test, except for the

7 For All
    Mankind

®

business unit discussed above and the

Splendid and Ella
    Moss

®

business unit discussed below, the estimated fair value of each
    of our business units exceeded its respective carrying value by
    at least 15%, and the estimated fair value of each
    indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset exceeded its
    respective carrying value by at least 20%. Accordingly, no other
    goodwill or trademark impairment charges were recorded. The

Splendid

®

and

Ella
    Moss

®

business unit has been part of our Contemporary Brands Coalition
    since our acquisition of those brands in 2009. The

Splendid

®

and

Ella
    Moss

®

brands are premium-priced lifestyle brands marketed to upscale
    department and specialty stores. In addition, the rollout of
    owned stores is a significant component in the growth model for
    these brands. Although the

Splendid

®

and

Ella
    Moss

®

brands have primarily performed as planned since their
    acquisition, there has not been significant growth in fair value
    of the business. Accordingly, at October 3, 2010 (the date
    of our annual impairment test), the business unit’s fair
    value was $304.2 million, which exceeded its carrying value
    by 7%. Goodwill in this business unit was $142.4 million.
    Further, the estimated fair value of the trademarks of this
    business unit exceeded their recorded amount
    ($98.9 million) by 19%.

It is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment or
    recoverability of goodwill or trademark intangible assets in any
    business unit could change in future periods if, for example,
    (i) our businesses do not perform as projected,
    (ii) overall economic conditions in 2011 or future years
    vary from our current assumptions, (iii) business
    conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit change
    from our current assumptions, (iv) investors require higher
    rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or
    (v) enterprise values of comparable publicly



traded companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable
    companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of
    revenues and EBITDA. A future impairment charge for goodwill or
    intangible assets could have a material effect on our
    consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Stock
    Options

We use a lattice option-pricing model to estimate the fair value
    of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of
    the Board of Directors. We believe that a lattice model provides
    a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can
    incorporate (i) historical option exercise patterns and
    multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for
    each of several groups of option holders and (ii) inputs
    that vary over time, such as assumptions for interest rates and
    volatility. We performed an annual review of all assumptions and
    believe that the assumptions employed in the valuation of each
    option grant are reflective of our outstanding options and
    underlying Common Stock and of our groups of option
    participants. Our lattice valuation is based on the assumptions
    listed in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

One of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is
    estimating the expected average life of the options before they
    are exercised. For each option grant, we based our estimates on
    evaluations of the historical and expected option exercise
    patterns for each of the groups of option holders that have
    historically exhibited different option exercise patterns. These
    evaluations included (i) voluntary stock option exercise
    patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of VF
    Common Stock and periods of time that options are outstanding
    before exercise and (ii) involuntary exercise patterns
    resulting from turnover, retirement and mortality.

Volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment. We
    based our estimate of future volatility on a combination of
    implied and historical volatility. Implied volatility was based
    on short-term (6 to 9 months) publicly traded

near-the-money

options on VF Common Stock. We measure historical volatility
    over a ten year period, corresponding to the contractual term of
    the options, using daily stock prices. Our assumption for
    valuation purposes was that expected volatility starts at a
    level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to
    the historical volatility over the remainder of the ten year
    option term.

Pension
    Obligations

VF sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering
    most full-time domestic employees employed before 2005 and an
    unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan that provides
    benefits in excess of the limitations imposed by income tax
    regulations. VF also sponsors defined benefit plans covering
    selected international employees. The selection of actuarial
    assumptions for determining our projected pension benefit
    liabilities and our annual pension expense is significant due to
    the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid.
    We annually update participant demographics and the expected
    amount and timing of benefit payments. We review annually the
    principal economic actuarial assumptions, summarized in
    Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and modify
    them based on current rates and trends. We also periodically
    review and modify as necessary other plan assumptions such as
    rates of compensation increases, retirement, termination,
    disability and mortality. We believe our assumptions
    appropriately reflect the participants in and benefits provided
    by the plans and result in the best estimate of the plans’
    future experience. Actual results may vary from the actuarial
    assumptions used.

One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is
    the discount rate. (This discussion of discount rate, and the
    discussion of return on assets in the next paragraph, relate
    specifically to our U.S. pension plans, which comprise over
    90% of plan assets and projected benefit obligations of our
    combined domestic and international plans.) The discount rate is
    used to estimate the present value of future cash outflows
    required to meet our projected benefit obligations. The discount
    rate reflects the estimated interest rate that VF could use to
    settle its projected benefit obligations at the valuation date.
    Our discount rate assumption is based on current market interest
    rates. We select our discount rate based on matching high
    quality corporate bond yields to the timing of projected benefit
    payments to participants in our U.S. pension plans. We use
    the population of U.S. corporate bonds rated ‘Aa’
    by Moody’s Investors Service or, if a Moody’s rating
    is not available, bonds rated ‘Aa’ by two other
    recognized rating services. From this population of over 600
    such bonds having at least $50 million outstanding that are
    noncallable/nonputtable unless with make-whole provisions, we
    exclude the highest and lowest yielding bonds. The plans’



projected benefit payments are matched to current market
    interest rates over the expected payment period, and a present
    value is developed that produces a single discount rate that
    recognizes our plans’ distinct liability characteristics.
    We believe that those ‘Aa’ rated issues meet the
    “high quality” intent of the applicable accounting
    standards and that our 2010 discount rate of 5.65% appropriately
    reflects current market conditions and the long-term nature of
    projected benefit payments to participants in our domestic
    pension plans. This lower discount rate, compared with the rate
    of 6.05% at the end of 2009, reflects the general decline in
    yields of U.S. government obligations and high quality
    corporate bonds during 2010. The discount rate for our plans may
    differ from the rates used by other companies because of longer
    expected duration of benefit payments reflecting (i) the
    higher percentage of female participants with a longer life
    expectancy and (ii) the higher percentage of inactive
    participants who will not begin receiving vested benefits for
    many years.

Another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the
    expected long-term rate of return on investments. Our investment
    objective is to maximize the long-term return through a
    diversified portfolio of assets with an acceptable level of
    risk. These risks include market, interest rate, credit,
    liquidity and foreign securities risks. Investment assets
    consist of domestic and international equity, corporate and
    governmental fixed income, real estate and commodity securities.
    We develop a projected rate of return for each of our investment
    asset classes based on many factors, including recent and
    historical returns, the estimated inflation rate, the premium to
    be earned in excess of a risk-free return, the premium for
    equity risk and the premium for longer duration fixed income
    securities. The weighted average projected long-term rates of
    return of the various assets held by the qualified plan provide
    the basis for the expected long-term rate of return actuarial
    assumption. Our rate of return assumption was 7.75% in 2010 and
    8.00% in 2009 and 2008. Although we have not changed the overall
    target mix of investments, we have over the last two years
    altered the investment mix to improve investment performance by
    (i) adding commodities as an asset class,
    (ii) increasing the allocation to fixed income investments,
    (iii) reducing the allocation to equity investments and
    (iv) increasing the allocation in equities to more
    international investments. As the qualified plan becomes more
    fully funded, our intent is to lengthen the average duration of
    fixed income investments to more closely match expected benefit
    payments so that the effect of interest rate changes on our
    plan’s investments will be better correlated with the
    benefit obligations the investments are intended to fund. The
    changes in asset allocation should, over time, reduce the

year-to-year

variability of our domestic plan’s funded status and
    resulting pension expense. Based on an evaluation of market
    conditions, projected market returns and planned changes in
    investment mix, we will continue to use a rate of return
    assumption of 7.75% for our U.S. plan for 2011. We monitor
    our plan’s asset allocation to balance anticipated
    investment returns with risk.

The funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is
    reflected in the balance sheet as the excess (or deficiency) of
    pension plan assets compared with projected benefit obligations
    payable to plan participants. The market value of our pension
    plan investment assets declined significantly in 2008 due to the
    global credit and financial market crisis, which resulted in the
    plans being underfunded by over $400 million at the end of
    2008. During 2009, the underfunded balance declined to
    $250.9 million primarily due to $200 million of
    discretionary VF cash contributions to the domestic plan and
    investment earnings on plan assets, partially offset by an
    increase in projected benefit obligations resulting from a
    reduction in the discount rate during the year. During 2010, the
    underfunded status of the plans improved once again due to
    $100 million of discretionary VF cash contributions and
    earnings on plan assets, partially offset by an increase in
    projected benefit obligations due to a further reduction in the
    discount rate during the year. The resulting underfunded status
    of $207.4 million is presented in the 2010 Consolidated
    Balance Sheet as $5.9 million of current liabilities and
    $201.5 million of noncurrent liabilities. The funded status
    of our plans recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheets could
    change significantly in future years depending on investment
    portfolio performance, the level of VF contributions to the
    plans, changes in the discount rate used to value projected
    benefit obligations, or other factors.

Differences in any year between actual results and the
    respective actuarial assumptions (e.g., investment performance,
    discount rates and other assumptions) do not affect that
    year’s pension expense but instead are deferred as
    unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in Accumulated Other
    Comprehensive Income in the balance sheet. At the end of 2010,
    there were $433.8 million of pretax deferred actuarial
    losses that resulted primarily from the substantial investment
    losses incurred during 2008 and the decline in discount rates
    over the last two years. These accumulated unrecognized
    actuarial losses resulted in an after tax amount of
    $266.1 million in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
    (Loss) in our 2010 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our policy is to
    amortize any



unrecognized actuarial gains and losses to future years’
    pension expense as follows: amounts which exceed 20% of
    beginning of the year projected benefit obligations are
    amortized over five years; amounts between the greater of 10% of
    projected benefit obligations or plan assets and 20% of
    projected benefit obligations are amortized over the expected
    average remaining service of active participants; and amounts
    less than the greater of 10% of projected benefit obligations or
    plan assets are not amortized.

Pension expense recognized in our financial statements was
    $67.6 million in 2010, $98.0 million in 2009 and
    $10.8 million in 2008. This compares with the cost of
    pension benefits actually earned by our covered active employees
    (commonly called “service cost”) of $18.1 million
    in 2010 and an average of $16.5 million per year over the
    last three years. Pension expense for 2010 and 2009 was
    significantly higher than the annual service cost because those
    years included the cost of amortizing the higher level of
    unrecognized actuarial losses (as discussed in the preceding
    paragraph). Looking forward, we expect our 2011 pension expense
    to decrease to approximately $50 million due to an increase
    in plan assets at the end of 2010.

The sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on our 2010
    pension expense and on projected benefit obligations at the end
    of 2010, all other factors being equal, is illustrated by the
    following:

As previously mentioned, we made a $100 million and a
    $200 million discretionary contribution to our domestic
    qualified pension plans during 2010 and 2009, respectively.
    Future funding obligations for our defined benefit plans depend
    on funding requirements under applicable laws and regulations,
    the interest rates used to determine those funding requirements
    and future performance of the plans’ investment portfolio.
    VF is not required under applicable regulations, and does not
    currently intend, to make a contribution to its domestic
    qualified pension plan during 2011 but does intend to make cash
    contributions totaling approximately $11 million during
    2011 to its other pension plans. We believe that VF has
    sufficient liquidity to make any required contributions to our
    pension plans in future years.

We have taken several steps to reduce the risk and volatility in
    our pension plans and their impact on our financial statements.
    Beginning in 2005, VF’s domestic defined benefit plans were
    closed to new entrants, which did not affect the benefits of
    existing plan participants at that date or their accrual of
    future benefits. Domestic employees hired after 2004, plus
    employees at certain acquired businesses not covered by those
    plans, participate in a defined contribution plan with VF
    contributing amounts based on a percentage of eligible
    compensation. As discussed in previous paragraphs, we made
    significant cash contributions to return the plans to a more
    fully funded status and have modified our investment strategy
    for plan assets. Finally, we have begun settling some
    participants’ accrued obligations by allowing a lump sum
    distribution election. On a longer-term basis, we believe the

year-to-year

variability of our retirement benefit expense should decrease.

Income
    Taxes

As a global company, VF is subject to income taxes and files
    income tax returns in over 100 domestic and foreign
    jurisdictions each year. The calculation of our income tax
    liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex
    tax laws and regulations, which are subject to legal and factual
    interpretation and significant management judgment.

VF’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal,
    state and foreign tax authorities, and those audits may result
    in proposed adjustments. We have reviewed all issues raised upon
    examination, as well as any exposure for issues that may be
    raised in future examinations. We have evaluated these potential
    issues under the “more-



likely-than-not” standard of the accounting literature. A
    tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is
    measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater
    than 50% likelihood of being realized. Such judgments and
    estimates may change based on audit settlements, court cases and
    interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Our income tax
    expense could be materially affected to the extent we prevail in
    a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a
    tax position for which valuation allowances have been
    established, or to the extent we are required to pay amounts
    greater than the established valuation allowances. We do not
    currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the
    ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties. There are no
    accruals for general or unknown tax expenses.

We have recorded $178.7 million of deferred income tax
    assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards,
    and we have recorded $137.2 million of valuation allowances
    against those assets. Realization of deferred tax assets related
    to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on
    future taxable income in specific jurisdictions, the amount and
    timing of which are uncertain, and on possible changes in tax
    laws. If we believe that we will not be able to generate
    sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses
    during the carryforward periods, we have recorded valuation
    allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts
    expected to be ultimately realized. In addition, we have
    recorded $12.7 million of valuation allowances against
    deferred income tax assets unrelated to operating loss and
    capital loss carryforwards. If in a future period we determine
    that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs
    from the net recorded amount, we would record an adjustment to
    income tax expense in that future period.

We have not provided U.S. income taxes on a portion of our
    foreign subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings because these
    earnings are permanently reinvested in the respective foreign
    jurisdictions. If we were to decide to remit those earnings to
    the United States in a future period, our provision for income
    taxes could increase in that period.

Non-GAAP Financial
    Information

VF is a global company that reports financial information in
    U.S. dollars in accordance with GAAP. Foreign currency
    exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by VF
    from translating our foreign revenues and expenses into
    U.S. dollars. These exchange rate fluctuations can have a
    significant effect on reported operating results and,
    accordingly, can affect the comparability of reported results.

To better explain our operating results, we use constant
    currency information, which excludes the effects of changes in
    foreign currency translation rates, to provide a framework to
    assess how our businesses performed relative to prior periods.
    Accordingly, we have provided supplemental constant currency
    financial information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, in
    the “Analysis of Results of Operations” section.
    Constant currency information represents the current year
    reported revenues after adjustment to eliminate the translation
    effects of changes in exchange rates. To calculate Coalition
    Revenues on a constant currency basis, revenues for the current
    year period for entities reporting in currencies other than the
    U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the
    average exchange rates in effect during the comparable period of
    the prior year (rather than the actual exchange rates in effect
    during the current year period).



We believe the following supplemental constant currency
    financial information is useful to investors to facilitate
    comparisons of operating results and better identify trends in
    our businesses:

These non-GAAP performance measures should be viewed in addition
    to, and not in lieu of or superior to, our financial results
    calculated in accordance with GAAP. Also, this supplemental
    information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
    reported by other companies.

Cautionary
    Statement on Forward-Looking Statements

From time to time, we may make oral or written statements,
    including statements in this Annual Report that constitute
    “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
    federal securities laws. These include statements concerning
    plans, objectives, projections and expectations relating to
    VF’s operations or economic performance, and assumptions
    related thereto.

Forward-looking statements are made based on our expectations
    and beliefs concerning future events impacting VF and therefore
    involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We caution that
    forward-looking statements are not guarantees and actual results
    could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the
    forward-looking statements.

Known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that
    could cause the actual results of operations or financial
    condition of VF to differ materially from those expressed or
    implied by such forward-looking statements are summarized in
    Item 1A. of this Annual Report.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

A discussion of VF’s market risks is incorporated by
    reference to “Risk Management” in Item 7.
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report.

Item 8.

Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data.

See “Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and
    Financial Statement Schedule” at the end of this Annual
    Report on

page F-1

for information required by this Item 8.

Item 9.

Changes
    in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure.

Not applicable.



Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures.

Conclusion
    Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures

Under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and the
    Chief Financial Officer, VF conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of VF’s
    “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

or

15d-15(e)

of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange
    Act”) as of January 1, 2011. These require that VF
    ensure that information required to be disclosed by VF in
    reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
    Commission’s rules and forms and that information required
    to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the
    Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to VF’s
    management, including the principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosures. Based on VF’s evaluation, the
    principal executive officer and the principal financial officer
    concluded that VF’s disclosure controls and procedures are
    effective.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

VF’s management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
    as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

VF’s management conducted an assessment of VF’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
    described in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework,

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
    assessment, VF’s management has determined that VF’s
    internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
    January 1, 2011. The effectiveness of VF’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2011 has
    been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
    registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
    which appears herein.

See “Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and
    Financial Statement Schedule” at the end of this annual
    report on

page F-1

for “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting.”

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in VF’s internal control over
    financial reporting that occurred during its last fiscal quarter
    that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
    materially affect, VF’s internal control over financial
    reporting.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of VF Corporation (“VF”) is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

VF’s management conducted an assessment of VF’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
    described in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework,

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
    assessment, VF’s management has determined that VF’s
    internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
    January 1, 2011.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of VF’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of January 1,
    2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
    independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
    their report included herein.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of V. F. Corporation

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all
    material respects, the financial position of V.F. Corporation
    and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) at
    January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010, and the results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended January 1, 2011 in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
    statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item
    15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the
    information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the
    related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion,
    the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of January 1,
    2011, based on criteria established in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
    The Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under
    Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement and whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
    audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As more fully described in Note A to the consolidated
    financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it
    accounts for noncontrolling interests effective January 4,
    2009.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

December

Note A —

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Description of Business:

VF Corporation (and
    its subsidiaries, collectively known as “VF”) is a
    global apparel company based in the United States. VF designs
    and manufactures or sources from independent contractors a
    variety of apparel and footwear for consumers of all ages.
    Products are marketed globally primarily under VF-owned brand
    names. VF has significant market shares in outdoor and action
    sports apparel, jeanswear and sportswear. VF is also a leader in
    travel gear, backpacks and technical outdoor equipment, and in
    occupational apparel.

Basis of Presentation:

The consolidated
    financial statements and related disclosures are presented in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
    (“GAAP”) in the United States of America. The
    consolidated financial statements include the accounts of VF and
    its majority-owned subsidiaries, after elimination of
    intercompany transactions and balances. For consolidated
    subsidiaries that are not wholly owned, the noncontrolling
    interests in net income, comprehensive income and
    stockholders’ equity are separately presented in the
    consolidated financial statements.

Investments in entities that VF does not control but has the
    ability to exercise significant influence (generally

20-50%

owned
    companies) are accounted for using the equity method of
    accounting. Equity method investments are recorded initially at
    cost in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Those
    amounts are adjusted to recognize VF’s proportional share
    of the investee’s earnings and dividends after the date of
    investment. VF’s share of net income of these investments,
    totaling $0.6 million in 2010, $0.8 million in 2009
    and $7.3 million in 2008, is included in Marketing,
    Administrative and General Expenses in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

Fiscal Year:

VF operates and reports using a
    52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to
    December 31 of each year. All references to “2010”,
    “2009” and “2008” relate to the 52 week
    fiscal years ended January 1, 2011 and January 2, 2010
    and the 53 week fiscal year ended January 3, 2009,
    respectively. Certain foreign subsidiaries report using a
    December 31 year-end due to local statutory requirements.
    For presentation purposes in this report, all fiscal years are
    presented as ended in December.

Use of Estimates:

In preparing the
    consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP,
    management makes estimates and assumptions that affect amounts
    reported in the consolidated financial statements and
    accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those
    estimates.

Changes in Accounting Policies:

During 2009,
    VF adopted the FASB’s new accounting guidance on
    noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements.
    The new guidance requires information about the entity as a
    whole, with separate information relating to the parent or
    controlling owners and to the noncontrolling (minority)
    interests, and provides guidance on the accounting for
    transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests.
    Upon adoption of the new guidance, the FASB required retroactive
    treatment for the presentation and disclosure requirements, with
    all other requirements to be applied prospectively. Accordingly,
    for VF’s previously issued consolidated financial
    statements:

•

Noncontrolling interests were reclassified from Other
    Liabilities to a separate component of Stockholders’ Equity.

•

Net Income was adjusted to separately present Net Income
    Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests.

•

Comprehensive Income was adjusted to separately present
    Comprehensive Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests.

During 2010, VF adopted the FASB’s new accounting guidance
    related to transfers of financial assets. This guidance modifies
    the requirements for removing financial assets from a balance
    sheet and requires additional disclosures about transfers of
    financial assets and any continuing involvement by the
    transferor. See Note C.

Also during 2010, VF adopted new accounting guidance for
    disclosures of fair value measurements. This guidance requires
    disclosures about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2
    of the fair value hierarchy. The guidance

F-10


VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements —
    (Continued)

also expands disclosures related to fair values of assets and
    liabilities, and valuation techniques used to measure fair
    value. See Note T.

During 2009, VF adopted the FASB’s new accounting guidance
    on business combinations. The new guidance revises how business
    combinations are accounted for, both at the acquisition date and
    in subsequent periods. The new guidance changes the accounting
    model for a business acquisition from a cost allocation standard
    to recognition of the fair value of the assets and liabilities
    of the acquired business, regardless of whether a 100% or a
    lesser controlling interest is acquired. See Note B.

Foreign Currency Translation:

The financial
    statements of most foreign subsidiaries are measured using the
    local currency as the functional currency. Assets and
    liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated
    into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the
    balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at
    average exchange rates during the period. Resulting translation
    gains and losses, and transaction gains and losses on long-term
    advances to foreign subsidiaries, are reported in Other
    Comprehensive Income (Loss) (“OCI”). For a foreign
    subsidiary that uses the U.S. dollar as its functional
    currency, the effects of remeasuring assets and liabilities into
    U.S. dollars are included in the Consolidated Statements of
    Income. Net transaction losses of $22.1 million in 2010,
    gains of $21.3 million in 2009 and losses of
    $18.9 million in 2008, arising from transactions
    denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of
    a particular entity, are included in the Consolidated Statements
    of Income.

Cash and Equivalents

are demand deposits, receivables
    from third party credit card processors, and highly liquid
    investments that have maturities within three months of their
    purchase dates. Cash equivalents totaling $530.5 million
    and $454.1 million at December 2010 and 2009, respectively,
    consist of institutional money market funds that invest in
    obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. or foreign
    governments and short-term time deposits of foreign commercial
    banks.

Accounts Receivable:

Trade accounts receivable
    are recorded at invoiced amounts, less estimated allowances for
    trade terms, sales incentive programs, customer markdowns and
    charge-backs, and returned products. Allowances are based on
    evaluations of specific product and customer circumstances,
    retail sales performance, historical and anticipated trends and
    current economic conditions. Royalty receivables are recorded at
    amounts earned based on the licensees’ sales of licensed
    products, subject in some cases to minimum annual amounts from
    individual licensees. VF maintains an allowance for doubtful
    accounts for estimated losses that will result from the
    inability of customers and licensees to make required payments.
    All accounts are subject to ongoing review of ultimate
    collectibility. The allowance considers specific customer
    accounts where collection is doubtful, as well as the inherent
    risk in ultimate collectibility of total balances. The amount of
    the allowance is determined considering the aging of balances,
    anticipated trends and economic conditions. Receivables are
    written off against the allowance when it is probable the
    amounts will not be recovered. There is no off-balance sheet
    credit exposure related to customer receivables.

Inventories

are stated at the lower of cost or market.
    Cost is net of purchase discounts or rebates received from
    vendors. Cost is determined on the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method for approximately 75% of
    total 2010 and 2009 inventories. For remaining inventories, cost
    is determined on the

last-in,

first-out (“LIFO”) method (primarily related to
    companies where LIFO is used for income tax purposes). The value
    of inventories stated on the LIFO method is not significantly
    different from the value determined under the FIFO method.

Long-lived Assets:

Property, plant and
    equipment, intangible assets and goodwill are recorded at cost.
    Improvements to property, plant and equipment that substantially
    extend the useful life of the asset, and interest cost incurred
    during construction of major assets, are capitalized. Assets
    under capital lease are recorded at the present value of minimum
    lease payments. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as
    incurred.

Cost for acquired intangible assets is fair value based
    generally on the present value of expected cash flows. These
    expected cash flows consider the stated terms of the rights or
    contracts acquired and expected renewal periods, if applicable.
    The number of renewal periods considered is based on
    management’s experience in renewing or extending similar
    arrangements, regardless of whether the acquired rights have
    explicit renewal or extension

F-11


VF
    CORPORATION

    Consolidated Financial Statements —
    (Continued)

provisions. Trademark intangible assets represent individual
    acquired trademarks, some of which are registered in over 100
    countries. Because of the significant number of trademarks,
    renewal of those rights is an ongoing process, with individual
    trademark renewals averaging 10 years. License intangible
    assets relate to numerous licensing contracts, with VF as either
    the licensor or licensee. Individual license renewals average
    four years. Costs incurred to renew or extend the lives of
    recognized intangible assets are not significant and are
    expensed as incurred. Goodwill represents the excess of cost of
    an acquired business over the fair value of net tangible assets
    and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is
    assigned at the business unit level, which at VF is typically
    one level below a reportable segment.

Depreciation of owned assets is computed using the straight-line
    method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging
    from 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment and up to
    40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements and assets
    under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of their
    estimated useful lives or the lease term.

Intangible assets having indefinite lives, consisting of major
    trademarks, and goodwill are not amortized. Other intangible
    assets, primarily customer relationships, contracts to license
    acquired trademarks to third parties and contracts to license
    trademarks from third parties, are amortized over their
    estimated useful lives ranging from less than one year to
    30 years. Amortization of intangible assets is computed
    using straight-line or accelerated methods consistent with the
    expected realization of benefits to be received. Depreciation
    and amortization expense related to producing or otherwise
    obtaining finished goods inventories is included in Cost of
    Goods Sold, and other depreciation and amortization expense is
    included in Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses.

VF’s policy is to review property and intangible assets
    with identified useful lives for possible impairment whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If
    forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset
    are not expected to be adequate to recover the asset’s
    carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess
    of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value.

VF’s policy is to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible
    assets and goodwill for possible impairment at the beginning of
    the fourth quarter each year, or whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets
    may not be recoverable. An intangible asset with an indefinite
    life (a major trademark) is evaluated for possible impairment by
    comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying value.
    An impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value of the
    trademark exceeds its estimated fair value. Goodwill is
    evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the fair value of
    a business unit with its carrying value, including the goodwill
    assigned to that business unit. An impairment charge is recorded
    if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair
    value. See Notes F, G and T for information related to
    impairment charges recorded in 2010 and 2009 for
    indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets and goodwill.

Derivative Financial Instruments

are measured at their
    fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains
    and losses are recognized as assets or liabilities,
    respectively, and classified as current or noncurrent based on
    the expected period of settlement. The accounting for changes in
    the fair value (i.e., gains and losses) of derivative
    instruments depends on whether a derivative has been designated
    and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and on the type
    of hedging relationship. The criteria used to determine if a
    derivative instrument qualifies for hedge accounting treatment
    are (i) whether an appropriate hedging instrument has been
    identified and designated to reduce a specific exposure and
    (ii) whether there is a high correlation between changes in
    the fair value of the hedging instrument and the identified
    exposure. A qualifying derivative is designated for accounting
    purposes, based on the nature of the hedging relationship, as a
    fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net
    investment in a foreign business. VF’s hedging practices
    and related accounting policies for each of the three types of
    hedging relationships are described in Note U. VF considers
    its foreign businesses to be long-term investments and does not
    hedge those net investments. VF does not use derivative
    instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Hedging cash
    flows are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows in the same category as the items being hedged.

F-12


VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements —
    (Continued)

VF formally documents hedging instruments and hedging
    relationships at the inception of each contract. Further, VF
    assesses, both at the inception of a contract and on an ongoing
    basis, whether the hedging instruments are effective in
    offsetting the risk of the hedged transactions. Occasionally, a
    portion of a derivative instrument will be considered
    ineffective in hedging the originally identified exposure due to
    a decline in amount or a change in timing of the hedged
    exposure. In that case, hedge accounting treatment is
    discontinued for the ineffective portion of that hedging
    instrument and any change in fair value for the ineffective
    portion is recognized in net income. Also, cash flow hedges of
    forecasted cash receipts are dedesignated as hedges when the
    forecasted sale is recognized. In that case, hedge accounting is
    discontinued, and the fair value of the hedging instrument is
    recognized in net income.

The counterparties to the derivative contracts are financial
    institutions having A-rated investment grade credit ratings. To
    manage its credit risk, VF continually monitors the credit risks
    of its counterparties, limits its exposure in the aggregate and
    to any single counterparty, and adjusts its hedging positions as
    appropriate. The impact of VF’s credit risk and the credit
    risk of its counterparties, as well as the ability of each party
    to fulfill its obligations under the contracts, is considered in
    determining the fair value of the derivative contracts. Credit
    risk has not had a significant effect on the fair value of
    VF’s derivative contracts. VF does not have any credit
    risk-related contingent features or collateral requirements with
    its derivative contracts.

Revenue Recognition:

Revenue is recognized
    when (i) there is a contract or other arrangement of sale,
    (ii) the sales price is fixed or determinable,
    (iii) title and the risks of ownership have been
    transferred to the customer and (iv) collection of the
    receivable is reasonably assured. Net Sales to wholesale
    customers and sales through the internet are recognized when the
    product has been received by the customer. Net Sales at
    VF-operated retail stores are recognized at the time products
    are purchased by consumers, net of expected returns. Shipping
    and handling costs billed to customers are included in Net
    Sales. Net Sales are recorded after reduction of estimated
    allowances for trade terms, sales incentive programs, customer
    markdowns and charge-backs, and product returns. Sales incentive
    programs with wholesale customers include stated discounts.
    Sales incentive programs entered into directly with consumers
    include rebate and coupon offers. These allowances are estimated
    based on evaluations of specific product and customer
    circumstances, retail sales performance, historical and
    anticipated trends, and current economic conditions;
    historically, they have not differed significantly from actual
    results. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected from
    customers and remitted directly to governmental authorities are
    excluded from Net Sales.

Royalty Income is recognized as earned based on the greater of
    the licensees’ sales of licensed products at rates
    specified in the licensing contracts or contractual minimum
    royalty levels.

Cost of Goods Sold

for VF-manufactured goods includes all
    materials, labor and overhead costs incurred in the production
    process. Cost of Goods Sold for contracted or purchased finished
    goods includes the purchase costs and related overhead. In both
    cases, overhead includes all costs related to manufacturing or
    purchasing finished goods, including costs of planning,
    purchasing, quality control, freight, duties, royalties paid to
    third parties and shrinkage. For product lines having a
    warranty, a provision for estimated future repair or replacement
    costs, based on historical and anticipated trends, is recorded
    when these products are sold. Sales incentives to consumers in
    the form of free products are included in Cost of Goods Sold.

Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses

includes
    costs of product development, selling, marketing and
    advertising, VF-operated retail stores, warehousing, shipping
    and handling, licensing and administration. Advertising costs
    are expensed as incurred and totaled $426.8 million in
    2010, $327.3 million in 2009 and $399.1 million in
    2008. Advertising costs include cooperative advertising payments
    made to VF’s customers as direct reimbursement for their
    documented costs of advertising VF’s products. Cooperative
    advertising costs, totaling $40.4 million in 2010,
    $37.1 million in 2009 and $42.1 million in 2008, are
    independently verified to support the fair value of advertising
    reimbursed by VF. Shipping and handling costs for delivery of
    products to customers totaled $206.2 million in 2010,
    $188.2 million in 2009 and $218.4 million in 2008.
    Expenses related to

F-13

royalty income, including amortization of licensing intangible
    assets, were $13.9 million in 2010, $14.5 million in
    2009 and $20.8 million in 2008.

Rent Expense:

VF enters into noncancelable
    operating leases for retail stores, distribution centers, office
    and other real estate and for equipment. Leases for real estate
    have initial terms ranging from 3 to 15 years, generally
    with renewal options. Leases for equipment typically have
    initial terms ranging from 2 to 5 years. Most leases have
    fixed rentals, with many of the real estate leases providing for
    additional payments based on sales volume or for payments of
    real estate taxes and occupancy-related costs. Contingent rent
    expense, owed when Net Sales at individual retail store
    locations exceed a stated base amount, is recognized when the
    liability is probable. Rent expense for leases having rent
    holidays or scheduled rent increases is recorded on a
    straight-line basis over the lease term beginning when VF has
    possession or control of the leased premises. Lease incentives
    received from landlords and the difference between straight-line
    rent expense and scheduled rent payments are deferred in Other
    Liabilities (Note L) and amortized as a reduction of
    rent expense over the lease term.

Self-insurance:

VF is self-insured for a
    substantial portion of its employee group medical, workers’
    compensation, vehicle, property and general liability exposures.
    Liabilities for self-insured exposures are accrued at the
    present value of amounts expected to be paid based on historical
    claims experience and actuarial data for forecasted settlements
    of claims filed and for incurred but not yet reported claims.
    Accruals for self-insured exposures are included in current and
    noncurrent liabilities based on the expected period of payment.
    Excess liability insurance has been purchased to cover claims in
    excess of self-insured amounts.

Income Taxes

are provided on Net Income for financial
    reporting purposes. Income Taxes are based on amounts of taxes
    payable or refundable in the current year and on expected future
    tax consequences of events that are recognized in the
    consolidated financial statements in different periods than they
    are recognized in tax returns. As a result of timing of
    recognition and measurement differences between financial
    accounting standards and income tax laws, temporary differences
    arise between amounts of pretax financial statement income and
    taxable income, and between reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and their
    respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
    reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect estimated
    future tax effects attributable to these temporary differences
    and to net operating loss and net capital loss carryforwards,
    based on tax rates expected to be in effect for years in which
    the differences are expected to be settled or realized.
    Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future
    taxable income in specific jurisdictions. Valuation allowances
    are used to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts considered
    likely to be realized. U.S. deferred income taxes are not
    provided on undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries where
    such earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested.
    Accrued income taxes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets include
    unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and
    penalties, appropriately classified as current or noncurrent.
    The provision for Income Taxes also includes estimated interest
    and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

Earnings Per Share:

Basic earnings per share
    is computed by dividing net income attributable to
    VF Corporation common stockholders by the weighted average
    number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period.
    Diluted earnings per share assumes conversion of potentially
    dilutive securities such as stock options, restricted stock and
    restricted stock units.

Concentration of Risks:

VF markets products to
    a broad customer base throughout the world. Products having
    various price points are sold through multiple channels of
    distribution, including specialty stores, department stores,
    national chains, mass merchants, VF-operated stores, and

e-commerce

sites. VF’s ten largest customers, all

U.S.-based

retailers, accounted for 26% of 2010 total revenues, and sales
    to our largest customer accounted for 10% of 2010 revenues.
    Sales are made on an unsecured basis under customary terms that
    may vary by product, channel of distribution or geographic
    region. VF continuously monitors the creditworthiness of its
    customers and has established internal policies regarding
    customer credit limits. The breadth of product offerings,
    combined with the large number and geographic diversity of its
    customers, limits VF’s concentration of risks.

Legal and Other Contingencies:

Management
    periodically assesses, based on the latest information
    available, liabilities and contingencies in connection with
    legal proceedings and other claims that may arise from time to
    time. When it is probable that a loss has been or will be
    incurred, a loss, or a reasonable estimate of the loss, is
    recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Estimates of
    losses are adjusted in the period in which additional
    information becomes available or circumstances change. A
    contingent liability is disclosed when there is at least a
    reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. Management
    believes that the outcome of any outstanding or pending matters,
    individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material
    adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Reclassifications:

Certain prior year amounts
    have been reclassified to conform with the 2010 presentation.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards:

New
    accounting guidance issued by the FASB, but not effective until
    after 2010, is not expected to have a significant effect on
    VF’s consolidated financial position, results of operations
    or disclosures.

Note B —

Acquisitions

On March 10, 2010, VF acquired 100% ownership of its former
    50%-owned joint venture that marketed

Vans

®

branded products in the wholesale channel in Mexico. As part of
    this transaction, VF also acquired the

Vans

®

retail stores that had been operated by our joint venture
    partner (together with the wholesale business, “Vans
    Mexico”). The purchase price of this business was
    $31.0 million. The carrying value of our initial 50%
    investment, recorded in Other Assets, was $7.9 million at
    the acquisition date, which included our equity in the net
    income of the joint venture recognized through the acquisition
    date. VF recognized a $5.7 million gain in Miscellaneous
    Income in 2010 from remeasuring its original 50% investment in
    the joint venture to fair value, measured using the income and
    market approaches. The investment in the joint venture was
    accounted for using the equity method of accounting through the
    acquisition date. Revenues and pretax earnings recognized in
    VF’s 2010 operating results since the acquisition date were
    $28.2 million and $6.4 million (excluding the
    $5.7 million gain), respectively. Acquisition expenses
    included in VF’s results of operations were not
    significant. Vans Mexico is reported as part of the
    Outdoor & Action Sports Coalition.

On March 11, 2009, VF completed the acquisition of Mo
    Industries Holdings, Inc. (“Mo Industries”), owner of
    the

Splendid

®

and

Ella
    Moss

®

brands of premium sportswear. This transaction resulted in VF
    acquiring the remaining two-thirds equity of Mo Industries not
    previously owned for $160.8 million (consisting of
    $156.1 million of cash and $4.7 million of notes) and
    payment of $52.3 million of debt. In June 2008, VF had
    acquired one-third of the outstanding equity of Mo Industries
    for $77.4 million. The initial investment was recorded in
    Other Assets and was accounted for using the equity method of
    accounting. The carrying value of the investment was $80.5
    million at the time of the March 2009 acquisition, consisting of
    the initial cost of the investment, plus the equity in net
    income of the investment through the acquisition date. VF
    recognized a $0.3 million gain in Miscellaneous Income
    during 2009 from remeasuring its one-third interest in Mo
    Industries to fair value. Operating results of the acquisition
    have been included in the consolidated financial statements
    since March 11, 2009, and are reported as part of the
    Contemporary Brands Coalition.

On July 31, 2008, VF acquired 100% ownership of its former
    50%-owned joint venture that markets

Lee

®

branded products in Spain and Portugal (“Lee Spain”).
    The cost of the additional investment was $25.4 million,
    consisting of $14.9 million in cash, plus the transfer of
    certain nonmonetary assets held by the former joint venture. The
    investment in the joint venture was accounted for using the
    equity method of accounting through July 2008, and Lee Spain has
    been accounted for as a consolidated subsidiary subsequent to
    that date. Operating results are reported as part of the
    Jeanswear Coalition.

For acquisitions prior to 2008, contingent consideration of
    $3.8 million and $5.8 million was recorded as Goodwill
    in 2009 and 2008, respectively. An additional $1.7 million
    may become payable in 2011, which would also be recorded as
    Goodwill. In addition, the 2007 acquisition of substantially all
    of the operating assets of Majestic

F-15


VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements —
    (Continued)

Athletic, Inc. included $10.0 million of contingent
    consideration accrued at the acquisition date, of which
    $5.2 million, $3.3 million and $1.5 million was
    paid in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Management has allocated the purchase price of each acquisition
    to acquired tangible and intangible assets, and assumed
    liabilities, based on their respective fair values. The
    following table summarizes the fair values of the assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed for Vans Mexico in 2010 and Mo
    Industries in 2009 at their respective dates of acquisition:

Management believes the

trademarks and tradenames have indefinite lives. Amounts
    assigned to amortizable intangible assets relate primarily to
    customer relationships, which are being amortized using
    accelerated methods over their estimated useful lives of
    10 years for Vans Mexico and 18 years for Mo
    Industries.

The purchase price of each acquisition exceeded the fair value
    of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, with the
    excess purchase price recorded as Goodwill. Factors that
    contributed to recognition of Goodwill included
    (i) expected growth rates and profitability of the acquired
    companies, (ii) the ability to expand the brands within
    their markets or to new markets, (iii) their experienced
    workforces, (iv) VF’s strategies for growth in
    revenues, income and cash flows and (v) expected synergies
    with existing VF business units. The Mo Industries acquisition
    is consistent with VF’s goal of acquiring strong lifestyle
    brands that have high growth potential within their target
    markets, and the Vans Mexico acquisition gave VF control of this
    leading brand in additional international markets. None of the
    goodwill recognized for these acquisitions is expected to be
    deductible for income tax purposes.

    other interests in the receivables. At the end of 2010 and 2009,
    accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets had been
    reduced by $112.3 million and $74.2 million,
    respectively, related to balances sold under this program.
    During 2010 and 2009, VF sold a total of $1,062.8 million
    and $239.3 million, respectively, of accounts receivable at
    their stated amounts, less a funding fee. The funding fee
    charged by the financial institution for this program, which
    totaled $1.8 million in 2010 and $0.4 million in 2009,
    is recorded in Miscellaneous Expense. Net proceeds of this
    accounts receivable sale program are recognized as part of the
    change in accounts receivable in Cash Provided by Operating
    Activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

    discussed in Note B, VF acquired the remaining equity in March

Note I —

Short-term
    Borrowings

Short-term borrowings consist of international lending
    arrangements with outstanding balances of $36.6 million at
    December 2010 and $45.5 million at December 2009. These
    arrangements are unsecured and had a weighted average interest
    rate of 7.7% at the end of 2010 and 7.6% at the end of 2009.

VF has a $1.0 billion senior domestic unsecured revolving
    bank credit agreement that supports issuance of up to
    $1.0 billion in commercial paper, with any unused portion
    available for general corporate purposes. This agreement, which
    expires in October 2012, has a borrowing rate of LIBOR plus
    0.19% and a facility fee of 0.06% per year. The agreement
    contains a financial covenant requiring VF’s ratio of
    consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization, as
    defined, to remain below 60%. The agreement contains other
    covenants and events of default, including limitations on liens,
    subsidiary indebtedness, sales of assets, and a
    cross-acceleration event of default if more than
    $100.0 million of other debt is in default and has been
    accelerated by the lenders. If VF fails in the performance of
    any covenant under this agreement, the banks may terminate their
    obligation to lend, and any bank borrowings outstanding under
    this agreement may become due and payable. At the end of 2010,
    VF was in compliance with all covenants, and the entire amount
    of the credit agreement was available for borrowing, except for
    $16.7 million related to standby letters of credit issued
    under the agreement on behalf of VF.

Certain international subsidiaries, with VF Corporation as
    guarantor, have a €250.0 million (U.S. dollar
    equivalent of $334.2 million at December 2010) senior
    international unsecured revolving bank credit agreement. This
    agreement, which expires in October 2012, has a borrowing rate
    of EURIBOR plus 0.20% and a facility fee of 0.06% per year. The
    terms and conditions of the international bank credit agreement
    are substantially the same as those of VF’s
    $1.0 billion domestic bank credit agreement. At the end of
    2010, VF was in compliance with all covenants, and the entire
    amount of the credit agreement was available for borrowing.

All notes, along with any amounts outstanding under our
    revolving bank credit agreements (Note I), rank equally as
    senior unsecured obligations of VF. All notes contain customary
    covenants and events of default, including limitations on liens
    and sale-leaseback transactions and a cross-acceleration event
    of default. The cross-acceleration provision of the 2033 notes
    is triggered if more than $50.0 million of other debt is in
    default and has been accelerated by the lenders. For the 2017
    and 2037 notes, the cross-acceleration trigger is
    $100.0 million. If VF fails in the performance of any
    covenant under the indentures that govern the respective notes,
    the trustee or lenders may declare the principal due and payable
    immediately. At the end of 2010, VF was in compliance with all
    covenants. None of the long-term debt agreements contain
    acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in
    credit ratings. However, for the 2017 and 2037 notes, if there
    were a change in control of VF and, as a result of the change in
    control, those notes were rated below investment grade by
    recognized rating agencies, then VF would be obligated to
    repurchase those notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount
    of notes repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

VF

Notes to

VF may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal
    to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount, plus
    accrued interest to the redemption date, or (ii) the sum of
    the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of
    principal and interest discounted to the redemption date at an
    adjusted treasury rate, as defined, plus 20 basis points
    for the 2017 notes and 25 basis points for the 2037 notes,
    plus accrued interest to the redemption date.

The 2033 notes have a principal balance of $300.0 million
    and are recorded net of unamortized original issue discount.
    Interest expense on these notes is recorded at an effective
    annual interest rate of 6.19%, including amortization of the
    original issue discount, deferred gain on an interest rate
    hedging contract (Note U) and debt issuance costs.

The $200.0 million of 8.5% notes were repaid at their
    maturity during 2010.

Capital leases relate primarily to buildings and improvements
    (Note E). These leases expire at dates through 2021 and
    have an effective interest rate of 5.1%.

The scheduled payments of long-term debt and future minimum
    lease payments for capital leases at the end of 2010 are

Retirement
    and Savings Benefit Plans

VF has several retirement and savings benefit plans covering
    eligible employees. VF retains the right to amend any aspect of
    the plans, or to curtail or discontinue any of the plans,
    subject to local regulations.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans:

VF sponsors a
    noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering
    most full-time domestic employees employed before 2005 and an
    unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan that provides
    benefits earned that exceed limitations imposed by income tax
    regulations. VF also sponsors contributory defined benefit plans
    covering selected international employees. These defined benefit
    plans provide pension benefits based on compensation and years
    of service. The components of pension cost for these plans were
    as follows:

amortized to pension expense as follows: amounts in excess of
    20% of projected benefit obligations at the beginning of the
    year are amortized over five years; amounts between (i) 10%
    of the greater of projected benefit obligations or plan assets
    and (ii) 20% of projected benefit obligations are amortized
    over the expected average remaining service of active
    participants; and amounts less than the greater of 10% of
    projected benefit obligations or plan assets are not amortized.
    Deferred actuarial losses and deferred prior service costs are
    recorded in OCI. The estimated amounts of Accumulated OCI to be
    amortized to pension expense in 2011 are $42.6 million of
    deferred actuarial losses and $3.5 million of deferred
    prior service costs.

Management’s investment objective is to invest the
    plans’ assets in a diversified portfolio of securities to
    provide long-term growth in plan assets that, along with VF
    contributions, will meet the plans’ benefit payment
    obligations. Investment strategies focus on diversification
    among several asset classes (in accordance with the target
    allocations presented below), a balance of long-term investment
    return at an acceptable level of risk, and liquidity to meet
    benefit payments. Plan assets are generally liquid securities
    diversified across equity, fixed income, real estate and other
    asset classes. Funds are allocated among several independent
    investment managers who have full discretion to manage their
    portion of the investments, subject to strategy and risk
    guidelines established with each manager. The overall strategy,
    the resulting allocations of plan assets and the performance of
    individual investment managers are continually monitored.
    Derivative instruments may be used by investment managers for
    hedging purposes and by the commodity investment manager to gain
    exposure to commodities through the futures market. There are no
    investments in VF debt or equity securities and no significant
    concentrations of security risk.

The expected long-term rate of return on the plans’ assets
    was based on an evaluation of the weighted average of the
    expected returns for the major asset classes in which the plans
    invest. Expected returns by asset class were developed through
    analysis of historical market returns, current market
    conditions, inflation expectations, and equity and credit risks.
    The target allocation of investments by asset class for domestic
    defined benefit plans in 2011 is provided below:

VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements —
    (Continued)

VF makes contributions to its pension plans sufficient to meet
    minimum funding requirements under applicable laws, plus
    discretionary amounts as considered prudent. VF made
    discretionary contributions totaling $100.0 million and
    $200.0 million to the domestic qualified defined benefit
    plan in 2010 and 2009, respectively. VF is not required under
    applicable regulations, and does not currently intend, to make a
    contribution to the domestic qualified defined benefit pension
    plan during 2011 but does intend to make contributions totaling
    approximately $11.0 million to the other pension plans. The
    plans’ estimated future benefit payments, including
    benefits attributable to estimated future employee service and
    compensation increases, are approximately $66.3 million in
    2011, $70.6 million in 2012, $73.3 million in 2013,
    $77.5 million in 2014, $81.3 million in 2015 and
    $468.6 million for the years 2016 through 2020.

Deferred Compensation Plans:

VF sponsors a
    nonqualified retirement savings plan for employees whose
    contributions to a tax qualified 401(k) plan would be limited by
    provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan allows
    participants to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation
    and to receive matching contributions for a portion of the
    deferred amounts. Expense under this plan was $3.9 million
    in 2010 and 2009, and $4.4 million in 2008. Participants
    earn a return on their deferred compensation based on their
    selection of a hypothetical portfolio of publicly traded mutual
    funds, fixed income fund and VF Common Stock. Changes in the
    fair value of the participants’ hypothetical investment
    selections are recorded as an adjustment to deferred
    compensation liabilities, with an offset to compensation expense
    in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Deferred compensation,
    including accumulated earnings on the participant-directed
    investment selections, is distributable in cash at
    participant-specified dates or upon retirement, death,
    disability or termination of employment. Similarly, under a
    separate nonqualified plan, nonemployee members of the Board of
    Directors may elect to defer their Board compensation and invest
    it in hypothetical shares of VF Common Stock. At December 2010,
    VF’s liability to participants in the deferred compensation
    plans was $213.7 million, of which $23.0 million was
    recorded in Accrued Liabilities (Note J) and
    $190.7 million was recorded in Other Liabilities
    (Note L).

VF has purchased (i) publicly traded mutual funds, a fixed
    income fund and VF Common Stock in the same amounts as most of
    the participant-directed investment selections underlying the
    deferred compensation liabilities and (ii) variable life
    insurance contracts that, in turn, invest in institutional funds
    that are substantially the same as other participant-directed
    investment selections. These investment securities and earnings
    thereon, held in an irrevocable trust, are intended to provide a
    source of funds to meet the deferred compensation obligations,
    subject to claims of creditors in the event of VF’s
    insolvency, and an economic hedge of the financial impact of
    changes in deferred compensation liabilities. At December 2010,
    the fair value of the investments was $207.1 million, of
    which $23.0 million was recorded in Other Current Assets
    and $184.1 million was recorded in Other Assets
    (Note H). The VF Common Stock purchased to match
    participant-directed investment selections is treated for
    financial reporting purposes as treasury stock (Note N),
    which is the primary reason for the difference in carrying value
    of the investment securities and the recorded deferred
    compensation liabilities. Realized and unrealized gains and
    losses on these investments (other than VF Common Stock) are
    recorded in compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements
    of Income and substantially offset losses and gains resulting
    from changes in deferred compensation liabilities to
    participants.

Other Retirement and Savings Plans:

VF also
    sponsors defined contribution retirement and savings plans. For
    domestic employees not covered by VF’s defined benefit
    plans or a collective bargaining agreement, VF contributes a
    specified percentage of an employee’s gross earnings to a
    qualified retirement plan. VF also sponsors 401(k) and other
    retirement and savings plans for certain domestic and foreign
    employees where cash contributions are based on a specified
    percentage of employee contributions. Expense for these plans
    totaled $14.6 million in 2010, $13.3 million in 2009
    and $16.0 million in 2008.

    acquired over the $1 per share stated value of Common Stock is
    deducted from Retained Earnings. In addition,
    246,860 shares of VF Common Stock at the end of 2010,
    241,446 shares at the end of 2009 and 261,092 shares
    at the end of 2008 were held in trust for deferred compensation
    plans (Note M). These shares held for deferred compensation
    plans are treated for financial reporting purposes as treasury
    shares at a cost of $10.7 million, $9.9 million and
    $10.8 million at the end of 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
    (Loss):

Comprehensive income consists of net
    income and specified components of Other Comprehensive Income
    (“OCI”). OCI consists of changes in assets and
    liabilities that are not included in net income under GAAP but
    are instead deferred and accumulated within a separate component
    of stockholders’ equity in the balance sheet. VF’s
    comprehensive income is presented in the Consolidated Statements
    of Comprehensive Income. The deferred components of other
    comprehensive income (loss) are reported, net of related income
    taxes, in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in

Note O —
    Stock-based Compensation

VF is authorized to grant nonqualified stock options, restricted
    stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock to officers,
    key employees and nonemployee members of VF’s Board of
    Directors under the amended and restated 1996 Stock Compensation
    Plan approved by stockholders. All stock-based compensation
    awards are classified as equity awards, which are accounted for
    in Stockholders’ Equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
    Compensation cost for all awards expected to vest is recognized
    over the shorter of the requisite service period or the vesting
    period. Awards that do not vest are forfeited. VF has elected to
    compute income tax benefits associated with stock option awards
    under the short cut method as allowed by the applicable
    accounting literature. Total stock-based compensation cost and
    the related income tax benefits recognized in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income were $63.5 million and
    $23.4 million in 2010, $36.0 million and
    $13.3 million for 2009 and $31.6 million and
    $11.6 million for 2008, respectively. Stock-based
    compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory was
    $0.3 million at December 2010 and $0.2 million at
    December 2009. At the end of 2010, there was $35.0 million
    of total unrecognized compensation cost related to all
    stock-based compensation arrangements that will be recognized
    over a weighted average period of 0.8 years.

At the end of 2010, there were 12,561,824 shares available
    for future grants of stock options and stock awards under the
    1996 Stock Compensation Plan. Shares for option exercises are
    issued from VF’s authorized but unissued Common Stock. VF
    has a practice of repurchasing shares of Common Stock in the
    open market to offset, on a long-term basis, dilution caused by
    awards under equity compensation plans.

Stock Options:

Stock options are granted with
    an exercise price equal to the market value of VF Common Stock
    on the date of grant. Stock options vest in equal annual
    installments over three years, and compensation cost is
    recognized ratably over the vesting period. All options are
    granted with ten year terms. The fair value on the date of

$18.58

Expected volatility over the contractual term of an option was
    based on a combination of the implied volatility from publicly
    traded options on VF Common Stock and the historical volatility
    of VF Common Stock. The expected term represents the period of
    time over which options that vest are expected to be outstanding
    before exercise. VF used historical data to estimate option
    exercise behaviors and to estimate the number of options that
    would vest. Groups of employees that have historically exhibited
    similar option exercise behaviors were considered separately in
    estimating the expected term for each employee group. Dividend
    yield represents expected dividends on VF Common Stock for the
    contractual life of the options. Risk-free interest rates for
    the periods during the contractual life of the option were the
    implied yields at the date of grant from the U.S. Treasury
    zero coupon yield curve.

Restricted Stock Units:

VF has granted
    performance-based RSUs to key employees as a long-term
    incentive. These RSUs enable the recipients to receive shares of
    VF Common Stock at the end of a three year period. Each RSU has
    a potential final value ranging from zero to two shares of VF
    Common Stock. The number of shares earned by participants, if
    any, is based on achievement of a three year baseline
    profitability goal and annually established performance goals
    for profitability, revenues and operating cash flow set by the
    Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Shares are
    issued to participants in the year following the conclusion of
    each three year performance period.

VF has also granted nonperformance-based RSUs to a smaller group
    of key employees and members of the Board of Directors. Each RSU
    entitles the holder to one share of VF Common Stock. The
    employee RSUs generally vest four years after the date of grant
    and the Director RSUs vest upon grant.

Dividend equivalents, payable in additional shares of VF Common
    Stock, accrue without compounding on the RSUs, and are subject
    to the same risks of forfeiture as the RSUs.

Restricted Stock:

VF has granted restricted
    shares of VF Common Stock to certain members of management. The
    fair value of the restricted shares, equal to the market value
    of VF Common Stock at the grant date, is recognized ratably over
    the vesting period. Restricted shares are issued in the name of
    the employee but generally do not vest until four years after
    the date of grant. Dividends are payable in additional
    restricted shares when the restricted stock vests, and are

As of the end of 2010, VF has not provided deferred taxes on
    $1,002 million of undistributed earnings from certain
    international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to
    be permanently reinvested. The undistributed earnings would
    become taxable in the United States if management decided to
    repatriate earnings for business, tax or foreign exchange
    reasons. If this were the case, U.S. income taxes would be
    provided net of foreign taxes already paid.

VF has been granted a lower effective income tax rate for
    taxable earnings for years 2010 through 2014 in a foreign
    jurisdiction based on certain investment and employment level
    requirements. This lower rate, when compared with the
    country’s statutory rate, resulted in an income tax
    reduction of $6.0 million ($0.05 per diluted share) in
    2010. Income tax was reduced by $7.1 million ($0.06 per
    diluted share) in 2009 and $12.6 million ($0.11 per diluted
    share) in 2008 pursuant to a separate agreement that expired in
    2009. In addition, VF has been granted a lower effective income
    tax rate on taxable earnings in another foreign jurisdiction for
    the period 2010 through 2019. This lower rate, when compared
    with the country’s statutory rate, resulted in an income
    tax reduction of $1.7 million ($0.02 per diluted share) in
    2010.

VF has potential tax benefits totaling $106.6 million for
    foreign operating loss carryforwards, of which
    $88.8 million have an unlimited carryforward life. In
    addition, there are $26.4 million of potential tax benefits
    for federal operating loss carryforwards that expire between
    2017 and 2027 and $14.4 million of benefits for state
    operating loss carryforwards that expire between 2011 and 2029.

federal and state operating loss carryforward amounts relate to
    acquired companies for periods prior to their acquisition by VF.
    A valuation allowance has been provided where it is more likely
    than not that the deferred tax assets related to those operating
    loss carryforwards will not be realized.

Valuation allowances totaled $100.0 million for available
    foreign operating loss carryforwards, $13.3 million for
    available federal operating loss carryforwards,
    $9.2 million for available state operating loss
    carryforwards and $12.7 million for other foreign deferred
    income tax assets. During 2010, VF had a net increase in
    valuation allowances of $39.7 million related to foreign
    operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets,
    $0.8 million related to state operating loss carryforwards,
    $0.4 million related to federal capital loss carryforwards,
    and a decrease of $1.4 million related to foreign currency
    translation effects. In addition, VF has potential tax benefits
    totaling $31.3 million for federal capital loss
    carryforwards that expire between 2011 and 2014 upon which a
    valuation allowance of $14.7 million was provided.

The unrecognized tax benefits and interest of $57.6 million

VF files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as
    well as separate and combined income tax returns in numerous
    state and foreign jurisdictions. In the United States, the
    Internal Revenue Service (“IRS’) commenced an
    examination of tax years 2007, 2008 and 2009 during this fiscal
    year. Additionally, the audit of tax years 2002 and 2003 was
    settled in 2008, and the IRS examination of tax years 2004, 2005
    and 2006 was completed in 2009. VF has appealed the results of
    the 2004 to 2006 examination to the IRS Appeals office. VF is
    currently subject to examination by various state and
    international tax authorities. Management regularly assesses the
    potential outcomes of both ongoing and future examinations for
    the current and prior years to ensure VF’s provision for
    income taxes is sufficient. The outcome of any one examination
    is not expected to have a material impact on VF’s
    consolidated financial statements. Management believes that some
    of these audits and negotiations will conclude during the next
    12 months. Management also believes that it is reasonably
    possible that the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits may
    decrease by $15.9 million within the next 12 months
    due to settlement of audits and expiration of statutes of
    limitations, all of which would reduce income tax expense.

Note Q —

Business
    Segment Information

VF’s businesses are grouped by product categories, and by
    brands within those product categories, for internal financial
    reporting used by management. These groupings of businesses
    within VF are referred to as “coalitions” and are the
    basis for VF’s reportable business segments, as described
    below:

•

Outdoor & Action Sports

— Outerwear,
    action sports apparel and footwear, backpacks, bags, and
    technical equipment

•

Jeanswear

— Jeanswear and related products

•

Imagewear

— Occupational apparel and licensed
    apparel

•

Sportswear

— Fashion sportswear

•

Contemporary Brands

— Premium lifestyle apparel

•

Other

— Primarily VF Outlets

Operating results of the

lucy

®

business unit have been reclassified from the Contemporary
    Brands Coalition to the Outdoor & Action Sports
    Coalition consistent with the change in internal management
    reporting beginning in 2010.

Management at each of the coalitions has direct control over and
    responsibility for its revenues, operating income and assets,
    hereinafter termed “Coalition Revenues,”
    “Coalition Profit” and “Coalition Assets,”
    respectively. VF management evaluates operating performance and
    makes investment and other decisions based on Coalition Revenues
    and Coalition Profit. Accounting policies used for internal
    management reporting at the individual coalitions are consistent
    with those in Note A, except as stated below and except
    that inventories are

F-34


VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements —
    (Continued)

valued on a FIFO basis. Common costs such as information systems
    processing, retirement benefits and insurance are allocated to
    the coalitions based on appropriate metrics such as usage or
    employment.

Corporate costs, (other than allocated costs directly related to
    the coalitions), impairment charges and net interest expense are
    not controlled by coalition management and therefore are
    excluded from the Coalition Profit performance measure used for
    internal management reporting. Corporate and Other Expenses
    consists of corporate headquarters expenses that are not
    allocated to the coalitions (including compensation and benefits
    of corporate management and staff, certain legal and
    professional fees, and administrative and general) and other
    expenses related to but not allocated to the coalitions for
    internal management reporting (including a portion of defined
    benefit pension costs, development costs for management
    information systems, costs of maintaining and enforcing certain
    of VF’s trademarks, adjustments for the LIFO method of
    inventory valuation and miscellaneous consolidating
    adjustments). Defined benefit pension plans in the United States
    are centrally managed. The current year service cost component
    of pension cost is allocated to the coalitions, while other cost
    components are reported in Corporate and Other.

Coalition Assets, for internal management purposes, are those
    used directly in or resulting from the operations of each
    business unit, such as accounts receivable, inventories and
    property, plant and equipment. Corporate assets include
    corporate facilities, investments held in trust for deferred
    compensation plans and information systems assets.

    respectively, and $215.0 million thereafter. In addition,
    VF will receive $8.8 million in income over the period of a
    noncancelable sublease through 2016.

VF has entered into licensing agreements that provide VF rights
    to market products under trademarks owned by other parties.
    Royalties under these agreements are recognized in Cost of Goods
    Sold in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Certain of these
    agreements contain minimum royalty and minimum advertising
    requirements. Future minimum royalty payments, including any
    required advertising payments, are $61.9 million,
    $82.4 million, $74.8 million, $77.4 million and
    $25.9 million for the years 2011 through 2015,
    respectively, and $55.9 million thereafter.

On December 20, 2010, VF signed an asset purchase agreement
    to acquire the trademarks and related intellectual property of
    Rock and Republic Enterprises, Inc., for approximately
    $57 million, subject to customary conditions and entry of a
    confirmation order in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
    District of New York.

In the ordinary course of business, VF has entered into purchase
    commitments for raw materials, contract production and finished
    products. These agreements, typically ranging from 2 to
    6 months in duration, require total payments of
    $839.2 million in 2011. In addition, VF has a remaining
    commitment to purchase $67.5 million of finished product,
    with a minimum of $15.0 million per year, in connection
    with the sale of a business in a prior year.

VF has entered into commitments for (i) service and
    maintenance agreements related to its management information
    systems, (ii) capital spending and (iii) advertising.

Fair
    Value Measurements

Fair value is the price that would be received from the sale of
    an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., an exit price)
    in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly
    transaction between market participants. In determining fair
    value, the accounting standards distinguish between
    (i) market data obtained or developed from independent
    sources (i.e., observable data inputs) and (ii) a reporting
    entity’s own data and assumptions that market participants
    would use in pricing an asset or liability (i.e., unobservable
    data inputs). Financial assets and financial liabilities
    measured and reported at fair value are classified in a three
    level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in the
    valuation process. The hierarchy is based on the observability
    and objectivity of the pricing inputs, as follows:

•

Level 1

— Quoted prices in active markets
    for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2

— Significant directly observable
    data (other than Level 1 quoted prices) or significant
    indirectly observable data through corroboration with observable
    market data. Inputs would normally be (i) quoted

F-38


VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements —
    (Continued)

prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities,
    (ii) quoted prices in inactive markets for identical or
    similar assets or liabilities or (iii) information derived
    from or corroborated by observable market data.

•

Level 3

— Prices or valuation techniques
    that require significant unobservable data inputs. Inputs would
    normally be a reporting entity’s own data and judgments
    about assumptions that market participants would use in pricing
    the asset or liability.

The fair value measurement level for an asset or liability is
    based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to
    the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques maximize the
    use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
    inputs.

Derivative instruments represent unrealized gains or losses on
    foreign currency forward exchange contracts, which are the
    differences between (i) the functional currency value of
    the foreign currency to be received or paid at the
    contracts’ settlement date and (ii) the functional
    currency value to be sold or purchased at the forward exchange
    rate at the balance sheet dates.

VF purchases investment securities that substantially mirror
    liabilities to participants in VF’s nonqualified deferred
    compensation plans. These securities, held in an irrevocable
    trust, consist of mutual funds (classified as
    Level 1) and a separately managed fixed income fund
    (classified as Level 2). Fair value of the separately
    managed

F-39


VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements —
    (Continued)

fixed income fund included in investment securities is its daily
    net asset value. Fair value of liabilities under deferred
    compensation plans is the amount payable to participants, based
    on the fair value of participant-directed investment selections.

The carrying value of all other financial assets and financial
    liabilities is their cost, which may differ from fair value. At
    December 2010 and December 2009, the carrying values of
    VF’s cash held as demand deposits, accounts receivable,
    life insurance contracts, short-term borrowings, accounts
    payable and accrued liabilities approximated their fair value.
    The fair value of VF’s long-term debt, including the
    current portion, was $1,025.1 million at the end of 2010,
    compared with its carrying value of $938.6 million, and was
    $1,202.6 million at the end of 2009, compared with its
    carrying value of $1,141.7 million. Fair value for
    long-term debt was estimated based on quoted market prices of
    similar debt instruments or values of comparable borrowings.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements:

Goodwill
    and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for possible
    impairment at least annually. During the 2010 impairment test,
    management concluded that the carrying value of goodwill in the

7 For All
    Mankind

®

business unit exceeded its fair value and, accordingly, recorded
    an impairment charge of $195.2 million to write down the
    goodwill to its implied fair value (Note G). Management
    also concluded that the carrying value of the

7 For All
    Mankind

®

trademark intangible asset exceeded its fair value and,
    accordingly, recorded an impairment charge of $6.6 million
    to write down the asset to its fair value (Note F).
    Similarly in 2009, management recorded goodwill impairment
    charges totaling $101.9 million to write down the goodwill
    of its

These nonrecurring fair value measurements were developed using
    significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). For goodwill,
    the primary valuation technique used was an income methodology
    based on management’s estimates of forecasted cash flows
    for each business unit, with those cash flows discounted to
    present value using rates commensurate with the risks of those
    cash flows. In addition, management used a market-based
    valuation method involving analysis of market multiples of
    revenues and of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
    and amortization (“EBITDA”) for (i) a group of
    comparable public companies and (ii) recent transactions,
    if any, involving comparable companies. For trademark intangible
    assets, management used the income-based relief-from-royalty
    valuation method in which fair value is the discounted value of
    forecasted royalty revenues arising from a trademark using a
    royalty rate that an independent party would pay for use of that
    trademark.

Management’s assumptions at each valuation date were based
    on analysis of current and expected economic conditions and the
    updated strategic plan for each business unit. Assumptions used
    were similar to those that would be used by market participants
    performing valuations of these business units. Information
    regarding the fair value assessments of the

7 For

premium-priced lifestyle brand is marketed to upscale department
    and specialty stores. Premium apparel sales were significantly
    impacted by the recession that began in late 2007 as many
    consumers reduced their spending for luxury goods, which
    resulted in the closure of approximately one-half of the premium
    apparel specialty retail stores in the United States. Factors
    that led to management’s current expectation of reduced
    revenue and earnings growth included the expectation of slower
    growth for sales of

products in the premium apparel channel for the next several
    years. After the

    remained at the end of December 2010.

Reef

:  When

    the 2009 impairment review was performed, the

Reef

®

business unit had not met the revenue and earnings growth
    forecasted at its acquisition in 2005. Factors that led to
    management’s expectation of reduced revenue and earnings
    growth included expectation of a slow economic recovery and
    continued low consumer spending for the next several years, and
    a revised business strategy, led by a new management team
    installed in 2009, to focus on the brand’s core sandals
    business and to reduce its apparel lines. Operating performance
    for the

Reef

®

business unit improved in 2010, and no additional impairment
    charges were required in the 2010 impairment review. There was
    $48.3 million of goodwill and $74.4 million of
    indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets remaining at the
    end of December 2010 and December 2009.

lucy

®

:

The

lucy

®

business unit was acquired in August 2007. Management’s
    intent at the acquisition date was to refine the product
    offerings and store design and then to aggressively open new
    stores for several years. When the impairment review was
    performed in 2009, management had not made as much progress as
    planned, recessionary conditions existed in the United States,
    the number of stores had not been expanded, and the business had
    not been profitable. These factors, and particularly
    management’s expectation of a slow economic recovery, led
    to a reduced revenue forecast in the 2009 impairment review. At
    the beginning of 2010 responsibility for the

lucy

®

business was transferred from the Contemporary Brands Coalition
    to the Outdoor & Action Sports Coalition where the

lucy

®

business unit is now benefiting from the technical product
    expertise, design staff and retail competencies of

The North
    Face

®

.

    Further, several underperforming stores were closed in the first
    quarter of 2010. Operating performance for the

lucy

®

business unit improved in 2010, and no additional impairment
    charges were required. There was $39.3 million of goodwill
    and $40.3 million of indefinite-lived trademark intangible
    assets remaining at the end of December 2010 and 2009.

Nautica

®

:  When

    the 2009

Nautica

®

impairment review was performed, management’s expectation
    of reduced revenue and earnings growth was based on recessionary
    conditions since the end of 2007 which had negatively impacted
    retail sales in the department  store channel, including sales
    of
    Nautica

®

brand products, and had also impacted sales at
    Nautica

®

retail outlet stores. Further, the department store channel of
    distribution in the United States had undergone consolidation
    over the last several years, resulting in the closing of a
    number of stores. In 2010, operating performance for the

Nautica

®

business unit was stable and consistent with the 2009 forecast;
    therefore, no additional impairment charges were required. There
    was $153.7 million of goodwill remaining at the end of
    December 2010 and 2009.

Note U —
    Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

VF is exposed to risks in its ongoing business operations. Some
    of these risks are managed by using derivative financial
    instruments. Derivative financial instruments are contracts
    whose value is based on, or “derived” from, changes in
    the value of an underlying currency exchange rate, interest rate
    or other financial asset or index.

VF conducts business in many foreign countries and therefore is
    subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
    Exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on the
    U.S. dollar value of operating results and net assets
    denominated in foreign currencies. VF does not attempt to manage
    translation risk but does use derivative contracts to manage the
    exchange rate risk of specified cash flows or transactions
    denominated in various foreign currencies. VF manages exchange
    rate risk on a consolidated basis, which allows exposures to be
    netted. The use of derivative financial instruments allows VF to
    reduce the overall exposure to risks from exchange rate
    fluctuations in its cash flows and earnings, since gains and
    losses in the value of the derivative contracts offset losses
    and gains in the value of the underlying hedged exposures. In
    addition, in prior years VF had used derivatives in limited
    instances to hedge interest rate risk.

Summary of Derivative Instruments:

All of
    VF’s derivative instruments meet the criteria for hedge
    accounting at the inception of the hedging relationship.
    However, derivative instruments that are cash flow hedges

F-41


VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements —
    (Continued)

of forecasted cash receipts are dedesignated as hedges near the
    end of their term and, accordingly, do not qualify for hedge
    accounting after the date of dedesignation. The notional amounts
    of outstanding derivative contracts at December 2010 and
    December 2009 totaled $1.1 billion and $857 million,
    respectively, consisting of contracts hedging primarily
    exposures to the euro, British pound, Mexican peso, Polish zloty
    and Canadian dollar. Derivative contracts, consisting of forward
    exchange contracts, have maturities ranging from one month to
    20 months. Amounts of outstanding derivatives in the

VF’s Fair Value Hedge Strategies and Accounting
    Policies:

VF has a hedging program to reduce the
    risk that future cash flows for firm commitments will be
    impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. VF may
    enter into derivative contracts to hedge intercompany loans
    between a domestic company and a foreign subsidiary or between
    two foreign subsidiaries having different functional currencies.

For a derivative instrument that is designated and qualifies as
    a fair value hedge (i.e., hedging the exposure to changes in the
    fair value of an asset or liability attributable to a particular
    risk), changes in the fair value of the derivative are
    recognized in earnings as an offset, on the same line, to the
    earnings impact of the underlying hedged item.

VF’s Cash Flow Hedge Strategies and Accounting
    Policies:

VF has a hedging program to reduce the
    variability of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign
    currencies. VF uses derivative contracts to hedge a portion of
    the exchange risk for its forecasted inventory purchases and
    production costs and for its forecasted cash receipts arising
    from sales of inventory. In addition, VF hedges the receipt in
    the United States of forecasted intercompany royalties from its
    foreign subsidiaries.

For a derivative instrument that is designated and qualifies as
    a cash flow hedge (i.e., hedging the variability in expected
    cash flows attributable to a particular currency risk), periodic
    changes in the fair value of the effective portion of the
    derivative are reported as a component of OCI and deferred in
    Accumulated OCI in the balance sheet. The deferred derivative
    gain or loss is reclassified into earnings as an offset, on the
    same line, to the earnings impact of the underlying hedged
    transaction (e.g., in cost of goods sold when the hedged
    inventories are sold, or in net sales when the hedged item
    relates to cash receipts from forecasted sales). As discussed in
    the

Derivative Contracts not Designated as Hedges

section
    below, cash flow hedges of forecasted cash receipts are
    dedesignated as hedges when the sale is recorded, and hedge
    accounting is not applied after that date.

Following is a summary of the effects of cash flow hedging
    relationships included in VF’s Consolidated Statements of
    Income for 2010 and 2009:

VF’s Net Investment Hedge Strategies and Accounting
    Policies:

In limited instances, VF may choose to
    hedge the risk of changes in its investments in foreign
    subsidiaries. Changes in the fair value of derivatives

    (Continued)

designated as net investment hedges, except for any ineffective
    portion, are reported as a component of OCI and deferred in
    Accumulated OCI, along with the foreign currency translation
    adjustments on that investment. Upon settlement of net
    investment hedges, cash flows are classified in investing
    activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
    Following is a summary of the effects on net investment hedging
    relationships included in VF’s Consolidated Statement of
    Income for 2010:

To be recognized as a gain (loss) on the sale or substantial
    liquidation of the hedged net investment.

There were no significant amounts recognized in earnings for the
    ineffective portion of any hedging relationships during the last
    three years.

At December 2010, Accumulated OCI included $4.0 million of
    net deferred pretax losses for foreign exchange contracts that
    are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next
    12 months. Actual amounts to be reclassified to earnings
    will depend on exchange rates when currently outstanding
    derivative contracts are settled.

In addition, in 2003 VF entered into an interest rate swap
    derivative contract to hedge the interest rate risk for issuance
    of long-term debt due in 2033. The contract was terminated
    concurrent with the issuance of the debt, with the realized gain
    deferred in Accumulated OCI. The remaining pretax gain of
    $2.6 million at December 2010, deferred in Accumulated OCI,
    will be reclassified into earnings over the remaining term of
    the debt.

Derivative Contracts not Designated as
    Hedges:

As noted in the preceding section, cash
    flow hedges of forecasted cash receipts are dedesignated as
    hedges when the forecasted sale is recognized. At that time, the
    amount of unrealized hedging gain or loss is recognized in Net
    Sales, and hedge accounting is not applied after the date of
    dedesignation. These derivatives remain outstanding and serve as
    an economic hedge of foreign currency exposures related to the
    ultimate collection of the trade receivables. During this period
    that hedge accounting is not applied, changes in the fair value
    of the derivative contracts are recognized directly in earnings.
    During 2010 and 2009, VF recorded net losses of
    $3.3 million and net gains of $1.1 million,
    respectively, in Miscellaneous Income (Expense) for derivatives
    not designated as hedging instruments, effectively offsetting
    the net remeasurement gains or losses on the related accounts
    receivable. There were no derivative contracts not designated as
    hedges in 2008.
