PART I

Item 1.

Business

.

V.F.
Corporation, organized in 1899, is a global leader in the design, production, procurement, marketing and distribution of branded lifestyle apparel, footwear and related products. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “VF,”
“we,” “us” and “our” used herein refer to V.F. Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.

VF’s diverse portfolio of more than 30 brands meets consumer needs across a broad spectrum of activities and lifestyles. Our
unparalleled ability to connect with consumers, as diverse as the company’s brand portfolio, creates a unique platform for sustainable, long-term growth. Our long-term growth strategy is focused on four drivers:

•

Lead in innovation by delivering new products and experiences that consistently delight customers, to drive core growth and strong gross margins;

•

Connect with consumers by gaining a deep understanding of their behavior, values and preferences to inspire brand engagement and loyalty;

•

Serve consumers directly, reaching them across multiple channels — wherever and whenever they shop; and,

•

Expand geographically, taking advantage of VF’s scale within every region and channel in which we operate.

VF is diversified across brands, product categories, channels of distribution, geographies and consumer
demographics. We own a broad portfolio of brands in the outerwear, footwear, denim, backpack, luggage, accessory, sportswear, occupational and performance apparel categories. Our largest brands are

The North Face

®

, Vans

®

,

Timberland

®

,

Wrangler

®

,

Lee

®

,
Nautica

®

,

Majestic

®

and

Kipling

®

.

Our products are marketed to consumers shopping in specialty stores, department
stores, national chains, mass merchants and our own direct-to-consumer operations.

Our direct-to-consumer business includes
VF-operated stores, concession retail stores and e-commerce sites. Revenues from the direct-to-consumer business represented 27% of VF’s total 2015 revenues.

Many of our brands sell products in international markets through licensees, agents, distributors and independently-operated partnership stores. To provide diversified products across multiple channels of
distribution in different geographic areas, we balance our own manufacturing capabilities with sourcing of finished goods from independent contractors. We utilize state-of-the-art technologies for inventory replenishment that enable us to
effectively and efficiently get the right assortment of products that match consumer demand. In 2015, VF derived approximately 70% of its revenues from the Americas region, 20% from Europe and 10% from its Asia Pacific business.

For both management and internal financial reporting purposes, VF is organized by groupings of businesses called “coalitions”.
The five coalitions are Outdoor & Action Sports, Jeanswear, Imagewear, Sportswear and Contemporary Brands. These coalitions are our reportable segments for financial reporting purposes. Coalition management has the responsibility to build
and operate their brands, with certain financial, administrative and systems support and disciplines provided by central functions within VF.



The following table summarizes VF’s primary owned and licensed brands by coalition:

Financial information regarding VF’s coalitions is included in Note P to the consolidated financial
statements, which are included at Item 8 of this report.

Outdoor & Action Sports Coalition

Jeanswear Coalition

Our Jeanswear coalition markets denim and related
casual apparel products globally.

The

Wrangler

®

brand offers denim, apparel, accessories and footwear
through mass merchants and mid-tier department stores in the U.S., VF-operated stores, and online at www.wrangler.com.

Wrangler

®

westernwear is distributed primarily through western specialty stores, as well as various online retail sites.

Lee

®

brand products are sold through mid-tier and traditional department stores in the U.S., and online at
www.lee.com. The

Rustler

®

and

Riders

®

by Lee

®

brands are marketed to mass merchant and regional discount stores
in the U.S. Our

Rock

& Republic

®

brand has an exclusive wholesale distribution and licensing arrangement with Kohl’s Corporation that covers all branded apparel, accessories, and other merchandise in the U.S. and
Canada.

Wrangler

®

and

Lee

®

products outside of the U.S. have a higher fashion consideration and, as a result, higher selling prices.
VF’s largest international jeanswear businesses are located in Europe and Asia, where

Wrangler

®

and

Lee

®

products are sold through department, specialty and concession retail stores. We also market

Wrangler

®

and

Lee

®

products to mass merchant, department and specialty stores in Canada and Mexico, as well as to department and
specialty stores in South America. In key international markets, we are expanding our reach through VF-operated stores, which are an important vehicle for presenting our brands’ image and marketing message directly to consumers. We currently
have more than 75 VF-operated stores primarily located in Europe, South America, and Asia, and are continuing to expand our brands in emerging markets. In international markets where VF does not have retail operations,

Wrangler

®

and

Lee

®

products are marketed through distributors, agents, licensees and over 900 single brand or multi-brand
partnership stores.

Our world-class supply chain, including owned manufacturing facilities along with advanced vendor-managed
inventory and retail floor space management programs with many of our major retailer customers, gives us a competitive advantage in our U.S. jeanswear business. We receive point-of-sale information from these customers on a daily or weekly basis, at
an individual store and style-size-color stock keeping unit level. We then ship products based on that customer data to ensure their selling floors are appropriately stocked with products that match their shoppers’ needs. Our system
capabilities allow us to analyze our retail customers’ sales, demographic and geographic data to develop product assortment recommendations that maximize the productivity of their jeanswear selling space and optimize their inventory investment.

We intend to drive growth through superior product innovation, consumer insight and marketing strategies. Growth in the U.S.
will be balanced across mass merchant, mid-tier and traditional department stores, and western specialty businesses. International growth will be driven by expansion of our existing businesses in Asia, Latin America and key European markets.

Imagewear Coalition

Our Imagewear coalition consists of the Image business (occupational workwear apparel and uniforms) and the Licensed Sports Group (“LSG”) business (owned and licensed athletic apparel). The
Image and LSG businesses represent approximately 53% and 47%, respectively, of total coalition revenues.

The Image business provides uniforms and career occupational apparel for workers in North America and
internationally, under the

Red
Kap

®

brand (premium workwear),
the

Bulwark

®

brand (flame resistant and protective apparel primarily for the petrochemical,
utility and mining industries) and the

Horace Small

®

brand



(apparel for law enforcement and public safety personnel). Products include a wide range of functionally designed shirts, pants, coveralls and outerwear. Image revenues are significantly
correlated with the overall level of employment in the U.S.

Approximately 70% of Image revenues are from
industrial laundries, resellers and distributors that in turn supply customized workwear to employers for production, service and white-collar personnel. Since industrial laundries and distributors maintain minimal inventories of work clothes,
VF’s ability to offer rapid delivery of products in a broad range of sizes is an important advantage in this market. Our commitment to customer service, supported by an automated central distribution center with several satellite locations,
enables customer orders to be filled within 24 hours of receipt. As a result, the

Red Kap

®

and

Bulwark

®

brands have a strong presence in the reseller distributor market and are growing in the workwear retail market.

The Image business also develops and manages uniform programs through custom-designed websites for major business customers and governmental organizations. These websites provide the employees of our
customers with the convenience of shopping for their work and career apparel via the Internet.

In our
LSG business, we design and market sports apparel and fanwear under licenses granted by major sports leagues, individual athletes and related organizations, including Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the Major League Baseball
Players Association, the National Basketball Association, the National Football League Players Association, the National Hockey League, the Nippon Professional Baseball League and selected major colleges and universities. In addition, the LSG
business is a major supplier of licensed

Harley-Davidson

®

apparel to Harley-Davidson
dealerships.

Under license from Major League Baseball, the

Majestic

®

brand is the official on-field uniform of all 30 major
league teams.

Majestic

®

brand adult
and youth-size authentic, replica jerseys and fanwear are sold through sporting goods and athletic specialty stores, department stores and major league stadiums. Sports apparel and fanwear marketed under other licensed labels are distributed through
department, mass merchant, sporting goods and athletic specialty stores and e-commerce partners. Our quick response capabilities allow us to deliver products to retailers within hours following major sporting events such as the Super Bowl, the World
Series and conference or division playoff championships.

We believe there is a strategic opportunity to grow revenues through
the continued extension of product and service capabilities to new industrial and service apparel distribution channels, markets, and geographies.

Sportswear Coalition

The Sportswear coalition
consists of the

Nautica

®

brand and the

Kipling

®

brand’s North American business. The

Kipling

®

brand’s business outside of North America is included in the
Outdoor & Action Sports coalition.

Nautica

®

brand sportswear is marketed through department stores, specialty
stores, VF-operated stores and at www.nautica.com. The

Nautica

®

brand is one of the leading men’s sportswear collection brands in department stores in the U.S. Other

Nautica

®

product lines include men’s outerwear, underwear and swimwear, and men’s and women’s sleepwear. We
operate over 80

Nautica

®

brand stores in premium and better outlet centers across the
U.S.

The

Nautica

®

brand is licensed to independent parties in the U.S. for apparel categories not produced by VF (e.g., tailored
clothing, dress shirts, neckwear, women’s swimwear and outerwear, children’s clothing) and for non-apparel categories (e.g., accessories, fragrances, watches, eyewear, footwear, luggage, bed and bath products, furniture). Outside the
U.S.,

Nautica

®

products are licensed
for sale in more than 50 countries, including over 250

Nautica

®

brand stores operated by independent licensees in Asia, Europe, North and South America and the Middle East.



The

Kipling

®

brand’s North American business includes handbags,
luggage, backpacks, totes and accessories. In the U.S.,

Kipling

®

products are sold through department, specialty and luggage stores, more than 30 VF-operated full-price and outlet stores, and at www.kipling.com. In Canada, the

Kipling

®

brand is sold through specialty and department stores. In the
U.S., the

Kipling

®

brand has seen
significant growth, driven by new stores, comparable store growth, an expanding e-commerce business, and increased distribution.

We believe there is the potential to grow

Nautica

®

brand revenue and improve profit performance through the growth of core sportswear products, increased average selling prices, improved product assortments and enhanced customer experiences across
our wholesale, outlet store, and e-commerce channels. There is also the potential for expanding
the

Kipling

®

brand through our
handbag and accessories relationship with Macy’s, Inc., e-commerce, travel retail stores, and additional VF-operated stores.

Contemporary Brands Coalition

Our Contemporary Brands coalition is focused on premium lifestyle brands, and includes the

7 For All Mankind

®

,

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

brands.

The

7 For All Mankind

®

brand offers premium denim and related products for women and men. While the core business remains focused on denim, the collection also includes sportswear products, such as knit and woven tops,
sweaters, jackets and accessories. The

7 For All Mankind

®

brand is marketed primarily in North America and Europe through premium department stores, specialty stores, over 80 VF-operated stores and over 40 independently-operated partnership stores.
Products are also sold online at www.7forallmankind.com.

The

Splendid

brand offers premium tops and casual apparel for women, men and
children, and the

Ella

Moss

®

brand offers premium sportswear for women and girls. These brands, noted for their soft wearable fabrics and vibrant colors, are marketed to upscale department and specialty stores primarily in the
U.S. They are also sold through over 30 VF-operated

Splendid

®

brand stores and one

Ella Moss

®

brand store, and at www.splendid.com and www.ellamoss.com.

Direct-To-Consumer
Operations

Our direct-to-consumer business includes full-price stores, outlet stores, e-commerce, and concession retail
locations. Direct-to-consumer revenues were 27% of total VF revenues in 2015 compared with 26% in 2014.

Our full-price
stores allow us to display a brand’s full line of products with fixtures and imagery that support the brand’s positioning and promise to consumers. These experiences provide high visibility for our brands and products and enable us to stay
close to the needs and preferences of our consumers. The complete and impactful presentation of products in our stores also helps to increase sell-through of VF products at our wholesale customers due to increased brand awareness, education and
visibility. VF-operated full-price stores generally provide gross margins that are well above VF averages.

In addition, VF
operates outlet stores in both premium outlet malls and more traditional value-based locations. These outlet stores serve an important role in our overall inventory management and profitability by allowing VF to sell a significant portion of excess,
discontinued and out-of-season products at better prices than otherwise available from outside parties, while maintaining the integrity of our brands.

Our growing global direct-to-consumer operations include 1,520 stores at the end of 2015. We operate retail store locations for the following brands:

Vans

,

Timberland

, The North Face

and

Ella Moss

®

. We also operate over 75

VF Outlet

®

stores in the U.S. that sell a broad selection of excess VF products, as well as other non-VF products. Approximately 70% of VF-operated stores offer
products at full price, and the remainder are outlet locations.



Approximately 60% of our stores are located in the Americas region (55% in the U.S.), 25% in Europe and 15% in the Asia Pacific region. Additionally, we have over 1,100 concession retail stores
located principally in Europe and Asia.

E-commerce is our fastest growing direct-to-consumer channel and
represented approximately 16% of our direct-to-consumer business in 2015. We currently market the following brands online:

®

, Eastpak

and

Reef

®

. We continue to expand our e-commerce initiatives by rolling out additional, country-specific brand sites in Europe
and Asia, which enhances our ability to deliver a superior, localized consumer experience.

We expect our
direct-to-consumer business to continue to grow at a faster pace than VF’s overall growth rate as we continue to drive higher comparable store sales, open new stores and expand our e-commerce presence. We opened 186 stores during 2015,
concentrating on the brands where we see higher retail growth potential —

Vans

®

,

The North Face

®

,

Timberland

®

and

Kipling

®

.

In addition to our direct-to-consumer operations, our
licensees, distributors and other independent parties own and operate over 3,000 partnership stores. These are primarily mono-brand retail locations selling VF products that have the appearance of VF-operated stores. Most of these partnership stores
are located in Europe and Asia, and are concentrated in the

brands.

Licensing Arrangements

As part of our strategy of expanding market penetration of VF-owned brands, we enter into licensing agreements with independent parties
for specific apparel and complementary product categories when such arrangements provide more effective manufacturing, distribution and marketing than could be achieved internally. We provide support to these business partners and ensure the
integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design, quality control, advertising, marketing and distribution of licensed products.

Licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of VF brands. License agreements are for fixed terms of generally 3 to 5 years, with conditional renewal options. Each licensee pays royalties to VF based on
its sales of licensed products, with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement. Royalties generally range from 4% to 10% of the licensing partners’ net licensed products sales. Royalty income was $126.1 million in 2015 (1% of
total revenues), primarily from the

Nautica

®

,

Vans

®

,

Lee

®

,

Timberland

®

, and

Wrangler

®

brands. In addition, licensees of our brands are generally
required to spend from 1% to 3% of their net licensed product sales to advertise VF’s products. In some cases, these advertising amounts are remitted to VF for advertising on behalf of the licensees.

VF has also entered into license agreements to use trademarks owned by third parties. We market apparel under licenses granted by Major
League Baseball, the Major League Baseball Players Association, the National Football League, the National Football League Players Association, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Inc.,
major colleges and universities, and individual athletes and related organizations, most of which contain minimum annual royalty and advertising requirements.

Manufacturing, Sourcing and Distribution

Product design and innovation,
including fit, fabric, finish and quality, are important elements across our businesses. These functions are performed by employees located in our global supply chain organization and our branded business units across the globe.

VF recently launched three strategic global innovation centers that focus on product innovation in technical apparel, footwear and
jeanswear. The centers are staffed with dedicated scientists, engineers and technical designers who combine proprietary insights with consumer needs, and a deep understanding of technology and new materials. The innovation centers are expected to
drive brand equity and sustained long-term growth.



VF’s centralized global supply chain organization is responsible for producing,
procuring and delivering products to our customers. VF is highly skilled in managing the complexities associated with our global supply chain. On an annual basis, VF sources or produces approximately 557 million units spread across more than 30
brands. Our products are obtained from 28 VF-operated manufacturing facilities and approximately 1,900 contractor manufacturing facilities in over 60 countries. Additionally, we operate 32 distribution centers and 1,520 retail stores. Managing this
complexity is made possible by the use of a network of information systems for product development, forecasting, order management and warehouse management, along with our core enterprise resource management platforms.

In 2015, 23% of our units were manufactured in VF-owned facilities and 77% were obtained from independent contractors. Products
manufactured in VF facilities generally have a lower cost and shorter lead times than products procured from independent contractors. Products obtained from contractors in the Western Hemisphere generally have a higher cost than products obtained
from contractors in Asia. However, contracting in the Western Hemisphere gives us greater flexibility, shorter lead times and allows for lower inventory levels. This combination of VF-owned and contracted production, along with different geographic
regions and cost structures, provides a well-balanced, flexible approach to product sourcing. We will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment.

VF operates manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribbean and Europe. A significant percentage
of denim bottoms and occupational apparel is manufactured in these plants, as well as a smaller percentage of footwear. For these owned production facilities, we purchase raw materials from numerous U.S. and international suppliers to meet our
production needs. Raw materials include products made from cotton, leather, rubber, wool, synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn, as well as thread and trim (product identification, buttons, zippers, snaps, eyelets and laces). In some
instances, we contract the sewing of VF-owned raw materials into finished product with independent contractors. Manufacturing in the U.S. includes all Major League Baseball uniforms, along with screen printing and embroidery of jerseys, T-shirts and
fleece products. Fixed price commitments for fabric and certain supplies are generally set on a quarterly basis for the next quarter’s purchases. No single supplier represents more than 10% of our total cost of goods sold.

Independent contractors generally own the raw materials and ship finished ready-for-sale products to VF. These contractors are engaged
through VF sourcing hubs in Hong Kong (with satellite offices across Asia) and Panama. These hubs are responsible for coordinating the manufacturing and procurement of product, supplier management, product quality assurance, and transportation and
shipping functions in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, respectively. Substantially all products in the Outdoor & Action Sports and Sportswear coalitions, as well as a portion of products for our Jeanswear and Imagewear coalitions, are
obtained through these sourcing hubs. For most products in our Contemporary Brands coalition, we contract the sewing and finishing of VF-owned raw materials through a network of independent contractors based primarily in the U.S.

Management continually monitors political risks and developments related to duties, tariffs and quotas. We limit VF’s sourcing
exposure through, among other measures: (i) diversifying geographies with a mix of VF-operated and contracted production, (ii) shifting of production among countries and contractors, (iii) sourcing production to merchandise categories
where product is readily available and (iv) sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements. VF does not directly or indirectly source products from suppliers in countries that are prohibited by the U.S. State
Department.

All VF-operated production facilities throughout the world, as well as all independent contractor facilities that
manufacture VF products, must comply with VF’s Global Compliance Principles. These principles, established in 1997 and consistent with international labor standards, are a set of strict standards covering legal and ethical business practices,
workers’ ages, work hours, health and safety conditions, environmental standards



and compliance with local laws and regulations. In addition, our owned factories must also undergo certification by the independent, nonprofit organization, Worldwide Responsible Accredited
Production (“WRAP”), which promotes global ethics in manufacturing.

VF, through its contractor monitoring program,
audits the activities of the independent businesses and contractors that produce VF products at locations across the globe. Each of the approximately 1,900 independent contractor facilities, including those serving our independent licensees, must be
pre-certified before producing VF products. This precertification includes passing a factory inspection and signing a VF Terms of Engagement agreement. We maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by using
dedicated internal staff and externally contracted firms. Additional information about VF’s Code of Business Conduct, Global Compliance Principles, Terms of Engagement, Factory Compliance Guidelines, Factory Audit Procedure and Environmental
Compliance Guidelines, along with a Global Compliance Report, is available on the VF website at www.vfc.com.

VF did not
experience difficulty in fulfilling its raw material and contracting production needs during 2015. Absent any material changes, VF believes it would be able to largely offset any increases in product costs through (i) the continuing shift in
the mix of its business to higher margin brands, geographies and channels of distribution, (ii) increases in the prices of its products and (iii) cost reduction opportunities. The loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a
significant adverse effect on our business.

Product is shipped from our independent suppliers and VF-operated manufacturing
facilities to distribution centers around the world. In some instances, product is shipped directly to our customers. Most distribution centers are operated by VF, and some support more than one brand. A portion of our distribution needs are met by
contract distribution centers.

VF’s quarterly operating results vary due to the seasonality of our individual businesses, and are historically stronger in the second half of the year. On a quarterly basis in 2015, consolidated
revenues ranged from a low of 20% of full year revenues in the second quarter to a high of 29% in the third quarter, while consolidated operating margin ranged from a low of 9% in the second quarter to a high of 18% in the third quarter. This
variation results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition, where 19% of the coalition’s revenues occurred in the second quarter compared to 31% in the third quarter of 2015. With
changes in our mix of business and the growth of our retail operations, historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be indicative of future trends.

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital increases early in the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then moderates later in the year as those
inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected. Cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the second half of the year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements,
particularly during the fourth quarter.

Advertising, Customer Support and Community Outreach

During 2015, our advertising and promotion expense was $712.6 million, representing 5.8% of total revenues. We advertise in consumer and
trade publications, on radio and television, and through digital initiatives including social media and mobile platforms on the Internet. We also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print media,
radio and television. We sponsor sporting, musical and special events, as well as athletes and personalities who promote our products. We employ marketing sciences to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional spending and to identify the
types of spending that provide the greatest return on our marketing investments.

We provide advertising support to our
wholesale customers in the form of point-of-sale fixtures and signage to enhance the presentation and brand image of our products. We also participate in shop-in-shops and



concession retail arrangements, which are separate sales areas dedicated to a specific VF brand within our customers’ stores, to help differentiate and enhance the presentation of our
products.

We contribute to incentive programs with our wholesale customers, including cooperative advertising funds,
discounts and allowances. We also offer sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of rebate and coupon offers.

In addition to sponsorships and activities that directly benefit our products and brands, VF and its associates actively support our communities and various charities. For example,

The North
Face

®

brand has committed to programs that
encourage and enable outdoor participation, such as

The North Face Endurance Challenge

®

and

The North Face Explore Fund

™

programs. The

Timberland

®

brand has a strong heritage of volunteerism, including the

Path of Service

™

program that offers full-time employees up to 40 hours of paid time off a year to serve their local communities
through global service events such as Earth Day in the spring and Serv-a-palooza in the fall. The

Wrangler

®

brand launched the Tough Enough to
Wear Pink

™

program, which honors and raises money for
breast cancer survivors, and the

National Patriot Program

™

, which funds agencies that serve wounded and fallen American military veterans and their families. The

Vans

®

brand has hosted annual

Vans

®

Earth Day and

Vans

®

Gives Back Day events in which all employees at brand headquarters spend the day volunteering in the community.
The

Nautica

®

brand supports Oceana, a
not-for-profit organization focused on ocean conservatism, and charity: water, a not-for-profit organization focused on providing clean, safe water to people in need. In addition, 2015 marked the twentieth year of support for the

Lee
National Denim Day

®

event, one of the
country’s largest single-day fundraisers for breast cancer that has raised over $93 million since its inception to fight breast cancer. VF sponsors the “VF 100” program to honor the 100 VF associates worldwide having the highest
number of volunteer service hours during the year.

Sustainability

VF’s approach to Sustainability and Responsibility (“S&R”) is to responsibly manage its business,
from the way it makes, distributes and markets products to the ways it preserves the environment and supports local communities. In 2014, VF launched its inaugural S&R Report, a compilation of the many actions and investments taking place across
VF for our businesses to operate in a sustainable manner. During 2015, VF continued to expand its global sustainability infrastructure and governance practices by requiring our top brands to report on their S&R practices and strategies on at
least an annual basis. In addition, we are on track to meet our first carbon reduction goal to reduce our carbon footprint by 5% (with a 2009 baseline year). VF also recognized seven U.S.-based distribution centers as being “zero-waste,”
meaning at least 95 percent of the waste from these factories will be diverted from landfills through recycling, composting and reuse. Other current initiatives include i) an ongoing partnership with the Better Cotton Initiative to promote
sustainable farming methods, ii) retrofitting owned facilities with LED lighting and pursuing LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) or BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology) certification for new
offices and distribution centers, and iii) continuing our innovative approach to responsible chemical management in our supply chain via the

CHEM-IQ

SM

chemical management program, an industry-leading method that allows us to identify and eliminate harmful chemicals
before they enter our manufacturing process. In addition, VF announced its goal to be 100% powered by renewable energy by 2025 at all owned and operated facilities.

Other Matters

Competitive Factors

Our business depends on our ability to stimulate consumer demand for VF’s brands and products. VF is well-positioned to compete in
the apparel, footwear and accessories sector by developing high quality, innovative products at competitive prices that meet consumer needs, providing high service levels, ensuring the right products are on the retail sales floor to meet consumer
demand, investing significant amounts behind existing brands and continuing to evaluate potential acquisitions. We continually strive to improve in each of these areas. Many of VF’s brands have long histories and enjoy strong recognition within
their respective consumer segments.



Intellectual Property

Trademarks, trade names, patents and domain names, as well as related logos, designs and graphics, provide substantial value in the
development and marketing of VF’s products and are important to our continued success. We have registered this intellectual property in the U.S. and in other countries where our products are manufactured and/or sold. We vigorously monitor and
enforce VF’s intellectual property against counterfeiting, infringement and violations of other rights where and to the extent legal, feasible and appropriate. In addition, we grant licenses to other parties to manufacture and sell products
utilizing our intellectual property in product categories and geographic areas in which VF does not operate.

Customers

VF products are primarily sold on a wholesale basis to specialty stores, department stores, national chains and mass
merchants. In addition, we sell products on a direct-to-consumer basis through VF-operated stores, concession retail stores and e-commerce sites. Our sales in international markets are growing and represented 36% of our total revenues in 2015, the
majority of which were in Europe.

Sales to VF’s ten largest customers, all of which are retailers based in the U.S.,
amounted to 22% of total revenues in 2015, 20% in 2014, and 21% in 2013. Sales to the five largest customers amounted to approximately 16% of total revenues in 2015, 15% in 2014, and 16% in 2013. Sales to VF’s largest customer totaled 8% of
total revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, the majority of which were derived from the Jeanswear coalition.

Employees

VF had approximately 64,000 employees at the end of 2015, of which approximately 28,000 were located in the U.S.
Approximately 600 employees in the U.S. are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In international markets, a significant percentage of employees are covered by trade-sponsored or governmental bargaining arrangements. Employee relations are
considered to be good.

Backlog

The dollar amount of VF’s order backlog as of any date may not be indicative of actual future shipments and, accordingly, is not material to an understanding of the business taken as a whole.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

.

The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating VF’s business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could
materially adversely affect VF’s business, its operating results and its financial condition.



VF’s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel
and footwear, which is sensitive to global economic conditions and other factors. A decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on VF.

The success of VF’s business depends on consumer spending, and there are a number of factors that influence consumer spending, including actual and perceived economic conditions, disposable consumer
income, interest rates, consumer credit availability, unemployment, stock market performance, weather conditions, energy prices and tax rates in the international, national, regional and local markets where VF’s products are sold. The current
global economic environment is unpredictable and adverse economic trends or other factors could negatively impact the level of consumer spending and have a material adverse impact on VF.

The apparel and footwear industries are highly competitive, and VF’s success depends on its ability to gauge consumer
preferences and product trends, and respond to constantly changing markets.

VF competes with numerous apparel and
footwear brands and manufacturers. Competition is generally based upon brand name recognition, price, design, product quality, selection, service and purchasing convenience. Some of our competitors are larger and have more resources than VF in some
product categories and regions. In addition, VF competes directly with the private label brands of its wholesale customers. VF’s ability to compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on our ability to:

•

Anticipate and respond to changing consumer trends in a timely manner;

•

Develop attractive, innovative and high quality products that meet consumer needs;

•

Maintain strong brand recognition;

•

Price products appropriately;

•

Provide best-in-class marketing support and intelligence;

•

Ensure product availability and optimize supply chain efficiencies;

•

Obtain sufficient retail store space and effectively present our products at retail; and

•

Produce or procure quality products on a consistent basis.

Failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing consumer preferences, markets and product trends could have a material adverse effect on VF’s business, financial condition and
results of operations.

VF’s results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately
forecast demand for our products.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully anticipate changing
consumer preferences and product trends or economic conditions and, as a result, we may not successfully manage inventory levels to meet our future order requirements. We often schedule internal production and place orders for products with
independent manufacturers before our customers’ orders are firm. If we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product required to meet the demand. Inventory levels in excess of
consumer demand may result in inventory write-downs, the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, or excess inventory held by our wholesale customers, which could have a negative impact on future sales, an adverse effect on the image and
reputation of VF’s brands, and negatively impact profitability. On the other hand, if we underestimate demand for our products, our manufacturing facilities or third-party manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet consumer
requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues, as well as damage to VF’s reputation and relationships. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image as well as our results of
operations and financial condition.



VF’s business and the success of its products could be harmed if VF is unable to
maintain the images of its brands.

VF’s success to date has been due in large part to the growth of its
brands’ images and VF’s customers’ connection to its brands. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand, the names and images of our brands may be impaired. Even if we react appropriately to
changes in consumer preferences, consumers may consider our brands’ images to be outdated or associate our brands with styles that are no longer popular. In addition, brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of
qualities, including merchandise quality and corporate integrity. Negative claims or publicity regarding VF, its brands or its products, including licensed products, could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims
are accurate. Social media, which accelerates the dissemination of information, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims. In the past, many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed
by periods of declining sales and losses. Our businesses may be similarly affected in the future. In addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a number of athletes and musicians and feature those individuals in our advertising and marketing
efforts. Actions taken by those individuals associated with our products could harm their reputations and adversely affect the images of our brands.

VF’s revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of its business.

VF’s business is increasingly seasonal, with a higher proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the fiscal year, which includes the fall and holiday selling
seasons. Poor sales in the second half of the fiscal year would have a material adverse effect on VF’s full year operating results and cause higher inventories. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are
affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales.

VF’s profitability
may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins.

The apparel industry is subject to significant pricing
pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. If these factors cause us to reduce our sales prices to
retailers and consumers, and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, VF’s profitability will decline. This could have a material adverse effect on VF’s results of operations, liquidity and financial
condition.

VF may not succeed in its business strategy.

One of VF’s key strategic objectives is growth. We seek to grow organically and through acquisitions. We seek to grow by building new
lifestyle brands, expanding our share with winning customers, stretching VF’s brands to new regions, managing costs, leveraging our supply chain and information technology capabilities across VF and expanding our direct-to-consumer business,
including opening new stores and remodeling and expanding our existing stores, and growing our e-commerce business. We may not be able to grow our existing businesses. We may have difficulty completing acquisitions, and we may not be able to
successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve the expected growth, cost savings or synergies from such integration. We may not be able to expand our market share with winning customers, expand our brands geographically or achieve the
expected results from our supply chain initiatives. We may have difficulty recruiting, developing or retaining qualified employees. We may not be able to achieve our store and e-commerce expansion goals, manage our growth effectively, successfully
integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new, remodeled and expanded stores profitably. Failure to implement our strategic objectives may have a material adverse effect on VF’s business.

VF relies significantly on information technology. Any inadequacy, interruption, integration failure or security failure of this
technology could harm VF’s ability to effectively operate its business.

Our ability to effectively manage and
operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems. We rely heavily on information technology to track sales and inventory and manage our supply chain.



We are also dependent on information technology, including the Internet, for our direct-to-consumer sales, including our e-commerce operations and retail business credit card transaction
authorization. Despite our preventative efforts, our systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to damage or interruption. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or
replacement systems, difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses, or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of VF’s business, including management of inventory, ordering and
replenishment of products, e-commerce operations, retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing, corporate email communications and our interaction with the public on social media.

VF is subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect its results, operations or reputation.

In the normal course of business we often collect, retain and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer
information, including credit card information, over public networks. There is a significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, identity theft and user privacy. Despite the
security measures we currently have in place, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches and VF and its customers could suffer harm if customer information were accessed by third
parties due to a security failure in VF’s systems or one of our third-party service providers. It could require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure or breach, severely damage our reputation and our relationships with
customers, and expose us to risks of litigation and liability. In addition, as a result of recent security breaches at a number of prominent retailers, the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense and the
regulatory environment has become more uncertain. As a result, we may incur significant costs to comply with laws regarding the protection and unauthorized disclosure of personal information.

VF’s business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. VF’s hedging strategies may not be
effective in mitigating those risks.

A growing percentage of VF’s total revenues (approximately 36% in 2015) is
derived from markets outside the U.S. VF’s international businesses operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in currency exchange rates affect the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency-denominated amounts at
which VF’s international businesses purchase products, incur costs or sell products. In addition, for VF’s U.S.-based businesses, the majority of products are sourced from independent contractors or VF plants located in foreign countries.
As a result, the cost of these products are affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies. Furthermore, much of VF’s licensing revenue is derived from sales in foreign currencies. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could
have an adverse impact on VF’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In accordance with our
operating practices, we hedge a significant portion of our foreign currency transaction exposures arising in the ordinary course of business to reduce risks in our cash flows and earnings. Our hedging strategy may not be effective in reducing all
risks, and no hedging strategy can completely insulate VF from foreign exchange risk. We do not hedge foreign currency translation rate changes.

Further, our use of derivative financial instruments may expose VF to counterparty risks. Although VF only enters into hedging contracts with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings, it is
possible that the credit quality of a counterparty could be downgraded or a counterparty could default on its obligations, which could have a material adverse impact on VF’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

There are risks associated with VF’s acquisitions.

Any acquisitions or mergers by VF will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies. These risks include,
among other things, higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses,



the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations, systems and personnel of the companies and the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management. In addition,
geographic distances may make integration of acquired businesses more difficult. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions.

Our acquisitions may cause large one-time expenses or create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant
impairment charges in the future. We also make certain estimates and assumptions in order to determine purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If our estimates or assumptions used to value
these assets and liabilities are not accurate, we may be exposed to losses that may be material.

VF’s operations
and earnings may be affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic risks.

Our ability to maintain the current
level of operations in our existing markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new markets is subject to legal, regulatory, political and economic risks. These include the burdens of complying with U.S. and international laws and
regulations, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, and tariffs or other trade barriers.

We cannot predict
whether quotas, duties, taxes, exchange controls or other restrictions will be imposed by the U.S., the European Union or other countries on the import or export of our products, or what effect any of these actions would have on VF’s business,
financial condition or results of operations. We cannot predict whether there might be changes in our ability to repatriate earnings or capital from international jurisdictions. Changes in regulatory, geopolitical policies and other factors may
adversely affect VF’s business or may require us to modify our current business practices.

A significant portion of
VF’s 2015 net income was earned in jurisdictions outside the U.S. VF is exposed to risks of changes in U.S. policy for companies having business operations outside the U.S. There have been a number of proposed changes to U.S. income tax laws,
including overall corporate and individual tax reform. Some of these tax law changes and tax reform proposals, among other things, consider accelerating the U.S. taxability of non-U.S. earnings or limiting foreign tax credits. While enactment of any
such proposal is not certain, if new legislation were enacted, it is possible our U.S. income tax expense could increase, which would reduce our earnings.

We may have additional tax liabilities.

As a global company, we
determine our income tax liability in various tax jurisdictions based on an analysis and interpretation of local tax laws and regulations. This analysis requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation and is often based on various
assumptions about the future actions of the local tax authorities. These determinations are the subject of periodic U.S. and international tax audits. Although we accrue for uncertain tax positions, our accrual may be insufficient to satisfy
unfavorable findings. Unfavorable audit findings and tax rulings may result in payment of taxes, fines and penalties for prior periods and higher tax rates in future periods, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows. Further, in an effort to deal with budget deficits, governments around the world are focusing on increasing tax revenues through increased audits and, potentially, increased tax rates for corporations. Changes in
tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly affect the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements, and could significantly impact our
profitability.

VF’s balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill. A
decline in the fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge, which would be recorded as an operating expense in VF’s Consolidated Statement of Income and could be material.

VF’s policy is to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the
beginning of the fourth quarter of each year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the



fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount. In addition, intangible assets that are being amortized are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that
their carrying value may not be recoverable. For these impairment tests, we use various valuation methods to estimate the fair value of our business units and intangible assets. If the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value, we would
recognize an impairment charge for the difference.

It is possible that we could have an impairment charge for goodwill or
trademark and trade name intangible assets in future periods if (i) overall economic conditions in 2016 or future years vary from our current assumptions, (ii) business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit change from
our current assumptions, (iii) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or (iv) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or of actual sales transactions of comparable companies,
were to decline, resulting in lower comparable multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and, accordingly, lower implied values of goodwill and intangible assets. A future impairment charge for goodwill
or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

VF
uses third-party suppliers and manufacturing facilities worldwide for a substantial portion of its raw materials and finished products, which poses risks to VF’s business operations.

During fiscal 2015, approximately 77% of VF’s units were purchased from independent manufacturers primarily located in Asia, with
substantially all of the remainder produced by VF-owned and operated manufacturing facilities located in the U.S., Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribbean and Europe. Any of the following could impact our ability to produce or deliver VF
products:

•

Political or labor instability in countries where VF’s facilities, contractors and suppliers are located;

•

Political or military conflict could cause a delay in the transportation of raw materials and products to VF and an increase in transportation costs;

•

Disruption at ports of entry, such as the west coast dock workers labor dispute that disrupted international trade at seaports, could cause delays in
product availability and increase transportation times and costs;

•

Heightened terrorism security concerns could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent or more lengthy inspections, leading to
delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods;

•

Decreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to more counterfeit goods and reduced sales of VF products, increased costs for
VF’s anticounterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of its brands;

•

Disruptions at manufacturing or distribution facilities caused by natural and man-made disasters;

•

Disease epidemics and health-related concerns could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargo
of VF’s goods produced in infected areas;

•

Imposition of regulations and quotas relating to imports and our ability to adjust timely to changes in trade regulations could limit our ability to
produce products in cost-effective countries that have the labor and expertise needed;

•

Imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports; and

•

Imposition or the repeal of laws that affect intellectual property rights.

Although no single supplier and no one country is critical to VF’s production needs, if we were to lose a supplier it could result
in interruption of finished goods shipments to VF, cancellation of orders by customers, and termination of relationships. This, along with the damage to our reputation, could have a material adverse effect on VF’s revenues and, consequently,
our results of operations.



Our business is subject to national, state and local laws and regulations for
environmental, employment, safety and other matters. The costs of compliance with, or the violation of, such laws and regulations by VF or by independent suppliers who manufacture products for VF could have an adverse effect on our operations and
cash flows, as well as on our reputation.

Our business is subject to comprehensive national, state and local laws and
regulations on a wide range of environmental, employment, safety and other matters. VF could be adversely affected by costs of compliance with or violations of those laws and regulations. In addition, while we do not control their business
practices, we require third-party suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance. The costs of products purchased by VF from independent
contractors could increase due to the costs of compliance by those contractors.

Failure by VF or its third-party suppliers to
comply with such laws and regulations, as well as with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards, or related political considerations, could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to VF, cancellation of orders by
customers, and termination of relationships. If one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical, it could jeopardize our reputation and
potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts that may reduce demand for VF’s merchandise. Damage to VF’s reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse
effect on VF’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to rebuild VF’s reputation.

Fluctuations in wage rates and the price, availability and quality of raw materials and finished goods could increase costs.

Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of fabrics, leather or other raw materials used by VF in its manufactured products, or
of purchased finished goods, could have a material adverse effect on VF’s cost of goods sold or its ability to meet its customers’ demands. The prices we pay depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them.
The price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, including general economic conditions and demand, crop yields, energy prices, weather patterns and speculation in the commodities markets.
Prices of purchased finished products also depend on wage rates in Asia and other geographic areas where our independent contractors are located, as well as freight costs from those regions. In addition, fluctuations in wage rates required by legal
or industry standards could increase our costs. In the future, VF may not be able to offset cost increases with other cost reductions or efficiencies or to pass higher costs on to its customers. This could have a material adverse effect on VF’s
results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

We may be adversely affected by weather conditions.

Our business is adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions. A significant portion of the sales of our
products is dependent in part on the weather and is likely to decline in years in which weather conditions do not favor the use of these products. Periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter may have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Inventory accumulation by our wholesale customers resulting from unseasonable weather in one season generally negatively affects orders in future seasons, which may have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Abnormally harsh or inclement weather can also negatively impact retail traffic and consumer spending.

A substantial portion of VF’s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers. The loss of any of these customers or the inability of any of these customers to pay
VF could substantially reduce VF’s revenues and profits.

A few of VF’s customers account for a significant
portion of revenues. Sales to VF’s ten largest customers were 22% of total revenues in fiscal 2015, with our largest customer accounting for 8% of revenues. Sales to our



customers are generally on a purchase order basis and not subject to long-term agreements. A decision by any of VF’s major customers to significantly decrease the volume of products
purchased from VF could substantially reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect on VF’s financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, in recent years, the retail industry has experienced consolidation and other ownership
changes. In the future, retailers may further consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations, realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target markets. These developments could result in a reduction in the number of stores
that carry VF’s products, an increase in ownership concentration within the retail industry, an increase in credit exposure to VF or an increase in leverage by VF’s customers over their suppliers. These changes could impact VF’s
opportunities in the market and increase VF’s reliance on a smaller number of large customers.

Further, the global
economy periodically experiences recessionary conditions with rising unemployment, reduced availability of credit, increased savings rates and declines in real estate and securities values. These recessionary conditions could have a negative impact
on retail sales of apparel and other consumer products. The lower sales volumes, along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets, could result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures,
bankruptcies or liquidations. This could result in higher credit risk to VF relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties. If these developments occur, our inability to shift sales to other customers or
to collect on VF’s trade accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on VF’s financial condition and results of operations.

Our ability to obtain short-term or long-term financing on favorable terms, if needed, could be adversely affected by geopolitical risk and volatility in the capital markets.

Any disruption in the capital markets could limit the availability of funds or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to
extend capital in the future. This could adversely affect our liquidity and funding resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. An inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows.

VF has a global revolving credit facility. One or more of the
participating banks may not be able to honor their commitments, which could have an adverse effect on VF’s business.

VF has a $1.75 billion global revolving credit facility that expires in April 2020. If the financial markets return to recessionary conditions, this could impair the ability of one or more of the banks
participating in our credit agreements to honor their commitments. This could have an adverse effect on our business if we were not able to replace those commitments or to locate other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms.

The loss of members of VF’s executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on its business.

VF depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers and business leaders who have
substantial experience and expertise in VF’s business. VF also depends on other key employees involved in the operation of its business. Competition for experienced and well-qualified personnel is intense. The unexpected loss of services of one
or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on VF.

VF’s direct-to-consumer business includes
risks that could have an adverse effect on its results.

VF sells merchandise direct-to-consumer through VF-operated
stores and e-commerce sites. Its direct-to-consumer business is subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on its results. Risks include, but are not limited to, (a) U.S. or international resellers purchasing
merchandise and reselling it overseas outside VF’s control, (b) failure of the systems that operate the stores and websites, and their related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, privacy concerns,
telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, (c) credit card fraud and (d) risks related to VF’s direct-to-consumer distribution centers. Risks specific to VF’s e-commerce business also include
(a) diversion of sales



from VF stores or wholesale customers, (b) difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels and (c) liability for online content. VF’s failure to
successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in its e-commerce business, as well as damage its reputation and brands.

Our VF-operated stores and e-commerce business require substantial fixed investments in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. We have entered into substantial
operating lease commitments for retail space. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our direct-to-consumer operations, a decline in sales or the closure of or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in
significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and employee-related costs.

VF’s net sales depend on the volume of traffic to its stores and the availability of suitable lease space.

A growing portion of our revenues are direct-to-consumer sales through VF-operated stores. In order to generate customer traffic, we
locate many of our stores in prominent locations within successful retail shopping centers or in fashionable shopping districts. Our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area to generate consumer traffic
in the vicinity of our stores. Part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. We cannot
control the development of new shopping centers or districts; the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping centers or districts; competition with other retailers for prominent locations; or the success of
individual shopping centers or districts. Further, if we are unable to renew or replace our existing store leases or enter into leases for new stores on favorable terms, or if we violate the terms of our current leases, our growth and profitability
could be harmed. All of these factors may impact our ability to meet our growth targets and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

VF may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights.

VF’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its competitive
position. VF is susceptible to others copying its products and infringing its intellectual property rights especially with the shift in product mix to higher priced brands and innovative new products in recent years. Some of VF’s brands, such
as

The North Face

®

,

Timberland

®

,

Vans

®

,

JanSport

®

,

Nautica

®

,

Wrangler

®

and

Lee

®

, enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition, and the higher
pricing of those products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement.

VF’s trademarks, trade names,
patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property are important to VF’s success. Counterfeiting of VF’s products or infringement on its intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect VF’s
revenues. Actions we have taken to establish and protect VF’s intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent copying of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its trademarks or block sales of
VF’s products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others. In addition, unilateral actions in the U.S. or other countries, including changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual
property rights, could have an impact on VF’s ability to enforce those rights.

The value of VF’s intellectual
property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of VF, or trademarks that are similar to VF’s trademarks, or trademarks that VF licenses from others. We may be unable to
successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to VF’s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights
to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. In other cases, there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks. VF is from time to time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some of its intellectual
property rights.



We may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe on their
trademarks, copyrights, patents or other intellectual property rights. Defending infringement claims could be expensive and time-consuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements.

VF is subject to the risk that its licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of VF’s brands.

During 2015, $126.1 million of VF’s revenues were derived from licensing royalties. Although VF generally has
significant control over its licensees’ products and advertising, we rely on our licensees for, among other things, operational and financial controls over their businesses. Failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or
our inability to replace existing licensees, if necessary, could adversely affect VF’s revenues, both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. Risks are also associated with a
licensee’s ability to:

•

Obtain capital;

•

Manage its labor relations;

•

Maintain relationships with its suppliers;

•

Manage its credit risk effectively;

•

Maintain relationships with its customers; and

•

Adhere to VF’s Global Compliance Principles.

In addition, VF relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands. Although we attempt to protect VF’s brands through approval rights over design, production processes, quality,
packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of licensed VF brands by our licensees. The misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that
brand and on VF.

VF has entered into license agreements to use the trademarks of others. Loss of a license could have
an adverse effect on VF’s operating results.

VF has entered into agreements to market products under licenses
granted by third parties, including Major League Baseball, the National Football League and Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Inc. Some of these licenses are for a short term and do not contain renewal options. Loss of a license, which in certain cases
could result in an impairment charge for related operating and intangible assets, could have an adverse effect on VF’s operating results.

If VF encounters problems with its distribution system, VF’s ability to deliver its products to the market could be adversely affected.

VF relies on owned or independently-operated distribution facilities to warehouse and ship product to its customers. VF’s
distribution system includes computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures.
Because substantially all of VF’s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations, VF’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes, floods, fires or other natural disasters affecting its distribution centers.
We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect VF from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in VF’s distribution facilities, such as the long-term loss of customers or an erosion of
brand image. In addition, VF’s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities. If we encounter problems with our
distribution system, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected.



Volatility in securities markets, interest rates and other economic factors could
substantially increase VF’s defined benefit pension costs.

VF currently has obligations under its defined benefit
pension plans. The funded status of the pension plans is dependent on many factors, including returns on investment assets and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations. Unfavorable impacts from returns on plan assets, decreases in
discount rates, changes in plan demographics or revisions in the applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of pension funding requirements, which could reduce cash available for VF’s business.

VF’s operating performance also may be negatively impacted by the amount of expense recorded for its pension plans. Pension expense
is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market, economic and demographic conditions. Differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are deferred and
amortized as part of future pension expense, which can create volatility that adversely impacts VF’s future operating results.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.

Overview

VF Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, collectively known as “VF”) is a global leader in the design, production,
procurement, marketing and distribution of branded lifestyle apparel, footwear and related products. VF’s diverse portfolio of more than 30 brands meets consumer needs across a broad spectrum of activities and lifestyles. Our long-term growth
strategy is focused on four drivers — product innovation, consumer research and marketing, our direct-to-consumer infrastructure and geographic expansion.

VF is diversified across brands, product categories, channels of distribution, geographies and consumer demographics. We own a broad portfolio of brands in the outerwear, footwear, denim, backpack,
luggage, accessory, sportswear, occupational and performance apparel categories. Our products are marketed to consumers shopping in specialty stores, department stores, national chains, mass merchants and our own direct-to-consumer operations, which
includes VF-operated stores, concession retail stores and e-commerce sites.

VF is organized by groupings of businesses called
“coalitions”. The five coalitions are Outdoor & Action Sports, Jeanswear, Imagewear, Sportswear and Contemporary Brands. These coalitions are our reportable segments for financial reporting purposes.

VF operates and reports using a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to December 31 of each year. All references to
“2015”, “2014” and “2013” relate to the 52-week fiscal year ended January 2, 2016, the 53-week fiscal year ended January 3, 2015, and the 52-week fiscal year ended December 28, 2013, respectively. Because 2014
had 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in 2015, we have highlighted the estimated comparative impact where relevant in the discussions below.



Highlights of 2015

All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis. All percentages shown in the tables below and the discussion that follows have been calculated using unrounded numbers. References to 2015 foreign
currency amounts below reflect the changes in foreign exchange rates from 2014 and their impact on both translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and on transactions denominated in a foreign currency. References to 2014 foreign currency
amounts below reflect the changes in foreign exchange rates from 2013 and their impact on translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.

•

Revenues grew to a record $12.4 billion, a 1% increase over 2014, despite a negative 5% impact from foreign currency and a negative 1% impact from the
additional week included in the 2014 results.

•

International revenues decreased 4% due to a negative 13% impact from foreign currency, and accounted for 36% of VF’s total revenues in 2015.

•

Direct-to-consumer revenues increased 3% over 2014, net of a negative 4% impact from foreign currency and a negative 3% impact from the additional week
included in the 2014 results, and accounted for 27% of VF’s total revenues in 2015. VF opened 186 retail stores in 2015.

•

Gross margin decreased 50 basis points to 48.3% in 2015, reflecting benefits from changes in mix and lower product costs that were more than offset by
a negative 80 basis point impact from foreign currency.

•

Cash flow from operations exceeded $1.1 billion in 2015, after the impact of a $250.0 million discretionary pension contribution by the Company.

•

Earnings per share increased 20% to $2.85 in 2015 from $2.38 in 2014, reflecting a $0.23 noncash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2015
resulting from VF’s annual impairment testing of intangible assets, compared with a $0.70 per share impairment charge in 2014.

•

VF increased the quarterly dividend rate by 16% in the fourth quarter, marking the 43

rd

consecutive year of increase in the rate of dividends paid per share.

•

VF repurchased $732.6 million of its Common Stock and paid $565.3 million in cash dividends, returning nearly $1.3 billion to stockholders.

Analysis of Results of Operations

Consolidated Statements of Income

The following table presents a summary
of the changes in total revenues during the last two years:

VF reported revenue growth of 1% in 2015, primarily attributable to a 3% increase in
the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition and continued strength in the international and direct-to-consumer businesses, partially offset by a negative 5% impact from foreign currency. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency, sales grew
in every region around the world in 2015. Additionally, 2015 revenue growth was negatively impacted by unseasonably warm weather in the fourth quarter, a softer retail environment and the 53

rd

week in 2014. The extra week in 2014 negatively impacted 2015 revenue growth comparisons by 1%.



VF reported revenue growth of 8% in 2014, driven by a 13% increase in the Outdoor &
Action Sports coalition, and continued strength in the international and direct-to-consumer businesses. The extra week in 2014 added approximately 1% of growth compared to 2013. Additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled
“Information by Business Segment”.

VF’s most significant foreign currency exposure relates to business
conducted in euro-based countries. However, VF conducts business in other developed and emerging markets around the world with exposure to foreign currencies other than the euro. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies
negatively impacted revenue comparisons in 2015 as discussed above.

The following table presents the percentage relationship
to total revenues for components of the Consolidated Statements of Income:

Gross margin declined 50 basis points to 48.3% in 2015 compared with 48.8% in 2014 primarily due to
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which negatively impacted gross margin by 80 basis points in 2015 compared with 2014. Excluding this impact, gross margin improved 30 basis points in 2015 due to lower product costs and the continued
shift in our revenue mix towards higher margin businesses, including Outdoor & Action Sports, direct-to-consumer and international, partially offset by aggressive efforts to manage inventory levels.

In 2014, gross margin increased 70 basis points to 48.8% compared with 48.1% in 2013, with improvements in nearly every coalition. The
increase in gross margin reflected the continued shift in our revenue mix towards higher margin businesses, including Outdoor & Action Sports, international and direct-to-consumer. In addition, the 2014 change in classification of retail
concession fees improved gross margin by 20 basis points and increased the ratio of selling, general and administration expenses to revenues compared with 2013.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased 10 basis points in 2015
compared with 2014. This decrease is primarily due to lower incentive compensation, leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues, and the benefit from a $16.6 million gain on the sale of a

VF Outlet

®

location in 2015, partially offset by increased investments in our direct-to-consumer businesses and global
product development, which includes our strategic innovation centers.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of total revenues were 30 basis points higher in 2014 compared with 2013. Excluding the impact of the aforementioned change in classification of retail concession fees, the percentage of selling, general and administrative expenses to
revenues did not change in 2014 compared with 2013, as the impact from increased investments in direct-to-consumer businesses and marketing was offset by the leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues.

As part of its annual impairment testing performed in the fourth quarter of 2015, VF recorded a $143.6 million
pre-tax, noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets related to our

7 For All
Mankind

®

,

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

brands to their respective estimated fair values. In the fourth
quarter of 2014, VF recorded a $396.4 million pre-tax, noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets related to these same brands. No impairment charge was required in 2013. For additional information, see
Notes E, F and S to the consolidated financial statements and the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section below.



In 2015, operating margin increased 170 basis points, to 13.4% from 11.7% in 2014. The
increase in operating margin reflects a lower impairment charge for intangible assets in 2015 compared with 2014.

In 2014,
operating margin declined 270 basis points, to 11.7% from 14.4% in 2013. The decrease in operating margin for 2014 reflects gross margin expansion and a 320 basis point decrease from the noncash impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets.

Net interest expense increased $2.4 million to $82.3 million in 2015. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due
to higher average levels of short-term borrowings. Net interest expense decreased $0.8 million to $79.8 million in 2014, due to the repayment of $400 million of floating rate notes during the third quarter of 2013 and increased interest income on
cash equivalents, partially offset by higher average levels of short-term borrowings in 2014.

Outstanding interest-bearing
debt averaged $2.4 billion for 2015, $1.8 billion for 2014 and $1.9 billion for 2013, with short-term borrowings representing 41%, 22% and 10% of average debt outstanding for the respective years. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding
debt was 3.5% in 2015, 4.6% for 2014 and 4.5% for 2013. The weighted average interest rate decreased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to the increase in average levels of short-term borrowings at lower interest rates. The weighted average
interest rate increased slightly in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to higher interest rates on international short-term borrowings.

Other income (expense) netted to income of $1.7 million in 2015, compared with expense of $5.5 million and $4.0 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The income in 2015 was due primarily to net foreign
currency exchange gains compared to net foreign currency exchange losses in both 2014 and 2013.

The effective income tax rate
was 22.1% in 2015 compared with 22.5% in 2014. The 2015 tax rate included a net discrete tax benefit of $44.0 million, which included $36.2 million of tax benefits related to the settlement of tax audits, and $4.6 million related to the retroactive
impact of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (“PATH”) Act of 2015 as discussed below. The $44.0 million tax benefit in 2015 reduced the effective income tax rate by 2.8% compared with a 1.0% impact of discrete items in
2014. Without discrete items, the effective tax rate during 2015 increased by approximately 1.3% primarily due to i) a lower percentage of foreign earnings in 2015, reflecting the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, ii) the
expiration of a favorable tax ruling in a foreign jurisdiction at the end of fiscal 2014, and iii) the comparative impact of tax benefits recorded in 2014 related to the utilization of foreign tax attributes. The international effective tax rate was
12.5% and 12.7% for 2015 and 2014, respectively. VF expects the 2016 annual tax rate to approximate 23.0%.

The PATH Act of
2015, signed into law in December 2015, permanently extended the U.S. federal research tax credit and extended certain tax credits and other incentives. The PATH Act was retroactive to January 1, 2015, and the impact was considered a discrete tax
benefit when recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015.

The effective income tax rate was 22.5% in 2014 compared with 22.6% in
2013. The 2014 tax rate included a net discrete tax benefit of $13.8 million, primarily related to unrecognized tax benefits and interest (net $11.4 million tax benefit) and the retroactive impact of the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 discussed
below ($5.3 million tax benefit), partially offset by other discrete tax items (net $2.9 million tax expense). These discrete items collectively lowered the 2014 annual tax rate by 1.0% compared with a 1.7% impact of discrete items in
2013. Without discrete items, the effective tax rate during 2014 decreased by approximately 0.7%. The international effective tax rate was 12.7% and 12.1% for 2014 and 2013, respectively.

The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014, signed into law in December 2014, retroactively extended certain tax credits and incentives
through tax year 2014. The impact of this tax law change to the 2014 tax year was considered a discrete tax benefit when recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014.



As a result of the above, net income in 2015 increased to $1.2 billion ($2.85 per share),
compared with $1.0 billion ($2.38 per share) in 2014 and $1.2 billion ($2.71 per share) in 2013. The increase in earnings per share in 2015 compared with 2014 reflects the lower intangible asset impairment charge ($0.23 per share in 2015 compared
with $0.70 per share in 2014) and improved operating performance, partially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency. The decrease in earnings per share in 2014 compared with 2013 reflects the goodwill and intangible asset impairment
charge in 2014, partially offset by improved operating performance. Refer to additional discussion in the “Information by Business Segment” section below.

Information by Business Segment

Management at each of the coalitions has
direct control over and responsibility for its revenues and operating income, hereinafter termed “coalition revenues” and “coalition profit”, respectively. VF management evaluates operating performance and makes investment and
other decisions based on coalition revenues and coalition profit. Common costs such as information systems processing, retirement benefits and insurance are allocated to the coalitions based on appropriate metrics such as sales, usage or employment.

The following tables present a summary of the changes in coalition revenues and coalition profit during the last two years:

The following section discusses the changes in revenues and profitability by coalition:

Outdoor & Action Sports



The Outdoor & Action Sports coalition includes the following
brands:

The North Face

Global revenues for Outdoor & Action Sports increased 3% in 2015, reflecting 9% operational growth despite the
warmer weather in the fourth quarter and the softer retail environment compared with 2014. The operational growth was partially offset by a negative 6% impact from foreign currency. The 53

rd

week in 2014 also negatively impacted 2015 revenue growth. Revenues in the Americas region increased 8% in 2015,
including a 2% negative impact from foreign currency. Revenues in the Asia Pacific region increased 10% in 2015 despite a 5% negative impact from foreign currency. European revenues declined 10% in 2015, including a 16% negative impact from foreign
currency.

Global revenues for

The North
Face

®

brand increased 1% in 2015 over 2014, as operational growth in the direct-to-consumer
channel was partially offset by a negative 4% impact from foreign currency. Sales for

The

North
Face

®

brand were negatively impacted by the warm weather in 2015, particularly during the
fourth quarter when consumer demand for cold-weather products is typically at its peak.

Vans

®

brand global revenues were up 7% in 2015, reflecting operational growth in both the direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels, partially offset by a negative 7% impact from foreign currency. Global revenues for the

Timberland

®

brand were up 2% in 2015 driven by strong wholesale revenues, partially offset by a negative 8% impact from
foreign currency and reduced consumer demand for outdoor apparel and footwear as a result of the warm weather noted above.

Global direct-to-consumer revenues for Outdoor & Action Sports grew 6% in 2015 over 2014, driven by new store openings and an
expanding e-commerce business. Foreign currency negatively impacted direct-to-consumer revenues by 5% in 2015. Wholesale revenues were up 1% in 2015, including an 8% negative impact from foreign currency.

The Outdoor & Action Sports coalition revenues increased 13% in 2014 over 2013 primarily due to growth in

The North Face

®

, Vans

®

and

Timberland

®

brands, which achieved global
revenue growth of 11%, 17% and 13%, respectively. Revenues in the Americas, European and Asia Pacific regions increased 14%, 9% and 17%, respectively. Direct-to-consumer revenues rose 22% in 2014 driven by increases of 31% and 24% for

The
North

Face

®

and

Vans

®

brands, respectively. New store openings and comparable sales growth, which includes an expanding e-commerce business, all contributed to the direct-to-consumer
revenue growth.

Operating margin decreased 110 basis points in 2015 due to the negative impact from foreign currency and
increased investments in direct-to-consumer businesses, partially offset by the leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues.

Operating margin increased 90 basis points in 2014 driven by a shift in business mix towards higher margin businesses and the leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues, partially offset by
increased investments in direct-to-consumer businesses and marketing.

Jeanswear

The Jeanswear coalition consists of the global jeanswear businesses, led by the

Wrangler

®

and

Lee

®

brands.



Global Jeanswear revenues were flat in 2015 compared with 2014,
reflecting operational growth offset by a negative 4% impact from foreign currency. The 53

rd

week in 2014 also negatively impacted 2015 revenue growth. Revenues in the Americas region increased 1% in 2015, reflecting a 2% negative impact from foreign currency. Revenues in the Asia Pacific region
increased 5% in 2015 despite a 4% negative impact from foreign currency. European revenues decreased 15% in 2015, including an 18% negative impact from foreign currency.

Global revenues for the

Wrangler

®

brand were flat in 2015 compared with 2014, as 4% operational growth driven by continued strength in the mass
business was offset by a negative 4% impact from foreign currency. Global revenues for the

Lee

®

brand were also flat in 2015 compared with 2014, as continued growth in China and Europe, strong wholesale growth in India, and recent product launches in the U.S. were partially offset by a negative 5%
impact from foreign currency. Revenues for the

Rock & Republic

®

brand were down 11% in 2015 compared with 2014.

Global
Jeanswear revenues were flat in 2014 over 2013, as an increase in global

Wrangler

®

brand revenues was offset by decreases in global

Lee

®

(driven by declines in the U.S.) and

Rock & Republic

®

brand revenues.

In 2014, revenues in the Americas region declined 3%.

Lee

®

brand revenues in the Americas region declined 9% in 2014, due to
ongoing pressure in the U.S. mid-tier and department store channels, and unfavorable consumer trends in women’s denim.

Wrangler

®

brand revenues in the Americas region increased 2% in 2014 driven by increases in both the western specialty and mass
businesses. Partially offsetting the overall decrease in the Americas region were increases in Europe and the Asia Pacific region of 5% and 14%, respectively. The increases in both Europe and the Asia Pacific region were primarily due to wholesale
and direct-to-consumer growth in the

Lee

®

brand. Revenues in the Americas (non-U.S.) region declined 5% in 2014 compared with 2013, due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation.

Operating margin increased 40 basis points in 2015 over 2014, primarily due to lower product costs, partially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency.

Operating margin declined 60 basis points in 2014 over 2013, primarily due to initiatives to liquidate excess inventory, and lower sales
volume in North America, partially offset by effective control of operating expenses.

Imagewear

The Imagewear coalition consists of VF’s Image business (occupational apparel
and uniforms, including the

Red Kap

®

and

Bulwark

®

brand industrial businesses) and Licensed Sports Group (“LSG”) business (athletic apparel and fanwear,
which includes the

Majestic

®

brand business).

Imagewear revenues decreased 2% in 2015 compared with 2014, partially due to the impact of the 53

rd

week in 2014. The Image business revenues decreased 6% compared with
2014 primarily due to the impact of considerably lower levels of oil and gas exploration, which negatively impacted sales of the

Bulwark

®

brand. Revenues for the LSG business were up 4% in 2015 compared with 2014, driven by strong Major League Baseball and National Basketball Association sales.

Coalition revenues increased 4% in 2014 compared with 2013. The Image business grew 4%, driven by a 10%
increase in the

Red Kap

®

brand business. Revenues from the LSG business were up 3% in 2014
primarily



due to strong National Football League sales. Effective in the first quarter of 2014, the LSG business strategically transitioned the youth business for Major League Baseball to a licensed model,
which negatively impacted coalition revenues by 2% in 2014 compared with 2013.

The 30 basis point decline in operating margin
in 2015 compared with 2014 was negatively impacted by lower gross margins primarily due to business mix.

The 60 basis point
improvement in operating margin in 2014 compared with 2013 was positively impacted by favorable product mix in both the Image and LSG businesses.

Sportswear

The Sportswear coalition consists of the

Nautica

®

and

Kipling

®

brand businesses in North America (the

Kipling

®

brand outside of North America is managed by the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition).

Coalition revenues decreased 2% in 2015 over 2014, partially due to the impact of the 53

rd

week in 2014.

Nautica

®

brand revenues decreased 4% in 2015 due in part to the unseasonably warm weather in the fourth quarter, which
reduced consumer demand for fleece, sweaters and outerwear.

Nautica

®

brand direct-to-consumer revenues were down 9% in 2015 compared with 2014 due to reduced traffic and the exit of less
profitable stores. Wholesale revenues for the

Nautica

®

brand were only down 1% in 2015 despite
continuing challenges in the U.S. department store channel.

Kipling

®

brand revenues in North
America increased 8%, driven by growth in the direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels.

Coalition
revenues increased 4% in 2014 over 2013 primarily due to a 21% increase in

Kipling

®

brand revenues
in North America, reflecting growth in the brand’s direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels.

Nautica

®

brand revenues increased 1% in 2014, as growth in the direct-to-consumer business was
partially offset by declines in wholesale revenues due to challenges in the U.S. department store channel. New store openings and comparable sales growth, which includes higher e-commerce revenues, contributed to a 14% increase in the
coalition’s direct-to-consumer business.

Operating margin increased 40 basis points in 2015 over
2014, primarily driven by a shift in business mix to the higher margin

Kipling

®

brand business and
lower levels of promotional activity in the wholesale channel for the

Nautica

®

brand, partially
offset by reduced expense leverage on lower sales volume and increased investments in direct-to-consumer businesses.

Operating margin declined 210 basis points in 2014 over 2013, primarily driven by a decline in gross margin due to higher levels of promotional activity in the wholesale channel, and increased investments
in infrastructure and direct-to-consumer businesses, partially offset by a shift in business mix towards the higher margin

Kipling

®

brand business.



Contemporary Brands

The Contemporary Brands coalition consists of the

7 For All Mankind

®

brand of premium denim and related apparel, and the

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

premium lifestyle apparel brands.

Coalition revenues decreased 14% in 2015 compared with 2014, reflecting ongoing challenges in demand for contemporary apparel and premium denim, and the negative impact of the 53

rd

week in 2014. In addition, foreign currency negatively impacted
coalition revenues by 3% in 2015 compared to 2014. Wholesale and direct-to-consumer revenues decreased 15% and 13%, respectively, in 2015 compared with 2014. Global revenues for the

7 For All Mankind

®

and the combined

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

brands decreased 14% and 15%, respectively.

Coalition revenues decreased 4% in 2014 compared with 2013 due to challenging consumer trends in contemporary
apparel and premium denim. Wholesale revenues decreased 11% in 2014, partially offset by an 11% increase in the smaller direct-to-consumer business. Global revenues for the

7 For All Mankind

®

and the combined

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

brands decreased 2% and 7%, respectively. Effective in the first
quarter of 2014, management strategically transitioned a portion of the

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

youth business to a licensed model, which negatively impacted coalition revenues by 3% in
2014 compared with 2013.

Operating margin decreased 410 basis points in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to discounting,
the negative impact from foreign currency and reduced expense leverage on a lower revenue base.

Operating margin decreased
350 basis points in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to the cost of store openings and reduced expense leverage on a lower revenue base.

As part of its annual impairment testing performed in the fourth quarter of 2015, VF recorded a $143.6 million pre-tax, noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets
related to the

7 For All Mankind

®

,

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

brands to their respective estimated fair values. In the fourth
quarter of 2014, VF recorded a $396.4 million pre-tax, noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets related to these same brands. These charges were excluded from the coalition profit of
Contemporary Brands since they are not part of the ongoing operations of the business. For additional information, see Notes E, F and S to the consolidated financial statements and the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section
below.

Other

VF Outlet

®

stores in the U.S. sell VF products at prices that are generally higher than what could be realized through
external wholesale channels, as well as other non-VF products. Revenues and profits of VF products sold in these stores are reported as part of the operating results of the applicable coalition, while revenues and profits of non-VF products are
reported in this “other” category. The increase in profit in 2015 is primarily due to a $16.6 million gain recognized on the sale of a

VF Outlet

®

location in 2015.



Reconciliation of Coalition Profit to Consolidated Income Before Income Taxes

There are three types of costs necessary to reconcile total coalition profit to consolidated income before income taxes. These costs are
(i) noncash impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, which is excluded from coalition profit because these costs are not part of the ongoing operations of the respective businesses, (ii) interest expense, net, which is excluded from
coalition profit because substantially all financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are not under the control of coalition management, and (iii) corporate and other expenses, discussed below, which are excluded from coalition
profit to the extent they are not allocated to the coalitions. Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and net interest expense are discussed in the “Consolidated Statements of Income” section, and corporate and other expenses are
discussed below.

Following is a summary of VF’s corporate and other expenses:

Information Systems and Shared Services

These costs include management information systems and the centralized finance, supply chain, human resources, direct-to-consumer and customer management functions that support worldwide operations.
Operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the coalitions based on utilization of those services. Costs to develop new computer applications are generally not allocated to the coalitions. The increases in information
systems and shared services costs in 2015 and 2014 resulted from the overall growth of the businesses and costs associated with expanded software system implementations and upgrades.

Corporate Headquarters’ Costs

Headquarters’ costs include
compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff, legal and professional fees and general and administrative expenses that have not been allocated to the coalitions. The decrease in corporate headquarters’ costs in 2015 compared
with 2014 was primarily driven by decreases in cash and stock-based compensation expense resulting from lower corporate performance versus established goals, partially offset by additional investments in our global innovation centers. The increase
in corporate headquarters’ costs in 2014 over 2013 was primarily driven by increases in cash and stock-based compensation expense, resulting from corporate performance in excess of established goals and increases in VF’s share price.

Other

This
category includes (i) costs of corporate programs or corporate-managed decisions that are not allocated to the coalitions, (ii) costs of registering, maintaining and enforcing certain of VF’s trademarks, and (iii) miscellaneous
consolidated costs, the most significant of which is related to the expense of VF’s centrally-managed U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The decrease in other expense in 2015 compared with 2014 was driven by a decrease in the value of
VF’s deferred compensation liability, partially offset by higher pension expense. The decrease in other expenses in 2014 compared with 2013 was driven by lower pension expense.



International Operations

International revenues declined 4% in 2015 compared with growth of 9% in 2014. The decline in 2015 is due to foreign currency, which negatively impacted international revenue growth by 13%. Revenues in
Europe declined 11%, reflecting operational growth that was more than offset by a 16% negative impact from foreign currency. In the Asia Pacific region, revenues increased 9% primarily driven by strong growth in China. Foreign currency negatively
impacted growth in the Asia Pacific region by 4%. Revenues in the Americas (non-U.S.) region decreased 1%, as weakening currencies in the region relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted growth by 15%. International revenues represented 36%
and 38% of total VF revenues in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Direct-to-Consumer Operations

Direct-to-consumer revenues grew 3% in 2015 compared with growth of 19% in 2014. The increase in 2015 was driven by operational growth in
all regions and growth in nearly every brand with a retail format. The direct-to-consumer revenue increase in 2015 was partially offset by a negative 4% impact from foreign currency (primarily in Europe), and a negative 3% impact from the additional
week included in the 2014 results. New store openings and comparable sales growth, which includes an expanding e-commerce business, all contributed to direct-to-consumer revenue growth. VF opened 186 stores in 2015, bringing the total number of
VF-owned retail stores to 1,520 at December 2015. Direct-to-consumer revenues were 27% of total VF revenues in 2015 compared with 26% in 2014.

Analysis of Financial Condition

Balance Sheets

The following discussion refers to significant changes in balances at December 2015 compared with December 2014:

•

Increase in inventory

— primarily due to lower consumer demand for cold-weather products in the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of the
unseasonably warm weather.

•

Decrease in intangible assets

— driven by (i) impairment charges for

7 For All Mankind

®

and

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

to reduce the carrying values of their intangible assets to fair value, (ii) the impact of foreign currency
fluctuations, and (iii) amortization expense. See Notes E and S to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

•

Increase in short-term borrowings

— due to commercial paper borrowings needed to support general corporate purposes and the $250.0 million
discretionary pension contribution in 2015.

•

Decrease in accrued liabilities

— primarily due to lower incentive compensation accruals, and the timing of payments for other accruals and
income taxes.

•

Decrease in other liabilities

— primarily due to an improvement in the funded status of the U.S. qualified pension plan, resulting from a
$250.0 million discretionary pension contribution in 2015.

The funded status of the defined benefit pension
plans is reflected in the balance sheet as the excess (or deficiency) of pension plan assets compared with projected benefit obligations payable to plan participants. The underfunded status of the defined benefit pension plans was $156.6 million at
the end of 2015 compared with $371.7 million at the end of 2014. The underfunded status includes a $126.9 million liability related to our unfunded U.S. nonqualified defined benefit plan, $34.3 million of net liabilities related to our
non-U.S. defined benefit plans, and a $4.6 million asset related to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plan. The improvement in the funded status as of December 2015 was due to i) an increase in plan assets resulting from a $250.0 million
discretionary contribution in 2015, partially offset by a lower return on plan assets, and ii) a decrease in projected benefit obligations caused primarily by higher discount rates. See the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates”
section below and Note L to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the defined benefit pension plans.



Liquidity and Cash Flows

The financial condition of VF is reflected in the following:

%

For the ratio of debt to total capital, debt is defined as short-term and long-term borrowings, and total
capital is defined as debt plus stockholders’ equity. The increase in the debt to total capital ratio at December 2015 compared with 2014 was primarily due to the increase in short-term borrowings as explained above, and a reduction in
stockholders’ equity due to the increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss, reflecting the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the $143.6 million noncash impairment charge of intangible assets recorded in the fourth
quarter of 2015.

VF’s primary source of liquidity is the strong annual cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash
from operations is typically lower in the first half of the year as inventory builds to support peak sales periods in the second half of the year. Cash provided by operating activities in the second half of the year is substantially higher as
inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected. Additionally, direct-to-consumer sales are highest in the fourth quarter of the year.

In summary, our cash flows were as follows:

Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Cash flow provided by operating activities is dependent on the level of net income and changes in working capital. Cash provided by operating activities declined $551.1 million in 2015 primarily due to i)
a $250.0 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. qualified pension plan in 2015, ii) an increase in net cash usage from working capital changes due in part to higher inventory levels at the end of 2015 as discussed above, iii) lower cash
collections in 2015 due to the extra week in 2014, and iv) the negative impact of foreign currency exchange.

Although net income decreased in 2014 due to the impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets, cash provided by operations increased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to i) improved
operating performance, ii) increased accounts receivable collections during the 53

rd

week, and iii) the net impact of changes in noncash adjustments, primarily related to pension obligations, impairment charges, depreciation and amortization, and deferred taxes. These cash flow
increases were partially offset by the impact of higher inventory levels at the end of 2014 compared with 2013 due to anticipated revenue growth in the first quarter of 2015.

Cash Used by Investing Activities

VF’s investing
activities in 2015 related primarily to capital expenditures of $254.5 million and software purchases of $63.3 million, partially offset by $16.7 million of proceeds from the sale of a

VF Outlet

®

location. Capital expenditures increased $20.4 million compared
with 2014 primarily due to the purchase of a headquarters building in the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition. Software purchases decreased $4.7 million in 2015 primarily due to the completion of a major system implementation that incurred
significant costs throughout 2014 and



through the middle of 2015. The decrease in software purchases was partially offset by the timing of payments to vendors, as a significant amount of payments for software purchases near the end
of 2014 were made in early 2015. VF expects capital spending to approximate $300.0 million in 2016 to support continued growth. This spending is expected to be funded by cash flow from operations.

VF’s investing activities in 2014 related primarily to capital expenditures of $234.1 million and software purchases of
$67.9 million. Capital expenditures decreased $37.1 million in 2014 compared with 2013 due to the completion of a number of significant projects during 2013. Software purchases increased $14.0 million over the 2013 period due to
system implementations and a new software license agreement that supports our e-commerce infrastructure and other key business functions.

Cash Used by Financing Activities

The decrease in cash used by financing activities in 2015 compared with 2014 was driven by the $427.5 million increase in short-term borrowings discussed in “Balance Sheets” above,
partially offset by an increase of $86.3 million in cash dividends paid in 2015.

The increase in cash used by financing
activities in 2014 compared with 2013 was driven by an increase of $445.8 million in open market purchases of Common Stock and an increase of $76.8 million in cash dividends paid, partially offset by a $400.1 million decrease in payments of
long-term debt.

During 2015, 2014 and 2013, VF purchased 10.0 million, 12.0 million and 6.8 million shares,
respectively, of its Common Stock in open market transactions. The respective cost was $732.6 million, $727.8 million and $282.1 million with an average price per share of $73.00 in 2015, $60.46 in 2014 and $41.19 in 2013.

As of the end of 2015, the Company had 30.7 million shares remaining under its current share repurchase program authorized by VF’s
Board of Directors. From January 4, 2016 to February 26, 2016, the Company repurchased approximately 5.0 million shares of Common Stock in open market transactions for $301.8 million (average price per share of $59.90). VF will continue to
evaluate its use of capital, giving first priority to business acquisitions and then to direct shareholder return in the form of dividends and share repurchases.

In April 2015, VF entered into a $1.75 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit (the “Global Credit Facility”) which supports the $1.75 billion U.S. commercial paper program described
below. The Global Credit Facility expires in April 2020 and VF may request two extensions of one year each, subject to stated terms and conditions. The Global Credit Facility replaced VF’s $1.25 billion revolving credit facility that was
scheduled to expire in December 2016. The Global Credit Facility may be used to borrow funds in both U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar currencies, and has a $50.0 million letter of credit sublimit. Borrowings under the Global Credit Facility are
priced at a credit spread of 80.5 basis points over the appropriate LIBOR benchmark for each currency. VF is also required to pay a facility fee to the lenders, currently equal to 7.0 basis points of the committed amount of the facility. The credit
spread and facility fee are subject to adjustment based on VF’s credit ratings.

VF has a commercial paper program that
allows for borrowings of up to $1.75 billion to the extent that it has borrowing capacity under the Global Credit Facility. Commercial paper borrowings and standby letters of credit issued as of December 2015 were $423.0 million and $17.3 million,
respectively, leaving $1,309.7 million available for borrowing against the Global Credit Facility at December 2015.

VF has
$110.1 million of international lines of credit with various banks, which are uncommitted and may be terminated at any time by either VF or the banks. Borrowings under these arrangements had a weighted average interest rate of 6.0% and 5.3% at
December 2015 and 2014, respectively, excluding accepted letters of credit which are non-interest bearing to VF. Total outstanding balances under these arrangements were $26.6 million and $21.8 million at December 2015 and 2014, respectively.



VF’s favorable credit agency ratings allow for access to additional liquidity at
competitive rates. At the end of 2015, VF’s long-term debt ratings were ‘A’ by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and ‘A3’ by Moody’s Investors Service, and commercial paper ratings by those rating
agencies were ‘A-1’ and ‘Prime-2’, respectively. None of VF’s long-term debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings. However, if there were a change in control of VF
and, as a result of the change in control, the 2017, 2021 and 2037 notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies, VF would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased,
plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

Cash dividends totaled $1.33 per share in 2015, compared with $1.1075 in 2014 and
$0.9150 in 2013. The dividend payout rate was 46.7% of diluted earnings per share in 2015 (43.2% excluding the effects of the noncash intangible asset impairment charge), 46.5% in 2014 (36.0% excluding the effects of the noncash goodwill and
intangible asset impairment charge), and 33.8% in 2013. Based on the quarterly dividend in place, the current indicated annual dividend rate for 2016 is $1.48 per share.

As of December 2015, approximately $697.5 million of cash and short-term investments was held by international subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested. VF’s
intent is to reinvest these funds in international operations. If management decides at a later date to repatriate these funds to the U.S., VF would be required to provide taxes on these amounts based on applicable U.S. tax rates, net of foreign
taxes already paid.

Following is a summary of VF’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of 2015
that will require the use of funds:

(1)

Long-term debt consists of required principal payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations.

(2)

Other recorded liabilities represent payments due for long-term liabilities in VF’s Consolidated Balance Sheet related to deferred compensation
and other employee-related benefits, product warranty claims and other liabilities. These amounts are based on historical and forecasted cash outflows. Amounts exclude liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits and deferred income taxes.

(3)

Interest payment obligations represent required interest payments on long-term debt and the interest portion of payments on capital leases. Amounts
exclude amortization of debt issuance costs, debt discounts and acquisition costs that would be included in interest expense in the consolidated financial statements.

(4)

Operating leases represent required minimum lease payments. Most real estate leases also require payment of related operating expenses such as taxes,
insurance, utilities and maintenance. These costs are not included above and were approximately 20% of rent expense in 2015. Total lease commitments exclude $2.0 million of payments to be received under noncancelable subleases.



(5)

Minimum royalty payments represent obligations under license agreements to use trademarks owned by third parties and include required minimum
advertising commitments. Actual payments could exceed minimum royalty obligations.

(6)

Inventory obligations represent binding commitments to purchase finished goods, raw materials and sewing labor that are payable upon delivery of the
inventory to VF. This obligation excludes the amount included in accounts payable at December 2015 related to inventory purchases.

(7)

Other obligations represent other binding commitments for the expenditure of funds, including (i) amounts related to contracts not involving the
purchase of inventories, such as the noncancelable portion of service or maintenance agreements for management information systems, and (ii) capital expenditures for approved projects.

VF had other financial commitments at the end of 2015 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under
certain circumstances:

•

Funding contributions to VF’s defined benefit pension plans are not included in the table because it is uncertain whether or when further
contributions will be required.

•

$115.9 million of surety bonds, standby letters of credit and international bank guarantees are not included in the above table because they represent
contingent guarantees of performance under self-insurance and other programs and would only be drawn upon if VF were to fail to meet its other obligations.

•

Purchase orders for goods or services in the ordinary course of business are not included in the above table because they represent authorizations to
purchase rather than binding commitments.

•

VF has guaranteed approximately $1.1 million of outstanding loans issued by the International Finance Corporation to VF suppliers. At December
2015, VF has a $0.1 million liability related to the estimated fair value of these guarantees.

Management believes that VF’s cash balances and funds provided by operating activities, as well as its Global Credit Facility,
additional borrowing capacity and access to capital markets, taken as a whole, provide (i) adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and long-term obligations when due, (ii) adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to
maintain the planned dividend payout rate, and (iii) flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise.

VF
does not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes.

Risk Management

VF is exposed to risks in the ordinary course of business.
Management regularly assesses and manages exposures to these risks through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, by (i) taking advantage of natural hedges within VF, (ii) purchasing insurance from commercial carriers,
or (iii) using derivative financial instruments. Some potential risks are discussed below:

Insured risks

VF is self-insured for a significant portion of its employee medical, workers’ compensation, vehicle and general liability exposures.
VF purchases insurance from highly-rated commercial carriers to cover other risks, including directors and officers, property and umbrella, and to establish stop-loss limits on self-insurance arrangements.



Cash and equivalents risks

VF had $945.6 million of cash and equivalents at the end of 2015. Management continually monitors the credit ratings of the financial institutions with whom VF conducts business. Similarly, management
monitors the credit quality of cash equivalents.

Defined benefit pension plan risks

At the end of 2015, VF’s defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by a net total of $156.6 million. The underfunded status
includes a $126.9 million liability related to our unfunded U.S. nonqualified defined benefit plan, $34.3 million of net liabilities related to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans, and a $4.6 million asset related to our U.S. qualified
defined benefit plan. VF has made significant cash contributions in recent years to improve the funded status of its plans, including discretionary contributions to the U.S. qualified plan of $250.0 million in 2015 and $50.0 million in 2014. VF
will continue to evaluate the funded status and future funding requirements of these plans, which depends in part on the future performance of the plans’ investment portfolios. Management believes that VF has sufficient liquidity to make any
required contributions to the pension plans in future years.

VF’s reported earnings are subject to risks due to the
volatility of its pension expense. Pension expense has ranged from $57.9 million to $89.5 million over the last three years, with the fluctuations primarily due to varying amounts of actuarial gains and losses that are deferred and amortized to
future years’ expense. The assumptions that impact actuarial gains and losses include the rate of return on investments held by the pension plans, the discount rate used to value participant liabilities and demographic characteristics of the
participants.

VF has taken several steps to manage the risk and volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the
financial statements. In 2005, VF’s U.S. defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants, which did not affect the benefits of existing plan participants at that date or their accrual of future benefits. In more recent years, the investment
strategy of the U.S. defined benefit plan has been revised to define dynamic asset allocation targets that are dependent upon changes in the plan’s funded status, capital market expectations, and risk tolerance. Management will continue to
evaluate actions that may help to reduce VF’s risks related to its defined benefit plans.

Interest rate risks

VF limits the risk of interest rate fluctuations by managing the mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt. In addition, VF may use
derivative financial instruments to manage risk. Since a significant portion of VF’s long-term debt has fixed interest rates, the exposure primarily relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate short-term borrowings (which averaged
$1.0 billion during 2015). However, any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on VF’s cash equivalents. Based on the average amount of variable rate borrowings and cash equivalents during 2015, the effect of a
hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would be a decrease in reported net income of approximately $5.7 million.

Foreign currency
exchange rate risks

VF is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations. Approximately 36% of
VF’s revenues in 2015 were generated in international markets. Most of VF’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In periods where the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the euro or other foreign
currencies where VF has operations, there is a negative impact on VF’s operating results upon translation of those foreign operating results into the U.S. dollar. VF does not hedge the translation of foreign currency operating results into the
U.S. dollar; however, management does hedge foreign currency transactions as discussed later in this section.

The reported
values of assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For net advances to and investments in VF’s foreign businesses that are considered to



be long-term, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on those long-term advances are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
stockholders’ equity. The U.S. dollar value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with changes in the underlying functional currencies. VF generally does not hedge this balance sheet translation exposure.

VF monitors net foreign currency market exposures and enters into derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of exchange
rate fluctuations for a significant portion of forecasted foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions (relating to cross-border inventory purchases, production costs, product sales, operating costs and intercompany royalty
payments). VF’s practice is to buy or sell foreign currency exchange contracts that cover up to 80% of foreign currency exposures for periods of up to 24 months. Currently, VF uses only forward foreign currency exchange contracts but may use
options or collars in the future. This use of financial instruments allows management to reduce the overall exposure to risks from exchange rate fluctuations on VF’s cash flows and earnings, since gains and losses on these contracts will offset
losses and gains on the transactions being hedged.

For cash flow hedging contracts outstanding at the end of 2015, if there
were a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% compared with rates at the end of 2015, it would result in a change in fair value of those contracts of approximately $172.4 million. However, any change in the fair value of the
hedging contracts would be substantially offset by a change in the fair value of the underlying hedged exposure impacted by the currency rate changes.

Counterparty risks

VF is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of
nonperformance by counterparties to derivative hedging instruments. To manage this risk, we have established counterparty credit guidelines and only enter into derivative transactions with financial institutions with ‘A minus/A3’
investment grade credit ratings or better. VF continually monitors the credit rating of, and limits the amount hedged with, each counterparty. Additionally, management utilizes a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize exposure to potential
counterparty defaults and adjusts positions as necessary. VF also monitors counterparty risk for derivative contracts within the defined benefit pension plans.

Commodity price risks

VF is exposed to market risks for the pricing of
cotton, leather, rubber, wool and other materials, which we either purchase directly or in a converted form such as fabric or shoe soles. To manage risks of commodity price changes, management negotiates prices in advance when possible. VF has not
historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments.

Deferred compensation and related investment security
risks

VF has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities to the plans’ participants are based on
the market values of the participants’ selection of a hypothetical portfolio of investment funds, including VF Common Stock. VF invests in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the participants’ investment selections. The
increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities (except for the participants’ investment selections in VF Common Stock) are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of VF’s investments,
resulting in an insignificant net exposure to operating results and financial position. The VF Common Stock is treated as treasury shares for financial reporting purposes, so any gains or losses on those shares result in exposure to operating
results and financial position as a result of the change in participant liabilities.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

VF has chosen accounting policies that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report
VF’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the



U.S. VF applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Significant accounting policies are summarized in Note A to the consolidated financial statements.

The application of these accounting policies requires that VF make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, contingent assets and liabilities, and related disclosures. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Because VF’s business cycle is relatively short (i.e., from the date that inventory is received until that inventory is
sold and the trade receivable is collected), actual results related to most estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date. In addition, VF may retain outside specialists to assist in valuations of business acquisitions,
impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets, equity compensation, pension benefits and self-insured liabilities. If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations when the
actual amounts become known.

VF believes the following accounting policies involve the most significant management estimates,
assumptions and judgments used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors. The application of these critical accounting policies and estimates is discussed with the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors.

Inventories

VF’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes all material, labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods. Overhead
allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies. VF performs a detailed review at each business unit, at least quarterly, of all
inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual style-size-color stock keeping units to identify slow moving or excess products, discontinued and to-be-discontinued products, and off-quality merchandise. This review matches inventory on
hand, plus current production and purchase commitments, with current and expected future sales orders. Management performs an evaluation to estimate net realizable value using a systematic and consistent methodology of forecasting future demand,
market conditions and selling prices less costs of disposal. If the estimated net realizable value is less than cost, VF provides an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory. This methodology recognizes inventory exposures at the time
such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold. Historically, these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to VF’s timely identification and rapid disposal of
these distressed inventories.

Existence of physical inventory is verified through periodic physical inventory counts and
ongoing cycle counts at most locations throughout the year. VF provides for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date. Historically, physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant.

Long-lived Assets, Including Goodwill and Intangible Assets

VF allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. VF
evaluates fair value at acquisition using three valuation techniques — the replacement cost, market and income methods — and weights the valuation methods based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances. The process of assigning
fair values, particularly to acquired intangible assets, is highly subjective.

Fair value for acquired intangible assets is
generally based on the present value of expected cash flows. Indefinite-lived trademark or trade name intangible assets (collectively referred to herein as “trademarks”) represent individually acquired trademarks, some of which are
registered in multiple countries. Definite-lived



customer relationship intangible assets are based on the value of relationships with wholesale customers at the time of acquisition. Definite-lived license intangible assets relate to numerous
licensing contracts, with VF as either the licensor or licensee. Goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired, and is assigned at the reporting
unit level.

VF’s depreciation policies for property, plant and equipment reflect judgments on their estimated economic
lives and residual value, if any. VF’s amortization policies for definite-lived intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets. In evaluating the
amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets, management considers historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers. For license-related intangible assets, management considers historical trends and anticipated license
renewal periods.

VF’s policy is to review property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets for
potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. VF tests for potential impairment at the asset or asset group level, which is the lowest level for
which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent. VF measures recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group by comparison with the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the
forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset are not expected to be adequate to recover the asset’s carrying value, a fair value analysis must be performed, and an impairment charge is recorded if there is an excess of the
asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value.

When testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential
impairment, management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition. Management uses the multi-period excess earnings method, which is a specific application
of the discounted cash flow method, to value customer relationship assets. Under this method, VF calculates the present value of the after-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationship asset after deducting contributory asset
charges.

VF’s policy is to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the
beginning of the fourth quarter of each year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount. As part of its annual impairment testing, VF may elect to assess qualitative
factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing. If management’s assessment of these qualitative factors indicates that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible
asset or reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then no further testing is required. Otherwise, the intangible asset or reporting unit must be quantitatively tested for impairment.

An indefinite-lived intangible asset is quantitatively tested for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset
with its carrying value. Fair value of an indefinite-lived trademark is based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. Under this method, forecasted revenues for products sold with the trademark are assigned a royalty rate that
would be charged to license the trademark (in lieu of ownership), and the fair value is calculated as the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark. The appropriate discount rate is based on the reporting
unit’s weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) that considers market participant assumptions, plus a spread that factors in the risk of the intangible asset. The royalty rate is selected based on consideration of i) royalty rates
included in active license agreements, if applicable, ii) royalty rates received by market participants in the apparel industry, and iii) the current performance of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the trademark intangible asset
exceeds its carrying value, there is no impairment charge. If the estimated fair value of the trademark is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference.

Goodwill is quantitatively evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying
value. Reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information that is



available and reviewed by coalition management. In the first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test, VF compares the carrying value of a reporting unit, including its recorded
goodwill, to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit.

For goodwill impairment testing, VF estimates the fair value of
a reporting unit using both income-based and market-based valuation methods. The income-based approach is based on the reporting unit’s forecasted future cash flows that are discounted to present value using the reporting unit’s WACC
discussed above. For the market-based approach, management uses both the guideline company and similar transaction methods. The guideline company method analyzes market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (“EBITDA”) for a group of comparable public companies. The market multiples used in the valuation are based on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit compared to the selected guideline companies. Under the
similar transactions method, valuation multiples are calculated utilizing actual transaction prices and revenue/EBITDA data from target companies deemed similar to the reporting unit.

Based on the range of estimated fair values developed from the income and market-based methods, VF determines the estimated fair value
for the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required. However, if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its
carrying value, VF performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the impairment charge, if any. The second step involves a hypothetical allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its tangible and
intangible assets (excluding goodwill) and liabilities as if the reporting unit were newly acquired, which results in an implied fair value of the goodwill. The amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the recorded goodwill, if any, over the
implied fair value of the goodwill.

The income-based fair value methodology requires management’s assumptions and
judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which VF operates and conditions in the capital markets, many of which are outside of management’s control. At the reporting unit level, fair value estimation requires management’s
assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific reporting unit, along with assessment of the reporting unit’s strategies and forecasts of future cash flows. Forecasts of individual reporting unit
cash flows involve management’s estimates and assumptions regarding:

•

Annual cash flows, on a debt-free basis, arising from future revenues and profitability, changes in working capital, capital spending and income taxes
for at least a 10-year forecast period.

•

A terminal growth rate for years beyond the forecast period. The terminal growth rate is selected based on consideration of growth rates used in the
forecast period, historical performance of the reporting unit and economic conditions.

•

A discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in realizing the forecasted cash flows. A discount rate considers the risk-free rate of return on
long-term treasury securities, the risk premium associated with investing in equity securities of comparable companies, the beta obtained from comparable companies and the cost of debt for investment grade issuers. In addition, the discount rate may
consider any company-specific risk in achieving the prospective financial information.

Under the
market-based fair value methodology, judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions. Management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market
participants performing similar valuations of VF’s reporting units.

Management concluded that there
were no triggering events that caused us to test goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets prior to our annual impairment testing date on the first day of the fourth quarter, which coincided with the timing of the severe performance decline in
the Contemporary Brands coalition. As such, management performed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset

impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015. VF elected to bypass the qualitative

assessment and perform a quantitative analysis for the

Timberland

and

Reef

reporting units, and for the

®

, Reef

®

,
Rock &

®

,

®

trademark intangible assets. Management performed a qualitative analysis for all
other reporting units and trademark intangible assets, as discussed below in the “Other reporting units — qualitative impairment analysis” section.

Timberland

®

impairment analysis

As of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015, VF performed a quantitative impairment analysis of the goodwill
and trademark intangible asset for the

Timberland

®

reporting unit and concluded that both the
goodwill and the trademark were not impaired. The estimated fair values of the goodwill and trademark intangible asset exceeded their respective carrying values by a significant amount.

The

Timberland

®

reporting unit, acquired in 2011, sells outdoor, adventure-inspired lifestyle footwear, apparel and accessories for men, women and children. Products are sold
globally through multiple wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels.

The

Timberland

®

reporting unit has experienced strong revenue and profit growth in recent years, primarily due to product
innovation and heightened brand awareness which has led to solid performance in the wholesale and e-commerce businesses. Key assumptions developed by VF management and used in our quantitative analysis of the

Timberland

®

reporting unit and trademark asset include:

•

Moderate revenue growth rates in line with recent history, balanced across the wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels

•

Additional openings of retail stores and continued growth in the e-commerce business

•

Wholesale growth driven by continued door expansion with existing and new customers

•

Modest gross margin expansion in line with recent history and based on updated strategies

•

Increased leverage of selling, general and administrative expenses on higher revenues

•

Improved profitability over historical levels based on the assumptions discussed above

•

Market-based discount rates

•

Royalty rate based on active license agreements of the brand

Actual results for the

Timberland

®

reporting unit may vary from projected results. Accordingly, management performed sensitivity analysis on the impairment models and concluded that the reporting
unit goodwill and trademark intangible asset were not impaired, even with significant negative changes made to key assumptions. For example, a 50% decrease in the forecasted cumulative average revenue growth rate used in the trademark intangible
asset impairment model did not cause its estimated fair value to decline below carrying value. Similarly for goodwill, a 50% decrease in projected cash flows did not cause the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to decline below its carrying
value. Separately, a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate did not cause the estimated fair values of the

Timberland

®

reporting unit or trademark intangible asset to decline below their respective carrying values.

Reef

®

impairment analysis

As of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015, VF performed a
quantitative impairment analysis of the goodwill and trademark intangible asset for the

Reef

®

reporting unit and concluded that both the goodwill and the trademark were not impaired. The estimated fair values of the goodwill and trademark intangible asset exceeded their respective carrying values by a significant amount.

The

Reef

®

reporting unit, acquired in 2005, sells surf-inspired products including sandals, shoes, swimwear, casual apparel and accessories for men, women and children.
Products are sold through the wholesale channel and online primarily in North America, as well as in European and South American markets. As part of the 2009 annual impairment analysis, a portion of the

Reef

®

goodwill ($31.1 million) and trademark ($5.6 million) was written down to estimated fair values of $48.3
million and $74.4 million, respectively.



Recent performance by the brand has been negatively impacted by
isolated events such as an unseasonably cold Spring in 2014 and supplier issues in 2015. However, VF is optimistic about the brand because of the one-off nature of these recent occurrences that negatively impacted sales, the success of recent
product introductions, and continued operational growth in Europe. Key assumptions developed by VF management and used in our quantitative analysis of the

Reef

®

reporting unit and trademark asset include:

•

Modest revenue growth in the wholesale channel driven by door expansion with existing and new customers

•

Strong growth in the e-commerce business

•

Modest gross margin expansion based on updated strategies

•

Increased leverage of selling, general and administrative expenses on higher revenues

•

Improved profitability over historical levels based on the assumptions discussed above

•

Market-based discount rates

•

Royalty rate based on active license agreements of the brand

Actual results for the

Reef

®

reporting unit may vary from projected results. Accordingly, management performed sensitivity analysis on the impairment models and concluded that the reporting
unit goodwill and trademark intangible asset were not impaired, even with significant negative changes made to key assumptions. For example, a 50% decrease in the forecasted cumulative average revenue growth rate used in the trademark intangible
asset impairment model did not cause its estimated fair value to decline below carrying value. Similarly for goodwill, a 50% decrease in projected cash flows did not cause the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to decline below its carrying
value. Separately, a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate did not cause the estimated fair values of the

Reef

®

reporting unit or trademark intangible asset to decline below their respective carrying
values.

Rock & Republic

®

impairment analysis

As of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015, VF performed a quantitative impairment analysis of the trademark
intangible asset for the

Rock & Republic

®

brand and concluded that the trademark was not
impaired. The estimated fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeded its carrying value of $58.1 million by 4%.

The

Rock & Republic

®

brand was acquired in 2011
and has an exclusive wholesale distribution and licensing arrangement with Kohl’s Corporation. Recent performance of the brand has been negatively impacted by challenging consumer trends in the women’s denim category.

VF expects that recent price changes, new product launches, and increased marketing and supply chain initiatives in
collaboration with Kohl’s will improve the brand’s performance in future periods. Key assumptions developed by VF management and used in our quantitative analysis of the

Rock & Republic

®

trademark asset include:

•

Modest revenue growth, primarily driven by the licensing business

•

Market-based discount rates

•

Royalty rate based on the current exclusive agreement with Kohl’s

In February 2016, VF and Kohl’s agreed to renew the contract for an additional three-year term, with four
optional three-year renewal periods. The terms of the agreement are consistent with the assumptions used in our analysis. However, actual results for the

Rock and Republic

®

brand may vary from projected results. Additionally, because our quantitative analysis shows that the estimated fair value of the trademark is essentially
equal to its carrying value, any negative variances from our assumptions would result in a decrease in



fair value and a potential impairment charge. For example, a 10% decrease in the forecasted cumulative average revenue growth rate for the licensing business, or a 100 basis point increase in the
discount rate, would cause the estimated fair value of the trademark to decline below its carrying value.

Splendid

®

and Ella Moss

®

impairment analysis

VF performed a fair value assessment of the trademark intangible asset for the

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

reporting unit as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015, and recorded a $15.3 million impairment charge.

The

Splendid

®

and

Ella
Moss

®

reporting unit, acquired in 2009, sells premium tops and casual apparel primarily in the
women’s contemporary apparel space. In recent years, the brand has been negatively impacted by challenging consumer trends in women’s contemporary apparel, which has led to reduced foot traffic and increased promotional activity in
department stores and in our VF-operated stores. As a result, all goodwill related to the

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

reporting unit was written off as part of the 2014 impairment analysis ($142.4 million). Additionally in 2014, management recognized impairment charges related to
the

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

trademark and definite-lived customer relationship asset of $45.7 million and $64.2 million, respectively.

In 2015, the

Splendid

®

and

Ella
Moss

®

reporting unit continued to be challenged by reduced consumer demand for contemporary apparel,
particularly in the later months of the year, which caused brand performance to miss the revenue and profitability projections used in the 2014 impairment analysis. Management’s revenue and profitability forecasts used in the

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

trademark valuation were developed in conjunction with management’s annual strategic plan review conducted in the fourth quarter. Our resulting revised
outlook for business performance took a more cautious view and considered recent performance and trends, strategic initiatives, the general softness of the contemporary apparel market, and expected further declines in this market. Key assumptions
developed by VF management and used in our quantitative analysis of the

Splendid

®

and

Ella
Moss

®

trademark include:

•

Modest revenue decline, primarily driven by the wholesale channel

•

Market-based discount rates

•

Royalty rate based on active license agreements of these brands

The

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

trademark has a remaining carrying value of $37.9 million as of December 2015. Because actual results for the

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

reporting unit may vary from projected results, management performed sensitivity analysis on the trademark impairment
valuation, noting that a 50% increase in the forecasted cumulative average revenue rate of decline used in the valuation would increase the 2015 trademark impairment charge by approximately $2.5 million. Separately, a 100 basis point increase in the
discount rate would increase the impairment charge by approximately $3.2 million.

Also in 2015,
management concluded that a triggering event occurred related to the

Splendid

®

and

Ella
Moss

®

definite-lived customer relationship intangible asset based on the results of the
trademark valuation, as well as management’s annual strategic plan review conducted in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, management performed a quantitative impairment analysis, which utilized the assumptions listed above for the trademark
valuation, and also considered historical attrition rates, revenues and profitability related to wholesale customers that existed at acquisition. VF recorded an $11.7 million impairment charge for the

Splendid

and

customer relationship asset, which has no remaining carrying
value as of December 2015.

7 For All Mankind

®

impairment analysis

VF performed a fair value assessment of the trademark intangible asset at the

7 For All Mankind

®

reporting unit as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015, and recorded a $76.1 million impairment
charge.



The

7 For All Mankind

®

reporting unit, acquired in 2007, markets premium denim through wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels
primarily in North America and Europe. Over the last several years, the brand has been negatively impacted by ongoing challenges in the premium denim market. As a result, all goodwill related to the


For All Mankind

®

reporting unit was written off as part of the 2010 impairment analysis. In addition, a portion of the original
value of the trademark was impaired in 2010 ($6.6 million) and 2014 ($87.6 million) as part of the trademark impairment analysis for those years. Also in 2014, management recorded a $56.6 million impairment charge related to the

7 For All
Mankind

®

customer relationship asset.

In 2015, the market for premium denim and apparel continued to decline as reduced consumer demand was amplified by a reduction in tourism, which negatively impacted revenues at our stores in urban and
tourist locations, particularly in the later months of the year. As a result, the brand’s 2015 performance missed the revenue and profitability projections included in the 2014 impairment analysis. Management’s revenue and profitability
forecasts used in the

7 For All Mankind

®

trademark valuation were developed in conjunction with
management’s annual strategic plan review conducted in the fourth quarter. Our resulting revised outlook for business performance took a more cautious view and considered recent performance and trends, strategic initiatives, the general
softness of the premium denim and apparel market, and expected further declines in this market. Key assumptions developed by VF management and used in our quantitative analysis of the

7 For All Mankind

®

trademark include:

•

Relatively flat wholesale and direct-to-consumer revenues, with near-term declines forecasted for both channels.

•

Market-based discount rates

•

Royalty rate based on active license agreements of the brand

The

7 For All Mankind

®

trademark has a
remaining carrying value of $126.1 million as of December 2015. Because actual results for the

7 For All
Mankind

®

reporting unit may vary from projected results, management performed sensitivity analysis on the trademark impairment valuation, noting that a 50% decrease in the
forecasted cumulative average revenue growth rate used in the valuation would increase the 2015 trademark impairment charge by approximately $4.6 million. Separately, a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase the impairment
charge by approximately $10.8 million.

Also in 2015, management concluded that a triggering event
occurred related to the

7 For All Mankind

®

definite-lived customer relationship intangible asset
based on the results of the trademark valuation, as well as management’s annual strategic plan review conducted in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, management performed a quantitative impairment analysis, which utilized the assumptions listed
above for the trademark valuation, and also considered historical attrition rates, revenues and profitability related to wholesale customers that existed at acquisition. VF recorded a $40.5 million impairment charge for the

7 For All
Mankind

®

customer relationship asset, which has no remaining carrying value as of December 2015.

Other reporting units — qualitative impairment analysis

For all other reporting units, VF elected to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the goodwill and trademark intangible assets in those reporting units
were impaired. In this qualitative assessment, VF considered relevant events and circumstances for each reporting unit, including (i) current year results, ii) financial performance versus management’s annual and five-year strategic plans,
iii) changes in the reporting unit carrying value since prior year, (iv) industry and market conditions in which the reporting unit operates, (v) macroeconomic conditions, including discount rate changes, and (vi) changes in products
or services offered by the reporting unit. If applicable, performance in recent years was compared to forecasts included in prior valuations. Based on the results of the qualitative assessment, VF concluded that it was not more likely than not that
the carrying values of the goodwill and trademark intangible assets were greater than their fair values, and that further quantitative testing was not necessary.



Management’s use of estimates and assumptions

It is possible that VF’s conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or intangible assets in any reporting unit
could change in future periods. There can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing performed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2015 will prove to be accurate
predictions of the future, if, for example, (i) the businesses do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in 2016 or future years vary from current assumptions (including changes in discount rates), (iii) business
conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions, including loss of major customers, (iv) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or (v) enterprise values of
comparable publicly traded companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and EBITDA.

A future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on VF’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.

Stock Options

VF uses a
lattice option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the Board of Directors. VF believes that a lattice model provides a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can
incorporate (i) historical option exercise patterns and multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders and (ii) inputs that vary over time, such as assumptions for interest rates and
volatility. Management performs an annual review of all assumptions employed in the valuation of option grants and believes they are reflective of the outstanding options and underlying Common Stock and of groups of option participants. The lattice
valuation incorporates the assumptions listed in Note N to the consolidated financial statements.

One of the critical
assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before they are exercised. For each option grant, VF estimated the expected average life based on evaluations of the historical and expected option exercise
patterns for each of the groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns. These evaluations included (i) voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of VF
Common Stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and (ii) involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover, retirement and death.

Volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment. Management bases its estimates of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility. Implied volatility is based on
short-term (6 to 9 months) publicly traded near-the-money options on VF Common Stock. VF measures historical volatility over a ten-year period, corresponding to the contractual term of the options, using daily stock prices.
Management’s assumption for valuation purposes is that expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical volatility over the remainder of the ten-year option term.

Pension Obligations

VF
sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most full-time U.S. employees hired before 2005 and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits in excess of the limitations imposed by income tax
regulations. VF also sponsors certain non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The selection of actuarial assumptions for determining the projected pension benefit liabilities and annual pension expense is significant due to amounts involved and the
long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid.

Management reviews annually the principal economic actuarial
assumptions, summarized in Note L to the consolidated financial statements, and revises them as appropriate based on current rates and trends. VF also



periodically reviews and revises, as necessary, other plan assumptions such as rates of compensation increases, retirement, termination, disability and mortality. VF believes the assumptions
appropriately reflect the participants’ demographics and projected benefit obligations of the plans and result in the best estimate of the plans’ future experience. Actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used.

Effective fiscal year 2015, VF early-adopted FASB ASU 2015-04,

Practical Expedient for Measurement Date of an Employer’s Defined
Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets

. This standard permits companies with a non-calendar fiscal year-end to use the calendar month end closest to their fiscal year-end to measure defined benefit plan assets and liabilities. Therefore, all plan
assets and liabilities were valued as of December 31, 2015. This did not impact our valuation as December 31, 2015 was also the last business day of our fiscal year.

The below discussion of discount rate, return on assets and mortality assumptions relate specifically to the U.S. pension plans, as they comprise approximately 93% of VF’s total defined benefit plan
assets and approximately 92% of VF’s total projected benefit obligations of the combined U.S. and international plans.

One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate, which is used to estimate the present value of future
cash outflows necessary to meet projected benefit obligations for the specific plan. It is the estimated interest rate that VF could use to settle its projected benefit obligations at the valuation date. The discount rate assumption is based on
current market interest rates. VF selects a discount rate for each of the U.S. pension plans by matching high quality corporate bond yields to the timing of projected benefit payments to participants in each plan. VF uses the population of U.S.
corporate bonds rated ‘Aa’ by Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services. VF excludes the highest and lowest yielding bonds from this population of approximately 688 such bonds having at least
$50.0 million outstanding that are noncallable/nonputable unless with make-whole provisions. Each plan’s projected benefit payments are matched to current market interest rates over the expected payment period to calculate an associated
present value. A single equivalent discount rate is then determined that produces the same present value. The resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan’s distinct liability characteristics.
VF believes that those ‘Aa’ rated issues meet the “high quality” intent of the applicable accounting standards and that the 2015 discount rates of 4.45% for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and 4.44% for the
unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan appropriately reflect current market conditions and the long-term nature of projected benefit payments to participants in the U.S. pension plans. These higher discount rates, compared with the rates of
4.05% for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and 4.00% for the unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan at the end of 2014, reflect the general increase in yields of U.S. government obligations and high quality corporate bonds during
2015. The discount rate for the plans may differ from the rates used by other companies because of a longer expected duration of benefit payments reflecting (i) the higher percentage of female participants who generally have a longer life
expectancy than males and (ii) the higher percentage of inactive participants who will not begin receiving vested benefits for many years.

The SEC announced in 2015 that it would not object to companies using the spot rate approach, a more granular approach to measuring service cost and interest cost. VF adopted the spot rate approach at
year-end 2015. Previously, the same single equivalent discount rate determined for measuring the projected benefit obligation was also used to determine service cost and interest cost. Under the new spot rate approach, the full yield curve is
applied separately to cash flows for each projected benefit obligation, service cost, and interest cost for a more precise calculation. The change to the spot rate approach on the year-end 2015 projected benefit obligation valuation had an
immaterial impact. However, the new approach impacts 2016 pension expense by lowering service cost and interest cost by approximately $13.5 million. VF expects that the spot rate approach will continue to lower service and interest cost in
the next several years.

Another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected long-term rate of return
on investments. VF’s investment objective is to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets with an acceptable level of risk to maximize the long-term return while minimizing volatility in the value of plan assets relative to the value of plan



liabilities. These risks include market, interest rate, credit, liquidity, regulatory and foreign securities risks. Investment assets consist of U.S. and international equity, corporate and
governmental fixed-income securities, insurance contracts, and alternative assets. VF develops a projected rate of return for each of the investment asset classes based on many factors, including historical and expected returns, the estimated
inflation rate, the premium to be earned in excess of a risk-free return, the premium for equity risk and the premium for longer duration fixed-income securities. The weighted average projected long-term rates of return of the various assets held by
the qualified plan provide the basis for the expected long-term rate of return actuarial assumption. VF’s rate of return assumption was 6.25% in 2015, 6.50% in 2014 and 7.00% in 2013. In recent years, VF has altered the investment mix by
(i) increasing the allocation to fixed-income investments and reducing the allocation to equity investments, (ii) increasing the allocation in equities to more international investments and, (iii) adding alternative assets as an asset
class. The changes in asset allocation are anticipated, over time, to reduce the year-to-year variability of the U.S. plan’s funded status and resulting pension expense. Management monitors the plan’s asset allocation to balance risk with
anticipated investment returns in a given year. Based on an evaluation of market conditions and projected market returns, VF will be using a rate of return assumption of 6.00% for the U.S. plan for 2016.

We consistently review all of our demographic assumptions as part of the normal management of our defined benefit plans, and update these
assumptions as appropriate. In 2014, the Society of Actuaries (SOA) issued new mortality tables (RP-2014) and mortality improvement scales (MP-2014) which reflect longer life expectancies than the previous tables. This updated information was
considered, along with the characteristics of our plan-specific populations and other data where appropriate, in developing our best estimate of the expected mortality rates of plan participants in the U.S. pension plans. In 2015, the SOA
issued MP-2015, an updated scale (based on the same underlying SOA RP-2014 study) that reflects two additional years of mortality experience. VF considered the newly released MP-2015 and determined it is directionally consistent with the
assumptions adopted by VF in 2014.

Differences between actual results in a given year and the actuarially determined
assumed results for that year (e.g., investment performance, discount rates and other assumptions) do not affect that year’s pension expense, but instead are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in accumulated other
comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At the end of 2015, there were $586.8 million of pretax accumulated deferred actuarial losses, plus $17.5 million of pretax deferred prior service costs, resulting in an
after tax amount of $372.2 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet. These deferred losses will be amortized as a component of pension expense.

Pension expense recognized in the financial statements was $64.8 million in 2015, $57.9 million in 2014 and $89.5 million in 2013. This
compares with the cost of pension benefits actually earned each year by covered active employees (commonly called “service cost”) of $29.2 million in 2015, $24.2 million in 2014 and $25.4 million in 2013. Pension expense has been
significantly higher than the annual service cost in recent years due to the amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses (as discussed in the preceding paragraph). Looking forward, VF expects 2016 pension expense to decrease to approximately
$61.8 million which reflects a reduction in expense related to application of the spot rate approach, partially offset by an increase in amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses.



The sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on 2015 pension expense and on projected
benefit obligations related to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan at the end of 2015, all other factors being equal, is illustrated by the following:

As discussed in the “Risk Management” section above, VF has taken several steps to reduce
volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements. On a longer-term basis, VF believes the year-to-year variability of the retirement benefit expense should decrease.

Income Taxes

As a
global company, VF is subject to income taxes and files income tax returns in over 100 U.S. and foreign jurisdictions each year. Almost every jurisdiction in which VF operates has a lower effective income tax rate than the U.S. As discussed in
Note O to the consolidated financial statements, VF has been granted a lower effective income tax rate on taxable earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may
be subject to significant change. The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. VF makes an ongoing assessment to identify any
significant exposure related to increases in tax rates in international jurisdictions.

In February 2015, the European Union
Commission (“EU”) opened a state aid investigation into rulings granted to companies under Belgium’s excess profit tax regime. On January 11, 2016, the EU announced its decision that these rulings were illegal and ordered that
tax benefits granted under these rulings should be collected from the affected companies, including VF. If this matter is adversely resolved, the Belgian government may be required to assess, and VF may be required to pay, past taxes reflective of
the disallowed alleged state aid that VF received in years 2010 through 2014. VF is currently assessing its legal options and the impact that an adverse outcome would have on the Company’s financial statements in future periods, but does not
expect the impact to be material.

The calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of
complex tax laws and regulations, which are subject to legal interpretation and significant management judgment. VF’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and those audits may result in
proposed adjustments. VF has reviewed all issues raised upon examination, as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations. VF has evaluated these potential issues under the “more-likely-than-not” standard of
the accounting literature. A tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. Such judgments and estimates may change based on audit
settlements, court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent VF prevails in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which a liability
for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances has been established, or to the extent VF is required to pay amounts greater than the established liability for unrecognized tax benefits. VF does not currently anticipate any material impact on
earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties. There are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses.



VF has $139.6 million of gross deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and
capital loss carryforwards, and $95.4 million of valuation allowances against those assets. Realization of deferred tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions,
the amount and timing of which are uncertain, and on possible changes in tax laws. If management believes that VF will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods, VF records
valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized. If in a future period management determines that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount, VF would
record an adjustment to income tax expense in that future period.

VF has not provided U.S. income taxes on a portion of the
foreign subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings because these earnings are permanently reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions. VF has not determined the deferred tax liabilities associated with these undistributed earnings, as such
determination is not practicable. If VF decided to remit those earnings to the U.S. in a future period, the provision for income taxes could increase in that period.

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, VF conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of VF’s “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) as of January 2, 2016. These require that
VF ensure that information required to be disclosed by VF in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to VF’s management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on VF’s evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer concluded that VF’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of VF Corporation (“VF”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). VF’s
management conducted an assessment of VF’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework described in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013),

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, VF’s management has determined that VF’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 2, 2016.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of VF Corporation

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)1 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of VF Corporation
and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) at January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 2, 2016 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)2 presents fairly, in all material respects, the information
set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2016,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial
statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of
internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it classifies deferred taxes in
2015.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

Note A — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

VF Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, collectively known as “VF”) is a global apparel and footwear company based in the United States. VF designs, produces, procures, markets and
distributes a variety of products, including jeanswear, outerwear, footwear, backpacks, luggage, sportswear, and occupational and performance apparel, for consumers of all ages. Products are marketed primarily under VF-owned brand names.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements and related disclosures are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
the U.S (“GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of VF and its controlled subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances.

Fiscal Year

VF operates and reports using a 52/53 week fiscal year ending
on the Saturday closest to December 31 of each year. All references to “2015”, “2014” and “2013” relate to the 52-week fiscal year ended January 2, 2016, the 53-week fiscal year ended January 3, 2015, and
the 52-week fiscal year ended December 28, 2013, respectively. Certain foreign subsidiaries report using a December 31 year-end due to local statutory requirements.

Use of Estimates

In preparing the consolidated financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transaction

The financial statements of most foreign subsidiaries are measured using the foreign currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S.
dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. Resulting translation gains and losses, and transaction gains and losses on long-term advances to
foreign subsidiaries, are reported in other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”).

Foreign currency transactions are
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of a particular entity. These transactions generally result in receivables or payables that are fixed in the foreign currency. Transaction gains or losses arise when exchange rate
fluctuations either increase or decrease the functional currency cash flows from the originally recorded transaction. As discussed in Note T, VF enters into derivative contracts to manage foreign currency risk on certain of these transactions.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, net of the related hedging impact, were a loss of $9.0 million in 2015, a gain of $6.1 million in 2014, and a gain of $9.1 million in 2013.

Cash and Equivalents

Cash and equivalents are demand deposits, receivables from third-party credit card processors, and highly liquid investments that mature
within three months of their purchase dates. Cash equivalents totaling $535.1 million and $585.9 million at December 2015 and 2014, respectively, consist of money market funds and short-term time deposits.

Accounts Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts, less estimated allowances for trade terms, sales incentive programs, discounts, markdowns, chargebacks and returns as discussed below in

Revenue Recognition

. Royalty receivables are recorded at amounts earned based on the licensees’ sales of licensed products, subject in some cases to contractual minimum annual royalties due from individual licensees. VF maintains an
allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that will result from the inability of customers and licensees to make required payments. The allowance is determined based on review of specific customer accounts where collection is doubtful, as
well as an assessment of the collectability of total receivables considering the aging of balances, historical and anticipated trends, and current economic conditions. All accounts are subject to ongoing review of ultimate collectability.
Receivables are written off against the allowance when it is probable the amounts will not be recovered.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”)
method and is net of discounts or rebates received from vendors.

Long-lived Assets, Including Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill are initially recorded at cost. VF capitalizes improvements
to property, plant and equipment that substantially extend the useful life of the asset, and interest cost incurred during construction of major assets. Assets under capital leases are recorded at the present value of minimum lease payments. Repair
and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Cost for acquired intangible assets is fair value, based generally on the
present value of expected cash flows. Trademark intangible assets represent individual acquired trademarks, some of which are registered in multiple countries. Customer relationship intangible assets are based on the value of relationships with
wholesale customers in place at the time of acquisition. License intangible assets relate to numerous licensing contracts, with VF as either the licensor or licensee.

Goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is assigned at the reporting unit level.

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets, ranging from 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment and up to 40 years for buildings. Amortization expense for leasehold improvements and assets under capital leases is recognized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or
the lease terms, and is included in depreciation expense.

Intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives, consisting
of major trademarks and trade names, are not amortized. Other intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, contracts to license trademarks to third parties and contracts to license trademarks from third parties, are amortized over their
estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 30 years. Amortization of intangible assets is computed using straight-line or accelerated methods consistent with the timing of the expected benefits to be received.

Depreciation and amortization expense related to producing or otherwise obtaining finished goods inventories is included in cost of goods
sold, and other depreciation and amortization expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

F-11


VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 2015

VF’s policy is to review property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible
assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset are not expected to
recover the asset’s carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value.

VF’s policy is to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year, or whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount. VF may first assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing. If VF determines
that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an asset or reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then no further testing is required. Otherwise, the assets must be quantitatively tested for impairment.

An indefinite-lived intangible asset is quantitatively evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the
asset with its carrying value. An impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. Goodwill is quantitatively evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting
unit with its carrying value, including the goodwill assigned to that reporting unit. An impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are
measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized as assets and liabilities, respectively, and classified as current or noncurrent based on the derivatives’ maturity dates. The accounting for
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments (i.e., gains and losses) depends on whether a derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and on the nature of the hedging relationship. The criteria used to
determine if a derivative instrument qualifies for hedge accounting treatment are (i) whether an appropriate hedging instrument has been identified and designated to reduce a specific exposure and (ii) whether there is a high correlation
between changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the identified exposure based on the nature of the hedging relationship. VF’s hedging practices are described in Note T. VF does not use derivative instruments for trading or
speculative purposes. Hedging cash flows are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same category as the items being hedged.

VF formally documents hedging instruments and hedging relationships at the inception of each contract. Further, at the inception of a contract and on an ongoing basis, VF assesses whether the hedging
instruments are effective in offsetting the risk of the hedged transactions. Occasionally, a portion of a derivative instrument will be considered ineffective in hedging the originally identified exposure due to a decline in amount or a change in
timing of the hedged exposure. In that case, hedge accounting treatment is discontinued for the ineffective portion of that hedging instrument, and any change in fair value for the ineffective portion is recognized in net income.

VF also uses derivative contracts to manage foreign currency exchange risk on certain assets and liabilities. These contracts are not
designated as hedges, and are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in fair value recognized directly in net income.

The counterparties to the derivative contracts are financial institutions having at least A-rated investment grade credit ratings. To manage its credit risk, VF continually monitors the credit risks of
its counterparties,

F-12


VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 2015

limits its exposure in the aggregate and to any single counterparty, and adjusts its hedging positions as appropriate. The impact of VF’s credit risk and the credit risk of its
counterparties, as well as the ability of each party to fulfill its obligations under the contracts, is considered in determining the fair value of the derivative contracts. Credit risk has not had a significant effect on the fair value of VF’s
derivative contracts. VF does not have any credit risk-related contingent features or collateral requirements with its derivative contracts.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when (i) there is a contract or other arrangement of sale, (ii) the sales price is fixed or determinable,
(iii) title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer and (iv) collection of the receivable is reasonably assured. Sales to wholesale customers and e-commerce sales are generally recognized when the product has been
received by the customer. Sales at VF-operated retail stores are recognized at the time products are purchased by consumers. Revenue from the sale of gift cards is deferred until the gift card is redeemed by the customer or the Company determines
that the likelihood of redemption is remote and that it does not have a legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift card to any jurisdiction under unclaimed property regulations.

Net sales reflect adjustments for estimated allowances for trade terms, sales incentive programs, discounts, markdowns, chargebacks and
returns. These allowances are estimated based on evaluations of specific product and customer circumstances, historical and anticipated trends, and current economic conditions.

Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected from customers and
remitted directly to governmental authorities are excluded from net sales.

Royalty income is recognized as earned based on
the greater of the licensees’ sales of licensed products at rates specified in the licensing contracts or contractual minimum royalty levels.

Cost of Goods Sold

Cost of goods sold for VF-manufactured goods includes
all materials, labor and overhead costs incurred in the production process. Cost of goods sold for purchased finished goods includes the purchase costs and related overhead. In both cases, overhead includes all costs related to manufacturing or
purchasing finished goods, including costs of planning, purchasing, quality control, depreciation, freight, duties, royalties paid to third parties and shrinkage. For product lines with a warranty, a provision for estimated future repair or
replacement costs, based on historical and anticipated trends, is recorded when these products are sold.

Selling, General and
Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs of product development, selling,
marketing and advertising, VF-operated retail stores, concession retail stores, warehousing, distribution, shipping and handling, licensing and administration. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $712.6 million in 2015, $713.7
million in 2014 and $671.3 million in 2013. Advertising costs include cooperative advertising payments made to VF’s customers as reimbursement for their costs of advertising VF’s products, and totaled $61.9 million in 2015, $62.6 million
in 2014 and $58.6 million in 2013. Shipping and handling costs for delivery of products to customers totaled $348.1 million in 2015, $309.9 million in 2014 and $298.5 million in 2013. Expenses related to royalty income, including amortization of
licensed intangible assets, were $13.0 million in 2015, $13.2 million in 2014 and $13.4 million in 2013.

VF CORPORATION

Rent Expense

VF enters into noncancelable operating leases for retail stores, office space, distribution facilities and equipment. Leases for real estate typically have initial terms ranging from 3 to 15 years,
generally with renewal options. Leases for equipment typically have initial terms ranging from 2 to 5 years. Most leases have fixed rentals, with many of the real estate leases requiring additional payments for real estate taxes and
occupancy-related costs. Contingent rent expense, owed when sales at individual retail store locations exceed a stated base amount, is recognized when the liability is probable. Rent expense for leases having rent holidays, landlord incentives or
scheduled rent increases is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term beginning with the earlier of the lease commencement date, or the date VF takes possession or control of the leased premises. The amount of the excess straight-line
rent expense over scheduled payments is recorded as a deferred liability.

Self-insurance

VF is self-insured for a significant portion of its employee medical, workers’ compensation, vehicle, property and general liability
exposures. Liabilities for self-insured exposures are accrued at the present value of amounts expected to be paid based on historical claims experience and actuarial data for forecasted settlements of claims filed and for incurred but not yet
reported claims. Accruals for self-insured exposures are included in current and noncurrent liabilities based on the expected periods of payment. Excess liability insurance has been purchased to limit the amount of self-insured risk on claims.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are provided on pretax income for financial reporting purposes. Income taxes are based on amounts of taxes payable or
refundable in the current year and on expected future tax consequences of events that are recognized in the consolidated financial statements in different periods than they are recognized in tax returns. As a result of timing of recognition and
measurement differences between financial accounting standards and income tax laws, temporary differences arise between amounts of pretax financial statement income and taxable income, and between reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect the estimated future tax impact of these temporary differences and net operating loss and net
capital loss carryforwards, based on tax rates currently enacted for the years in which the differences are expected to be settled or realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions.
Valuation allowances are used to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts considered more likely than not to be realized. U.S. deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries where such earnings are considered to
be permanently reinvested. Accrued income taxes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets include unrecognized income tax benefits, along with related interest and penalties, appropriately classified as current or noncurrent. All deferred tax assets and
liabilities are classified as noncurrent in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The provision for income taxes also includes estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net
income by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share assumes conversion of potentially dilutive securities such as stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units.

December 2015

Concentration of Risks

VF markets products to a broad customer base throughout the world. Products are sold at a range of price points through multiple wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels. VF’s ten largest customers,
all U.S.-based retailers, accounted for 22% of 2015 total revenues, and sales to VF’s largest customer accounted for 8% of 2015 total revenues. Sales are generally made on an unsecured basis under customary terms that may vary by product,
channel of distribution or geographic region. VF continuously monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and has established internal policies regarding customer credit limits. The breadth of product offerings, combined with the large number and
geographic diversity of its customers, limits VF’s concentration of risks.

Legal and Other Contingencies

Management periodically assesses liabilities and contingencies in connection with legal proceedings and other claims that may arise from
time to time. When it is probable that a loss has been or will be incurred, an estimate of the loss is recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Estimates of losses are adjusted when additional information becomes available or circumstances
change. A contingent liability is disclosed when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss may have been incurred. Management believes that the outcome of any outstanding or pending matters, individually and in the aggregate,
will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2015 presentation, as discussed below in

Recently Adopted
Accounting Standards

.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) changed the definition and disclosure requirements for
discontinued operations. This guidance became effective in the first quarter of 2015, but did not have an impact on VF’s consolidated financial statements.

In April 2015, the FASB issued an update to their accounting guidance related to retirement benefits that provides a practical expedient permitting companies to measure defined benefit plan assets and
obligations using the month-end that is closest to an entity’s fiscal year-end. The Company early adopted this guidance as of December 2015, and measured plan assets and obligations as of December 31, 2015. This change in measurement date
did not have a significant impact on VF’s consolidated financial statements.

In April 2015, the FASB issued an update to
their accounting guidance related to debt issuance costs. The guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability,
consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. The Company early adopted this guidance as of December 2015 on a retrospective basis, as presented in the table below.

In May 2015, the FASB issued an update to their accounting guidance related to fair value measurements. The guidance removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments
for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient, and requires separate disclosure instead.

F-15


VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 2015

The Company early adopted this guidance as of December 2015 on a retrospective basis. The new guidance did not impact disclosures related to VF’s investments, but did impact disclosures
related to the Company’s defined benefit pension plan assets. Refer to Note L for additional information.

In November
2015, the FASB issued an update to their accounting guidance on income taxes that eliminates the current requirement for companies to present deferred income tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet.
Instead, companies are required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The Company early adopted this guidance as of December 2015 on a retrospective basis, as presented in the table below.

The impact of adopting the new accounting guidance on classification of debt issuance costs and deferred income taxes on VF’s 2014
Consolidated Balance Sheet is as follows:

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In May 2014, the FASB issued a new accounting standard on revenue recognition that outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with
customers. The new guidance contains principles that an entity must apply to determine when and how revenue is recognized. New disclosures about revenues and cash flows arising from contracts with customers are also required. In July 2015, the FASB
approved a one-year delay to the adoption date of the standard that makes it effective in the first quarter of 2018 with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact that adopting this guidance will have on VF’s consolidated
financial statements.

In June 2014, the FASB issued an update to their accounting guidance related to stock-based
compensation. The guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting, and that could be achieved after the requisite service period, be treated as a performance condition. This guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2016,
but will not impact VF’s consolidated financial statements.

In February 2015, the FASB issued an update to their
existing consolidation model, that changes the analysis a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. This guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2016, but will not impact
VF’s consolidated financial statements.

In April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance related to a customer’s
accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. This guidance provides clarification on whether a cloud computing arrangement should be treated as a software license or a service contract. This guidance will be effective in the first
quarter of 2016, but will not impact VF’s consolidated financial statements.

F-16


VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 2015

In July 2015, the FASB issued an update to their accounting guidance related to
inventory, that changes the measurement principle from lower of cost or market to lower of cost or net realizable value. This guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2017 with early adoption permitted, but will not impact VF’s
consolidated financial statements.

In September 2015, the FASB issued an update to their accounting guidance related to
business combinations that simplifies the accounting for measurement-period adjustments. The guidance requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in
which the adjustment amounts are determined, thus eliminating the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement-period adjustments. This guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2016, and will impact VF’s
consolidated financial statements if the Company is the acquirer in a business combination that includes measurement-period adjustments.

In January 2016, the FASB issued an update to their accounting guidance related to the recognition and measurement of certain financial instruments. The guidance affects the accounting for equity
investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. This guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2018 with early adoption permitted. The Company is
evaluating the impact that adopting this guidance will have on VF’s consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016,
the FASB issued a new accounting standard on leasing. The new standard will require companies to record most leased assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, and also proposes a dual model for recognizing expense. This guidance will be effective
in the first quarter of 2019 with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact that adopting this guidance will have on VF’s consolidated financial statements.

Note B — Accounts Receivable

VF has an agreement with a financial institution to sell selected trade accounts receivable on a
recurring, nonrecourse basis. Under the agreement in place at December 2015, up to $237.5 million of VF’s accounts receivable could be sold to the financial institution and remain outstanding at any point in time. This agreement was amended in
January 2016 to permit up to $367.5 million of VF’s sold accounts receivable to remain outstanding at any point in time. VF removes the accounts receivable from the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the time of sale. VF does not retain any
interests in the sold accounts receivable but continues to service and collect outstanding accounts receivable on behalf of the financial institution. During 2015 and 2014, VF sold total accounts receivable of $1,340.9 million and $1,247.4 million,
respectively. As of December 2015 and 2014, $144.9 million and $130.3 million, respectively, of the sold accounts receivable had been removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets but remained outstanding with the financial institution. The funding

Note H — Short-term Borrowings

In April 2015, VF entered into a $1.75 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit (the
“Global Credit Facility”) which supports the $1.75 billion U.S. commercial paper program described below. The Global Credit Facility expires in April 2020 and VF may request two extensions of one year each, subject to stated terms and
conditions. The Global Credit Facility replaced VF’s $1.25 billion revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in December 2016. The Global Credit Facility may be used to borrow funds in both U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar
currencies, and has a $50.0 million letter of credit sublimit. Borrowings under the Global Credit Facility are priced at a credit spread of 80.5 basis points over the appropriate LIBOR benchmark for each currency. VF is also required to pay a
facility fee to the lenders, currently equal to 7.0 basis points of the committed amount of the facility. The credit spread and facility fee are subject to adjustment based on VF’s credit ratings.

F-20


VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 2015

The Global Credit Facility contains certain restrictive covenants, which include
maintenance of a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio, as defined therein, equal to or below 60%. If VF fails in the performance of any covenants, the lenders may terminate their obligation to make advances and declare any
outstanding obligations to be immediately due and payable. At the end of 2015, VF was in compliance with all covenants.

VF
has a commercial paper program that allows for borrowings of up to $1.75 billion to the extent that it has borrowing capacity under the Global Credit Facility. As of December 2015 and 2014, outstanding commercial paper borrowings totaled $423.0
million and $0, respectively. The Global Credit Facility also had $17.3 million of outstanding standby letters of credit issued on behalf of VF, leaving $1,309.7 million available for borrowing against this facility as of December 2015.

VF has $110.1 million of international lines of credit with various banks, which are uncommitted and may be terminated at any time by
either VF or the banks. Borrowings under these arrangements had a weighted average interest rate of 6.0% and 5.3% at December 2015 and 2014, respectively, excluding accepted letters of credit which are non-interest bearing to VF. Total outstanding
balances under these arrangements were $26.6 million and $21.8 million at December 2015 and 2014, respectively.

VF CORPORATION

December 2015

Note J — Long-term Debt

Interest payments are due semiannually on all fixed-rate notes.

All notes, along with any amounts outstanding under the Global Credit Facility (Note H), rank equally as senior unsecured obligations of
VF. All notes contain customary covenants and events of default, including limitations on liens and sale-leaseback transactions and a cross-acceleration event of default. The cross-acceleration provision of the 2033 notes is triggered if more than
$50.0 million of other debt is in default and has been accelerated by the lenders. For the other notes, the cross-acceleration trigger is $100.0 million. If VF fails in the performance of any covenant under the indentures that govern the respective
notes, the trustee or lenders may declare the principal due and payable immediately. At the end of 2015, VF was in compliance with all covenants. None of the long-term debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes
in credit ratings. However, if there were a change in control of VF and, as a result of the change in control, the 2017, 2021 and 2037 notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies, then VF would be obligated to repurchase
those notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount plus any accrued interest.

VF may redeem its fixed-rate notes, in whole
or in part, at a price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest to the redemption date, or (ii) the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted to
the redemption date at an adjusted treasury rate, as defined, plus 20 basis points for the 2017 and 2021 notes and 25 basis points for the 2037 notes, plus accrued interest to the redemption date. In addition, the 2021 notes can be redeemed at 100%
of the principal amount plus accrued interest to the redemption date within the three months prior to maturity.

The 2017 and
2037 notes have a principal balance of $250.0 million and $350.0 million, respectively, and are recorded net of unamortized debt issuance costs.

The 2021 notes have a principal balance of $500.0 million and are recorded net of unamortized original issue discount and debt issuance costs. Interest expense on these notes is recorded at an effective
annual interest rate of 4.69%, including amortization of a deferred loss on an interest rate hedging contract (Note T), original issue discount and debt issuance costs.

The 2033 notes have a principal balance of $300.0 million and are recorded net of unamortized original issue discount and debt issuance costs. Interest expense on these notes is recorded at an effective
annual interest rate of 6.19%, including amortization of a deferred gain on an interest rate hedging contract (Note T), original issue discount and debt issuance costs.

Note L — Retirement and Savings Benefit Plans

VF has several retirement and savings benefit plans covering eligible employees. VF retains the right to curtail or
discontinue any of the plans, subject to local regulations.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Defined benefit plans provide pension benefits based on participant compensation and years of service. VF sponsors a noncontributory
qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most full-time U.S. employees employed before 2005 (the “U.S. qualified plan”) and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits in excess of limitations
imposed by income tax regulations (together, the “U.S. plans”). The U.S. qualified plan is fully funded at the end of 2015, and VF’s net underfunded status primarily relates to obligations under the unfunded U.S. nonqualified defined
benefit plan. The U.S. plans comprise 93% of VF’s total defined benefit plan assets and 92% of VF’s total projected benefit obligations at December 2015, and the remainder relates to non-U.S. defined benefit plans.

The components of pension cost for VF’s defined benefit plans were as follows:

Accumulated benefit obligations at any measurement date are the present value of vested
and unvested pension benefits earned, without considering projected future compensation increases. Projected benefit obligations are the present value of vested and unvested pension benefits earned, considering projected future compensation
increases.

At the end of fiscal 2015, the Company changed to the spot rate approach to measure service and interest costs for
our defined benefit plans. Previously, the same single equivalent discount rate determined for measuring the projected benefit obligation was also used to determine service cost and interest cost. Under the new spot rate approach, the full yield
curve is applied separately to cash flows for each projected benefit obligation, service cost, and interest cost for a more precise calculation. The Company has accounted for this as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, has applied it
on a prospective basis.

VF recorded $4.1 million in settlement charges during 2015, related to the recognition of deferred
actuarial losses resulting from lump-sum payments of retirement benefits to participants in VF’s supplemental defined benefit pension plan.

Deferred actuarial gains and losses are changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the value of plan assets resulting from differences between expected amounts for a year using actuarial
assumptions and the actual results for that year. These amounts are deferred as a component of accumulated OCI and amortized to pension expense in future years as follows: amounts in excess of 20% of projected benefit obligations at the beginning of
the year are amortized over five years; amounts between (i) 10% of the greater of projected benefit obligations or plan assets and (ii) 20% of projected benefit obligations are amortized over the expected average remaining years of service
of active participants; and amounts less than the greater of 10% of projected benefit obligations or plan assets are not amortized. Deferred prior service costs related to plan amendments are also recorded in accumulated OCI and amortized to pension
expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining years of service for active employees. The estimated amounts of accumulated OCI to be amortized to pension expense in 2016 are $65.2 million of deferred actuarial losses and $2.6 million of
deferred prior service costs.

Management’s investment objectives are to invest plan assets in a diversified portfolio of
securities to provide long-term growth, minimize the volatility of the value of plan assets relative to plan liabilities, and to ensure plan assets are sufficient to pay the benefit obligations. Investment strategies focus on diversification among
multiple asset classes, a balance of long-term investment return at an acceptable level of risk, and liquidity to meet benefit payments. The primary objective of the investment strategies is to more closely align plan assets with plan liabilities by
utilizing dynamic asset allocation targets dependent upon changes in the plan’s funded ratio, capital market expectations, and risk tolerance.

Plan assets are primarily composed of common collective trust funds that invest in liquid securities diversified across equity, fixed-income, real estate and other asset classes. Fund assets are allocated
among independent investment managers who have full discretion to manage their portion of the fund’s assets, subject to strategy and risk guidelines established with each manager. The overall strategy, the resulting allocations of plan assets,
and the performance of funds and individual investment managers are continually monitored. Derivative financial instruments may be used by investment managers for hedging purposes to gain exposure to alternative asset classes through the futures
markets. There are no investments in VF debt or equity securities and no significant concentrations of security risk.

The
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was based on an evaluation of the weighted average expected returns for the major asset classes in which the plans have invested. Expected returns by asset class were developed through analysis of
historical market returns, current market conditions, inflation expectations, and equity and credit risks. Inputs from various investment advisors on long-term capital market returns and other variables were also considered where appropriate.

Cash equivalents include cash held by individual investment managers of other asset
classes for liquidity purposes (Level 1), and an institutional fund that invests primarily in short-term U.S. government securities measured at their daily net asset value. The fair values of insurance contracts are provided by the insurance
companies and are primarily based on accumulated contributions plus returns guaranteed by the insurers. Commodities consist of derivative commodity futures contracts (Level 1). Equity and fixed income securities generally represent institutional
funds measured at their daily net asset value derived from quoted prices of the underlying investments. Alternative investments are primarily in funds of hedge funds (“FoHFs”), which are comprised of different and independent hedge funds
with various investment strategies. The administrators of the FoHFs utilize unobservable inputs to calculate the net asset value of the FoHFs on a monthly basis.

VF makes contributions to its defined benefit plans sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable laws, plus discretionary amounts as determined by management. VF made discretionary
contributions of $250.0 million and $50.0 million to the U.S. qualified plan during 2015 and 2014, respectively. VF does not currently plan to make any contributions to the U.S. qualified plan during 2016, and intends to make approximately $15.3
million of contributions to its other defined benefit plans during 2016. The estimated future benefit payments for all of VF’s defined benefit plans are approximately $84.4 million in 2016, $89.8 million in 2017, $93.9 million in 2018, $98.3
million in 2019, $103.3 million in 2020 and $569.3 million for the years 2021 through 2025.

Other Retirement and Savings Plans

VF sponsors a nonqualified retirement savings plan for employees whose contributions to a 401(k) plan would be limited by
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan allows participants to defer a portion of their compensation and to receive matching contributions for a portion of the deferred amounts. Participants earn a return on their deferred compensation
based on their selection of a hypothetical portfolio of publicly traded mutual funds, a separately managed fixed-income fund and VF Common Stock. Changes in the fair value of the participants’ hypothetical investments are recorded as an
adjustment to deferred compensation liabilities and compensation expense. Expense under this plan was $2.5 million in 2015, $5.7 million in 2014 and $5.4 million in 2013. Deferred compensation, including accumulated earnings, is distributable in
cash at participant-specified dates upon retirement, death, disability or termination of employment. VF sponsors a similar nonqualified plan that permits nonemployee members of the Board of Directors to defer their Board compensation and invest in
hypothetical shares of VF Common Stock. VF also has remaining obligations under other deferred compensation plans, primarily related to acquired companies. At December 2015, VF’s liability to participants under all deferred compensation plans
was $252.7 million, of which $29.5 million was recorded in accrued liabilities (Note I) and $223.2 million was recorded in other liabilities (Note K).

VF has purchased (i) publicly traded mutual funds, a separately managed fixed-income fund and VF Common Stock in the same amounts as most of the participant-directed hypothetical investments
underlying the deferred compensation liabilities and (ii) variable life insurance contracts that invest in institutional funds that are substantially the same as the participant-directed hypothetical investments. These investment securities and
earnings thereon (other than VF Common Stock) are intended to provide a source of funds to meet the deferred compensation obligations, and serve as an economic hedge of the financial impact of changes in deferred compensation liabilities. They are
held in an irrevocable trust but are subject to claims of creditors in the event of VF’s insolvency. VF also has assets related to deferred compensation plans of acquired companies, which are primarily invested in life insurance contracts. At
December 2015, the fair value of investments held for all deferred compensation plans was $234.3 million, of which $29.0 million was recorded in other current assets and $205.3 million was recorded in other assets (Note G). The VF Common Stock
purchased to match participant-directed hypothetical investments is treated as treasury stock for financial reporting purposes (Note M), which is

the primary reason for the difference in carrying value of the deferred compensation assets and liabilities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these deferred compensation assets (other
than VF Common Stock) are recorded in compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income and substantially offset losses and gains resulting from changes in deferred compensation liabilities to participants.

VF sponsors 401(k) plans as well as other domestic and foreign retirement and savings plans. Expense for these plans totaled $47.0
million in 2015, $31.6 million in 2014 and $22.0 million in 2013.

Note M — Capital and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Common Stock

During 2015, the Company purchased 10.0 million shares of Common Stock in open market transactions for $730.1 million under its share repurchase program authorized by VF’s Board of Directors.
These transactions were treated as treasury stock transactions.

Common Stock outstanding is net of shares held in treasury
which are, in substance, retired. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, VF restored 10.1 million, 12.1 million and 17.0 million treasury shares, respectively, to an unissued status, after which they were no longer recognized as shares held in
treasury. There were no shares held in treasury at the end of 2015, 2014 or 2013. The excess of the cost of treasury shares acquired over the $0.25 per share stated value of Common Stock is deducted from retained earnings.

VF Common Stock is also held by the Company’s deferred compensation plans (Note L) and is treated as treasury shares for financial
reporting purposes. During 2015, the Company purchased 36,100 shares of Common Stock in open market transactions for $2.5 million. Balances related to shares held for deferred compensation plans are as follows:

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income consists of net income and specified components of OCI, which relates to changes in assets and liabilities that are
not included in net income under GAAP but are instead deferred and accumulated within a separate component of stockholders’ equity in the balance sheet. VF’s comprehensive income is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive
Income. The deferred components of OCI are reported, net of related income taxes, in accumulated OCI in stockholders’ equity, as follows:

These accumulated OCI components are included in the computation of net periodic pension cost (see Note L for additional details).

Note N — Stock-based Compensation

Pursuant to the amended and restated 1996 Stock Compensation Plan approved by stockholders, VF is authorized to grant
nonqualified stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock to officers, key employees and nonemployee members of VF’s Board of Directors. Substantially all stock-based compensation awards are classified as equity
awards, which are accounted for in stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On a limited basis, cash-settled stock appreciation rights are granted to employees in certain international jurisdictions. These awards are accounted
for as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and remeasured to fair value each reporting period until the award is settled. Compensation cost for all awards expected to vest is recognized over the shorter of the requisite service period or
the vesting period. Awards that do not vest are forfeited. VF has elected to compute income tax benefits associated with stock option awards under the short-cut method as allowed by the applicable accounting literature.

Total stock-based compensation cost and the associated income tax benefits recognized in
the Consolidated Statements of Income, and stock-based compensation costs included in inventory in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are as follows:

At the end of 2015, there was $46.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to all
stock-based compensation arrangements that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1 year.

At the end of 2015,
there were 42,927,147 shares available for future grants of stock options and stock awards under the 1996 Stock Compensation Plan. Shares for option exercises are issued from VF’s authorized but unissued Common Stock. VF has a practice of
repurchasing shares of Common Stock in the open market to offset, on a long-term basis, dilution caused by awards under equity compensation plans.

Stock Options

Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to
the fair market value of VF Common Stock on the date of grant. Employee stock options vest in equal annual installments over three years, and compensation cost is recognized ratably over the shorter of the requisite service period or the vesting
period. Stock options granted to nonemployee members of VF’s Board of Directors become exercisable one year from the date of grant. All options have ten-year terms. The grant date fair value of each option award is calculated using a lattice
option-pricing valuation model, which incorporates a range of assumptions for inputs as follows:

Expected volatility over the contractual term of an option was based on a combination of the implied
volatility from publicly traded options on VF Common Stock and the historical volatility of VF Common Stock. The expected term represents the period of time over which vested options are expected to be outstanding before exercise. VF used historical
data to estimate option exercise behaviors and to estimate the number of options that would vest. Groups of employees that have historically exhibited similar option exercise behaviors were considered separately in estimating the expected term for
each employee group. Dividend yield represents expected dividends on VF Common Stock for the contractual life of the options. Risk-free interest rates for the periods during the contractual life of the option were the implied yields at the date of
grant from the U.S. Treasury zero coupon yield curve.

Stock option activity for 2015 is summarized as follows:

The total fair value of stock options that vested during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $25.9 million, $22.6
million and $23.4 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $132.8 million, $143.7 million and $127.3 million, respectively.

Restricted Stock Units

VF grants performance-based RSUs that enable
employees to receive shares of VF Common Stock at the end of a three-year period. Each RSU has a potential final payout ranging from zero to two shares of VF Common Stock. The number of shares earned by participants, if any, is based on achievement
of a three-year baseline profitability goal and annually established performance goals set by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Shares are issued to participants in the year following the conclusion of each three-year performance
period.

The actual number of shares earned may also be adjusted upward or downward by 25% of the target award, based on how
VF’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) over the three-year period compares to the TSR for companies included in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The grant date fair value of the TSR-based adjustment was determined using a
Monte Carlo simulation technique that incorporates option-pricing model inputs, and was $3.78, $1.41 and $3.16 per share for the 2015, 2014 and 2013 RSU grants, respectively.

VF also grants nonperformance-based RSUs to certain key employees in international jurisdictions and to nonemployee members of the Board of Directors. Each RSU entitles the holder to one share of VF
Common Stock. The employee RSUs generally vest four years from the date of grant. The RSUs granted to nonemployee members of the Board of Directors vest upon grant and will be settled in shares of VF Common Stock one year from the date of grant.

Dividend equivalents on the RSUs accrue without compounding and are payable in additional shares of VF Common Stock when the
RSUs vest. Dividend equivalents are subject to the same risk of forfeiture as the RSUs.

RSU activity for 2015 is summarized as follows:

The weighted average fair value of performance-based RSUs granted during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $75.33,
$56.86 and $40.64 per share, respectively, which was equal to the fair market value of the underlying VF Common Stock on each grant date. The total fair market value of awards outstanding at the end of 2015 was $102.7 million. Awards earned and
vested for the three-year performance period ended in 2015 and distributable in early 2016 totaled 1,067,426 shares of VF Common Stock having a value of $61.9 million, as approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
Similarly, 1,290,354 shares of VF Common Stock having a value of $88.4 million were earned for the performance period ended in 2014, and 1,457,159 shares of VF Common Stock having a value of $85.8 million were earned for the performance period ended
in 2013.

The weighted average fair value of nonperformance-based RSUs granted during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $71.17, $58.00
and $39.21 per share, respectively, which was equal to the fair market value of the underlying VF Common Stock on each grant date. The total market value of awards outstanding at the end of 2015 was $17.1 million.

Restricted Stock

VF
grants restricted shares of VF Common Stock to certain members of management. The fair value of the restricted shares, equal to the fair market value of VF Common Stock at the grant date, is recognized ratably over the vesting period. Restricted
shares vest over periods of up to five years from the date of grant. Dividends accumulate in the form of additional restricted shares and are subject to the same risk of forfeiture as the restricted stock.

Restricted stock activity for 2015 is summarized below:

December 2015

Foreign rate differences include tax benefits of $28.4 million, $11.2 million and $6.9
million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, from favorable audit outcomes on certain tax matters and from expiration of statutes of limitations.

VF was granted a ruling which lowered the effective income tax rate on taxable earnings for years 2010 through 2014 under Belgium’s excess profit tax regime. This lower rate, when compared with the
country’s statutory rate, resulted in an income tax reduction of $14.9 million ($0.03 per diluted share) in 2014 and $10.4 million ($0.02 per diluted share) in 2013. In February 2015, the European Union Commission (“EU”)
opened a state aid investigation into Belgium’s rulings. On January 11, 2016, the EU announced its decision that these rulings were illegal and ordered that tax benefits granted under these rulings should be collected from the affected
companies, including VF. If this matter is adversely resolved, the Belgian government may be required to assess, and VF may be required to pay, past taxes reflective of the disallowed alleged state aid that VF received in years 2010 through 2014. VF
is currently assessing its legal options and the impact that an adverse outcome would have on the Company’s financial statements in future periods, but does not expect the impact to be material.

In addition, VF has been granted a lower effective income tax rate on taxable earnings in another foreign jurisdiction for the years 2010
through 2019. This lower rate, when compared with the country’s statutory rate, resulted in income tax reductions of $3.2 million ($.01 per diluted share) in 2015, $6.0 million ($0.01 per diluted share) in 2014 and $3.3 million ($0.01 per
diluted share) in 2013.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following:

VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 2015

As of the end of 2015, VF has not provided deferred taxes on $3,657.2 million of
undistributed earnings from international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. VF’s intent is to continue to reinvest these earnings to support the strategic priority for growth in international markets.
If management decides at a later date to repatriate these funds to the U.S., VF would be required to provide taxes on these amounts based on applicable U.S. tax rates, net of foreign taxes already paid. VF has not determined the deferred tax
liability associated with these undistributed earnings, as such determination is not practicable.

VF has potential tax
benefits totaling $106.0 million for foreign operating loss carryforwards, of which $103.3 million have an unlimited carryforward life. In addition, there are $3.0 million of potential tax benefits for federal operating loss carryforwards that
expire between 2017 and 2026, and $30.6 million of potential tax benefits for state operating loss and credit carryforwards that expire between 2016 and 2031.

A valuation allowance has been provided where it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets related to those operating loss carryforwards will not be realized. Valuation allowances totaled $83.0
million for available foreign operating loss carryforwards, $12.4 million for available state operating loss and credit carryforwards, and $5.6 million for other foreign deferred income tax assets. During 2015, VF had a net increase in valuation
allowances of $3.1 million related to state operating loss and credit carryforwards, and an increase of $1.0 million related to foreign operating loss carryforwards and other foreign deferred tax assets, inclusive of foreign currency effects.

tax years 2007 through 2011 were effectively settled during 2015. Additionally, tax years prior to 2007 were effectively settled with the IRS in prior years. During 2014, the IRS completed its
examination of Timberland’s 2010 tax return. The examination of Timberland’s 2011 tax return is still ongoing. The IRS has proposed material adjustments to Timberland’s 2011 tax return that would significantly impact the timing of
cash tax payments and assessment of interest charges. The Company has formally disagreed with the proposed adjustments and, during the third quarter of 2015, VF filed a petition to the U.S. Tax Court to begin the process of resolving this matter. In
addition, VF is currently subject to examination by various state and international tax authorities. Management regularly assesses the potential outcomes of both ongoing and future examinations for the current and prior years, and has concluded that
VF’s provision for income taxes is adequate. The outcome of any one examination is not expected to have a material impact on VF’s consolidated financial statements. Management believes that some of these audits and negotiations will
conclude during the next 12 months. Management also believes that it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits may decrease by $38.4 million within the next 12 months due to settlement of audits and expiration of
statutes of limitations, $33.4 million of which would reduce income tax expense.

Note P — Business Segment Information

VF’s businesses are grouped into product categories, and by brands within those product categories, for internal
financial reporting used by management. These groupings of businesses within VF are referred to as “coalitions” and are the basis for VF’s reportable segments, as described below:

Management at each of the coalitions has direct control over and responsibility for its revenues,
operating income and assets, hereinafter termed “coalition revenues,” “coalition profit” and “coalition assets,” respectively. VF management evaluates operating performance and makes investment and other decisions based
on coalition revenues and coalition profit. Accounting policies used for internal management reporting at the individual coalitions are consistent with those in Note A, except as stated below.

Corporate costs (other than common costs allocated to the coalitions), impairment charges and net interest expense are not controlled by
coalition management and therefore are excluded from the measurement of coalition profit. Common costs such as information systems processing, retirement benefits and insurance are allocated from corporate costs to the coalitions based on
appropriate metrics such as usage or employment. Corporate costs that are not allocated to the coalitions consist of corporate headquarters expenses (including compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff, certain legal and
professional fees, and administrative and general costs) and other expenses which include a portion of defined benefit pension costs, development costs for management information systems, costs of registering, maintaining and enforcing certain of
VF’s trademarks, and miscellaneous consolidated costs. Defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. are centrally managed. The current year service cost component of pension cost is allocated to the coalitions, while the remaining pension cost
components are reported in corporate and other expenses.

Coalition assets, for internal management purposes, are those used directly in or
resulting from the operations of each business unit, such as accounts receivable, inventories and property, plant and equipment. Corporate assets primarily include corporate facilities, investments held in trust for deferred compensation plans and
information systems.

Note Q — Commitments

VF is obligated under noncancelable operating leases related primarily to retail stores, office space, distribution
facilities and equipment. Rent expense, net of sublease income that was not significant in any period, was included in the Consolidated Statements of Income as follows:

Future minimum lease payments are $362.5 million, $306.0 million, $251.3 million, $192.2 million and
$171.1 million for the years 2016 through 2020, respectively, and $331.9 million thereafter. In addition, VF will receive total payments of $2.0 million related to noncancelable subleases through 2016.

VF has entered into licensing agreements that provide VF rights to market products under trademarks owned by other parties. Royalties
under these agreements are recognized in cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Certain of these agreements contain minimum royalty and minimum advertising requirements. Future minimum royalty payments, including any required
advertising payments, are $57.5 million, $89.0 million, $109.4 million, $94.7 million and $49.8 million for the years 2016 through 2020, respectively, and $52.0 million thereafter.

In the ordinary course of business, VF has entered into purchase commitments for raw materials, contract production and finished
products. These agreements, typically ranging from 2 to 6 months in duration, require total payments of $1.7 billion in 2016.

VF has entered into commitments for (i) service and maintenance agreements related to its management information systems,
(ii) capital spending and (iii) advertising. Future payments under these agreements are $100.2 million, $4.3 million, $0.5 million, $0.2 million and $0.2 million for the years 2016 through 2020, respectively, and $0.3 million thereafter.

Note R — Earnings Per Share

Outstanding options to purchase 2.4 million, 1.4 million and 0.9 million shares of Common
Stock were excluded from the calculations of diluted earnings per share in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, because the effect of their inclusion would have been antidilutive to those years. In addition, 0.9 million, 1.1 million and
1.3 million shares of performance-based restricted stock units were excluded from the calculations of diluted earnings per share in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, because these units were not considered to be contingent outstanding shares.

Note S — Fair Value Measurements

Financial assets and financial liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified in a three-level
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation process. A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The
hierarchy is based on the observability and objectivity of the pricing inputs, as follows:

•

Level 1

Recurring Fair Value Measurements

The following table summarizes financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured and recorded in the consolidated financial
statements at fair value on a recurring basis:

(a)

There were no transfers among the levels within the fair value hierarchy during 2015 or 2014.

VF’s cash equivalents include money market funds and short-term time deposits that approximate fair value based on Level 1
measurements. The fair value of derivative financial instruments, which consist of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, is determined based on observable market inputs (Level 2), including spot and forward exchange rates for foreign
currencies, and considers the credit risk of the Company and its counterparties. Investment securities are held in VF’s deferred compensation plans as an economic hedge of the related deferred compensation liabilities (Note L). These
investments are classified as trading securities and primarily include mutual funds (Level 1) that are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and a separately managed fixed-income fund (Level 2) with underlying investments that are valued
based on quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or quoted prices in inactive markets for identical assets. Liabilities related to VF’s deferred compensation plans are recorded at amounts due to participants, based on the fair value

of the participants’ selection of hypothetical investments. Prior to the second quarter of 2015, other marketable securities consisted of common stock investments classified as
available-for-sale, the fair value of which was based on quoted prices in active markets. During the second quarter of 2015, VF sold all of its available-for-sale securities for $5.9 million in cash proceeds and recognized a gain of $1.5 million,
which is included in other income (expense), net, in the 2015 Consolidated Statement of Income.

All other financial assets
and financial liabilities are recorded in the consolidated financial statements at cost, except life insurance contracts which are recorded at cash surrender value. These other financial assets and financial liabilities include cash held as demand
deposits, accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. At December 2015 and 2014, their carrying values approximated their fair values. Additionally, at December 2015 and 2014, the carrying value of VF’s
long-term debt, including the current portion, was $1,415.1 million and $1,417.8 million, respectively, compared with fair values of $1,592.4 million and $1,684.1 million at those respective dates. Fair value for long-term debt is a Level 2 estimate
based on quoted market prices or values of comparable borrowings.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements

Certain non-financial assets, primarily property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, are not required to be measured at
fair value on a recurring basis and are reported at carrying value. However, these assets are required to be assessed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be fully recoverable, and at least
annually for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. In the event an impairment is required, the asset is adjusted to fair value, using market-based assumptions.

There were no material impairment charges related to property, plant and equipment in 2015, 2014 or 2013.

Management performed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of 2015, 2014 and 2013. Additionally, in both the fourth quarter of 2015 and
2014, management determined that a triggering event occurred related to the

long-lived customer relationship assets based on
management’s fourth quarter strategic plan review, and performed impairment testing on these assets.

Impairment charges
related to goodwill and intangible assets were recorded in VF’s 2015 and 2014 Consolidated Statements of Income and are summarized as follows:

No impairment charges of goodwill or intangible assets were required in 2013.

Our impairment testing of goodwill, trademarks and customer relationship assets utilizes significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) to
determine fair value.

F-45


VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 2015

The fair value of reporting units for goodwill impairment testing is determined using a
combination of two valuation methods: an income approach and a market approach. The income approach is based on projected future (debt-free) cash flows that are discounted to present value. The appropriate discount rate is based on the reporting
unit’s weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) that takes market participant assumptions into consideration. For the market approach, management uses both the guideline company and similar transaction methods. The guideline company
method analyzes market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) for a group of comparable public companies. The market multiples used in the valuation are based on the relative
strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit compared to the selected guideline companies. Under the similar transactions method, valuation multiples are calculated utilizing actual transaction prices and revenue/EBITDA data from target companies
deemed similar to the reporting unit.

Management uses the income-based relief-from-royalty method to value trademark
intangible assets. Under this method, revenues expected to be generated by the trademark are multiplied by a selected royalty rate. The royalty rate is selected based on consideration of i) royalty rates included in active license agreements, if
applicable, ii) royalty rates received by market participants in the apparel industry, and iii) the current performance of the reporting unit. The estimated after-tax royalty revenue stream is then discounted to present value using the reporting
unit’s WACC plus a spread that factors in the risk of the intangible asset.

For the valuation of customer relationship
intangible assets, management uses the multi-period excess earnings method which is a specific application of the discounted cash flows method. Under this method, VF calculates the present value of the after-tax cash flows expected to be generated
by the customer relationship asset after deducting contributory asset charges.

Management’s revenue
and profitability forecasts used in the

reporting unit and intangible asset valuations were developed in conjunction with management’s strategic plan review performed each fourth quarter,
and our resulting revised outlook for business performance, and considered recent performance and trends, strategic initiatives and negative industry trends in contemporary apparel and premium denim. Assumptions used in the valuations are similar to
those that would be used by market participants performing independent valuations of these businesses.

Note T — Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

Summary of Derivative Financial Instruments

All of VF’s outstanding derivative financial instruments are forward foreign currency exchange contracts. Although derivatives meet the criteria for hedge accounting at the inception of the hedging
relationship, a limited number of derivative contracts intended to hedge assets and liabilities are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. The notional amounts of outstanding derivative contracts were $2.4 billion at December 2015 and
$1.9 billion at December 2014, consisting primarily of contracts hedging exposures to the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Mexican peso, Japanese yen, Polish zloty and Swedish krona. Derivative contracts have maturities up to 24
months.

VF records and presents the fair values of all of its derivative assets and liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross basis, even though they are subject to master netting agreements. However, if VF were to offset and record the asset and liability balances of its forward foreign currency exchange contracts on a net basis in
accordance with the terms of its master netting agreements, the amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 2015 and December 2014 would be adjusted from the current gross presentation to the net amounts as detailed in the

Cash Flow Hedges

VF uses derivative contracts primarily to hedge a portion of the exchange risk for its forecasted sales, purchases, production costs, operating costs and intercompany royalties. The effects of cash flow
hedging included in VF’s Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income are summarized as follows:

Derivative Contracts Dedesignated as Hedges

Cash flow hedges of some forecasted sales to third parties have historically been dedesignated as hedges when the sales were recognized.
At that time, hedge accounting was discontinued and the amount of unrealized hedging gain or loss was recognized in net sales. These derivatives remained outstanding as an economic hedge of foreign currency exposures associated with the ultimate
collection of the related accounts receivable, during which time changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts were recognized directly in earnings. As discussed below in

Derivative Contracts Not Designated as Hedges

, VF now utilizes
separate derivative contracts to manage foreign currency risk related to the balance sheet exposures. Accordingly, 2013 was the last year during which dedesignations were recognized related to these cash flow hedges. During 2013, VF recorded a net
gain of $1.5 million in other income (expense), net, for derivatives dedesignated as hedging instruments.

Derivative Contracts Not Designated as Hedge

s

VF uses derivative contracts to manage foreign currency exchange risk on third-party accounts receivable and payable, as well as
intercompany borrowings. These contracts are not designated as hedges, and are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair values of these instruments are recognized directly in earnings. Gains or losses on these
contracts largely offset the net transaction gains or losses on the related assets and liabilities. Following is a summary of these derivatives included in VF’s Consolidated Statements of Income:

Other Derivative Information

There were no significant amounts recognized in earnings for the ineffective portion of any hedging relationships during 2015, 2014 and 2013.

At December 2015, accumulated OCI included $88.6 million of pretax net deferred gains for foreign exchange contracts that are expected to
be reclassified to earnings during the next 12 months. The amounts ultimately reclassified to earnings will depend on exchange rates in effect when outstanding derivative contracts are settled.

VF entered into interest rate swap derivative contracts in 2011 and 2003 to hedge the interest rate risk for issuance of long-term debt
due in 2021 and 2033, respectively. In each case, the contracts were terminated concurrent with the issuance of the debt, and the realized gain or loss was deferred in accumulated OCI. The remaining pretax net deferred loss in accumulated OCI was
$27.2 million at December 2015, which will be reclassified into interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining terms of the associated debt instruments. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, VF reclassified $4.3 million, $4.1
million and $3.9 million, respectively, of net deferred loss from accumulated OCI into interest expense, and expects to reclassify $4.5 million to interest expense during the next 12 months.
