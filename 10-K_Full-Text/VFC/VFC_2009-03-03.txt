PART I

Item 1.

Business.

V.F. Corporation, organized in 1899, is a worldwide leader in
    branded lifestyle apparel and related products. Unless the
    context indicates otherwise, the terms “VF,”
    “we,” “us” and “our” used herein
    refer to V.F. Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. Our
    stated vision is: VF will grow by building lifestyle brands that
    excite consumers around the world.

For over 100 years, VF has grown by offering consumers high
    quality, high value branded apparel and related products. Since
    2004, we have been implementing a growth plan that is
    transforming VF’s mix of business to include more lifestyle
    brands. Lifestyle brands are those brands that connect closely
    with consumers because they are aspirational and inspirational;
    they reflect consumers’ specific activities and interests.
    Lifestyle brands generally extend across multiple product
    categories and have higher than average gross margins.
    Accordingly, this transformation has included the acquisitions
    of several growing lifestyle brands, such as

Vans

®

,

Reef

®

,

Kipling

®

,

Napapijri

®

,

7 For All
    Mankind

®

and

lucy

®

.

    At the same time, we have continued to invest in our other
    businesses, including extending

The North
    Face

®

brand to new product categories and new markets, enhancing
    product development and marketing strategy in our

Nautica

®

men’s sportswear business, and expanding

Lee

®

,

Wrangler

®

,

The North
    Face

®

and several other brands into Asian and Eastern European markets.

An important step in VF’s transformation was the sale in
    2007 of our women’s intimate apparel business, which had
    over $800 million in revenues but lower profit and growth
    prospects. This business is separately reported as discontinued
    operations in this Annual Report. The remaining discussion of
    VF’s business, unless otherwise stated, is focused on
    VF’s continuing operations. See additional discussion
    regarding our discontinued operations in Note C to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, included at Item 8 of
    this Annual Report.

VF is a highly diversified apparel company — across
    brands, product categories, channels of distribution and
    geographies. VF owns a broad portfolio of brands in the
    jeanswear, outerwear, packs, footwear, sportswear and
    occupational apparel categories. These products are marketed to
    consumers shopping in specialty stores, upscale and traditional
    department stores, national chains and mass merchants. A growing
    portion of our revenues, currently 16%, are derived from sales
    directly to consumers through VF-operated retail stores and
    internet sites. A global company, VF derives 30% of its revenues
    from outside the United States, primarily in Europe, Asia,
    Canada and Latin America. VF products are also sold in some
    countries through licensees and distributors. To provide many
    types of products across numerous channels of distribution in
    different geographic areas, we balance efficient and flexible
    internally-owned manufacturing with sourcing of finished goods
    from independent contractors. An array of

state-of-the-art

technologies provide us with, among other things, sophisticated
    inventory replenishment capabilities that enable us to get
    consumer-right products, on time, to our customers’ shelves.

VF’s businesses are organized primarily into product
    categories, and by brands within those categories, for both
    management and internal financial reporting purposes. These
    groupings of businesses are called “coalitions” and
    consist of the following: Outdoor and Action Sports, Jeanswear,
    Imagewear, Sportswear and Contemporary Brands. These coalitions
    are treated as reportable segments for financial reporting
    purposes. Coalition management has responsibility to build their
    brands, with certain financial, administrative and systems
    support and disciplines provided by consolidated functions
    within VF.

We consider our Outdoor and Action Sports, Sportswear and
    Contemporary Brands coalitions to be our lifestyle coalitions.
    These are VF’s growth engines, where we expect long-term
    revenue and profit growth at a mid-single digit to low-double
    digit rate. Our Jeanswear and Imagewear coalitions are our
    heritage businesses where our focus is on strong profitability
    and cash flows, with long-term revenue growth expectations at a
    low-single digit rate.

    licensed brands by coalition:

    Statements, which are included at Item 8 of this report.

Outdoor
    and Action Sports Coalition

Our Outdoor and Action Sports Coalition, VF’s fastest
    growing business, is a group of outdoor and activity-based
    businesses that represent a collection of lifestyle brands.
    Product offerings include outerwear, sportswear, footwear,
    equipment, backpacks, daypacks, luggage and accessories.

The North
    Face

®

is our largest Outdoor and Action Sports Coalition brand. Its
    high performance outdoor apparel, equipment and footwear is sold
    across North and South America, Europe and Asia. (In Japan and
    South Korea,

The North
    Face

®

trademarks are owned by a third party.)

The North
    Face

®

apparel lines consist of outerwear, snow sports gear and
    functional sportswear and footwear for men, women and children.
    Its equipment line consists of tents, sleeping bags, backpacks,
    daypacks and accessories. Many of

The North
    Face

®

products are designed for extreme applications, such as high
    altitude mountaineering and ice and rock climbing, although many
    consumers also purchase these products because they represent a
    lifestyle to which they aspire.

The North
    Face

®

products are marketed through specialty outdoor and premium
    sporting goods stores in the United States, Canada, Europe and


Asia and select department stores in the United States. In
    addition, these products are sold through approximately 40
    VF-operated full price retail and outlet stores in the United
    States and Europe and online at www.thenorthface.com, as well as
    over 180

The North
    Face

®

retail stores operated by independent third parties dedicated to
    selling

The North
    Face

®

products in Europe and Asia.

VF manufactures and markets

Vans

®

performance and casual footwear and apparel for skateboard,
    bicycle motocross (“BMX”), surf and snow sports
    participants and enthusiasts. Products are sold on a wholesale
    basis through national chain stores in the United States and
    through skate and surf shops and specialty stores in the
    United States and Europe. The brand’s products are
    also sold through approximately 200 owned full-price

Vans

®

retail and outlet stores in the United States, primarily on the
    West Coast, and in key European markets. These retail stores
    carry a wide variety of

Vans

®

footwear, along with a growing assortment of apparel and
    accessory items, most of which bear the

Vans

®

trademarks. The

Vans

®

brand is marketed through a 50%-owned joint venture in Mexico.
    VF is the 70% owner of the

Vans Warped
    Tour

®

music festival, which presents over 50 alternative rock and
    heavy metal bands in performances in over 40 cities across
    North America each summer.

JanSport

®

backpacks, duffel bags, luggage and accessories are sold through
    department, office supply and national chain stores, as well as
    sports specialty stores and college bookstores in the United
    States.

JanSport

®

daypacks have a leading market share in the United States. A
    technical line of

JanSport

®

backpacks is sold through outdoor and sporting goods stores.

JanSport

®

fleece and T-shirts imprinted with college logos are sold
    through college bookstores and department stores in the United
    States. In Europe,

Eastpak

®

and

JanSport

®

backpacks, and a line of

Eastpak

®

clothing, are sold primarily through department and specialty
    stores, where the

Eastpak

®

brand is the leading backpack brand. The

JanSport

®

and

Eastpak

®

brands are also marketed throughout Asia by licensees and
    distributors. In 2007, VF acquired the maker of

Eagle
    Creek

®

adventure travel gear.

Eagle
    Creek

®

products include luggage, daypacks and accessories sold through
    specialty luggage stores, outdoor stores and department stores
    throughout the United States and Europe.

Derived from the Finnish word for Arctic Circle,

Napapijri

®

is a premium-priced brand of performance skiwear and
    outdoor-inspired casual outerwear, sportswear and accessories
    for men, women and children. The

Napapijri

®

brand enjoys especially strong consumer awareness in Italy,
    where it was created, and is expanding across Europe. Products
    are sold on a wholesale basis primarily to European specialty
    shops, such as sport stores and fashion boutiques, and through
    VF-operated and independently-operated retail stores in several
    countries in Europe. In 2007, VF entered into a majority-owned
    joint venture to market

Napapijri

®

brand products in Japan.

Kipling

®

handbags, shoulder bags, backpacks, luggage and accessories are
    stylish, colorful and fun products that are both practical and
    durable. The brand name comes from the author of

The Jungle
    Book

, Rudyard Kipling, and that provides the connection to
    the

Kipling

®

monkey mascot, which symbolizes fun and adventure. A colorful
    monkey key ring is attached to every bag, with a different
    monkey design for each product collection. Products are sold
    through specialty stores in Europe, Asia and South America, as
    well as through approximately 30 VF-operated and over 170
    independently-operated retail stores. The

Kipling

®

business in North America is managed as part of the Sportswear
    Coalition.

The

Reef

®

brand of surf-inspired products includes sandals, shoes, apparel
    and accessories marketed primarily to surf shops and department
    and specialty chain stores. Since its acquisition in 2005, we
    have significantly expanded the

Reef

®

brand’s presence by adding

Reef

®

men’s swimwear and other apparel in the United States and
    by acquiring rights previously held by independent distributors
    to market

Reef

®

products in other geographic areas, particularly in Europe.

We expect continued long-term growth in our Outdoor and Action
    Sports Coalition as we expand into new product categories, open
    additional retail stores, expand geographically and acquire
    additional outdoor or activity-based lifestyle brands.

Jeanswear
    Coalition

Our Jeanswear Coalition markets jeanswear and related casual
    products in the United States and in many international markets.
    The largest of these brands, the

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

brands, have long-standing traditions as authentic American
    jeans brands as they were established in 1889 and 1947,
    respectively, and have strong market


positions.

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

products are sold in nearly every developed country. Products
    also include shorts, casual pants, knit and woven tops and
    outerwear, which are designed to complement the jeanswear
    products and have helped to extend our brands.

In domestic markets,

Lee

®

products are sold primarily through national chain stores and
    specialty stores.

Wrangler

®

westernwear is marketed through western specialty stores. The

Wrangler
    Hero

®

,

Rustler

®

and

Riders

®

brands are marketed to mass merchant and regional discount
    stores. Despite significant competitive activity, VF’s
    domestic jeanswear revenues have been stable in recent years.
    Including all of its jeanswear brands, we believe that VF has
    the largest unit market share of jeans in the United States and
    is one of the largest marketers of jeans in the world. We also
    market cotton casual pants under the

Lee
    Casuals

®

,

Timber Creek by
    Wrangler

®

and

Wrangler

®

Khakis brands.

We believe our

vendor-managed

inventory and retail floor space management programs with
    several of our major retailer customers give us a competitive
    advantage in our domestic jeanswear business. We receive

point-of-sale

information from these customers on a daily basis, on an
    individual store and style-size-color stockkeeping unit
    (“SKU”) level. We then ship products based on customer
    data to ensure their selling floors are appropriately stocked
    with products that match their shoppers’ needs. Our systems
    capabilities allow us to analyze our retail customer’s
    sales, demographic and geographic data to develop product
    assortment recommendations that maximize the productivity of
    their jeanswear selling space and minimize their investment in
    inventory.

Jeanswear in most international markets is more fashion-oriented
    and has a higher selling price than similar products in the
    United States. The jeans market internationally is also more
    fragmented than in the United States, with competitors ranging
    from global brands to a number of smaller national or regional
    brands.

VF’s largest international jeanswear business is located in
    Western Europe. During 2008, we acquired the remaining portion
    of our former 50%-owned joint venture that markets

Lee

®

branded products in Spain and Portugal; this business is being
    integrated with our existing European jeanswear business.

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

jeanswear products are sold through department stores and
    specialty stores where we employ some of the same retail floor
    space management programs described above. We also market

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

products to mass market and specialty stores in Canada and
    Mexico, as well as to department stores and specialty stores in
    Asia and South America. In many international markets, we are
    expanding our reach through VF-operated retail stores, an
    increasingly important vehicle for presenting our brands’
    image and marketing message directly to consumers. We are
    continuing to expand our jeanswear brands in emerging markets,
    such as China and Russia, and through our majority-owned joint
    venture in India. In foreign markets where VF does not have
    owned operations,

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

jeanswear and related products are marketed through
    distributors, agents or licensees.

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

products are sold in over 500 independently operated single
    brand retail stores, primarily in Eastern Europe and South
    America.

In the United States, we believe our Jeanswear Coalition can
    grow its jeans market share in the mass market and national
    chain channels of distribution through superior consumer insight
    and marketing strategies and continuous product innovation. In
    our international businesses, growth will be driven by
    (i) product innovation, positioning and marketing in Europe
    and Latin America, (ii) expansion of our existing
    businesses in Asia, particularly in China, Russia and India, and
    (iii) the continued rollout of new retail stores.

Imagewear
    Coalition

Our Imagewear Coalition consists of the Image division
    (occupational apparel and uniforms) and the Activewear division
    (owned and licensed high profile sports and lifestyle apparel).
    Each division represents approximately one-half of Coalition
    revenues.

The Image division provides occupational apparel for workers
    around the world. Uniform and career apparel are sold in North
    America and internationally, primarily in Europe, under the

Red
    Kap

®

brand (a premium workwear brand with more than 75 years of
    history), the

Bulwark

®

brand (flame resistant and protective apparel), the

The
    Force

®

brand (apparel for law enforcement and public safety personnel)
    and the

Chef
    Designs

tm

brand (restaurant and food service apparel). Products include
    work pants, slacks, work and dress shirts, overalls, jackets


and smocks. In 2009, the Image division will launch a new
    services apparel line featuring high-end tailored apparel
    marketed under the licensed

Joseph
    Abboud

®

brand. Approximately two-thirds of Image division sales are to
    industrial laundries, resellers and distributors that in turn
    supply customized workwear to employers, primarily on a rental
    basis, for

on-the-job

wear by production, service and white-collar personnel. Since
    industrial laundries maintain minimal inventories of work
    clothes, a supplier’s ability to offer rapid delivery of
    products in a broad range of sizes is an important factor in
    this market. Our commitment to customer service, supported by an
    automated central distribution center with several satellite
    locations, has enabled customer orders to be filled within
    24 hours of receipt and has helped the

Red
    Kap

®

and

Bulwark

®

brands obtain a significant share of the industrial laundry
    rental business.

The Image division also develops and manages uniform programs
    through custom-designed websites for major business customers
    (e.g., FedEx Corporation, Air Canada, Continental Airlines and
    American Airlines) and governmental organizations (e.g.,
    U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Transportation Security
    Administration, National Park Service, Fire Department of New
    York City and New York City Transit Authority). These websites
    give employees of these customers the convenience of shopping
    for their work and career apparel via the internet.

In the Activewear division, we design and market sports apparel
    and fanwear under licenses granted by the major sports leagues,
    individual athletes and related organizations, including Major
    League Baseball, the National Football League, the National
    Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, NASCAR,
    ESPN, Inc. and many major colleges and universities. Under
    license from Major League Baseball,

Majestic

®

brand uniforms are worn exclusively on-field by all 30 major
    league teams.

Majestic

®

brand adult and youth-size authentic, replica jersey and casual
    fanwear are sold through department, sporting goods and athletic
    specialty stores. Adult and youth sports apparel products
    marketed under other licensed labels are distributed through
    department, mass market, sporting goods and athletic specialty
    stores. In addition, the Activewear division is a major supplier
    of licensed

Harley-Davidson

®

apparel marketed to Harley-Davidson dealerships. With the
    exception of the Major League Baseball license, loss of any
    license would not have a material effect on the Imagewear
    Coalition.

The opportunities to grow our Imagewear Coalition revenues
    include (i) the extension of its product and service
    capabilities into new markets, such as hospitality/services,
    (ii) growth of its

Majestic

®

brand through expansion to new domestic and international
    customers, updates to key authentic and replica products and

e-commerce,

(iii) growth of the National Football League business
    through recently acquired rights to additional apparel
    categories, (iv) market share gains in key licensed
    categories and (v) the extension of VF’s floor space
    management and replenishment capabilities to more retail doors,
    placing the product-right assortments on the sales floor in each
    geographic market. Looking forward we intend to drive Image and
    Activewear growth by leveraging the Coalition’s ability to
    manage a complex mix of products where

speed-to-market,

product customization and superior service give us a competitive
    advantage.

Sportswear
    Coalition

The

Nautica

®

brand is the principal lifestyle brand of the Sportswear
    Coalition.

Nautica

®

sportswear is marketed in the department store and specialty
    store channels of distribution in the United States. The
    department store channel has undergone significant consolidation
    in the last few years, resulting in numerous store closings and
    negatively impacting sales of

Nautica

®

brand products. The principal

Nautica

®

product line is men’s sportswear, noted for its classic
    styling. We believe

Nautica

®

is the number two men’s collection sportswear brand in
    national department stores. The

Nautica Jeans
    Company

®

line features fashionable jeanswear and related tops for younger
    male consumers. Other

Nautica

®

product lines include men’s outerwear, underwear and
    swimwear and men’s and women’s sleepwear.

Nautica

®

women’s sportswear, initially launched in the department
    store channel in late 2006, did not meet our expectations and
    was discontinued in that channel of distribution in 2008.
    Women’s sportswear continues to be marketed at
    www.nautica.com and in select

Nautica

®

outlet stores.

The Sportswear Coalition operates approximately 110

Nautica

®

retail outlet stores in better outlet malls across the United
    States. These stores carry

Nautica

®

merchandise for men, women, boys, girls and infants. The product
    styles sold in the outlet stores are different from the

Nautica

®

styles sold to department and specialty store wholesale
    customers. These outlet stores also carry

Nautica

®

merchandise from licensees to complete their product assortment.
    In addition, independent licensees operate over 200

Nautica

®

brand retail stores across the world.


The

Nautica

®

brand is licensed to independent parties in the United States
    for apparel categories not produced by VF (e.g., tailored
    clothing, dress shirts, neckwear, women’s swimwear,
    accessories such as fragrances, watches and eyewear) and for
    nonapparel categories (e.g., bed and bath linens and
    accessories).

Nautica

®

products are licensed for sale in over 60 countries outside the
    United States. Wholesale sales of

Nautica

®

licensed products total approximately $470 million on an
    annual basis.

The

John
    Varvatos

®

brand is a rapidly growing luxury apparel and accessories
    collection for men, including tailored clothing, sportswear,
    footwear and accessories. The

John Varvatos

*

USA

®

line of tailored clothing, sportswear and accessories is
    designed to appeal to a younger consumer at somewhat more
    accessible price points. A

John Varvatos

*

USA

®

line of footwear will be launched in 2009. Products are sold
    through upscale department and specialty stores primarily in the
    United States, as well as through eight showcase

John
    Varvatos

®

retail locations. This business is 80% owned by VF, with the
    balance owned by Mr. John Varvatos.

The Sportswear Coalition also includes the

Kipling

®

business in North America.

Kipling

®

handbags, backpacks, totes, luggage and accessories are sold in
    the United States through specialty stores, department stores,
    VF-operated retail stores and at www.kipling.com. About
    two-thirds of products are the same as those sold in Europe,
    with the remainder designed specifically for the
    U.S. market.

We believe there is revenue and profit growth potential in each
    of our Sportswear brands through the expansion of owned retail
    stores, the expansion in the number of individual retailers
    offering our products and improved product offerings at
    accessible price points.

Contemporary
    Brands Coalition

Contemporary Brands, our newest coalition, is focused on upscale
    lifestyle brands. Formed in August 2007, it is currently
    composed of the

7 For All
    Mankind

®

and

lucy

®

brands. In addition, in May 2008 we acquired one-third of the
    outstanding equity of Mo Industries Holdings, Inc. (“Mo
    Industries”), a Los Angeles-based company that owns the

Splendid

®

and

Ella
    Moss

®

brands of premium knitwear marketed to better department and
    specialty stores. VF expects to acquire the remaining two-thirds
    of the outstanding equity of Mo Industries in the first half of
    2009.

7 For All
    Mankind

®

is a Los Angeles-based brand of contemporary denim jeans and
    related products — knit and woven tops, sweaters,
    jackets and accessories — for women and men. Products
    are noted for their fit and for innovation in design, fabric and
    finish. We believe the

7 For All
    Mankind

®

brand is the leading premium jeans brand in the United States,
    with the premium segment defined as jeans retailing for $150 or
    more. Retail price points for the brand’s core jeans range
    from $155 — $199 for basics, with higher price points
    for more fashion-forward products. With approximately
    three-fourths of its sales in the United States, the brand is
    marketed through department stores, such as Bloomingdale’s,
    Macy’s, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and Saks, and through
    specialty stores. In addition, the brand is sold in VF-operated
    retail locations. We opened 13 retail stores in prime street
    fronts or malls in the United States during 2008, bringing the
    total to 15. Internationally, sales are through department
    stores, such as Harrods, and specialty stores. We are pursuing
    growth opportunities in several areas — additional

direct-to-consumer

expansion through company-operated retail stores and

e-commerce,

additional sportswear product offerings, further geographic
    expansion in the Eastern European and Asian markets, and
    licensing.

Based in Portland, Oregon, the

lucy

®

brand of women’s lifestyle apparel is marketed through
    approximately 60

lucy

®

branded retail stores across the United States and via the
    internet.

lucy

®

is an activewear brand designed for versatility, comfort and fit
    for today’s active woman.

lucy

®

is an authentic activewear brand with functional product that
    women can wear from workout to weekend. The

lucy

®

retail stores are currently being remodeled to emphasize the
    brand’s four core types of activity-based
    apparel — yoga, gym, running and outdoor adventure.
    Approximately 90% of the products in the

lucy

®

retail stores are

lucy

®

branded, with the balance of the offerings being complementary
    lines, including

Splendid

®

knitwear. We expect that substantially all of the products in
    the stores will continue to be

lucy

®

branded.

We expect to grow the

7 For All
    Mankind

®

brand through retail and international expansion and new product
    lines and the

lucy

®

brand through opening stores in new markets. We will pursue
    further opportunities to leverage VF’s supply chain
    capabilities for both brands for future profitability
    improvement.

Direct-To-Consumer

Operations

VF-operated retail stores are an integral part of our strategy
    for growing VF’s brands, particularly our lifestyle brands.
    Our full price retail stores allow us to showcase a brand’s
    full line of current season products, with fixtures


and imagery that support the brand’s positioning. These
    stores provide high visibility for our brands and products and
    enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of
    consumers. The proper presentation of products in our retail
    stores also helps to increase consumer purchases of VF products
    at our wholesale customers. VF-operated retail stores generally
    provide operating margins that are equal to or above VF averages
    and a return on investment above VF averages. In addition, VF
    operates outlet stores in both upscale outlet malls and in more
    traditional value-based locations. These outlet stores serve an
    important role in our overall inventory management by allowing
    VF to effectively sell a significant portion of excess
    discontinued and

out-of-season

products at better prices than are otherwise available from
    outside parties, while maintaining the integrity of our brands.

Our growing global retail operations include 698 stores at the
    end of 2008. Of that total, there are 624 monobrand stores,
    (i.e., with only one brand’s products offered in each
    store), that sell

products. Approximately three-fourths of these stores offer
    products at full price, with the remainder being outlet
    locations offering products at discounted prices. In addition to
    the monobrand retail and outlet stores, we operate 74 VF Outlet
    stores across the United States that sell a broad selection of
    excess quantities of VF-branded products as well as women’s
    intimate apparel and childrenswear products under brands that
    are not VF-owned. Approximately three-fourths of the VF-operated
    retail stores are located in the United States. The remaining
    stores are primarily located in Europe.

Across the globe, internet sales (i.e.,

e-commerce)

comprise a small but growing portion of total retail sales of
    apparel, footwear and accessories.

E-commerce

sales of apparel and footwear have become the second largest
    category of

e-commerce

purchases in the United States (behind travel purchases). At VF,

e-commerce

is a growing portion of our revenues as we currently market the

brands online. Additional

e-commerce

sites will be rolled out for consumers in 2009.

Total retail store and

e-commerce

sales accounted for 16% of VF’s consolidated Total Revenues
    in 2008 and 14% in 2007. We expect our

direct-to-consumer

business to continue to grow at a faster pace than VF’s
    overall growth rate as we continue opening retail stores for our
    lifestyle brands. During 2008, we opened 89 retail stores. For
    2009, capital investments of approximately $30 million are
    planned for leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment for
    approximately 70 new retail locations.

In addition to the

direct-to-consumer

venues operated by VF, our licensees, distributors and other
    independent parties operate over 1,200 retail stores dedicated
    to our brands. These stores are located primarily in Eastern
    Europe and Asia.

Licensing
    Arrangements

As part of our business strategy of expanding market penetration
    of VF-owned brands, we enter into licensing agreements for our
    brands for specific apparel and complementary product categories
    in identified geographic regions if such arrangements with
    independent parties can provide more effective manufacturing,
    distribution and marketing of such products than could be
    achieved internally. These licensing arrangements relate to a
    broad range of VF brands and are for fixed terms of generally
    five years, with conditional renewal options. Each licensee pays
    royalties to VF based on its sales of licensed products, with
    most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement.
    Royalties generally range from 5% to 7% of the licensing
    partners’ net sales of licensed products. Gross Royalty
    Income was $81.0 million in 2008, with the largest
    contribution from the

Nautica

®

brand.

In addition, licensees of our brands are generally required to
    spend a specified amount to advertise VF’s products ranging
    from 1% to 5% of their net licensed product sales. In some
    cases, these advertising amounts are remitted to VF for
    advertising on behalf of the licensees. We provide support to
    these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand
    names by taking an active role in the design, quality control,
    advertising, marketing and distribution of each licensed product.

VF has also entered into license agreements to use third-party
    trademarks. We market apparel under licenses granted by Major
    League Baseball, the National Football League, the National
    Basketball Association, the National Hockey League,
    Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Inc., NASCAR, ESPN, Inc. and
    major colleges, most of which contain minimum annual licensing
    and advertising requirements.

Manufacturing,
    Sourcing and Distribution

Product design, fit, fabric, finish and quality are important in
    all of our businesses. These functions are performed by
    employees located within each of our branded businesses across
    the globe.


VF’s centralized global supply chain organization sources
    product and ultimately bears the responsibility to deliver
    product to our customers. VF is highly skilled in managing the
    complexity associated with the supply chain. VF’s revenues
    are comprised of approximately 500 million units
    representing 500,000 SKUs spread over 30 brands. VF operates 30
    manufacturing facilities and utilizes over 1,600 contractor
    manufacturing facilities. We manage over 30 distribution centers
    and nearly 700 retail stores. Managing this complexity is made
    possible by our use of information systems
    technologies — with

best-of-breed

systems for product development, forecasting, order management,
    warehouse management, etc. attached to our core enterprise
    resource management platform.

Today, 23% of our global Net Sales are of products manufactured
    in VF-owned facilities in Mexico, Europe and Central America and
    77% are of products obtained from contractors, primarily in
    Asia. We believe a combination of VF-owned and contracted
    production from different geographic regions provides
    flexibility and a competitive advantage in our product sourcing.
    We will continue to manage our supply chain from a global
    perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global
    production environment.

Our domestic Jeanswear and Imagewear businesses operate owned
    manufacturing facilities (primarily cutting, sewing and
    finishing) located in Mexico and Central America. Our
    international jeanswear businesses operate manufacturing
    facilities located in Poland and Turkey. A significant
    percentage of our denim bottoms are manufactured in these
    plants. For these owned production plants, we purchase raw
    materials from numerous domestic and international suppliers to
    meet scheduled production needs. Raw materials include fabrics
    made from cotton, synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic
    yarn, as well as thread and trim (product identification,
    buttons, zippers and snaps). In some instances, we contract the
    sewing of VF-owned raw materials into finished product with
    independent contractors in the United States, Mexico and Central
    America. While we obtain fixed price commitments for denim and
    certain supplies for up to one year in advance, specific
    purchase obligations with suppliers are typically limited to the
    succeeding two to six months. Our only long-term contract for
    the purchase of raw materials or finished products is a
    commitment in connection with the sale of VF’s
    childrenswear business in 2004. This agreement requires VF to
    purchase a remaining total of approximately $77.5 million
    of finished product for sale through our VF Outlet stores, with
    a minimum of $15 million per year. No single supplier
    represents more than approximately 3% of our total cost of sales.

For the U.S. market, our current sourcing strategy includes
    a balance of VF-owned production and contracted production in
    the Western Hemisphere and contracted production from Asia.
    Owned production generally has a lower cost than contracted
    production. Product obtained from contractors in the Western
    Hemisphere generally has a higher cost compared with production
    obtained from contractors in the Far East but gives us greater
    flexibility and shorter lead times and allows for lower
    inventory levels. Approximately 33% of units sold in the United
    States and 27% of the dollar value of domestic Net Sales in 2008
    were manufactured in VF-owned facilities, primarily in Mexico
    and Central America, with the balance obtained from contractors,
    primarily in Asia. This combination of VF-owned and contracted
    production, along with different geographic regions and cost
    structures, provides a balanced approach to product sourcing.

To an increasing extent, we are using independent contractors
    who own the raw materials and ship only finished,

ready-for-sale

products to VF. These contractors are engaged through VF
    sourcing hubs in Hong Kong (with several satellite offices
    across Asia) and Miami. These hubs are responsible for product
    procurement, product quality assurance, supplier management,
    transportation and shipping functions in the Eastern and Western
    Hemispheres, respectively. Substantially all products in the
    Outdoor and Action Sports and Sportswear Coalitions, as well as
    a growing portion of product requirements for our Jeanswear and
    Imagewear Coalitions, are obtained through these sourcing hubs.
    For most products in our Contemporary Brands Coalition, we
    currently contract the majority of sewing and finishing of
    VF-owned raw materials through a network of independent domestic
    and international contractors. Some of this volume is being
    shifted to the VF sourcing hubs. VF does not directly or
    indirectly source any products from suppliers in countries that
    are identified by the State Department as state sponsors of
    terrorism and are subject to U.S. economic sanctions and export
    controls.

Management continually monitors political risks and developments
    related to duties, tariffs and quotas. We limit VF’s
    sourcing exposure through, among other measures,
    (i) extensive geographic diversification with a mix of
    VF-operated and contracted production, (ii) shifts of
    production among countries and contractors,
    (iii) allocation of production to merchandise categories
    where the free flow of product is available and
    (iv) sourcing from countries with tariff preference and
    free trade agreements.


Through its contractor monitoring program, VF oversees the
    activities of the many independent businesses and contractors
    that produce VF-branded goods at locations across the globe.
    Each of the over 1,600 independent contractor facilities that
    manufacture VF-branded products must be pre-certified prior to
    performance of any production on behalf of VF, including
    contractors of our independent licensees. This pre-certification
    includes passing a factory inspection and signing a VF Terms of
    Engagement agreement. These requirements provide strict
    standards covering age of workers, hours of work, health and
    safety conditions and conformity with local laws. We maintain an
    ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these
    requirements by using dedicated internal and outsourced staff.
    Additional information about VF’s Global Compliance
    Principles, Terms of Engagement, Factory Audit Procedure and
    Factory Compliance Guidelines, along with a Global Compliance
    Report, are available on the VF website at www.vfc.com.

VF did not experience difficulty in filling its raw material and
    contracting production needs during 2008, and we do not
    anticipate difficulties in meeting our raw materials and
    contracting production requirements during 2009. The loss of any
    one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse
    effect on our business.

Product is shipped from our independent suppliers and
    VF-operated manufacturing plants to many distribution centers in
    the United States and international markets. In limited
    instances, product is shipped directly to our customers. Product
    is inspected, sorted and stored in our distribution centers
    until needed for packing and shipping to our wholesale customers
    or our retail stores. Most distribution centers are operated by
    VF. Some support multiple brands. A small portion of our
    distribution needs are met by contract distribution centers. Our
    distribution centers use computer-controlled inventory
    management technology for efficient tracking and movement of
    products.

Seasonality

With its diversified product offerings, VF’s operating
    results are somewhat seasonal. On a quarterly basis and
    excluding the effect of timing of businesses acquired during
    2008, consolidated Total Revenues for 2008 ranged from a low of
    approximately 22% of full year revenues in the second quarter to
    a high of 29% in the third quarter. This disparity results
    primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our
    Outdoor and Action Sports Coalition, where only 19% of Outdoor
    and Action Sports Coalition revenues occurred in the second
    quarter and 33% in the third quarter of 2008. With changes in
    our mix of business along with growth of our retail operations,
    historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be
    indicative of future trends. We expect the portion of annual
    revenues and profits occurring in the second half of the year to
    increase.

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working
    capital increases during the first half of the year as inventory
    builds to support peak shipping periods and then decreases
    during the second half of the year as those inventories are sold
    and accounts receivable are collected. Cash provided by
    operating activities is substantially higher in the second half
    of the year due to higher net income during that period and
    reduced working capital requirements, particularly during the
    fourth quarter.

Advertising
    and Customer Support

We support VF’s brands through extensive advertising and
    promotional programs that convey a lifestyle image for a
    specific brand or focus on specific product features. We
    advertise in consumer and trade publications, on national and
    local radio and television and on the internet. We also
    participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis
    with major retailers in print media, radio and television. We
    sponsor various sporting, music and other special events and
    sponsor a number of athletes and other personalities. In
    addition, we provide

point-of-sale

fixtures and signage to our wholesale customers to enhance the
    presentation and brand image of our products in their retail
    locations. This includes

shop-in-shops,

which are separate retail sales areas within a department store
    or other retail customer location that are dedicated to a
    specific VF brand.

We also participate in various retail customer incentive
    programs. These incentive programs with retailers include
    discounts, cooperative advertising funds and margin support
    funds. We also offer sales incentive programs directly to
    consumers in the form of rebate and coupon offers. Sales
    incentive offers with retailers and with consumers are
    recognized as sales discounts in arriving at reported Net Sales
    (except that cooperative advertising reimbursements of retailer
    advertising costs are reported as Advertising Expense, and free
    product with purchase offers are reported in Cost of Goods Sold).

During 2008, we spent $399.1 million on advertising and
    promoting our brands, a 10% increase from the 2007 level. We
    employ marketing sciences to optimize both the level and impact
    of advertising and promotional spending and to identify the
    types of spending that provide the greatest return on our
    marketing investments.


Internet websites are maintained for most of our brands. Some of
    them are

business-to-consumer

e-commerce

sites where consumers can order VF products. Other consumer
    websites provide information about our brands and products and,
    in many cases, direct consumers to our wholesale customers where
    they can purchase our products. We also operate several

business-to-business

sites where our retail customers can order VF products.

Our Jeanswear, Outdoor and Action Sports, Sportswear and
    Contemporary Brands Coalitions employ a staff of in-store
    marketing and merchandising coordinators located in major cities
    across the United States. These individuals visit our
    customers’ retail locations to inform the customers’
    sales force about our products and related promotions and to
    ensure that our products, and those of our licensees, are
    properly presented on the merchandise sales floor.

Other
    Matters

Competitive
    Factors

Our business depends on our ability to stimulate consumer demand
    for VF’s brands and products. VF is well-positioned to
    compete in the apparel industry by developing consumer-connected
    and innovative products at competitive prices, producing high
    quality merchandise, providing high levels of service, ensuring
    product availability to the retail sales floor and enhancing
    recognition of its brands. We continually strive to improve on
    each of these areas. Many of VF’s brands have long
    histories and enjoy high recognition within their respective
    consumer segments.

Trademarks

Trademarks, patents and domain names, as well as their related
    logos, designs and graphics, have substantial value in the
    marketing of VF’s products and are important to our
    continued success. We have registered this intellectual property
    in the United States and in other countries where our products
    are manufactured

and/or

sold.
    We vigorously monitor and enforce VF’s intellectual
    property against counterfeiting, infringement and violations of
    other rights where and to the extent legal, feasible and
    appropriate. In addition, we grant licenses to other parties to
    manufacture and sell products utilizing our intellectual
    property in product categories and geographic areas in which VF
    does not operate.

Customers

VF products are primarily sold through our sales force and
    independent sales agents and distributors. VF’s customers
    are specialty stores, department stores, national chains and
    mass merchants in the United States and in international
    markets. Of our Total Revenues, 30% are in international
    markets, primarily in Europe, and 16% are through VF-operated
    retail stores (which includes international stores).

Sales to VF’s ten largest customers, all of which are
    retailers based in the United States, amounted to 26% of Total
    Revenues in 2008, 27% in 2007 and 30% in 2006. These larger
    customers included (in alphabetical order) Kohl’s
    Corporation, Macy’s, Inc., J.C. Penney Company, Inc., Sears
    Holding Corporation, Target Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores,
    Inc. Sales to the five largest customers amounted to
    approximately 21% of Total Revenues in 2008, 22% in 2007 and 24%
    in 2006. Sales to VF’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores,
    Inc., totaled 11% of Total Revenues in 2008, 12% in 2007 and 13%
    in 2006, substantially all of which were in the Jeanswear
    Coalition. Generally sales to our ten largest and five largest
    customer groups have increased in the last two years but are a
    smaller percentage of Total Revenues in 2008 and 2007 due to
    higher growth rates in our lifestyle businesses, which have a
    greater portion of their sales to other customers.

Employees

VF employed approximately 46,600 men and women at the end of
    2008, of which approximately 19,900 were located in the United
    States. Approximately 900 employees in the United States
    are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In
    international markets, a significant percentage of employees are
    covered by trade- sponsored or governmental bargaining
    arrangements. Employee relations are considered to be good.

Backlog

The dollar amount of VF’s order backlog as of any date is
    not meaningful, may not be indicative of actual future shipments
    and, accordingly, is not material for an understanding of the
    business of VF taken as a whole.


Executive
    Officers of VF

The following are the executive officers of VF Corporation as of
    February 14, 2009. The executive officers are generally
    elected annually and serve at the pleasure of the Board of
    Directors. There is no family relationship among any of the VF
    Corporation executive officers.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

The following risk factors should be read carefully in
    connection with evaluating VF’s business and the
    forward-looking statements contained in this

Form 10-K.

Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect
    VF’s business, its operating results and its financial
    condition.

RISKS
    SPECIFIC TO VF CORPORATION

VF’s
    business could be adversely affected by reduced consumer
    spending and consumer confidence.

The global credit crisis that began in 2008 is having a negative
    impact on retail sales of apparel and other consumer products.
    Reduced sales by our wholesale customers may lead to lower
    retail inventory levels, reduced orders from suppliers like VF,
    or order cancelations. Reduced sales by some of our wholesale
    customers, along with the possibility of their reduced access
    to, or inability to access, the credit markets, may result in
    various retailers experiencing significant financial
    difficulties. Financial difficulties of customers could result
    in reduced sales to those customers or could result in store
    closures, bankruptcies or liquidations. Higher credit risk
    relating to receivables from customers experiencing financial
    difficulty may result. If these developments occur, our
    inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on
    VF’s trade accounts receivable could have a material
    adverse effect on VF’s financial condition and results of
    operations.

A growing portion of our revenues are

direct-to-consumer

through VF-operated retail stores and websites. It is possible
    that reduced consumer confidence, along with a reduction in
    availability of consumer credit and increasing unemployment, may
    lead to reduced purchases of VF’s products through
    VF-operated retail stores and websites. This could have a
    material adverse effect on VF’s financial condition and
    results of operations.

A
    substantial portion of VF’s revenues and gross profit is
    derived from a small number of large customers. The loss of any
    of these customers could substantially reduce VF’s
    profits.

A few of VF’s customers account for a significant portion
    of revenues. Sales to VF’s ten largest customers were 26%
    of Total Revenues in fiscal 2008, with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
    accounting for 11% of revenues. Sales are generally on a
    purchase order basis, and we do not have long-term agreements
    with any of our customers. A decision by any of VF’s major
    customers to decrease significantly the number of products
    purchased from VF could substantially reduce revenues and have a
    material adverse effect on VF’s financial condition and
    results of operations. Moreover, in recent years, the retail
    industry has experienced consolidation and other ownership
    changes. In the future, retailers may further consolidate,
    undergo restructurings or reorganizations, realign their
    affiliations or reposition their stores’ target market.
    These developments could result in a reduction in the number of
    stores that carry VF’s products, increased ownership
    concentration within the retail industry, increased credit


exposure or increased retailer leverage over their suppliers.
    These changes could both impact VF’s opportunities in the
    market and increase VF’s reliance on a smaller number of
    large customers.

The
    apparel industry is highly competitive, and VF’s success
    depends on its ability to respond to constantly changing fashion
    trends and consumer demand. Reduced sales or prices resulting
    from competition could have a material adverse effect on
    VF.

VF competes with numerous brands and manufacturers of apparel.
    Some of our competitors may be larger and have more resources
    than VF in certain product categories. In addition, VF competes
    directly with the private label brands of its wholesale
    customers. VF’s ability to compete within the apparel and
    footwear industries depends on its ability to:

•

Anticipate and respond to changing consumer trends in a timely
    manner;

•

Develop attractive, quality products;

•

Maintain favorable brand recognition;

•

Price products appropriately;

•

Provide effective marketing support;

•

Ensure product availability and optimize supply chain
    efficiencies; and

•

Obtain sufficient retail floor space and effectively present its
    products at retail.

The failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly
    changing markets and trends could have a material adverse effect
    on VF’s business, financial condition and results of
    operations. In addition, if we misjudge fashion trends and
    market conditions, we could be faced with significant excess
    inventories for some products that we may have to sell at a loss
    or missed opportunities that may result in lost sales.

VF’s
    business is exposed to foreign currency
    fluctuations.

Approximately 30% of VF’s Total Revenues is derived from
    international markets. VF’s foreign businesses operate in
    functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses in these foreign businesses
    are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
    In addition, VF sources and manufactures most of its products
    overseas. As a result, the cost of these products may be
    affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies.
    Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the
    U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency denominated
    amounts at which VF’s international businesses purchase
    products, incur costs or sell products. Furthermore, much of
    VF’s licensing revenue is derived from sales in foreign
    currencies. Although we hedge some exposures to changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates arising in the ordinary course
    of business, foreign currency fluctuations could have a material
    adverse impact on VF’s financial condition and results of
    operations.

VF’s
    profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on
    margins.

The apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure
    caused by many factors, including intense competition,
    consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to
    reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand.
    These factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to
    retailers and consumers, which could cause VF’s gross
    margin to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions
    with comparable reductions in operating costs. If VF’s
    sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our
    product costs or operating expenses, VF’s profitability
    will decline. This could have a material adverse effect on
    VF’s results of operations, liquidity and financial
    condition.

Fluctuations
    in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could
    increase costs and cause service delays.

Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of fabrics
    or other raw materials used by VF in its manufactured apparel
    could have a material adverse effect on VF’s cost of sales
    or its ability to meet its customers’ demands. The prices
    for such fabrics depend on demand and market prices for the raw
    materials used to produce them, particularly cotton. The price
    and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate
    significantly, depending on many factors, including crop yields
    and weather patterns. In the future, VF may not be able to pass
    all or a portion of such higher raw materials prices on to its
    customers.


VF has
    entered into license agreements to use the trademarks of others.
    Loss of a license could have an adverse effect on VF’s
    operating results.

VF has entered into agreements to market products under licenses
    granted by third parties, including Major League Baseball, the
    National Football League and Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Inc.
    Some of these licenses are for a short term and do not contain
    renewal options. Loss of a license, which in certain cases could
    result in an impairment charge for related intangible assets,
    could have an adverse effect on VF’s operating results.

VF may
    not succeed in implementing its growth strategy.

One of our key strategic objectives is growth. We seek to grow
    through both organic growth and acquisitions, building new
    growing lifestyle brands, expanding our share with winning
    customers, stretching VF’s brands and customers to new
    geographies, fueling the growth by leveraging our supply chain
    and information technology capabilities across VF, expanding our

direct-to-consumer

business and building new growth enablers by identifying and
    developing high potential employees. We may not be able to grow
    our existing businesses or achieve planned cost savings from
    ongoing businesses. We may have difficulty identifying
    acquisition targets, and we may not be able to successfully
    integrate a newly acquired business or achieve expected cost
    savings or synergies from such integration. We may not be able
    to expand our market share with winning customers, expand our
    brands geographically or achieve the expected results from our
    supply chain initiatives. We may also have difficulty recruiting
    or developing qualified managers. Failure to implement our
    growth strategy may have a material adverse effect on VF’s
    business.

VF
    borrows funds on a short-term basis, primarily to support
    seasonal working capital requirements. Long-term debt is part of
    VF’s total capital structure. Because of recent conditions
    in global credit markets, VF may have difficulty accessing the
    capital markets for short or long-term financing.

During the last several months, the global capital and credit
    markets have been experiencing extreme levels of volatility and
    disruption, with government intervention, mergers or
    bankruptcies of several major financial institutions, and a
    general decline in global liquidity. Many corporate issuers have
    been unable to access credit markets.

VF uses short-term commercial paper borrowings primarily to
    support seasonal working capital requirements, with amounts
    generally repaid by the end of each year from strong cash flows
    from operations. VF was able to continue to borrow in the
    commercial paper markets during 2008, and all commercial paper
    borrowings were repaid by the end of the year. In addition, VF
    may access the long-term capital markets to replace maturing
    debt obligations or to fund acquisition or other growth
    opportunities. There is no assurance that the commercial paper
    markets or the long-term capital markets will continue to be a
    reliable source of financing for VF.

VF has
    committed domestic and international bank credit facilities.
    Because of the continued distress in the global capital markets,
    one or more of the participating banks may not be able to honor
    their commitments, which could have an adverse effect on
    VF’s business.

If we were to have difficulty in accessing the short or
    long-term capital markets, VF has $1.3 billion of committed
    domestic and international bank credit facilities that expire in
    October 2012. Continued distress in the financial markets could
    impair the ability of one or more of the banks participating in
    our credit agreements from honoring their commitments. This
    could have an adverse effect on our business if we were not able
    to replace those commitments or to locate other sources of
    liquidity on acceptable terms.

If VF
    encounters problems with its distribution system, VF’s
    ability to deliver its products to the market would be adversely
    affected.

VF relies on its distribution facilities to warehouse and, using
    its own employees or in some cases independent contractors, to
    ship product to its customers. VF’s distribution system
    includes computer-controlled and automated equipment, which
    means its operations are complicated and may be subject to a
    number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the
    proper operation of software and hardware, electronic or power
    interruptions or other system failures. Because substantially
    all of VF’s products are distributed from a relatively
    small number of locations, VF’s operations could also be
    interrupted by earthquakes, floods, fires or other natural
    disasters near its distribution centers. We maintain business
    interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect VF
    from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant
    disruptions in VF’s distribution facilities, such as the
    long-term loss of customers or an erosion of brand image. In
    addition, VF’s distribution capacity is dependent on the
    timely performance of services by third parties, including the
    transportation of product to and from its distribution


facilities. If we encounter problems with our distribution
    system, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage
    inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating
    efficiencies could be materially adversely affected.

VF
    relies significantly on information technology. Any inadequacy,
    interruption, integration failure or security failure of that
    technology could harm VF’s ability to effectively operate
    its business.

Our ability to effectively manage and operate our business
    depends significantly on its information technology systems. The
    failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with
    transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, difficulty in
    integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a
    breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the
    operations of VF’s business. Moreover, VF and its customers
    could suffer harm if customer information were accessed by third
    parties due to a security failure in VF’s systems. It could
    also require significant expenditures to remediate any such
    failure, problem or breach.

VF
    uses foreign suppliers and manufacturing facilities for a
    substantial portion of its raw materials and finished products,
    which poses risks to VF’s business
    operations.

During fiscal 2008, approximately 77% of VF’s products sold
    were produced by and purchased or procured from independent
    manufacturers primarily located in Asia, with substantially all
    of the remainder produced by VF-owned and operated manufacturing
    facilities located in Eastern Europe, Mexico and Central
    America. Although no single supplier and no one country is
    critical to VF’s production needs, any of the following
    could materially and adversely affect our ability to produce or
    deliver VF products and, as a result, have a material adverse
    effect on VF’s business, financial condition and results of
    operations:

•

Political or labor instability in countries where VF’s
    facilities, contractors and suppliers are located;

•

Political or military conflict, which could cause a delay in the
    transportation of raw materials and products to VF and an
    increase in transportation costs;

•

Heightened terrorism security concerns, which could subject
    imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent or more
    lengthy inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or
    impoundment of goods for extended periods or could result in
    decreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods,
    leading to lost sales, increased costs for VF’s
    anticounterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of its
    brands;

•

Disease epidemics and health-related concerns, such as the SARS,
    bird flu, mad cow and

hoof-and-mouth

disease outbreaks in recent years, which could result in closed
    factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and
    scrutiny or embargo of VF’s goods produced in infected
    areas;

•

Imposition of regulations and quotas relating to imports and our
    ability to adjust timely to changes in trade regulations, which,
    among other things, could limit our ability to produce products
    in cost-effective countries that have the labor and expertise
    needed;

•

Imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on
    imports; and

•

Imposition or the repeal of laws that affect intellectual
    property rights.

If
    VF’s suppliers fail to use acceptable ethical business
    practices, VF’s business could suffer.

We require third party suppliers to operate in compliance with
    applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working
    conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance.
    Additionally, we require all suppliers making VF-branded
    apparel, whether directly for VF or for its licensees, to comply
    with VF’s Terms of Engagement and Global Compliance
    Principles. Our staff and third parties retained for such
    purposes periodically visit and audit the operations of
    VF’s owned and operated facilities and those of independent
    contractors manufacturing product for VF to determine
    compliance. However, we do not control independent manufacturers
    or their labor and other business practices. If one of our
    independent contractors violates labor or other laws or
    implements labor or other business practices that are generally
    regarded as unethical in the United States, the shipment of
    finished products to VF could be interrupted, orders could be
    cancelled, relationships could be terminated, and VF’s
    reputation could be damaged. Any of these events could have a
    material adverse effect on VF’s revenues and, consequently,
    its results of operations.

VF’s
    results of operations could be materially harmed if VF is unable
    to accurately forecast demand for its products.

We often schedule internal production and place orders for
    products with independent manufacturers before our
    customers’ orders are firm. Therefore, if we fail to
    accurately forecast customer demand, we may experience


excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to
    our customers. Factors that could affect our ability to
    accurately forecast demand for our products include:

•

An increase or decrease in consumer demand for VF’s
    products or for products of its competitors;

•

Our failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance of new
    products;

•

New product introductions by competitors;

•

Unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other
    factors, which may result in cancelations of orders or a
    reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by
    retailers;

•

Weak economic conditions or consumer confidence in future
    economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary
    items such as VF’s products; and

•

Terrorism or acts of war, or the threat of terrorism or acts of
    war, which could adversely affect consumer confidence and
    spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and
    raw materials.

Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in
    inventory write-downs and the sale of excess inventory at
    discounted prices, which could have an adverse effect on
    VF’s results of operations and financial condition. In
    addition, if we underestimate demand for our products, our
    manufacturing facilities or third party manufacturers may not be
    able to produce products to meet customer requirements, and this
    could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost
    revenues, as well as damage to VF’s reputation and customer
    relationships. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
    successfully manage inventory demand to meet future order and
    reorder requirements.

The
    loss of members of VF’s executive management and other key
    employees could have a material adverse effect on its
    business.

VF depends on the services and management experience of its
    executive officers and business leaders who have substantial
    experience and expertise in VF’s business. VF also depends
    on other key employees involved in the operation of its
    business. Competition for qualified personnel in the apparel
    industry is intense. The unexpected loss of services of one or
    more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect
    on VF.

VF may
    be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual
    property rights.

VF’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are
    important to its success and its competitive position. VF is
    susceptible to others imitating its products and infringing its
    intellectual property rights. With the shift in product mix to
    higher priced brands, VF is more susceptible to infringement of
    its intellectual property rights. Some of VF’s brands, such
    as

The North
    Face

®

,

Vans

®

,

JanSport

®

,

Nautica

®

,

Wrangler

®

and

Lee

®

brands, enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition, and
    the generally higher pricing of such products creates additional
    risk of counterfeiting and infringement.

Infringement or counterfeiting of VF’s products or its
    other intellectual property rights could diminish the value of
    our brands or otherwise adversely affect VF revenues. Actions we
    have taken to establish and protect VF’s intellectual
    property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of its
    products by others or to prevent others from seeking to
    invalidate its trademarks or block sales of VF’s products
    as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property
    rights of others. In addition, unilateral actions in the United
    States or other countries, such as changes to or the repeal of
    laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property
    rights, could have an impact on VF’s ability to enforce
    those rights.

The value of VF’s intellectual property could diminish if
    others assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other
    intellectual property rights of VF, or in trademarks that are
    similar to VF’s trademarks, or trademarks that VF licenses

and/or

markets. We may be unable to successfully resolve these types of
    conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, there may be
    trademark owners who have prior rights to VF’s trademarks
    because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect
    intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws
    of the United States. In other cases, there may be holders who
    have prior rights to similar trademarks. VF is from time to time
    involved in opposition and cancelation proceedings with respect
    to some items of its intellectual property.

VF
    obtains licensing royalties and relies on its licensees to
    maintain the value of its brands.

Only a relatively small portion of VF’s revenues,
    $81.0 million or 1.1%, was derived from licensing royalties
    in 2008. Although VF generally has significant control over its
    licensee products and advertising, we rely on them for, among
    other things, operational and financial controls over their
    businesses. Failure of our licensees to successfully market
    licensed products or our inability to replace existing licensees
    could adversely affect VF’s revenues, both


directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from
    reduced sales of our other products. Risks are also associated
    with a licensee’s ability to:

•

Obtain capital;

•

Manage its labor relations;

•

Maintain relationships with its suppliers;

•

Manage its credit risk effectively; and

•

Maintain relationships with its customers.

In addition, VF relies on its licensees to help preserve the
    value of its brands. Although we make every attempt to protect
    VF’s brands through, among other things, approval rights
    over design, production processes and quality, packaging,
    merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of its
    products, we cannot completely control the use of licensed VF
    brands by our licensees. The misuse of a brand by a licensee
    could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on VF.

VF’s
    balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets
    and goodwill. A decline in the estimated fair value of an
    intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset
    impairment charge, which would be recorded as an operating
    expense in VF’s Consolidated Statement of
    Income.

Under current accounting standards, we estimate the fair value
    of acquired assets, including intangible assets, and assumed
    liabilities arising from a business acquisition. The excess, if
    any, of the cost of the acquired business over the fair value of
    net tangible assets acquired is goodwill. The goodwill is then
    assigned to a business unit or “reporting unit” within
    VF, which depends on whether the acquired business will be
    operated as a separate business unit or integrated into an
    existing VF business unit.

At December 2008, VF had approximately $0.9 billion of
    trademark intangible assets and $1.3 billion of goodwill on
    its balance sheet. These assets are not required to be amortized
    under current accounting rules. In addition, VF had
    approximately $0.4 billion of intangible assets that are
    being amortized under current accounting rules. The combined
    amounts represent 42% of VF’s Total Assets and 75% of
    Common Stockholders’ Equity.

Trademark intangible assets that are not amortized and goodwill
    must be tested for impairment at least annually. The impairment
    test requires us to estimate the fair value of VF’s
    business units and related intangible assets, primarily using
    discounted cash flow methodologies based on forecasted revenues
    and cash flows that will be derived from a business unit or
    trademark. Intangible assets that are being amortized must be
    tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate
    that their carrying value might not be recoverable.

The fair value of a business unit could decline if forecasted
    revenues or cash flows were to be lower in the future due to
    effects of the global recession or other causes. If the carrying
    value of intangible assets or of goodwill were to exceed its
    fair value, the asset would be written down to its fair value,
    with the impairment loss recognized as a noncash charge in the
    Consolidated Statement of Income. We have not had any impairment
    charges in the last three years, other than the 2006 loss on
    disposal of our intimate apparel business (accounted for as
    discontinued operations). However, changes in the future outlook
    of a business unit could result in an impairment loss, which
    could have a material adverse effect on VF’s results of
    operations and financial condition.

VF’s
    defined benefit pension plans were underfunded at the end of
    2008 due primarily to the effects of the global financial and
    credit market crisis that began in 2008. This resulted in a
    charge to Common Stockholders’ Equity in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet and a significant increase in our 2009 pension
    expense. If the pension plan investments were to decline in
    value, or if the level of interest rates were to decline from
    the current level, the pension plans would be further
    underfunded, resulting in an additional charge to Common
    Stockholders’ Equity and higher pension expense in future
    years.

VF’s qualified defined benefit pension plan swung from
    being overfunded at the end of 2007 to significantly underfunded
    at the end of 2008. This underfunded status was due primarily to
    the decline in the value of pension plan assets with the general
    turmoil in the global securities markets in 2008. The
    underfunded status resulted in recognition of
    $414.9 million of liabilities and a $291.0 million
    after-tax charge to Common Stockholders’ Equity at the end
    of 2008. For financial accounting, differences between actual
    investment returns and the actuarially assumed investment return
    are deferred and amortized to future years’ pension cost.
    Our pension cost will increase from $10.8 million in 2008
    to approximately $98 million in 2009 primarily due to
    amortization of these deferred actuarial losses.


The level of interest rates drives the discount rate used to
    value the plans’ projected benefit obligations. In general,
    a decrease in interest rates would result in a greater present
    value of future benefit obligations, while an increase in
    interest rates would result in a smaller present value of future
    benefit obligations.

A further decrease in the value of pension plan assets or a
    decrease in interest rates could result in a further decline in
    the plans’ funded status. In that case, VF would recognize
    additional liabilities and additional charges to Common
    Stockholders’ Equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and
    higher pension expense in future years.

If current market conditions persist, VF would be required to
    make substantial cash funding contributions to the plan,
    beginning in 2010, to return the plan to a fully funded status
    over the next few years.

RISKS
    APPLICABLE TO THE APPAREL INDUSTRY

VF’s
    revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending
    for apparel, which is sensitive to general economic conditions
    and other factors affecting consumer confidence.

The apparel industry has historically been subject to cyclical
    variations and is particularly affected by adverse trends in the
    general economy. The success of VF’s business depends on
    consumer spending. Consumer spending is influenced by a number
    of factors, including actual and perceived economic conditions
    affecting disposable consumer income (such as unemployment and
    wages), business conditions, interest rates, housing costs,
    energy prices, availability of credit and tax rates in the
    international, national, regional and local markets where
    VF’s products are sold. Any significant deterioration in
    general economic conditions, recession or increases in interest
    rates could reduce the level of consumer spending and inhibit
    consumers’ use of credit. A significant decline in the
    securities markets could materially affect consumer confidence,
    the financial condition of VF’s customers and VF’s
    operating costs through higher contributions to its pension
    plan. In addition, natural disasters, war, terrorist activity or
    the threat of war or terrorist activity could adversely affect
    consumer spending and thereby have a material adverse effect on
    VF’s financial condition and results of operations.

VF’s
    ability to sell products in international markets may be
    affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic
    risks.

Our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our
    existing international markets and to capitalize on growth in
    new international markets is subject to risks associated with
    international operations. These include the burdens of complying
    with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, unexpected
    changes in regulatory requirements, new tariffs or other
    barriers to some international markets.

We cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes or other similar
    restrictions will be imposed by the United States, the European
    Union or other countries upon the import or export of our
    products in the future, or what effect any of these actions
    would have on VF’s business, financial condition or results
    of operations. Changes in regulatory, geopolitical policies and
    other factors may adversely affect VF’s business or may
    require us to modify our current business practices.

Properties.

VF owns certain facilities used in manufacturing and
    distribution activities and leases a distribution center under a
    capital lease. Other facilities are leased under operating
    leases that generally contain renewal options. We believe all
    facilities and machinery and equipment are in good condition and
    are suitable for VF’s needs.


Manufacturing, distribution and administrative facilities being
    utilized at the end of 2008 are summarized below by reportable

Approximately 70% of the owned and leased space represents

    facilities. The remainder represents administrative and showroom
    facilities.

In addition to the above, VF owns or leases retail or outlet
    locations totaling 5,900,000 square feet. VF also leases
    500,000 square feet of space that was formerly used in its
    operations but is now subleased to a third party through the end
    of the lease term.

    considering funding required for business acquisitions, our
    common stock price and levels of stock option exercises. Also,
    under the Mid-Term Incentive Plan implemented under VF’s
    1996 Stock Compensation Plan, VF must withhold from the shares
    of Common Stock issuable in settlement of a participant’s
    performance-based restricted stock units the number of shares
    having an aggregate fair market value equal to any minimum
    statutory federal, state and local withholding or other tax that
    VF is required to withhold, unless the participant has made
    other arrangements to pay such amounts. There were no shares
    withheld under the Mid-Term Incentive Plan during the fourth
    quarter of 2008.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

Overview

VF Corporation is a leading global marketer of branded lifestyle
    and other apparel products. Management’s vision is to grow
    VF by building leading lifestyle brands that excite consumers
    around the world. Lifestyle brands, representative of the
    activities that consumers aspire to, will generally extend
    across multiple geographic markets and product categories and
    therefore have greater opportunities for growth.

VF owns a diverse portfolio of brands with strong market
    positions in several consumer product categories. In addition,
    we market occupational apparel to resellers and major corporate
    and government customers. VF has a broad customer base, with
    products distributed through leading specialty stores, upscale
    and traditional department stores, national chains and mass
    merchants, plus VF-operated retail stores and internet websites.

VF is organized around our principal product categories and
    major brands within those categories. These groupings of
    businesses, referred to as “coalitions,” are
    summarized as follows:

Discontinued
    Operations

VF sold its women’s intimate apparel business in April
    2007. The decision to exit this business was representative of
    our strategic plan to shift VF’s portfolio mix to higher
    growth, higher margin lifestyle brands. Because VF has sold this
    business, the operating results, assets, liabilities and cash
    flows of the global intimate apparel business have been
    separately presented as discontinued operations in the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

See Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    further details about the discontinued operations.

Unless
    otherwise stated, the remaining sections of this discussion and
    analysis of results of operations and financial condition relate
    only to continuing operations.

Impact of
    the Current Global Economic Environment

The global economy reflected significant volatility and change
    during 2008 — declines in residential and commercial
    real estate values that spread across the globe, rapid and
    extreme changes in commodity prices and currency markets, sharp
    declines in global securities markets, rising unemployment, and
    a credit and liquidity crisis — leading to the current
    global recession. VF reported record revenues and earnings per
    share in each of its first three quarters and full year of 2008.
    However, our fourth quarter performance was negatively impacted
    by the deteriorating global economic environment and its impact
    on consumer spending. There is every indication that these
    difficult economic conditions will continue through 2009.


In response to these market conditions and the expectation that
    they would continue, we took an aggressive approach to reducing
    costs, resulting in a charge of $41.0 million in the fourth
    quarter of 2008. These cost reduction initiatives are expected
    to result in cost savings of approximately $100 million
    beginning in 2009. See Note K to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Long-term
    Financial Targets

In January 2008, we revised two of our long-term financial
    targets and added a new earnings per share growth target. We
    expect attainment of these targets to drive increases in total
    shareholder return (“TSR”), which is the total of
    stock price appreciation and dividends received by our
    shareholders. While the revenue and earnings growth targets are
    not expected to be achieved in 2009, we have not revised our
    longer-term outlook. These targets are summarized below:

•

Revenue growth of 8% to 10% per year

— At the
    beginning of 2008, we increased our long-term revenue growth
    target from 6% to 8% per year to 8% to 10% per year, with
    approximately 6% to 7% coming from organic growth and 2% to 3%
    from acquisitions. We had exceeded the prior target by achieving
    revenue growth of 16% in 2007 and 10% in 2006. In 2008, our
    revenues increased by 6%. Key drivers of future growth
    consistent with the 8% to 10% target include a continuation of
    the strong momentum we have experienced in our outdoor and
    action sports businesses, growth in our contemporary brands and
    sportswear businesses, acquisitions of key lifestyle brands,
    international expansion and continued growth in our
    direct-to-consumer business. We expect our international
    revenues to expand approximately 13% annually and account for
    33% of our total revenues by 2012, compared with 30% in 2008.
    Revenues in our direct-to-consumer business are also expected to
    grow by approximately 18% annually and represent 22% of revenues
    by 2012, compared with 16% in 2008. We have many programs in
    place to continue to drive organic growth across our brands and
    will continue to aggressively search for opportunities to
    acquire branded lifestyle businesses that meet our strategic and
    financial goals.

•

Operating income of 15% of revenues

— We
    increased our long-term targeted operating margin from 14% to
    15%. Our operating margins had approached the original 14%
    target in 2007 and 2006. However, operating margins declined to
    12.3% in 2008, reflecting the negative impact from cost saving
    actions of 0.8% primarily related to workforce reductions and
    the current difficult global economic conditions, particularly
    in the fourth quarter of the year. We expect future improvement
    in our operating margin as we (i) leverage our costs across
    an expanded revenue base, (ii) grow our international and
    retail businesses, which have higher than VF average operating
    margins, (iii) continue our relentless focus on cost
    reduction and (iv) grow existing lifestyle brands that
    report higher than VF average operating margins.

•

Earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% per year

— We established a new target of 10% to 11% annual
    growth in diluted earnings per share and believe that earnings
    per share can grow at a faster rate than revenues, reflecting
    expansion in our operating margin. We had exceeded this growth
    rate in recent years. With the impact of the cost reduction
    actions and global economic events mentioned above, earnings per
    share were flat in 2008. On a long-term basis, we expect our
    growth rate of earnings per share to be in line with the new
    target.

In addition to the revised and new targets discussed above, we
    maintained the following long-term targets:

•

Return on invested capital of 17%

— We believe
    that a high return on capital is closely correlated with
    enhancing TSR. We calculate return on invested capital as
    follows:

Income from continuing operations before net interest
    expense, after income taxes

Average common stockholders’ equity, plus
    average short and long-term debt

VF earned a 13.5% return on invested capital in 2008 and a 14.8%
    return in 2007. Our returns in these years were impacted by our
    2008 cost reduction initiatives and by acquisitions in 2007.
    Newly acquired businesses generally have a lower than average
    return on invested capital in their earliest years of ownership.

•

Debt to capital of less than 40%

— We have
    established a goal of keeping our debt to less than 40% of our
    total capitalization, with capitalization defined as our common
    stockholders’ equity, plus combined short and long-term
    debt. This ratio was 25.2% at the end of 2008. This low debt to
    capital ratio demonstrates VF’s ability to generate strong
    cash flow considering the level of dividend, share repurchase
    and acquisition spending over the last several years.


•

Dividend payout ratio of 40%

— Our target is to
    return approximately 40% of earnings to our stockholders through
    a consistent dividend policy. The 2008 dividend payout ratio was
    43.0% of Net Income. VF has increased its dividends paid per
    share each year for the past 36 years.

We evaluate our existing businesses to ensure that they meet our
    strategic and financial objectives and may in the future decide
    to exit a business that does not meet those objectives, as
    demonstrated by the sale of the global intimate apparel business
    in 2007.

Strategic
    Objectives

We have developed a growth plan that we believe will enable VF
    to achieve its long-term revenue and earnings targets. Our
    growth strategy consists of six drivers:

1.

Build more global, growing lifestyle brands.

Focus on
    building more growing, global lifestyle brands with an emphasis
    on younger consumers and on female consumers.

2.

Expand our share with winning customers.

Develop brand
    and product strategies that will enable us to gain market share
    with successful, growing retail partners.

3.

Stretch brands to new geographies.

Grow our international
    presence, particularly in expanding economies such as those in
    China, India and Russia.

4.

Expand our direct-to-consumer business.

Increase the
    portion of revenues obtained from VF-operated monobrand retail
    stores and

e-commerce.

5.

Fuel the growth.

Leverage our supply chain and
    information technology capabilities across VF to drive lower
    costs and inventory levels, increase productivity and integrate
    acquisitions efficiently to generate savings that can be
    reinvested in our brands.

6.

Build new growth enablers.

Support our growth plans by
    identifying and developing high potential employees and by
    building a diverse team of talented leaders.

Highlights
    of 2008

There were several notable actions and achievements in 2008:

•

Revenues and earnings per share were both at record levels.

•

Total Revenues increased 6% to $7,642.6 million, driven by
    higher revenues in our outdoor and action sports, international
    and direct-to-consumer businesses and the benefit of a full year
    of ownership of the contemporary brands businesses.

•

With $679.5 million of cash flow from operating activities,
    VF had adequate liquidity to cover all of its current needs, as
    well as fund $217.6 million of investments in capital
    expenditures and acquisitions, $255.2 million of dividends
    paid and $149.7 million of repurchases of our Common Stock.
    We ended the year with $381.8 million of cash and
    equivalents. And with our investment grade credit rating, we
    continue to have access to the capital markets, despite the
    credit crisis in late 2008. At the end of 2008, we had the
    ability to borrow over $1.3 billion under committed bank
    credit agreements.

•

We took aggressive actions to address the uncertainty posed by
    current economic conditions and to protect our future
    profitability. These cost reduction actions should bring about
    annualized savings of approximately $100 million, beginning
    in 2009. The actions resulted in a $41.0 million charge in
    the fourth quarter.

•

In May 2008, VF acquired one-third of the outstanding equity of
    Mo Industries, which owns the

Splendid

®

and

Ella
    Moss

®

brands of premium sportswear marketed to better department and
    specialty stores. VF expects to acquire the remaining two-thirds
    equity in the first half of 2009. Mo Industries had total
    revenues of $95 million for the full year 2008. See
    Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Total Revenues consist of Net Sales of products and Royalty
    Income from licensees. Revenues increased in 2008 due to overall
    unit volume increases and organic growth in our outdoor and
    action sports businesses and the benefit of a full year of
    operations of our contemporary brands businesses acquired in
    2007. The impact of the 53rd week in 2008 was not
    significant to VF’s operating results. Revenues in most of
    our businesses increased in 2007, with the largest growth in our
    outdoor and action sports and jeanswear businesses. Additional
    details on revenues are provided in the section titled
    “Information by Business Segment.”

In translating foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar, the
    weaker U.S. dollar in relation to the functional currencies
    where VF conducts the majority of its business (primarily the
    European euro countries) benefited revenue by $109 million
    in 2008 relative to 2007, and $130 million in 2007 relative
    to 2006. The weighted average translation rate for the euro was
    $1.47 per euro during 2008 compared with $1.36 during 2007. With
    the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in recent months to
    $1.39 per euro at December 2008, reported revenues in 2009 are
    expected to be negatively impacted compared with 2008.

    Total Revenues for components of our Consolidated Statements of
    Income:

Gross margins increased to 43.9% of revenues in 2008, compared
    with 43.5% in 2007 and 43.4% in 2006. Gross margins increased
    0.5% in 2008 from the impact of our lifestyle businesses, which
    have gross margin percentages higher than VF averages,
    representing a higher percentage of Total Revenues. The slight
    increase in the gross margin percentage in 2007 over 2006 was
    also due to our higher margin lifestyle businesses representing
    a higher percentage of Total Revenues.

In 2008, 77% of our total Net Sales related to products sourced
    from contractors, primarily in Asia, and 23% related to products
    manufactured in VF-owned facilities in Mexico, Europe and
    Central and South America. We believe a combination of VF-owned
    and contracted production from different geographic regions
    provides flexibility and a competitive advantage in our product
    sourcing.

Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses as a percent of
    revenues were 31.7% of revenues in 2008 and 30.1% in both 2007
    and 2006. This ratio increased 1.4% in 2008 due to the growth in
    our direct-to-consumer business, which has a higher expense
    ratio. Our direct-to-consumer business represented 16% of total
    VF revenues in 2008 and 14% in 2007. In addition, the specific
    cost reduction actions discussed in the “Highlights of
    2008” section of the “Overview” above increased
    this ratio by 0.6% in 2008. These increases were partially
    offset by lower incentive compensation and other spending
    reductions. While the 2007 ratio was flat compared with 2006,
    the 2007 ratio reflected the net impact of the higher expense
    ratios of our 2007 acquisitions and the cost reduction actions
    taken in 2007, offset by the beneficial impact of revenue growth
    in many of our businesses, resulting in improved leverage of
    operating expenses.


We include costs of cooperative advertising, licensing, retail
    stores and shipping and handling in Marketing, Administrative
    and General Expenses, as stated in our significant accounting
    policies in Note A to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. Some apparel companies classify cooperative
    advertising costs as a reduction of Net Sales and licensing
    costs as a reduction to Royalty Income. Further, some classify
    retail store costs and shipping and handling costs in Cost of
    Goods Sold. Accordingly, our gross margins and operating
    expenses may not be directly comparable with other apparel
    companies.

Interest income decreased $3.2 million in 2008 primarily
    due to lower interest rates. Interest expense (including bank
    fees and amortization of deferred costs and a hedging gain)
    increased $21.9 million in 2008 due to an increase in debt
    balances related to the issuance of $600.0 million of
    senior long-term notes in October 2007 to fund our 2007
    acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by lower
    short-term borrowing rates. Interest expense increased
    $14.9 million in 2007 due to (i) higher borrowings
    needed to fund acquisition activity and (ii) higher
    interest rates on short-term debt. Average interest-bearing debt
    outstanding totaled approximately $1,454 million for 2008,
    $1,080 million for 2007 and $900 million for 2006. The
    weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 6.3% for
    2008, 6.4% for 2007 and 6.1% for 2006.

The effective income tax rate was 28.9% in 2008, compared with
    32.3% in 2007 and 31.2% in 2006. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, we
    recorded tax benefits of $24.6 million, $12.0 million
    and $16.9 million, respectively, for the favorable tax
    outcomes upon audits in several international locations and from
    expirations of statutes of limitations in locations where tax
    contingencies were recorded for open tax years. These benefits
    lowered our annual tax rates by 2.9%, 1.3% and 2.2%,
    respectively, for 2008, 2007 and 2006. During 2008, we also
    recorded tax benefits of $11.5 million due to updated
    assessments of previously accrued amounts. These benefits
    lowered our 2008 annual tax rate by 1.4%. The remainder of the
    decline in the effective income tax rate in 2008 from 2007 was
    attributed to growth in our international businesses in
    jurisdictions having effective tax rates that are substantially
    lower than the United States as well as VF average effective
    rates.

Income from Continuing Operations decreased 2% to
    $602.7 million in 2008 from $613.2 million in 2007,
    while earnings per share increased to $5.42 in 2008 from $5.41
    in 2007. Cost reduction actions taken during 2008 lowered
    earnings per share by $0.41. Cost reduction actions completed in
    2007, partially offset by the gain on exiting the

H.I.S

®

business, reduced 2007 earnings per share by $0.06. In
    translating foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar, the
    weaker U.S. dollar had a $0.15 favorable impact on earnings
    per share in 2008 compared with 2007. Discrete tax items
    accounted for an incremental benefit of $0.16 in 2008 earnings
    per share over 2007. Earnings per share increased slightly in
    2008 on lower Income from Continuing Operations due to the
    reduced number of diluted shares outstanding in 2008.

After considering the effects of discontinued operations, VF
    reported net income of $591.6 million ($5.22 per share) in
    2007 and $533.5 million ($4.72 per share) in 2006. In
    translating foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar, the
    weaker U.S. dollar had a $0.11 per share favorable impact
    in 2007 compared with 2006. Net income for 2007 also benefited
    by $0.09 per share from the acquisitions made in 2007.

Information
    by Business Segment

VF’s businesses are grouped into five product categories,
    and by brands within those product categories, for management
    and internal financial reporting purposes. These groupings of
    businesses are referred to as “coalitions.” Both
    management and VF’s Board of Directors evaluate operating
    performance at the coalition level. These coalitions represent
    VF’s reportable segments.

We have recently realigned our management structure within our
    former Outdoor Coalition to better capture future opportunities
    in the outdoor and action sports industries. As a result, we
    have renamed that coalition the Outdoor and Action Sports
    Coalition.

For business segment reporting purposes, Coalition Revenues and
    Coalition Profit represent net sales, royalty income and
    operating expenses under the direct control of an individual
    coalition, along with amortization of acquisition-related
    intangible assets and its share of centralized corporate
    expenses directly related to the coalition. Corporate expenses
    not apportioned to the coalitions and net interest expense are
    excluded from Coalition Profit. Importantly, this basis of
    performance evaluation is consistent with that used for
    management incentive compensation.

See Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
    summary of our results of operations and other information by
    coalition, along with a reconciliation of Coalition Profit to
    Income from Continuing Operations


Before Income Taxes. To leverage the scale of VF, there are a
    number of functions that are shared across all coalitions.
    Accordingly, coalition results are not necessarily indicative of
    operating results that would have been reported had each
    business coalition been an independent, stand-alone entity
    during the periods presented. Further, VF’s presentation of
    Coalition Profit may not be comparable with similar measures
    used by other companies.

Outdoor
    and Action Sports:

The Outdoor and Action Sports Coalition consists of VF’s
    outdoor and action sports-related businesses including

The
    North
    Face

®

brand apparel, footwear and equipment,

Vans

®

performance and casual footwear and apparel,

JanSport

®

and

Eastpak

®

daypacks and apparel,

Kipling

®

bags and accessories,

Napapijri

®

outdoor-based sportswear,

Reef

®

beach-inspired footwear and apparel and

Eagle
    Creek

®

adventure travel gear.

Outdoor and Action Sports Coalition Revenues increased 15% in
    2008 led by global unit gains from strong consumer demand for
    our

The North
    Face

®

,

Vans

®

,

Kipling

®

,

Napapijri

®

and

Eastpak

®

brands. The growth in these brands, particularly

The North
    Face

®

and

Vans

®

,

    included geographic expansion and the opening of additional
    owned retail locations. Domestic revenues for our outdoor and
    action sports businesses increased 11%, while international
    revenues increased 21%, with the favorable effects of foreign
    currency accounting for $57 million or 6% of this increase.

Revenues increased 28% in 2007, with 25% organic growth and the
    remainder resulting from the Eagle Creek and The North
    Face — China acquisitions in 2007. The organic growth
    was led by global unit volume increases in our

The North
    Face

®

,

Vans

®

,

Kipling

®

and

Napapijri

®

brands. Domestic revenues for our outdoor and action sports
    businesses increased 24% in 2007, while international revenues
    increased 35%, with the favorable effects of foreign currency
    accounting for $73 million or 11% of this increase.

Coalition Profit increased 16% in 2008, with operating margins
    increasing to 16.6% from 16.4% in 2007. The increase was driven
    by higher revenues, resulting in improved leverage of operating
    expenses, and growth in our international and retail operations,
    where operating margins are higher. These improvements were
    partially offset by an $8.3 million charge related to cost
    reduction actions that negatively impacted operating margins by
    0.3%.

Coalition Profit increased 31% in 2007, with operating margins
    increasing to 16.4% in 2007 from 16.0% in 2006. The increase was
    also driven by strong revenue growth and the improved leverage
    of operating expenses and higher revenues in our international
    and retail operations. These improvements were partially offset
    by the negative impact of higher levels of distressed sales and
    additional investments in our retail operations.

Jeanswear:

The Jeanswear Coalition consists of our global jeanswear
    businesses, led by the

Wrangler

®

and

Lee

®

brands. Overall jeanswear revenues were down 5% in 2008 and up
    4% in 2007.

Domestic jeanswear revenues decreased 8% in 2008 and were flat
    in 2007 compared with 2006. The decline in 2008 resulted from a
    very difficult retail environment caused by the deteriorating
    global economy that impacted the


Lee, mass market and western specialty businesses. In 2007, a 3%
    increase in our mass market business over 2006 was offset by
    slight declines in our Lee and specialty businesses.

Jeanswear revenues in international markets, including Europe,
    Canada, Mexico, Latin America and Asia, increased 2% in 2008
    over 2007 and 13% in 2007 over 2006. Foreign currency
    translation positively impacted international jeanswear 2008
    revenues by $50 million, or 5%, and 2007 revenues by
    $57 million, or 6%. Revenues on a constant-currency basis
    were down in 2008, reflecting difficult economic conditions in
    key European countries and the sale of the

H.I.S

®

business in 2007, which accounted for $25 million of
    revenues in that year. These declines were partially offset by
    revenue growth in our Asia businesses. Revenues increased in all
    geographic areas in 2007 over 2006 with the exception of our
    Latin America operations, where revenues were flat.

Jeanswear Coalition operating margins were 13.7% in 2008 and
    16.6% in 2007. Jeanswear operating results included expenses of
    $27.3 million in 2008 and $8.0 million in 2007 related
    to capacity reduction and other cost saving actions, which
    negatively impacted operating margins in those years by 1.0% and
    0.3%, respectively. Operating margins in 2008 were also impacted
    by lower revenues without comparable expense reduction,
    increased promotional activities and higher product costs. The
    2007 operating margin was favorably impacted by 0.2% related to
    the gain on the sale of

H.I.S

®

trademarks and related intellectual property during that year.

Jeanswear Coalition operating margins were 16.6% in 2007 and
    15.5% in 2006. The increase in 2007 operating margins resulted
    from (i) growth in our international jeans businesses,
    where gross margins are higher than our domestic businesses,
    (ii) improved operating efficiencies, (iii) a 0.2%
    increase in 2007 due to the gain on the

H.I.S

®

sale and (iv) capacity and other cost reduction actions
    that negatively impacted margins by 0.3% in 2007 vs. 0.5%
    in 2006.

Imagewear:

The Imagewear Coalition includes VF’s occupational
    (industrial, career and safety) apparel business, as well as our
    licensed sports apparel business. Imagewear Coalition Revenues
    were flat in both our occupational and licensed sports apparel
    businesses in 2008 compared with 2007. Imagewear Coalition
    Revenues increased in 2007 compared with 2006 due to the
    Majestic acquisition.

Occupational apparel revenues declined 3% in 2007 from 2006.
    This reduction included the impact of exiting our
    underperforming commodity fleece and T-shirt business. Excluding
    this business, revenues in our occupational apparel business
    increased slightly in 2007 over 2006.

Revenues in the licensed apparel business increased 59% in 2007
    over 2006 due to the acquisition of Majestic. This acquisition
    added $156 million to revenues in 2007. Excluding the
    impact of the Majestic acquisition, licensed apparel revenues
    increased 6% in 2007 led by growth in the licensed National
    Football League and Major League Baseball businesses.

Imagewear Coalition operating margins declined in 2008 to 13.3%
    from 14.4% in 2007, reflecting difficult market conditions in
    the fourth quarter of 2008 that especially affected consumer
    spending in our licensed sports apparel businesses. In addition,
    the 2008 operating results included a $2.0 million charge
    for cost reduction activities that negatively impacted the
    operating margin by 0.2% and additional investments in
    advertising that accounted for 0.4% of the margin decline.

Operating margins for the Imagewear Coalition declined to 14.4%
    in 2007 from 16.2% in 2006, resulting from competitive factors
    impacting the pricing of new programs within the occupational
    apparel businesses and the impact of the 2007 Majestic
    acquisition, which had lower operating margins than Imagewear
    Coalition averages.

Sportswear:

The Sportswear Coalition consists of our

Nautica

®

lifestyle brand, the

John
    Varvatos

®

luxury collection for men and the

Kipling

®

brand business in North America (whereas the

Kipling

®

brand is managed as part of the Outdoor and Action Sports
    Coalition internationally).

Coalition Revenues were down 7% in 2008 compared with 2007, with
    an 11% decrease in our

Nautica

®

brand revenues partially offset by double-digit revenue gains in
    our

John
    Varvatos

®

and

Kipling

®

brand businesses. The decline in the Nautica business resulted
    from difficult market conditions in the department store
    channel, lower volumes in our retail outlet stores and the exit
    in early 2008 of our women’s wholesale business.

Coalition Revenues were flat in 2007 compared with 2006, with a
    4% decrease in our

Nautica

®

brand revenues offset by double-digit revenue gains in our

John
    Varvatos

®

and

Kipling

®

brand businesses. The overall decline in


Nautica revenues resulted from lower menswear business due to
    challenging conditions in department stores and higher
    promotional activity in our Nautica retail stores in the second
    half of 2007.

Sportswear Coalition operating margins declined to 6.3% in 2008
    from 9.6% in 2007 due to lower

Nautica

®

brand revenues without comparable expense reduction and
    increased markdown activity related to a highly promotional
    retail environment. In addition, the 2008 operating results
    included $5.8 million in charges for cost reduction
    activities, including the exit of the

Nautica

®

women’s wholesale sportswear business that negatively
    impacted the operating margin by 0.9%.

Sportswear Coalition operating margins declined to 9.6% in 2007
    from 13.3% in 2006 due to the impact of revenue decreases in the

Nautica

®

brand without comparable expense reduction and increased
    promotional activity in our owned outlet stores and the
    department store channel in 2007.

Contemporary
    Brands:

This coalition was formed in August 2007 with two newly acquired
    businesses — Seven For All Mankind (

7 For All
    Mankind

®

brand of premium denim jeanswear and related apparel) and lucy
    activewear
    (

lucy

®

brand of women’s activewear). This coalition in 2008 also
    includes the earnings since June 2008 from our one-third equity
    investment in Mo Industries, the owner and marketer of the

Splendid

®

and

Ella
    Moss

®

brands. VF expects to acquire the remaining two-thirds equity
    interest in Mo Industries in the first half of 2009.

The increase in Coalition Revenues in 2008 was due to a full
    year of ownership of the

7 For All
    Mankind

®

and

lucy

®

brands and additional VF-operated retail store openings.

The Contemporary Brands Coalition operating margin decreased
    from 17.5% in 2007 to 13.9% in 2008, reflecting high levels of
    promotion and markdown-related expenses as a result of the
    significant impact of the economic downturn on the more upscale
    department stores. In addition, the 2008 operating results
    included the impact of 1.7% for charges for an unremitted
    value-added tax and duty matter and cost reduction initiatives.

Other:

The Other business segment includes the VF Outlet business,
    which is a group of company-operated retail outlet stores in the
    United States that sell a broad selection of excess quantities
    of VF products and other branded products. Revenues and profits
    of VF products are reported as part of the operating results of
    the applicable coalitions, while revenues and profits of non-VF
    products (primarily women’s intimate apparel,
    childrenswear, hosiery, underwear and accessories, which provide
    a broader selection of merchandise to attract consumer traffic)
    are reported in this business segment. Revenues in 2008 for the
    Other business segment were flat with 2007. The increase in
    revenues in 2007 over 2006 was due to VF Outlets’ sales of
    women’s intimate apparel products obtained from independent
    suppliers following VF’s exit of its intimate apparel
    business in April 2007 (whereas such revenues prior to April
    2007 were reported as part of discontinued operations).

Reconciliation
    of Coalition Profit to Consolidated Income from Continuing
    Operations Before Income Taxes:

There are two types of costs necessary to reconcile total
    Coalition Profit, as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, to
    Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes. These
    costs, discussed below, are Interest and Corporate and Other
    Expenses. See also Note R to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Interest Expense, Net was discussed in the previous
    “Consolidated Statements of Income” section. Interest
    is excluded from Coalition Profit because substantially all of
    our financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are
    not under the control of coalition management.


Corporate and Other Expenses consists of corporate
    headquarters’ and similar costs that are not apportioned to
    the operating coalitions. These expenses are summarized as
    follows:

Information Systems and Shared Services

—
    Included are costs of our management information systems and our
    centralized shared services center, which includes common
    financial, supply chain, human resources and customer management
    services that support our worldwide operations. Operating costs
    of information systems and shared services are charged to the
    coalitions based on utilization of those services, such as
    minutes of computer processing time, number of transactions or
    number of users. Costs to develop new computer applications that
    will be used across VF are not allocated to the coalitions. The
    decrease in information systems and shared services costs in
    2008 resulted primarily from information systems costs incurred
    in 2007 for transition services provided to the acquirer of our
    intimate apparel business that did not recur in 2008. The
    reimbursement of these costs from the acquirer in 2007 is
    separately presented above.

Corporate Headquarters’ Costs

—
    Headquarters’ costs include compensation and benefits of
    corporate management and staff, certain legal and professional
    fees, and administrative and general expenses, which are not
    apportioned to the coalitions. The decrease in corporate
    headquarters’ costs in 2008 from 2007 resulted primarily
    from lower management incentive compensation. The increase in
    these costs from 2006 to 2007 was driven by higher incentive
    compensation and other costs.

Trademark Maintenance and Enforcement

— Legal
    and other costs of registering, maintaining and enforcing the
    majority of VF’s trademarks, plus related costs of
    licensing administration, are controlled by a centralized
    trademark and licensing staff and are not allocated to the
    coalitions.

Other

— This category includes
    (i) adjustments to convert the earnings of certain business
    units using the FIFO inventory valuation method for internal
    reporting to the LIFO method for consolidated financial
    reporting, (ii) miscellaneous costs that result from
    corporate programs or corporate-managed decisions that are not
    allocated to the business units for internal management
    reporting and (iii) other consolidating adjustments.

Analysis
    of Financial Condition

Balance
    Sheets

Accounts Receivable decreased 12% in 2008 due, in part, to a 5%
    decrease in fourth quarter wholesale revenues compared with
    2007. In addition, collections on accounts receivable were
    higher in 2008 because that year included 53 weeks; that
    is, collections in the 53rd week ended January 3, 2009
    sharply exceeded credit sales during that week.

Inventories increased 1% in 2008, reflecting our aggressive
    management of inventory levels during the economic downturn.

Other Current Assets increased at December 2008 over 2007 due
    primarily to an increase in prepaid income taxes at the end of
    2008.

Property, Plant and Equipment remained flat at the end of 2008
    compared with 2007, with additions from 2008 capital spending
    being offset by depreciation and the effects of foreign currency
    translation. Capital spending in 2008 supported the growth of
    our businesses and specifically included an increased level of
    spending to support new retail stores.


Total Intangible Assets and Goodwill decreased in 2008 due to
    the amortization of intangible assets and the impact of a
    stronger U.S. dollar in translating balances of
    international businesses, partially offset by the acquired Lee
    Spain balances.

Other Assets increased in 2008 as a result of our investment in
    Mo Industries and higher deferred income taxes. The increase in
    deferred income taxes primarily related to the underfunded
    status of our defined benefit pension plans as discussed below.
    These increases were partially offset by a decline in the value
    of our assets held for deferred compensation plans.

In October 2007, VF entered into a $1.0 billion domestic
    senior unsecured committed revolving bank credit agreement that
    supports issuance of up to $1.0 billion in commercial
    paper. Also in October 2007, certain international subsidiaries,
    with VF as guarantor, entered into a €250.0 million
    (U.S. dollar equivalent of $347.2 million) senior
    unsecured committed revolving bank credit agreement. There were
    no Short-term Borrowings under these domestic or international
    credit agreements at December 2008. Short-term Borrowings at
    December 2007 included $92.7 million outstanding under the
    international credit agreement. Short-term Borrowings under
    other international borrowing agreements were $53.6 million
    at December 2008 and $38.8 million at December 2007.

Accounts Payable decreased in 2008 compared with 2007 due to the
    timing of inventory purchases and the related vendor payments at
    our fiscal year-end. Accrued Liabilities increased in 2008 due
    to the fourth quarter 2008 charge for cost reduction actions and
    increased income and other tax accruals, partially offset by
    lower incentive compensation liabilities.

Other Liabilities increased due to the underfunded status of our
    defined benefit pension plans at the end of 2008, as discussed
    in the following paragraph. This increase is partially offset by
    lower deferred compensation liabilities and deferred income
    taxes.

The global credit crisis and the related significant declines in
    global securities markets during 2008 resulted in a significant
    decline in the value of our defined benefit pension plan’s
    investment portfolio. As a result, our projected pension benefit
    obligations now exceed the value of our plan’s investment
    assets. In accordance with FASB Statement No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans,

the underfunded status of our
    pension plans was recognized as a $414.9 million liability
    at December 2008 and a $291.0 million after-tax charge in
    Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). Net deferred
    actuarial losses in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
    (Loss) will be amortized to pension expense over the next five
    years. See Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for a discussion of asset, liability and equity balances related
    to defined benefit pension plans.

Liquidity
    and Cash Flows

The financial condition of VF is reflected in the following:

Current ratio

%

For the ratio of debt to total capital, debt is defined as
    short-term and long-term borrowings, and total capital is
    defined as debt plus common stockholders’ equity. Our ratio
    of net debt to total capital, with net debt defined as debt less
    cash and equivalents, was 18.7% at the end of 2008.

VF’s primary source of liquidity is its strong cash flow
    provided by operating activities. Cash flow from operating
    activities of continuing operations, which was
    $679.5 million in 2008, $833.6 million in 2007 and
    $454.1 million in 2006, is primarily dependent on the level
    of Income from Continuing Operations and changes in investments
    in inventories and other working capital components. Income from
    Continuing Operations was $602.7 million,
    $613.2 million and $535.1 million in 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. Income from Continuing Operations in each
    year included noncash stock-based compensation expense of
    $31.6 million, $62.4 million and $46.4 million in
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Also, we did not make a
    discretionary contribution to our qualified defined benefit
    pension plan in 2007 or 2008 because of the plan’s funded
    status at the beginning of each of those years. Operating cash
    flows in 2006 included a discretionary contribution to the
    pension plan of $75.0 million.


The net change in operating asset and liability components was a
    cash usage of $152.3 million in 2008, $4.2 million in
    2007 and $200.6 million in 2006. Cash flow in 2008
    benefited from collections on accounts receivable in the
    53rd week of the year; that is, collections in the
    53rd week ended January 3, 2009 sharply exceeded
    credit sales during that week. Cash flow in 2007 benefited
    because the timing of year-end payments resulted in an unusually
    large accounts payable balance at the end of 2007, which
    resulted in higher accounts payable disbursements in 2008. Cash
    generated from operations was lower in 2006 due to
    (i) higher than normal accounts receivable at the end of
    2006, resulting from very strong international sales near the
    end of the year to customers with longer payment terms,
    (ii) unusually low accounts payable at the end of 2006 due
    to the timing of inventory receipts and (iii) unusually
    high accrued income taxes at the beginning of 2006 due to
    required tax payments for the prior year.

To finance ongoing operations and most unusual circumstances
    that may arise, VF anticipates relying on continued future
    strong cash generation. In addition, VF has significant existing
    liquidity from its available cash balances and debt capacity,
    supported by its strong credit rating. At the end of 2008,
    $988.4 million was available for borrowing under VF’s
    $1.0 billion senior unsecured committed revolving bank
    credit facility, with $11.6 million of standby letters of
    credit issued under the agreement. This credit facility is used
    primarily to support our seasonal commercial paper borrowings.
    Also at the end of 2008, €250.0 million
    (U.S. dollar equivalent of $347.2 million) was
    available for borrowing under VF’s senior unsecured
    committed international revolving bank credit facility.

As discussed in the previous Balance Sheets section, our defined
    benefit pension plans were significantly underfunded at the end
    of 2008. VF is not required and does not intend to make a
    funding contribution to the plan during 2009. VF has adequate
    liquidity to meet future funding requirements. We will continue
    to evaluate the funded status of our retirement plans and to
    evaluate future funding levels.

We paid cash of $93.4 million, $1,060.6 million and
    $39.3 million for acquisitions in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, net of cash balances in the acquired companies.
    These acquisitions were funded with existing VF cash balances,
    short-term commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings. In
    addition, we received $348.7 million in proceeds from the
    sale of our intimate apparel business in 2007.

Capital expenditures were $124.2 million in 2008, compared
    with $113.9 million and $127.2 million in 2007 and
    2006, respectively. Capital expenditures in each of these years
    primarily related to retail, distribution and information
    systems, as well as maintenance spending across our global
    manufacturing network. We expect that capital spending could
    reach $110 million in 2009. Capital spending will be funded
    by cash flow from operations.

During 2007, VF received $592.8 million in proceeds from
    the issuance of $600.0 million principal amount of
    5.95% senior notes due in 2017 and 6.45% senior notes
    due in 2037. VF paid $78.1 million under the international
    bank credit agreement in 2007 and paid $33.0 million notes
    in each of 2007 and 2006 related to the Nautica acquisition. See
    Notes J and L to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In October 2007, Standard & Poor’s Ratings
    Services affirmed its ‘A minus’ corporate credit
    rating, ‘A-2’ commercial paper rating and
    ‘stable’ outlook for VF. Standard &
    Poor’s also assigned its ‘A minus’ senior
    unsecured debt rating to VF’s $600.0 million unsecured
    senior notes issued in October 2007. In August 2007,
    Moody’s Investors Service affirmed VF’s long-term debt
    rating of ‘A3’, commercial paper rating of
    ’Prime-2’ and ‘stable’ outlook. Existing
    long-term debt agreements do not contain acceleration of
    maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings.
    However, for the $600.0 million of senior notes issued in
    2007, if there were a change in control of VF and, as a result
    of the change in control

,

the notes were rated below
    investment grade by recognized rating agencies, then VF would be
    obligated to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate
    principal amount of notes repurchased, plus any accrued and
    unpaid interest.

During 2008, VF purchased 2.0 million shares of its Common
    Stock in open market transactions at a cost of
    $149.7 million (average price of $74.86). During 2007, VF
    purchased 4.1 million shares of its Common Stock at a cost
    of $350.0 million (average price of $85.03), using the
    proceeds from the sale of our intimate apparel business. In
    addition, VF purchased 2.0 million shares of its Common
    Stock in 2006 at a cost of $118.6 million (average price of
    $59.29 per share). The primary objective of our share repurchase
    program is to offset, on a long-term basis, dilution caused by
    awards under equity compensation plans. Under its current
    authorization from the Board of Directors, VF may purchase an
    additional 3.2 million shares. We do not currently intend
    to repurchase any shares in 2009. We will continue to evaluate
    future share repurchases considering funding required for
    business acquisitions, our common stock price and levels of
    stock option exercises.


Cash dividends totaled $2.33 per common share in 2008, compared
    with $2.23 in 2007 and $1.94 in 2006. Our dividend payout rate
    was 43.0% in 2008, compared with payout rates of 42.7% in 2007
    and 41.1% in 2006. Going forward, we expect to pay dividends of
    approximately 40% of our diluted earnings per share. The current
    indicated annual dividend rate for 2009 is $2.36 per share.

Following is a summary of VF’s contractual obligations and
    commercial commitments at the end of 2008 that will require the

We have other financial commitments at the end of 2008 that are
    not included in the above table but may require the use of funds
    under certain circumstances:

•

Funding contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension
    plan are not included in the table because of uncertainty over
    whether or when further contributions will be required.

•

VF owned one-third of the equity of Mo Industries at the end of
    2008 and had an option to acquire the remaining equity. VF
    expects to acquire the remaining two-thirds of the outstanding
    equity of Mo Industries for approximately $200 million,
    including the repayment of debt, in the first half of 2009.


•

VF has entered into $80.3 million of surety bonds, standby
    letters of credit and international bank guarantees representing
    contingent guarantees of performance under self-insurance and
    other programs. These commitments would only be drawn upon if VF
    were to fail to meet its claims obligations.

•

Purchase orders for goods or services in the ordinary course of
    business that represent authorizations to purchase rather than
    binding commitments are not included in the table.

During 2008 VF met its obligations when due from (i) cash
    flows from operations, (ii) issuance of commercial paper
    and (iii) on a limited basis, short-term borrowings under
    international bank facilities. Credit market conditions and the
    general contraction of liquidity in the United States and global
    capital markets during 2008, particularly during the last half
    of the year, had a significant impact on the ability of many
    companies to access the commercial paper and other capital
    markets. VF was able to issue commercial paper for seasonal
    working capital needs during this period, although for generally
    shorter maturities and at higher spreads over U.S. Treasury
    interest rates than in prior years. If the commercial paper
    markets were not available, VF has $1.3 billion of
    liquidity available under its domestic and international
    committed revolving bank credit agreements. These agreements
    expire in 2012. Management believes that VF’s cash balances
    and funds provided by operating activities, as well as unused
    committed bank credit lines, additional borrowing capacity and
    access to equity markets, taken as a whole, provide
    (i) adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and
    long-term obligations when due, (ii) adequate liquidity to
    fund capital expenditures and to maintain our dividend payout
    policy and (iii) flexibility to meet investment
    opportunities that may arise.

We do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated
    entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate
    off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes.

Risk
    Management

VF is exposed to a variety of market risks in the ordinary
    course of business, and we regularly assess these potential
    risks. We manage our exposures to these risks through our
    operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, by
    taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures within VF or
    by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative
    financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are
    contracts whose value is based on, or “derived” from,
    changes in the value of an underlying currency exchange rate,
    interest rate or other financial asset or index. We do not use
    derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
    purposes.

VF had $381.8 million of cash and equivalents at the end of
    2008. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature
    within three months of their purchase. These investments consist
    of deposits in highly rated U.S. and foreign commercial
    banks and investments in institutional money market funds that
    invest only in obligations issued or guaranteed by the
    U.S. government. Considering recent credit market
    conditions and the weakened financial condition of many banks
    and other financial institutions, we continually monitor
    VF’s cash equivalents and the credit ratings of VF’s
    financial institutions. Similarly, we monitor the credit quality
    of investments in our defined benefit pension plan to ensure
    that the plan’s exposure to investments affected, or likely
    to be affected, by the credit market crisis is not significant.

We limit the risk of interest rate fluctuations on net income
    and cash flows by managing our mix of fixed and variable
    interest rate debt. In addition, we may also use derivative
    financial instruments to minimize our interest rate risk. Since
    all of our long-term debt has fixed interest rates, our primary
    interest rate exposure relates to changes in interest rates on
    variable rate short-term borrowings, which averaged
    approximately $308 million during 2008. However, any change
    in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on
    VF’s cash equivalents. Based on average amounts of
    borrowings having variable interest rates and cash equivalents
    during 2008, the effect of a hypothetical 1.0% change in
    interest rates on reported net income would not be significant.

VF is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign
    currency fluctuations. Approximately 30% of our revenues in 2008
    were generated in international markets. Substantially all of
    our foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other
    than the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities in these
    foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign
    currency exchange rates. During 2007, we entered into an
    international bank credit agreement that provides for
    euro-denominated borrowings. Although there were no borrowings
    under this agreement at the end of 2008, borrowings under the
    agreement could be used to reduce the exposure to currency rate
    changes for our euro-denominated net assets. Net advances to and
    investments in our foreign businesses, primarily in Europe,
    Latin American and Asia, are considered to be long-term, and
    accordingly, foreign currency translation effects on those net
    assets are deferred as a component of Accumulated Other
    Comprehensive Income


(Loss) in Common Stockholders’ Equity. We do not hedge
    these net investments and do not hedge the translation of
    foreign currency operating results into the U.S. dollar.

We monitor net foreign currency market exposures and may in the
    ordinary course of business enter into foreign currency forward
    exchange contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate
    fluctuations for specific foreign currency transactions or a
    portion of our anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Use of
    these financial instruments allows us to reduce the overall
    exposure to exchange rate movements on VF’s cash flows,
    since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and
    gains on the transactions or cash flows being hedged. Our
    practice is to hedge a portion of our net foreign currency cash
    flows anticipated during the following 12 months (relating
    to cross-border inventory purchases, production costs, product
    sales and intercompany royalty payments) by buying or selling
    primarily U.S. dollar contracts against various currencies.
    Although VF is exposed to risk of loss in the event of
    nonperformance by the counterparties to these foreign exchange
    contracts, we believe these counterparties are creditworthy
    financial institutions. We continually monitor our hedging
    positions with each counterparty and the credit ratings of the
    counterparties. We will adjust our positions if necessary.

If there were a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency
    exchange rates of 10% compared with rates at the end of 2008,
    the expected effect on the change in fair value of the hedging
    contracts outstanding would result in an unrealized loss of
    approximately $45 million. Based on changes in the timing
    and amount of foreign currency exchange rate movements, the
    actual unrealized loss could differ. However, any such change in
    the fair value of the hedging contracts would also result in an
    offsetting change in the value of the underlying transactions or
    anticipated cash flows being hedged.

VF is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton and
    other fibers, which indirectly impacts fabric prices. We manage
    our fabric prices by obtaining fixed price commitments for denim
    and other fabrics in some cases for up to one year in advance.
    VF has not historically managed, nor do we currently intend to
    manage, commodity price exposures by using derivative
    instruments.

VF has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which
    liabilities accrued for the plans’ participants are based
    on market values of investment funds that are selected by the
    participants. The risk of changes in the market values of the
    participants’ investment selections is hedged by VF’s
    investment in a portfolio of securities that substantially
    mirrors the investment selections underlying the deferred
    compensation liabilities. Increases and decreases in deferred
    compensation liabilities are substantially offset by
    corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of
    VF’s investments, resulting in a negligible net exposure to
    our operating results and financial position.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are
    appropriate to accurately and fairly report VF’s operating
    results and financial position in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States. We apply
    these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our
    significant accounting policies are summarized in Note A to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The application of these accounting policies requires that we
    make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply
    judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, revenues, expenses, contingent assets and
    liabilities, and related disclosures. These estimates,
    assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience,
    current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under
    the circumstances. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions
    on an ongoing basis and may retain outside specialists to assist
    in our evaluation in areas such as determining the fair value of
    acquired assets and assumed liabilities in a business
    acquisition, impairment testing for goodwill and intangible
    assets, equity compensation, pension benefits and self-insured
    liabilities. Because our business cycle is relatively short
    (i.e., from the date that we place an order to manufacture or
    purchase inventory until that inventory is sold and the trade
    receivable is collected), actual results related to most of
    these estimates are known within a few months after any balance
    sheet date. If actual results ultimately differ from previous
    estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations
    in the period in which the actual amounts become known.

We believe the following accounting policies involve the most
    significant estimates, assumptions and management judgments used
    in preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements or are
    the most sensitive to change from outside factors. We have
    discussed the application of these critical accounting policies
    and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.


Inventories

Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value.
    Cost includes all material, labor and overhead costs incurred to
    manufacture or purchase the finished goods. Overhead allocated
    to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of our
    plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or
    abnormal production inefficiencies. Market value is based on a
    detailed review in each business unit, at least quarterly, of
    all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual
    style-size-color stockkeeping units (“SKUs”) to
    identify slow moving or excess products, discontinued and
    to-be-discontinued products, and off-quality merchandise. This
    review matches inventory on hand, plus current production and
    purchase commitments, with current and expected future sales
    orders. For those units in inventory that are identified as
    slow-moving or excess quantities, we estimate their market value
    based on historical experience and current realization trends.
    This evaluation, performed using a systematic and consistent
    methodology, requires forecasts of future demand, market
    conditions and selling prices. If the forecasted market value,
    on an individual style or SKU basis, is less than cost, we
    provide an allowance to reflect the lower value of that
    inventory. This methodology recognizes inventory exposures, on
    an individual style or SKU basis, at the time such losses are
    evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold.
    Historically, these estimates of future demand and selling
    prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to
    our timely identification and rapid disposal of these reduced
    value inventories.

Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis. We
    provide for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred
    since the last physical inventory date. Historically, our
    physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant.

Long-lived
    Assets

We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the
    underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired, and
    liabilities assumed, based on their respective fair values, with
    any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. The process of
    assigning fair values, particularly to acquired intangible
    assets, is highly subjective, as the fair value assessments are
    based on forecasts of future cash flows. We use the same
    assumptions of future cash flows for assigning fair values to
    these assets that we used for evaluation of the business
    acquisition.

Our depreciation policies for property, plant and equipment and
    our amortization policies for definite-lived intangible assets
    reflect judgments on the estimated economic lives of these
    assets. In evaluating the useful lives and expected benefits to
    be received for customer-related intangible assets, we review
    historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers.
    For license-related intangible assets, we review historical
    trends and anticipated license renewal periods and attrition
    rates. We review these assets for possible impairment whenever
    events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
    asset or asset group may not be fully recoverable. In those
    circumstances, we measure recoverability of the carrying value
    of these assets by comparison with estimated undiscounted cash
    flows expected to be generated by the asset. This review
    requires estimates and assumptions about the forecasted amount
    and duration of future cash flows and residual value, if any,
    attributable to the assets being tested.

We evaluate indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets and
    goodwill in all business units at least annually, or more
    frequently if there is an indication of possible impairment. We
    measure recoverability of an indefinite-lived trademark
    intangible asset by comparing its fair value, estimated using
    the “relief-from-royalty” method, with its carrying
    value. Under the “relief-from-royalty” method,
    forecasted global revenues for a trademark are assigned a
    royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark from
    an independent party. Those forecasted royalties are discounted
    to a present value, and the discounted fair value is compared
    with the carrying value of the trademark intangible asset.

The recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill of an
    acquired business is assessed by comparing the carrying value of
    the business unit, including recorded goodwill, to the fair
    value of the business unit. Fair value is estimated using
    forecasted cash flows of a business unit, discounted to a
    present value. These assessments of intangible asset and
    goodwill fair values require management’s assumptions and
    judgment regarding business strategies, future revenues and
    profitability, working capital changes, capital spending, income
    tax rates and a discount rate that reflects the risks inherent
    in the forecasted cash flows.

Based on our evaluations, other than the charges in 2006 and
    2007 in connection with the sale of our intimate apparel
    businesses, the indicated fair values of our amortized assets,
    indefinite-lived trademark assets and goodwill exceeded the
    respective carrying amounts of those assets in each of the last
    three years, and accordingly no


impairment charges were recognized. If the estimated fair value
    of an acquired business were to decline due to changes in
    forecasted business operations, or if we were to decide to
    discontinue use of its trademark or otherwise exit the business,
    we may be exposed to an impairment charge, which could be
    material.

Stock
    Options

We use a lattice option-pricing model to estimate the fair value
    of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of
    the Board of Directors. We believe that a lattice model provides
    a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can
    incorporate (i) historical option exercise patterns and
    multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for
    each of several groups of option holders and (ii) inputs
    that vary over time, such as assumptions for interest rates and
    volatility. We performed a rigorous review of all assumptions
    and believe that the assumptions employed in each valuation are
    reflective of our outstanding options and underlying Common
    Stock and of our groups of option participants. Our lattice
    valuation is based on the assumptions listed in Note P to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements.

One of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is
    estimating the expected average life of the options before
    exercise. In each year, we based our estimates on evaluations of
    the historical and expected option exercise patterns for each of
    several groups of option holders that have historically
    exhibited different option exercise patterns. These evaluations
    included (i) voluntary stock option exercise patterns based
    on a combination of changes in the price of VF Common Stock and
    periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and
    (ii) involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover,
    retirement and mortality.

Volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment. In
    each year, we based our estimate of future volatility on a
    combination of implied and historical volatility. Implied
    volatility was based on short-term (6 to 9 months) publicly
    traded near-the-money options on VF Common Stock. We measured
    historical volatility over a ten year period, corresponding to
    the contractual term of the options, using daily stock price
    observations. Our assumption for valuation purposes was that
    expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied
    volatility and then transitions to the historical volatility
    over the remainder of the ten year option term.

Pension
    Obligations

VF sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan as a key
    retirement benefit for most domestic employees employed on or
    before December 31, 2004. For employees covered by this
    plan, VF also sponsors an unfunded supplemental defined benefit
    plan that provides benefits that exceed limitations imposed by
    income tax regulations. The selection of appropriate actuarial
    assumptions for determination of our projected pension benefit
    liabilities and of our annual pension expense is significant due
    to the long time period over which benefits are accrued and
    paid. We annually update participant demographics and the
    expected amount and timing of benefit payments. We review
    annually the principal economic actuarial assumptions,
    summarized in Note N to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, and modify them based on current rates and trends.
    We also periodically review and modify as necessary other plan
    assumptions such as rates of retirement, termination, disability
    and mortality. We believe our assumptions are reflective of the
    participants in and benefits provided by the plans and result in
    the best estimate of the plans’ future experience. Actual
    results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used.

One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is
    the discount rate. The discount rate is used to estimate the
    present value of future cash outflows required to meet our
    projected benefit obligations at each measurement date. The
    discount rate reflects the interest rate inherent in the price
    that VF could settle its projected benefit obligations at the
    valuation date. Our discount rate assumption at each year-end is
    based on current market interest rates. We select our discount
    rate based on matching high quality corporate bond yields to the
    timing of projected benefit payments to be made to participants
    in our pension plans. We use the population of
    U.S. corporate bonds rated ‘Aa’ by Moody’s
    Investors Service (over 300 such bonds with at least
    $50 million outstanding that are noncallable/nonputtable
    unless with make-whole provisions) and exclude the highest and
    lowest yielding bonds. The plans’ projected benefit
    payments are matched to current market interest rates over the
    expected payment period, and a present value is developed that
    produces a single equivalent discount rate that recognizes our
    plans’ distinct liability characteristics. Despite the
    unusual conditions prevailing in the corporate bond markets in
    late 2008, we concluded that those ‘Aa’ rated issues
    meet the “high quality” intent of the applicable
    accounting standards. We believe our 2008 discount rate of 6.50%
    appropriately reflects current market conditions and the
    long-term nature of projected benefit payments to participants
    in our pension plans. The discount rate for our plans may be
    higher than rates used for plans at some other companies because
    of our plans’ longer duration of expected


benefit payments due to (i) a higher percentage of female
    participants with a longer life expectancy and (ii) a
    higher percentage of inactive participants who will not begin
    receiving vested benefits for many years.

Another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the
    expected long-term rate of return on investment assets in our
    qualified plan’s pension trust. Our investment objective is
    to maximize the long-term return on a diversified portfolio of
    assets at an acceptable level of risk. Plan assets are comprised
    of a diversified portfolio of domestic and international equity,
    corporate and governmental fixed income and real estate
    securities. We develop a projected rate of return for each of
    our investment asset classes based on several factors, including
    the estimated inflation rate, the premium to be earned in excess
    of a risk-free return, the premium for equity risk and the
    premium for longer duration fixed income securities. The
    weighted average of the projected long-term rate of return for
    the various classes of assets held by the plan provides the
    basis for the expected long-term rate of return actuarial
    assumption. Our rate of return assumption was 8.00% in 2008 and
    8.25% in 2007 and 2006. Our actual compounded annual rate of
    return since 1981 has exceeded 9%, although our actual rate of
    return was lower than the 8.00% assumption for the trailing 10
    and 15 year periods and was negative in 2008. We will
    constantly challenge the plan’s asset allocation, giving
    consideration to changes that will appropriately balance
    anticipated investment returns with risk.

The sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on our
    annual pension expense and on our plans’ projected benefit
    obligations, all other factors being equal, is illustrated by
    the following:

During 2007 and 2006, actual pension plan investment returns
    varied favorably compared with their respective actuarial
    assumptions. In 2008, however, there was a significant decline
    in the market value of our pension plan investment assets due to
    the global credit and financial market crisis, resulting in over
    $450 million of accumulated net unrecognized actuarial
    losses at the end of 2008. Accordingly, our qualified defined
    benefit pension plan was significantly underfunded at the end of
    2008. The underfunded status of our pension plans at the end of
    2008 resulted in recognition of a $291.0 million after-tax
    charge in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), along
    with recognition of related current and noncurrent liabilities
    of $9.4 million and $405.5 million, respectively. The
    funded status of our plans recognized in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets could change significantly in future years
    depending on investment portfolio performance, changes in
    interest rates and the level of VF contributions to the
    qualified plan.

Differences between actual results and the respective actuarial
    assumptions (i.e., actuarial gains and losses related to
    investment returns, discount rates and other assumptions) do not
    affect the current year’s pension expense but instead are
    deferred and amortized to pension expense over future periods.
    Our policy is to amortize unrecognized actuarial gains and
    losses to pension expense as follows: amounts totaling less than
    10% of the lower of investment assets or projected benefit
    obligations at the beginning of the year are not amortized;
    amounts totaling 10% to 20% of projected benefit obligations are
    amortized over the expected average remaining service of active
    participants; and amounts in excess of 20% of projected benefit
    obligations at the beginning of the year are amortized over five
    years.

The cost of pension benefits earned by our covered employees
    (commonly called “service cost”) was
    $16.5 million in 2008 and has averaged $20.1 million
    per year over the last three years. Pension expense recognized
    in our financial statements was $10.8 million in 2008,
    $13.1 million in 2007 and $37.5 million in 2006.
    Expense in 2006 was significantly higher than the average annual
    service cost because that year included a significant cost
    component for amortization of accumulated unrecognized actuarial
    losses (as discussed in the preceding paragraph). Our pension
    expense for 2008 and 2007 decreased significantly from 2006 due
    to reduced amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses, higher
    investment returns on a larger amount of plan assets (arising
    from discretionary funding contributions totaling
    $260.0 million over the period 2003 —
    2006) and an increase in the discount


rate used to value our projected benefit liabilities. Because of
    the significant investment losses incurred in the plan’s
    investment portfolio in 2008, pension expense for 2009 will
    include a significant cost component for amortization of
    unrecognized actuarial losses. This significant amortization
    cost component, plus expected reduced investment portfolio
    earnings due to a lower amount of plan assets, will cause our
    pension expense to increase to approximately $98 million
    for 2009 from $10.8 million in 2008.

VF is not required under applicable regulations, and does not
    currently intend, to make a contribution to the qualified
    pension plan during 2009 but does intend to make contributions
    totaling $9.4 million during 2009 to fund payments under
    the supplemental pension plan. We believe that VF has sufficient
    liquidity to make contributions to the qualified plan, as
    necessary, in future years to return the plan to a fully or
    substantially fully funded status.

Effective December 31, 2004, VF’s domestic defined
    benefit plans were amended to close the plans to new entrants.
    The amendments did not affect the benefits of plan participants
    at that date or their accrual of future benefits. Domestic
    employees hired after that date, plus employees at certain
    acquired businesses not covered by those plans, now participate
    in a new defined contribution arrangement with VF contributing
    amounts based on a percentage of eligible compensation. Funds
    contributed under this new benefit arrangement are invested as
    directed by the participants. This defined contribution feature
    did not have a significant effect on our total retirement
    benefit expense over the last three years. However, on a
    longer-term basis, the service cost component of our defined
    benefit plans’ expense is expected to decline as a
    percentage of our total retirement benefit expense, and the
    year-to-year variability of our retirement benefit expense
    should decrease.

Income
    Taxes

As a global company, VF is subject to income tax and files
    income tax returns in over 100 domestic and foreign
    jurisdictions each year. The calculation of our income tax
    liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex
    tax laws and regulations, which are subject to legal and factual
    interpretation and significant management judgment.

VF’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal,
    state and foreign tax authorities, and those audits may result
    in proposed adjustments. We have reviewed all issues raised upon
    examination, as well as any exposure for issues that may be
    raised in future examinations. We have evaluated these potential
    issues under the “more-likely-than-not” standard of
    FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109

. A tax position is recognized if it meets this
    standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that
    is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Such judgments and
    estimates may change based on audit settlements, court cases and
    interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Our income tax
    expense could be materially affected to the extent we prevail in
    a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a
    tax position for which accruals have been established, or to the
    extent we are required to pay amounts greater than established
    accruals. We do not currently anticipate any material impact on
    earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax
    uncertainties. There are no accruals for general or unknown tax
    expenses.

We have recorded $133.2 million of deferred income tax
    assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards,
    and we have recorded $93.4 million of valuation allowances
    against those assets. Realization of deferred tax assets is
    dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions,
    the amount and timing of which are uncertain, possible changes
    in tax laws and tax planning strategies. If in our judgment it
    appears that we will not be able to generate sufficient taxable
    income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward
    periods, we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce those
    deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately
    realized. If in a future period we determine that the amount of
    deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded
    amount, we would record an adjustment to income tax expense in
    that future period.

We have not provided U.S. income taxes on a portion of our
    foreign subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings because we
    intend to invest those earnings indefinitely. If we were to
    decide to remit those earnings to the United States in a future
    period, our provision for income taxes could increase in that
    period.

Cautionary
    Statement on Forward-Looking Statements

From time to time, we may make oral or written statements,
    including statements in this Annual Report that constitute
    “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
    federal securities laws. These include statements concerning
    plans, objectives, projections and expectations relating to
    VF’s operations or economic performance, and assumptions
    related thereto. Forward-looking statements are made based on
    our expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting
    VF and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We
    caution that


forward-looking statements are not guarantees and actual results
    could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the
    forward-looking statements.

Known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that
    could cause the actual results of operations or financial
    condition of VF to differ materially from those expressed or
    implied by such forward-looking statements are summarized in
    Item 1.A of this Annual Report.

Conclusion
    Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures

Under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and the
    Chief Financial Officer, VF conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of VF’s
    “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

or

15d-15(e)

of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange
    Act”) as of January 3, 2009. These require that VF
    ensure that information required to be disclosed by VF in
    reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
    Commission’s rules and forms and that information required
    to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the
    Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to VF’s
    management, including the principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosures. Based on VF’s evaluation, the
    principal executive officer and the principal financial officer
    concluded that VF’s disclosure controls and procedures are
    effective.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

VF’s management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
    as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

VF’s management conducted an assessment of VF’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
    described in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework,

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
    assessment, VF’s management has determined that VF’s
    internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
    January 3, 2009. The effectiveness of VF’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2009 has
    been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
    registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
    which appears herein.

See “Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and
    Financial Statement Schedule” at the end of this annual
    report on

page F-1

for “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting.”

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in VF’s internal control over
    financial reporting that occurred during its last fiscal quarter
    that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
    materially affect, VF’s internal control over financial
    reporting.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of VF Corporation (“VF”) is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act
    Rule 13a-15(f). VF’s management conducted an
    assessment of VF’s internal control over financial
    reporting based on the framework described in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

, issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on this assessment, VF’s management has
    determined that VF’s internal control over financial
    reporting was effective as of January 3, 2009.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of VF’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of January 3,
    2009 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
    independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
    their report included herein.

F-2

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of V.F. Corporation:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of V.F.
    Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) at
    January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, and the results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended January 3, 2009 in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
    statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
    Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects,
    the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with
    the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our
    opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    January 3, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for these financial statements and financial statement schedule,
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to
    express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial
    statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We
    conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

As more fully described in Note A to the consolidated
    financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it
    accounts for (i) uncertain tax positions effective
    December 31, 2006; and (ii) defined benefit pension
    and other postretirement plans effective December 30, 2006
    as well as the measurement date for the related plan assets and
    benefit obligations effective December 31, 2006.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Note A —
    Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business:

VF Corporation (and
    its subsidiaries, collectively known as “VF”) is a
    global apparel company based in the United States. VF designs
    and manufactures or sources from independent contractors a
    variety of apparel and footwear for all ages. Products are
    marketed primarily under VF-owned brand names. VF has
    significant market shares in jeanswear, outdoor and action
    sports apparel and sportswear. VF is also a leader in daypacks,
    backpacks and technical outdoor equipment and in occupational
    apparel.

VF markets these products to a broad customer base throughout
    the world. Products having various price points are sold through
    multiple channels of distribution, including specialty stores,
    department stores, national chains, mass merchants and
    VF-operated retail stores. VF’s ten largest customers, all

U.S.-based

retailers, accounted for 26% of 2008 total revenues and 25% of
    total 2008 accounts receivable. Sales are made on an unsecured
    basis under customary terms that may vary by product, channel of
    distribution or geographic region. VF continuously monitors the
    creditworthiness of its customers and has established internal
    policies regarding customer credit limits. The breadth of
    product offerings, combined with the large number and geographic
    diversity of its customers, limits VF’s concentration of
    risks.

Basis of Presentation:

All financial
    statements and related disclosures are presented in accordance
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America. The consolidated financial statements include
    the accounts of VF and its subsidiaries, after elimination of
    intercompany transactions and balances. For consolidated
    subsidiaries that are not wholly owned, the minority
    owners’ portion of net income, which is not significant, is
    reported in Miscellaneous, net in the Consolidated Statements of
    Income, and the minority ownership interest in net assets is
    reported in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Investments in entities that VF does not control but has the
    ability to exercise significant influence (generally

20-50%

owned
    companies) are accounted for using the equity method of
    accounting. Equity method investments, initially recorded at
    cost in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are
    adjusted to recognize VF’s share of the investee’s
    earnings and dividends after the date of investment. VF’s
    share of net income of these investments, totaling
    $7.3 million in 2008, $4.2 million in 2007 and
    $2.2 million in 2006, is included in Marketing,
    Administrative and General Expenses in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

In April 2007, VF sold its intimate apparel business consisting
    of its domestic and international women’s intimate apparel
    business units. Accordingly, the Consolidated Statements of
    Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows have been
    reclassified to present the intimate apparel businesses as
    discontinued operations for all periods. Interest expense has
    not been allocated to the discontinued operations. Amounts
    presented herein, unless otherwise stated, relate to continuing
    operations. See Note C.

Fiscal Year:

VF operates and reports using a
    52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to
    December 31 of each year. All references to “2008”,
    “2007” and “2006” relate to the 53 week
    fiscal year ended on January 3, 2009 and the 52 week
    fiscal years ended on December 29, 2007 and
    December 30, 2006, respectively. Certain foreign
    subsidiaries report using a December 31 year-end due to
    local statutory requirements. For presentation purposes in this
    report, all fiscal years are presented as ended in December.

Foreign Currency Translation:

Financial
    statements of most foreign subsidiaries are measured using the
    local currency as the functional currency. Assets and
    liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated
    into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the
    balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at
    average exchange rates during the period. Resulting translation
    gains and losses, and transaction gains and losses on long-term
    advances to foreign subsidiaries, are reported in Accumulated
    Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). For a foreign subsidiary that
    uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency, the
    effects of remeasuring assets and liabilities into
    U.S. dollars are included in the Consolidated Statements of
    Income. Net transaction losses of $18.9 million in 2008 and
    net transaction gains of $7.5 million in 2007 and
    $12.0 million in 2006, arising from

F-9

VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional
    currency of a particular entity, are included in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income.

Cash and Equivalents

are demand deposits and highly
    liquid investments that will mature within three months of their
    purchase. Cash equivalents consist of short-term time deposits
    in U.S. and foreign commercial banks and investments in
    institutional money market funds that invest in short-term
    obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government.

Accounts Receivable:

Trade accounts receivable
    are recorded at invoiced amounts, less estimated allowances for
    trade terms, sales incentive programs, customer markdowns and
    charge-backs, and returned products. Allowances are based on
    evaluations of specific product and customer circumstances,
    retail sales performance, historical and anticipated trends and
    current economic conditions. Royalty receivables are recorded at
    amounts earned based on the licensees’ sales of licensed
    products, subject in some cases to minimum annual amounts from
    individual licensees. VF maintains an allowance for doubtful
    accounts for estimated losses that will result from the
    inability of customers and licensees to make required payments.
    All accounts are subject to ongoing review for ultimate
    collectibility. The allowance considers specific customer
    accounts where collection is doubtful, as well as the inherent
    risk in ultimate collectibility of total balances. The amount of
    the allowance is determined considering the aging of balances,
    anticipated trends and economic conditions. Receivables are
    written off against the allowance when it is probable the
    amounts will not be recovered. There is no off-balance sheet
    credit exposure related to customer receivables.

Inventories

are stated at the lower of cost or market.
    Cost is net of purchase discounts or rebates received from
    vendors. Cost is determined on the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method for 77% of total 2008
    inventories and 73% of total 2007 inventories. For remaining
    inventories, cost is determined on the

last-in,

first-out (“LIFO”) method (primarily due to Internal
    Revenue Service conformity requirements where LIFO is used for
    income tax purposes). The LIFO method is used for jeanswear,
    wholesale sportswear and occupational apparel inventories
    located in the United States and Canada. The value of
    inventories stated on the LIFO method is not significantly
    different from the value determined under the FIFO method.
    Market value for materials and supplies is replacement cost.
    Market value for finished goods is the expected net realizable
    value, which is based on the quantity and quality of
    inventories, forecasted demand and historical and expected
    realization trends.

Long-lived Assets:

Property, plant and
    equipment, intangible assets and goodwill are stated at cost.
    Improvements to property, plant and equipment that substantially
    extend the useful life of the asset, and interest costs incurred
    during construction of major assets, are capitalized. Repair and
    maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Goodwill represents
    the excess of costs over the fair value of net tangible assets
    and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired.
    Goodwill is assigned at the business unit level, which at VF is
    typically one level below a reportable segment.

Depreciation of owned assets and amortization of assets under
    capital leases are computed using the straight-line method over
    the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from 3 to
    10 years for machinery and equipment and up to
    40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are
    depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or
    the lease term. Intangible assets having indefinite lives
    (trademarks and tradenames) and goodwill are not amortized.
    Other intangible assets, primarily customer relationships,
    contracts to license acquired trademarks to third parties and
    contracts to license trademarks from third parties, are
    amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from less
    than one year to 30 years. Amortization of intangible
    assets is computed using straight-line or accelerated methods
    consistent with the expected realization of benefits to be
    received. The estimated useful lives of licensing intangible
    assets may take into consideration renewal or extension periods
    based on VF’s experience in renewing or extending similar
    arrangements. Costs related to license contract renewals or
    extensions are expensed as incurred and are not significant.
    Depreciation and amortization expense related to producing or
    otherwise obtaining finished goods inventories is included in
    Cost of Goods Sold, and other depreciation and amortization
    expense is included in Marketing, Administrative and General
    Expenses. Upon retirement or disposition, the asset

F-10

VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are
    removed from the accounts, and a gain or loss is recognized
    based on the difference between the net proceeds received and
    the asset’s carrying value.

VF’s policy is to evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived
    intangible assets for possible impairment at least annually and
    to evaluate all long-lived assets for possible impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Goodwill
    is evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the fair value
    of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including the
    goodwill assigned to that reporting unit. Fair value of a
    reporting unit is generally estimated using an approach in which
    forecasted cash flows of a reporting unit are discounted at a
    rate commensurate with the risks of those cash flows. An
    impairment charge would be recorded if the carrying value of the
    goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Intangible assets with
    indefinite lives (trademarks) are evaluated for possible
    impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset with its
    carrying value. Fair value for these assets is estimated as the
    discounted value of future revenues arising from a trademark
    using a royalty rate that a third party would pay for use of
    that trademark. The amount of impairment charge would be the
    excess of the trademark’s carrying value over its estimated
    fair value. For property and intangible assets with identified
    useful lives, an impairment loss would be recorded if forecasted
    undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset or asset
    group are not expected to be adequate to recover the
    asset’s carrying value. The amount of impairment charge for
    these assets would be the excess of the asset’s carrying
    value over its fair value.

In connection with the decision near the end of 2006 to exit the
    women’s intimate apparel business, VF recorded an
    impairment charge for the difference between the recorded book
    value of the long-lived assets of this business and the expected
    net sales proceeds. See Basis of Presentation above and
    Note C.

Revenue Recognition:

Revenue is recognized
    when (i) there is a contract or other arrangement of sale,
    (ii) the sales price is fixed or determinable,
    (iii) title and the risks of ownership have been
    transferred to the customer, and (iv) collection of the
    receivable is reasonably assured. Net Sales to wholesale
    customers and sales through the internet are generally
    recognized when the product has been received by the customer.
    Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in
    Net Sales. Net Sales are recorded after reduction of estimated
    allowances for trade terms, sales incentive programs, customer
    markdowns and charge-backs, and product returns. Sales incentive
    programs with wholesale customers include stated discounts.
    Sales incentive programs directly with consumers include rebate
    and coupon offers. These allowances are estimated based on
    evaluations of specific product and customer circumstances,
    retail sales performance, historical and anticipated trends, and
    current economic conditions; historically, they have not
    differed significantly from actual results. Net Sales at
    VF-operated retail stores, after reduction of an estimated
    allowance for returns, are recognized at the time products are
    purchased by consumers. Sales taxes and value added taxes
    collected from customers and remitted directly to governmental
    authorities are excluded from Net Sales.

Royalty Income is recognized as earned based on the greater of
    licensees’ sales of licensed products at rates specified in
    the licensing contracts or contractual minimum royalty levels.

Cost of Goods Sold

for VF-manufactured goods includes all
    materials, labor and overhead costs incurred in the production
    process. Cost of Goods Sold for contracted or purchased finished
    goods includes the purchase costs and related overhead. In both
    cases, overhead includes all costs related to manufacturing or
    purchasing finished goods, including costs of planning,
    purchasing, quality control, freight, duties, royalties paid to
    third parties and shrinkage. For product lines having a lifetime
    warranty, a provision for estimated future repair or replacement
    costs, based on historical and anticipated trends, is recorded
    when these products are sold. Sales incentives to consumers in
    the form of free products are included in Cost of Goods Sold.

Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses

include
    costs of product development, selling, marketing and
    advertising, VF-operated retail stores, warehousing, shipping
    and handling, licensing and administration. Advertising costs
    are expensed as incurred and totaled $399.1 million in
    2008, $362.1 million in 2007 and $321.9 million in
    2006. Advertising costs include cooperative advertising payments
    made to VF’s retail customers

F-11

VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

as direct reimbursement of documented advertising costs incurred
    by those retailers for advertising VF’s products.
    Cooperative advertising costs, totaling $73.2 million in
    2008, $61.5 million in 2007 and $60.8 million in 2006,
    are independently verified to support the fair value of
    advertising reimbursed by VF. Shipping and handling costs for
    delivery of products to customers totaled $218.4 million in
    2008, $213.0 million in 2007 and $201.5 million in
    2006. Expenses related to royalty income, including amortization
    of licensing intangible assets, were $21.6 million in 2008,
    $23.6 million in 2007 and $22.5 million in 2006.

Rent Expense:

VF enters into noncancelable
    operating leases for retail stores, distribution, office and
    other real estate and for equipment. Leases for real estate have
    initial terms ranging from 3 to 15 years, generally with
    renewal options. Leases for equipment typically have initial
    terms ranging from 2 to 5 years. Most leases have fixed
    rentals, with many of the real estate leases providing for
    additional payments based on sales volume or for payments of
    real estate taxes and occupancy-related costs. Contingent rent
    expense, based on Net Sales at individual retail store locations
    being in excess of a stated base amount, is recognized when the
    liability is probable. Rent expense for leases having rent
    holidays or scheduled rent increases is recorded on a
    straight-line basis over the lease term beginning when VF has
    possession or control of the leased premises. Lease incentives
    received from landlords and the difference between straight-line
    rent expense and scheduled rent payments are deferred in Other
    Liabilities and amortized as a reduction of rent expense over
    the lease term.

Self-insurance:

VF is primarily self-insured
    for employee group medical, workers’ compensation, vehicle,
    property and general liability exposures. Liabilities for
    self-insured exposures are accrued at the present value of
    amounts expected to be paid based on historical claims
    experience and actuarial data for forecasted settlements of
    claims filed and for incurred but not yet reported claims.
    Accruals for self-insured exposures are included in current and
    noncurrent liabilities based on the expected period of payment.
    Excess liability insurance has been purchased to cover claims in
    excess of self-insured amounts.

Income Taxes

are provided on Net Income for financial
    reporting purposes. Income Taxes are based on amounts of taxes
    payable or refundable in the current year and on expected future
    tax consequences of events that are recognized in the financial
    statements in different periods than they are recognized in tax
    returns. As a result of timing of recognition and measurement
    differences between financial accounting standards and income
    tax laws, temporary differences arise between amounts of pretax
    financial statement income and taxable income and between
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets and their respective tax bases. Deferred income
    tax assets and liabilities reported in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets reflect estimated future tax effects attributable to
    these temporary differences and to net operating loss and net
    capital loss carryforwards, based on tax rates expected to be in
    effect for years in which the differences are expected to be
    settled or realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is
    dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions.
    Valuation allowances are used to reduce deferred tax assets to
    amounts considered likely to be realized. U.S. deferred
    income taxes are not provided on undistributed income of foreign
    subsidiaries where such earnings are considered to be
    permanently invested. Accrued income taxes in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets include unrecognized income tax benefits,
    including related interest and penalties, appropriately
    classified as current or noncurrent. The provision for Income
    Taxes also includes estimated interest and penalties related to
    uncertain tax positions.

Earnings Per Share:

Basic earnings per share
    is computed by dividing earnings available to common
    stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of Common
    Stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per share considers the
    effect of potentially dilutive securities such as stock options,
    restricted stock, restricted stock units and Preferred Stock
    (prior to its conversion into Common Stock during 2006). Stock
    options are included in diluted earnings per share when the
    average market price of VF Common Stock during the quarter
    exceeds the exercise price of the option. Performance-based
    restricted stock units are included in diluted earnings per
    share in the quarter in which the underlying performance
    conditions have been satisfied.

Changes in Accounting Policies:

In September
    2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued FASB Statement No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans

(“Statement 158”).
    Statement 158, effective for December 2006, required that
    (i) the funded status of a

F-12

VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

defined benefit plan, measured as the difference between the
    fair value of plan assets and projected benefit obligations, be
    recorded in the balance sheet and (ii) gains and losses for
    differences between actuarial assumptions and actual results,
    and unrecognized prior service costs, be recorded as a component
    of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). Accordingly,
    VF recorded a charge of $55.5 million (net of income taxes
    of $34.5 million) to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
    (Loss) effective at the end of 2006. Statement 158 did not
    change the measurement of plan assets and benefit obligations or
    the measurement of benefit expense in the statement of income.

Further, Statement 158 required VF to change its September
    measurement date for valuation of plan assets and projected
    benefit obligations to its December fiscal year-end date. VF
    elected for 2007 to change its plans’ measurement date to
    December and accordingly recorded, effective at the beginning of
    2007, (i) a charge of $3.8 million (net of income
    taxes of $2.4 million) to Retained Earnings for pension
    expense for the period October to December 2006 and (ii) a
    credit of $22.5 million (net of income taxes of
    $14.0 million) to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
    (Loss) for the changes in plan assets and projected benefit
    obligations for that period. See Note N for the effect of
    the change in measurement date from September 2006 to December
    2006 on the pension plans’ assets and projected benefit
    obligations.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”), which clarified the accounting
    for uncertainty in income tax positions. FIN 48 prescribed
    the recognition threshold an income tax provision is required to
    meet before being recorded in the financial statements and
    provided guidance on classification and disclosures of tax
    positions. VF adopted FIN 48 by recording a cumulative
    effect charge of $2.3 million (net of $0.2 million
    income tax effect) to Retained Earnings at the beginning of
    2007, a $2.8 million reduction in Goodwill and a
    $0.5 million reduction in unrecognized income tax benefits,
    in accordance with the provisions of FIN 48. See
    Note Q.

VF adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)

06-11,

Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on
    Share-Based Payment Awards,

beginning in 2008.

EITF 06-11

requires that the tax benefit related to dividend equivalents
    declared on restricted stock units that are expected to vest be
    recorded as an increase in Additional Paid-in Capital. The
    impact of adopting

EITF 06-11

was not significant.

In September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“Statement 157”), and
    in February 2007 issued FASB Statement No. 159,

The Fair
    Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115

(“Statement 159”). Statement 157
    clarified the definition of fair value, established a framework
    and a hierarchy based on the level of observability and judgment
    associated with inputs used in measuring fair value, and
    expanded disclosures about fair value measurements
    (Note U). Statement 157 applies whenever other accounting
    pronouncements require or permit assets or liabilities to be
    measured at fair value but does not require any new fair value
    measurements. VF adopted Statement 157 in 2008. However, as
    permitted by FASB Staff Position

No. 157-2,

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157

, VF elected
    to defer until 2009 the disclosure provisions of Statement 157
    relating to nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and
    nonfinancial liabilities. This deferral of disclosures applies
    primarily to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities
    initially measured at fair value in a business combination or
    measured at fair value for an impairment assessment. Statement
    159 permits companies to measure at fair value eligible
    financial assets and financial liabilities that were not
    otherwise required to be recorded at fair value, with changes in
    fair value recognized in net income as they occur. Since VF did
    not elect to apply fair value accounting to any additional
    items, the adoption of Statement 159 had no impact.

Derivative Financial Instruments

are measured at their
    fair value and are recognized as Other Current Assets or Accrued
    Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. VF formally
    documents hedged transactions and hedging instruments at the
    inception of the contract. Further, VF assesses, both at the
    inception of a contract and on an ongoing basis, whether the
    hedging instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes
    in cash flows of the hedged transactions. Derivative financial
    instruments are used for risk management and are not used for
    trading or speculative purposes.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

A derivative may be specifically designated and accounted for as
    (i) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows for a
    forecasted transaction or (ii) a hedge of the exposure to
    changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or
    an unrecognized firm commitment. The criteria used to determine
    if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are
    (i) whether an appropriate hedging instrument has been
    designated and identified to reduce an identified exposure and
    (ii) whether there is a high correlation between changes in
    the fair value of the hedging instrument and the identified
    exposure. Changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for
    as cash flow hedges are deferred in Accumulated Other
    Comprehensive Income (Loss) until the hedged transaction affects
    earnings, at which time the amount is reclassified to Net Income
    (primarily in Cost of Goods Sold) as an offset to the earnings
    impact of the hedged transaction. Changes in the fair value of
    derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges are recognized in
    Net Income as an offset to the earnings impact of the hedged
    item. These hedging transactions are evaluated each quarter,
    with changes in fair value deferred in Accumulated Other
    Comprehensive Income (Loss) or reported in Net Income, depending
    on the nature of the hedged item or risk and the effectiveness
    of the hedge. The impact of a hedging instrument that is not
    effective in hedging the intended cash flows or fair values is
    recorded immediately in earnings; these amounts have not been
    significant. Hedging cash flows are classified in the
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same category as
    the items being hedged. If a derivative instrument does not meet
    the criteria for hedge accounting, which would be rare, any
    change in fair value is recognized in Miscellaneous Income or
    Expense when it occurs.

Legal and Other Contingencies:

Management
    periodically assesses, based on the latest information
    available, liabilities and contingencies in connection with
    legal proceedings and other claims that may arise from time to
    time. When it is probable that a loss has been or will be
    incurred, we record the loss, or a reasonable estimate of the
    loss, in the consolidated financial statements. Estimates of
    losses are adjusted in the period in which additional
    information becomes available or circumstances change. We
    disclose a contingent liability when there is at least a
    reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. Management
    believes that the outcome of any outstanding or pending matters,
    individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material
    adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Use of Estimates:

In preparing financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, management makes estimates and assumptions that
    affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements
    and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those
    estimates.

Reclassifications:

Certain prior year amounts
    have been reclassified to conform with the 2008 presentation.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards:

In
    December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement
    No. 141(Revised),

Business Combinations

(“Statement 141(R)”), which revises how business
    combinations are accounted for, both at the acquisition date and
    in subsequent periods. Statement 141(R) requires the acquiring
    entity in a business combination to (i) measure
    substantially all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in
    either a full or a partial acquisition at their full fair values
    at the acquisition date, (ii) expense all transaction and
    restructuring costs and (iii) provide additional
    disclosures not required under prior rules. Statement 141(R) is
    effective for transactions in which VF obtains control of a
    business beginning in its 2009 fiscal year. The impact on VF of
    adopting Statement 141(R) will depend on the nature, terms and
    size of business combinations completed after the effective
    date. Early adoption of Statement 141(R) was not permitted.

Also in December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement
    No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
    Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51

(“Statement 160”). Statement 160 requires a company to
    classify noncontrolling (i.e., minority) interests in partially
    owned consolidated subsidiaries as equity instead of as a
    liability and provides guidance on the accounting for
    transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests.
    Statement 160, effective for VF’s 2009 fiscal year,
    requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure
    requirements, with all other requirements to be applied
    prospectively. The impact on VF of adopting Statement 160 will
    not be significant. Early adoption of Statement 160 was not
    permitted.

In March 2008, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 133

(“Statement 161”). Statement 161
    requires expanded disclosures related to (i) how and why an

    Statement 133 and its related interpretations and (iii) how
    derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an

In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

No. FAS 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

(“FSP 142-3”).

FSP 142-3

amends the factors to be considered in developing renewal or

Note B —
    Acquisitions

In June 2008, VF acquired one-third of the outstanding equity of
    Mo Industries Holdings, Inc. (“Mo Industries”), a Los
    Angeles-based company that owns the

Splendid

®

and

Ella
    Moss

®

brands of premium sportswear marketed to upscale department and
    specialty stores. VF also acquired an option to purchase the
    remaining shares of Mo Industries and granted the other
    stockholders of Mo Industries an option to require VF to
    purchase all of their stock during the first half of 2009 at a
    price based on its 2008 earnings. The cost of the investment,
    including the related put/call rights, was $77.4 million.
    The investment is recorded in Other Assets and is being
    accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The equity
    in net income of Mo Industries was reported as part of the
    Contemporary Brands Coalition from the date of the investment.
    See Note W.

In July 2008, VF acquired 100% ownership of its former 50%-owned
    joint venture that markets

Lee

®

branded products in Spain and Portugal (“Lee Spain”).
    The cost of the additional investment was $25.4 million,
    consisting of $14.9 million in cash, plus the transfer of
    certain nonmonetary assets held by the former joint venture.
    Management has allocated the purchase price to acquired tangible
    and intangible assets and assumed liabilities, based on their
    respective fair values. Of the total consideration,
    $13.5 million was assigned to indefinite-lived and
    amortizable Intangible Assets and $15.7 million was
    assigned to Goodwill. The joint venture was accounted for using
    the equity method of accounting through July 2008, and Lee Spain
    is accounted for as a consolidated subsidiary subsequent to that
    date. Operating results for all periods are reported as part of
    the Jeanswear Coalition.

On February 28, 2007, VF acquired substantially all the
    operating assets of Majestic Athletic, Inc.
    (“Majestic”) and related companies for a cost of
    $131.5 million. Majestic currently holds exclusive on-field
    uniform rights for all 30 major league baseball teams, including
    supplying each team with on-field

MLB Authentic
    Collection

tm

outerwear, batting practice jerseys, T-shirts, shorts and
    fleece. Majestic also markets

Majestic

®

brand baseball-related consumer apparel to wholesale accounts.
    On August 27, 2007, VF acquired lucy activewear, inc.
    (“lucy activewear”), a chain of retail stores
    marketing

lucy

®

brand women’s activewear, for a cost of
    $114.1 million. On August 31, 2007, VF acquired Seven
    For All Mankind, LLC (“Seven For All Mankind”),
    marketer of the

7 For All
    Mankind

®

brand of women’s and men’s premium denim jeanswear and
    related apparel products in the United States and Europe, for a
    cost of $773.1 million. The lucy activewear business and
    the Seven For All Mankind business together formed the
    foundation for a new lifestyle-based coalition called
    Contemporary Brands. On January 26, 2007, VF acquired Eagle
    Creek, Inc. (“Eagle Creek”), maker of

Eagle
    Creek

®

brand adventure travel gear that includes accessories, luggage
    and daypacks. In addition, on April 2, 2007, VF acquired
    the brand-related assets of a former licensee that had rights to
    market VF’s

The North
    Face

brand in China and Nepal (“The North Face —
    China”). Because the licensing arrangement represented an
    arms-length contract, no gain or loss was recognized at

the acquisition date. The total cost of these acquisitions,
    collectively referred to as the “2007 Acquisitions,”
    was $1,070.3 million, plus the assumption of
    $11.6 million of debt.

In the Majestic acquisition, the fair value of the net assets
    acquired exceeded the purchase price by $14.0 million.
    Since there is a maximum of $10.0 million of contingent
    consideration based on growth in revenues that may result in the
    recognition of additional purchase cost, that amount was accrued
    as a deferred credit, with the remaining $4.0 million
    excess fair value at the acquisition date applied to reduce on a
    pro rata basis amounts initially assigned to noncurrent assets.
    Of the total contingent consideration, $3.3 million was
    earned in 2008 and payable in 2009 and $1.5 million was
    earned in 2007 and paid in 2008. The additional
    $5.2 million maximum contingent consideration that can be
    earned through 2009 is recorded as a deferred credit in Other
    Liabilities. If the final contingent consideration earned is
    less than the $10.0 million maximum, the difference will be
    recognized as a pro rata reduction of amounts initially assigned
    to noncurrent assets. Contingent consideration of
    $5.3 million for Eagle Creek, based on a measure of
    profitability, was accrued in 2008 and recorded as Goodwill. In
    addition, contingent consideration of $0.8 million related
    to the 2005 acquisition of the net assets of Holoubek, Inc.
    (“Holoubek”) was earned and recorded as Goodwill in
    2008. Additional contingent consideration for Eagle Creek can be
    earned in 2009 based on a measure of profitability, with no
    maximum amount, and additional consideration of
    $1.7 million can be earned for Holoubek in 2011. Any
    additional contingent consideration earned will be recorded as
    Goodwill.

On September 1, 2006, VF acquired a 60% interest in a newly
    formed joint venture to design, market and distribute VF-branded
    products in India for a total cost of $33.2 million. Prior
    to the transaction, the joint venture partner marketed the

Lee

,

Wrangler

®

,

Nautica

®

,

JanSport

®

and

Kipling

®

brands under license or distribution agreements. Because all
    preexisting relationships were arms-length contracts, no gain or
    loss was recognized upon formation of the joint venture.

Management has allocated the purchase price of each acquisition
    to acquired tangible and intangible assets, and assumed
    liabilities, based on their respective fair values. The
    following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the Lee Spain
    acquisition in 2008 (including the carrying value of the prior
    50% equity investment) and for the 2007 Acquisitions at their
    respective dates of acquisition:

®

,

Majestic

®

and

    Creek

®

trademarks and tradenames have indefinite lives. Amounts
    assigned to amortizable intangible assets included
    $223.8 million of customer relationships and
    $49.7 million of licensing contracts. Customer
    relationships are being amortized using accelerated methods over
    their estimated weighted average useful lives of 19 years,
    and licensing contracts are being amortized using straight-line
    and accelerated methods over their estimated weighted average
    useful lives of 18 years. For the 2008 acquisition of Lee
    Spain and the 2006 acquisition in India, amounts assigned to
    amortizable intangible assets consisted primarily of customer
    relationships, which are being amortized using an accelerated
    method over their weighted average useful lives of 15 years.

Except for the Majestic transaction, the purchase price of each
    acquisition exceeded the fair value of the net tangible and
    intangible assets acquired, with the excess purchase price
    recorded as Goodwill. Factors that contributed to recognition of
    Goodwill included (i) expected growth rates and
    profitability of the acquired companies, (ii) the ability
    to expand the brands within their markets or to new markets,
    (iii) their experienced workforce, (iv) VF’s
    strategies for growth in sales, income and cash flows and
    (v) expected synergies with existing VF business units. The
    Majestic, lucy activewear, Seven For All Mankind and Eagle Creek
    acquisitions are consistent with VF’s goal of acquiring
    strong lifestyle brands that have high growth potential within
    their target markets. The acquisitions of Lee Spain, The North
    Face — China and the joint venture in India gave VF
    control of its leading brands in some of the fastest growing
    markets in the world. Approximately $205.9 million of
    Goodwill in the 2007 Acquisitions is expected to be deductible
    for income tax purposes.

Operating results of the acquisitions have been included in the
    consolidated financial statements since their respective
    acquisition dates.

The following pro forma results of operations assume that the
    Majestic and Seven For All Mankind acquisitions had occurred at
    the beginning of 2007. Pro forma operating results for the other
    2007 acquisitions and for the Lee Spain acquisition in 2008, for
    periods prior to their respective dates of acquisition, are not
    provided because these acquisitions, in the aggregate, are not
    material to VF’s results of operations.

Sale of Intimate Apparel Business Classified as Discontinued
    Operations:

In December 2006, management and the Board of
    Directors decided to exit VF’s domestic and international
    women’s intimate apparel business (formerly referred to as
    the Intimate Apparel Coalition, a reportable business segment).
    On April 1, 2007, VF sold the net assets of this business
    (except for an investment in marketable securities of an
    intimate apparel supplier) for $348.7 million, plus
    $28.8 million related to the business unit’s Cash and
    Equivalents. The transaction was consistent with VF’s
    stated objective of focusing on lifestyle businesses having high
    growth and profit potential. The results of operations and cash
    flows of the intimate apparel business are separately presented
    as discontinued operations for all periods in accordance with
    FASB Statement No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

(“Statement 144”).

VF recorded a charge of $42.2 million in 2006, computed in
    accordance with Statement 144, for the difference between the
    recorded book value of the intimate apparel business and the
    expected net sales proceeds. The recorded book value included
    $117.5 million of Goodwill and $32.0 million of
    foreign currency translation losses, net of income tax

benefit, deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
    (Loss). The charge was recorded as a valuation allowance against
    noncurrent assets of the intimate apparel business. In addition,
    VF recorded a noncash partial pension plan curtailment charge of
    $5.6 million for the withdrawal of intimate apparel
    participants from VF’s defined benefit pension plans. The
    write-down to expected net sales proceeds, plus the pension
    curtailment charge, were recorded in 2006 as a loss on disposal
    of the intimate apparel business, net of an income tax benefit
    of $10.9 million. Included in the determination of the
    $42.2 million impairment charge in 2006 was a
    $17.2 million unrealized gain on an investment in
    marketable securities of a supplier to our former intimate
    apparel business mentioned above. However, those marketable
    securities were not included in the final sales transaction.
    Accordingly, the loss on disposal in 2007 of $24.6 million
    consisted of (i) a $17.2 million increase in the loss
    related to the unsold marketable securities, (ii) final
    determination of the sales price and (iii) income tax
    adjustments of the sales price allocation.

Cost and accumulated amortization of $17.5 million were

    underlying intangible assets became fully amortized in that
    year. Similarly, $0.1 million was eliminated from
    Trademarks and Other in both 2008 and 2007.

Amortization expense was $39.4 million in 2008,
    $27.1 million in 2007 and $18.0 million in 2006.
    Estimated amortization expense for the years 2009 through 2013
    is $34.5 million, $31.9 million, $29.6 million,
    $28.0 million and $26.7 million, respectively.

Other investment securities include common stock of a supplier
    to our former intimate apparel business and life insurance
    contracts held in an irrevocable trust to partially fund
    liabilities under the supplemental defined benefit pension plan
    (Note N). The common stock and the life insurance contracts
    are considered to be available-for-sale securities and,
    accordingly, are recorded at fair value.

Investments accounted for under the equity method at the end of
    2007 included a 50% investment in Lee Spain. In July 2008, VF
    acquired the remaining equity in Lee Spain, and accordingly Lee
    Spain is a consolidated subsidiary after that date. At the end
    of 2008, the primary investment accounted for under the equity
    method was a one-third interest in Mo Industries. See

VF has a $1.0 billion senior domestic unsecured committed
    revolving bank credit agreement that supports issuance of up to
    $1.0 billion in commercial paper, with any unused portion
    available for general corporate purposes. This agreement expires
    in October 2012 and can be extended by VF in October 2009 for
    one additional year, with approval of the lenders. The agreement
    requires VF to pay a facility fee of 0.06% per year and contains
    a financial covenant requiring VF’s ratio of consolidated
    indebtedness to consolidated capitalization to remain below 60%.
    The agreement contains other covenants and events of default,
    including limitations on liens, subsidiary indebtedness, sales
    of assets, and a cross-acceleration event of default if more
    than $100.0 million of other debt is in default and has
    been accelerated by the lenders. If VF fails in the performance

the banks may terminate their obligation to lend, and any bank

    covenants, and the entire amount of the credit agreement was
    available for borrowing, except for $11.6 million related
    to standby letters of credit issued under the agreement on
    behalf of VF.

In addition, certain international subsidiaries, with VF
    Corporation as guarantor, have a €250.0 million
    (U.S. dollar equivalent of $347.2 million at December
    2008) senior international unsecured committed revolving

In the fourth quarter of 2008, management took a number of
    actions to realign VF’s cost structure to protect future
    profitability and to address the uncertainty posed by the
    economic crisis and recession that began in 2008. Costs totaling
    $41.0 million relating to these actions were charged to
    expense as follows: $5.0 million to Cost of Goods Sold and
    $36.0 million to Marketing, Administrative and General. Of
    the total, $35.1 million related to severance and benefits,
    and $5.9 million related to asset write-downs and lease
    exit costs. There was $40.1 million remaining to be paid at
    the end of December 2008, primarily in Compensation above, and
    substantially all amounts will be paid in cash during 2009.

All notes, along with any amounts outstanding under the domestic
    bank credit agreement and the international bank credit
    agreement (Note J), rank equally as senior obligations of
    VF. All notes contain customary covenants and events of default,
    including limitations on liens and sale-leaseback transactions
    and a cross-acceleration event of default. The
    cross-acceleration provision of the 2010 and 2033 notes is
    triggered if more than $50.0 million of other debt is in
    default and has been accelerated by the lenders. For the 2017
    and 2037 notes, the cross-acceleration trigger is
    $100.0 million. If VF fails in the performance of any
    covenant under the indenture that governs the respective notes,
    the trustee or lenders may declare the principal due and payable
    immediately. At the end of 2008, VF was in compliance with all
    covenants. Existing long-term debt agreements do not contain
    acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in
    credit ratings. However, for the 2017 and 2037 notes, if there
    were a change in control of VF and, as a result of the change in
    control, those notes were rated below investment grade by
    recognized rating agencies, then VF would be obligated to
    repurchase those notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount
    of notes repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. VF
    may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to
    (i) 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest to
    the redemption date, and (ii) a premium for any excess of
    the U.S. Treasury rate over the stated rate for the notes,
    plus an additional 20 basis points for the 2017 notes and
    25 basis points for the 2037 notes.

The 6.00% notes, having a principal balance of
    $300.0 million, are recorded net of unamortized original
    issue discount. Interest Expense on these notes is recorded at
    an effective annual interest rate of 6.19%, including
    amortization of the original issue discount, deferred gain on an
    interest rate hedging contract (Note U) and debt
    issuance costs.

Capital leases and other included capital lease obligations of
    $40.0 million at the end of 2008 and $43.3 million at
    the end of 2007 at an effective interest rate of 5.1%.

VF has several retirement and savings benefit plans covering
    eligible employees. VF retains the right to amend any aspect of
    the plans, or to curtail or discontinue any of the plans,
    subject to local regulations.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans:

VF sponsors a
    noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering
    most full-time domestic employees initially employed before
    2005. For employees covered by this plan, VF also sponsors an
    unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan that provides
    benefits that exceed limitations imposed by income tax
    regulations. These defined benefit plans provide pension
    benefits based on compensation levels and years of service. The

Differences between actual results and amounts estimated using
    actuarial assumptions are deferred and amortized as a component
    of future years’ pension expense. These unrecognized
    actuarial gains and losses are amortized to pension expense as
    follows: amounts totaling less than 10% of the lower of plan
    assets or projected benefit obligations are not amortized;
    amounts totaling 10% to 20% of projected benefit obligations are
    amortized over the expected average remaining service of active
    participants; and amounts in excess of 20% of projected benefit
    obligations at the beginning of the year are amortized over five
    years. Under Statement 158, deferred actuarial losses and
    deferred prior service costs are recorded in Accumulated Other
    Comprehensive Income (Loss). The estimated amounts of
    Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to be amortized to
    pension expense in 2009 are as follows: deferred actuarial
    losses — $60.5 million and deferred prior service
    costs — $2.7 million.

Management’s investment strategy is to invest the
    plan’s assets in a diversified portfolio of domestic and
    international equity, corporate and governmental fixed income
    and real estate securities to provide long-term growth in plan
    assets at an acceptable level of risk. This strategy, the
    resulting allocation of plan assets and the selection of
    independent investment managers are reviewed periodically. There
    are no investments in VF debt or equity securities. The
    plan’s exposure to investments affected by the credit
    market crisis is not significant.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was based
    on the weighted average of the expected returns for the major
    asset classes in which the plan invests. Expected returns by
    asset class were developed through analysis of historical market
    returns, current market conditions, inflation expectations and
    other economic factors. The actual allocations by asset class at
    the latest measurement dates, and the target allocation for
    2009, are as follows:

VF makes contributions to the qualified pension plan sufficient
    to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable laws, plus
    discretionary amounts as considered prudent. VF is not required
    under applicable regulations, and does not currently intend, to
    make a contribution to the qualified pension plan during 2009
    but does intend to make contributions totaling $9.4 million
    to fund payments under the nonqualified pension plan. The
    plans’ estimated future benefit payments, including
    benefits attributable to estimated future employee service, are
    approximately $54.5 million in 2009, $56.6 million in
    2010, $59.9 million in 2011, $63.7 million in 2012,
    $67.0 million in 2013 and $384.7 million for the years
    2014 through 2018.

Deferred Compensation Plans:

VF sponsors a
    nonqualified retirement savings plan for employees whose
    contributions to a tax qualified 401(k) plan would be limited by
    provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan allows
    participants to defer receipt of a portion of their salary and
    incentive compensation and to receive matching contributions for
    a portion of the deferred amounts. Expense under this plan was
    $4.4 million in 2008, $4.3 million in 2007 and
    $4.1 million in 2006. Participants earn a return on their
    deferred compensation based on investment earnings of
    participant-selected mutual funds and VF Common Stock. Changes
    in the market value of the participants’ investment
    selections are recorded as an adjustment to deferred
    compensation liabilities, with an offset to compensation expense
    in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Deferred compensation,
    including accumulated earnings on the participant-directed
    investment selections, is distributable in cash at
    participant-specified dates or upon retirement, death,
    disability or termination of employment. Similarly, under a
    separate nonqualified plan, nonemployee members of the Board of
    Directors may elect to defer their Board compensation and invest
    it in VF Common Stock equivalents. At December 2008, VF’s
    liability to participants of the deferred compensation plans was
    $178.8 million, of which $22.3 million expected to be
    paid in 2009 was recorded in Accrued Liabilities
    (Note K) and $156.5 million expected to be paid
    beyond one year was recorded in Other Liabilities (Note M).

VF has purchased (i) specific mutual funds and VF Common
    Stock in the same amounts as the participant-directed investment
    selections underlying the deferred compensation liabilities and
    (ii) variable life insurance contracts that, in turn,
    invest in mutual funds that are substantially the same as other
    participant-directed investment selections. These investment
    securities and earnings thereon, held in an irrevocable trust,
    are intended to provide (i) a source of funds to meet the
    deferred compensation obligations, subject to claims of
    creditors in the event of VF’s insolvency, and (ii) an
    economic hedge of the financial impact of changes in deferred
    compensation liabilities based on changes in market value of the
    participant-selected investments underlying the liabilities. The
    mutual funds and life insurance investments are recorded at fair
    value. At December 2008, the fair value of the mutual fund and
    life insurance investments was $175.0 million, of which
    $22.3 million expected to be liquidated to fund payments to
    participants in 2009 was recorded in Other Current Assets and
    $152.7 million was recorded in Other Assets (Note I).
    The VF Common Stock purchased to match participant-directed
    investment selections is treated for financial reporting
    purposes as treasury stock (Note O), which is the primary
    reason for the difference in carrying value of the investment
    securities and the recorded deferred compensation liabilities.
    Realized and unrealized gains and losses on the mutual fund and
    life insurance investments (other than VF Common Stock) are
    recorded in compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements
    of Income and substantially offset losses and gains resulting
    from changes in deferred compensation liabilities to
    participants.

Other Retirement and Savings Plans:

VF also
    sponsors defined contribution retirement and savings plans. For
    domestic employees not covered by VF’s defined benefit
    plans or a collective bargaining agreement, VF contributes a
    specified percentage of an employee’s gross earnings to a
    qualified retirement plan. VF also sponsors 401(k) and other
    retirement and savings plans for certain domestic and foreign
    employees where cash contributions are based on a specified
    percentage of employee contributions. Expense for these plans
    totaled $14.5 million in 2008, $14.2 million in 2007
    and $12.8 million in 2006.

outstanding is net of shares held in

    treasury shares at the end of 2008, 10,042,686 treasury shares
    at the end of 2007 and 5,775,810 at the end of 2006. The excess
    of the cost of treasury shares acquired over the $1 per share
    stated value of Common Stock is deducted from Retained Earnings.
    In addition, 261,092 shares of VF Common Stock at the end
    of 2008, 284,103 shares at the end of 2007 and
    261,458 shares at the end of 2006 were held in trust for
    deferred compensation plans (Note N). These shares held for
    deferred compensation plans are treated for financial reporting
    purposes as treasury shares at a cost of $10.8 million,
    $11.8 million and $9.8 million at the end of 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

Note P —
    Stock-based Compensation

VF may grant nonqualified stock options, restricted stock units
    (“RSUs”) and restricted stock to officers and key
    employees and also to nonemployee members of VF’s Board of
    Directors under the amended and restated 1996 Stock Compensation
    Plan approved by stockholders. All stock-based compensation
    awards are classified as equity awards, which are accounted for
    in Common Stockholders’ Equity in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. Compensation cost for all awards expected to vest is
    recognized over the shorter of the requisite service period or
    the vesting period. Awards that do not vest are forfeited.
    Compensation cost for stock option awards, which vest in equal
    annual installments over three years of continuous service, is
    recognized during each individual vesting period. Income tax
    benefits associated with stock option awards are computed under
    the short form method. Total compensation cost and the related
    income tax benefits for those awards recognized in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income were $31.6 million and
    $11.6 million for 2008, $62.4 million and
    $23.0 million for 2007 and $46.4 million and
    $17.1 million for 2006, respectively. Stock-based
    compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory was
    $0.4 million at December 2008 and $0.5 million at
    December 2007. At the end of 2008, there was $23.1 million
    of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested
    stock-based compensation arrangements, of which
    $15.1 million, $5.8 million, $1.5 million and
    $0.4 million are expected to be recognized in 2009, 2010,
    2011 and 2012, respectively.

At the end of 2008, there were 7,108,954 shares available
    for future grants of stock options and stock awards under the
    1996 Stock Compensation Plan. VF has a practice of repurchasing
    shares of Common Stock in the open market to offset, on a
    long-term basis, dilution caused by awards under equity
    compensation plans.

Stock Options:

Stock options are granted at a
    price equal to the average of the high and low price of VF
    Common Stock on the date of grant and expire ten years after the
    date of grant. The fair value on the date of grant of each
    option award is calculated using a lattice option-pricing
    valuation model, which incorporates a range of

Volatility is the measure of change in the market price of VF
    Common Stock from period to period. Expected volatility over the
    contractual term of an option was based on a combination of the
    implied volatility from publicly traded options on VF Common
    Stock and the historical volatility of VF Common Stock. The
    expected term represents the period of time that options granted
    are expected to be outstanding before exercise. VF used
    historical data to estimate both voluntary and involuntary
    option exercise behaviors and to estimate the number of options
    that would not vest. Groups of employees that have historically
    exhibited similar option exercise behaviors were considered
    separately in estimating the expected term. Dividend yield
    represents expected dividends on VF Common Stock for the
    contractual life of the options. Risk-free interest rates for
    the periods during the contractual life of the option were the
    implied yields at the date of grant from the U.S. Treasury
    zero coupon yield curve.

    stock options exercised during 2008 was $57.4 million,
    during 2007 was $53.3 million and during 2006 was
    $74.9 million.

Restricted Stock Units:

VF has granted
    performance-based RSUs and nonperformance-based RSUs to key
    employees as a long-term incentive. For performance-based RSUs,
    participants are eligible to receive shares of VF Common Stock
    at the end of a three year performance period. Each RSU has a
    potential final value ranging from zero to two shares of VF
    Common Stock. The number of shares earned by participants, if
    any, is based on achievement of performance goals for
    profitability and revenue growth set by the Compensation
    Committee of the Board of Directors. Shares are issued to
    participants in the year following the end of each three year
    performance period. For nonperformance-based RSUs, each RSU
    entitles the holder to one share of VF Common Stock. These RSUs
    vest generally four years after grant. Dividend equivalents,
    payable in additional shares of VF Common Stock, accrue without
    compounding on the two types of RSUs.

The grant date fair value of each performance-based RSU granted
    during 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $78.02, $77.00 and $55.32,
    respectively, which was equal to the market value of the
    underlying VF Common Stock. The total value of awards
    outstanding at the end of 2008 was $50.7 million. Awards
    earned and vested for the three year performance period ended in
    2008 and distributable in early 2009 totaled 363,990 shares
    of VF Common Stock having a value of $20.9 million, subject
    to final confirmation approval of the Compensation Committee of
    the Board of Directors. Similarly, 420,536 shares of VF
    Common Stock with a value of $32.8 million were earned for
    the performance period ended in 2007, and 405,696 shares of
    VF Common Stock with a value of $31.2 million were earned
    for the performance period ended in 2006.

The grant date fair value of each nonperformance-based RSU
    granted during 2007 and 2006 was $80.08 and $75.97,
    respectively, which was equal to the market value of the
    underlying VF Common Stock. The total value of awards
    outstanding at the end of 2008 was $2.5 million.

Certain participants have elected to defer receipt of shares
    earned upon vesting. Dividend equivalents, payable in additional
    shares, accrue on deferred shares. A total of
    103,336 shares of Common Stock are issuable in future years
    for such deferrals.

Restricted Stock:

VF has granted restricted
    shares of VF Common Stock to certain members of management. The
    fair value of the restricted shares at the grant date was the
    market value of VF Common Stock. Dividends are payable in
    additional restricted shares at the time the restricted share
    grants vest, generally four years after grant.

As of the end of 2008, VF has not provided deferred
    U.S. income taxes on $645.6 million of undistributed
    earnings of international subsidiaries where the earnings are
    considered to be permanently invested. The undistributed
    earnings would become taxable in the United States if management
    decided to repatriate earnings for business, tax or foreign
    exchange reasons. If this were the case, U.S. income taxes
    would be provided net of foreign taxes already paid.

VF has been granted a lower effective income tax rate on taxable
    earnings in one foreign subsidiary based on meeting certain
    increased investment and employment level requirements. This
    lower rate, when compared with the country’s statutory
    rate, resulted in an income tax reduction of $12.6 million
    ($0.11 per diluted share) in 2008, $15.4 million ($0.14 per
    share) in 2007 and $13.6 million ($0.12 per share) in 2006.
    The tax status providing this benefit expires at the end of
    2009. During 2008, VF entered into a new agreement with the tax
    authorities of that country that will result in a slightly
    higher effective income tax rate on taxable income in that
    subsidiary for 2010 through 2014.

VF has potential tax benefits totaling $58.3 million for
    foreign operating loss carryforwards, of which
    $44.5 million have an unlimited carryforward life. In
    addition, there are $33.7 million of potential tax benefits
    for federal operating loss carryforwards that expire between
    2017 and 2027 and $8.2 million of benefits for state
    operating loss carryforwards that

F-33

VF
    CORPORATION

    Statements — (Continued)

expire between 2009 and 2028. Some of the foreign and
    substantially all of the federal and state operating loss
    carryforward amounts relate to acquired companies for periods
    prior to their acquisition by VF. A valuation allowance has been
    provided where it is more likely than not that the deferred tax
    assets related to those operating loss carryforwards will not be
    realized. Valuation allowances totaled $55.2 million for
    available foreign carryforwards, $13.3 million for
    available federal carryforwards and $5.5 million for
    available state carryforwards. During 2008, VF had a net
    reduction in valuation allowances of $13.7 million related
    to foreign carryforwards, $5.8 million related to federal
    carryforwards, $4.0 million related to state carryforwards
    and $12.3 million related to foreign currency translation
    effects. In addition, VF has potential tax benefits totaling
    $32.9 million for federal capital loss carryforwards at the
    end of 2008. Included in this amount is $19.4 million
    related to discontinued operations sold in 2007 (Note C),
    upon which a full valuation allowance was provided. Of the
    remaining amount, $10.1 million will be realized in cash
    upon settlement of Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
    examinations.

Included in unrecognized tax benefits are $56.8 million in
    2008 and $81.8 million in 2007 of tax benefits that, if
    recognized, would reduce our annual effective tax rate. VF
    recognizes accrued interest and penalties, as appropriate,
    related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax
    provision. VF had a net reduction of $3.6 million in the
    income tax provision in 2008 for accrued interest and penalties,
    net of income tax benefit, related to these unrecognized tax
    benefits and a net increase of $0.6 million in 2007 for
    interest and penalties, net of income tax benefit.

VF files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as
    well as separate and combined income tax returns in numerous
    state and foreign jurisdictions. In the United States, IRS
    examinations for tax years 2002 and 2003 were settled in 2008,
    and the IRS commenced an examination of tax years 2004, 2005 and
    2006. In the United Kingdom, Inland Revenue examinations for
    certain subsidiaries for tax years 2001 to 2006 were settled in
    2008. Tax years 1998 to 2002 are under examination by the State
    of North Carolina, and tax years 2003 to 2005 are under
    examination by the State of Alabama. In addition, the State of
    California has indicated its intent to examine tax year 2006. VF
    is also currently subject to examination by various other taxing
    authorities. Management believes that some of these audits and
    negotiations will conclude during the next 12 months.
    During 2009, management believes that it is reasonably possible
    that the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits may decrease
    by $9.1 million due to settlement of audits and expiration
    of statutes of limitations, which includes $4 million that
    would reduce income tax expense.

Note R —
    Segment Information

For internal management and reporting purposes, VF’s
    businesses are grouped principally by product categories, and by
    brands within those product categories. These groupings of
    businesses are referred to as “coalitions.” These
    coalitions represent VF’s reportable segments, as described
    below:

•

Outdoor and Action Sports

— Outerwear, action
    sports apparel and footwear, daypacks and bags, and technical
    equipment

•

Jeanswear

— Jeanswear and related products

•

Imagewear

— Occupational apparel and licensed
    apparel

•

Sportswear

— Fashion sportswear

•

Contemporary Brands

— Premium lifestyle apparel

•

Other

— Primarily VF Outlets

Operating results of Lee Spain are included in the Jeanswear
    Coalition, and the equity in net income of Mo Industries is
    included in the Contemporary Brands Coalition since their
    respective dates of acquisition or investment in 2008.

Management at each of the coalitions has direct control over and
    responsibility for its revenues, operating income and assets,
    hereinafter termed “Coalition Revenues,”
    “Coalition Profit” and “Coalition Assets,”
    respectively. VF management evaluates operating performance and
    makes investment and other decisions based on Coalition Revenues
    and Coalition Profit. Accounting policies used for internal
    management reporting at the individual coalitions are consistent
    with those in Note A, except as stated below and except
    that inventories are valued on a FIFO basis. Common costs such
    as information systems processing, retirement benefits and
    insurance are allocated to the coalitions based on appropriate
    metrics such as usage or employment.

Corporate costs, other than costs directly related to the
    coalitions, and net interest expense are not controlled by
    coalition management and are therefore excluded from the
    Coalition Profit performance measure used for internal
    management reporting. These items are separately presented in
    the reconciliation of Coalition Profit to Income from Continuing
    Operations Before Income Taxes.

Corporate and Other Expenses (presented separately in the
    following table) consists of corporate headquarters expenses
    that are not allocated to the coalitions (including compensation
    and benefits of corporate management and staff, certain legal
    and professional fees, and administrative and general) and other
    expenses related to but not allocated to the coalitions for
    internal management reporting (including development costs for
    management

information systems, costs of maintaining and enforcing certain
    of VF’s trademarks, adjustments for the LIFO method of
    inventory valuation and miscellaneous consolidating adjustments).

Coalition Assets, for internal management purposes, are those
    used directly in or resulting from the operations of each
    business unit, such as accounts receivable, inventories and
    property, plant and equipment. Corporate assets include
    investments held in trust for deferred compensation plans and
    information systems assets.

    Financial Instruments

Fair value is defined in Statement 157 as the price that would
    be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a
    liability (i.e., an exit price) in the principal or most
    advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market
    participants. In determining fair value, Statement 157
    establishes a three-level hierarchy that distinguishes between
    (i) market data obtained or developed from independent
    sources (i.e., observable data inputs) and (ii) a reporting
    entity’s own data and assumptions that market participants
    would use in pricing an asset or liability (i.e., unobservable
    data inputs). Financial assets and financial liabilities
    measured and reported at fair value are classified in one of the
    following categories, in order of priority of observability and
    objectivity of pricing inputs:

•

Level 1

— Fair value based on quoted
    prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2

— Fair value based on significant
    directly observable data (other than Level 1 quoted prices)
    or significant indirectly observable data through corroboration
    with observable market data. Inputs would normally be
    (i) quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or
    liabilities, (ii) quoted prices in inactive markets for
    identical or similar assets or liabilities or
    (iii) information derived from or corroborated by
    observable market data.

•

Level 3

— Fair value based on prices or
    valuation techniques that require significant unobservable data
    inputs. Inputs would normally be a reporting entity’s own
    data and judgments about assumptions that market participants
    would use in pricing the asset or liability.

Cash equivalents measured at fair value above represent funds
    held in institutional money market funds. Investment securities,
    consisting primarily of mutual funds (classified as
    Level 1) and a separately managed fixed income fund
    (classified as Level 2), are purchased to offset a
    substantial portion of participant-directed investment
    selections representing underlying liabilities to participants
    in VF’s deferred compensation plans. Liabilities under
    deferred compensation plans are recorded at amounts payable to
    participants, based on the fair value of participant-directed
    investment selections. Derivative instruments represent net
    unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency forward exchange
    contracts, which is the net difference between (i) the
    U.S. dollars to be received or paid at the contracts’
    settlement date and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the
    foreign currency to be sold or purchased at the current forward
    exchange rate.

The fair value of VF’s long-term debt, including the
    current portion, was approximately $1,027.4 million at the
    end of 2008, compared with its carrying value of
    $1,144.9 million, and was $1,137.5 million at the end
    of 2007, compared with its carrying value of
    $1,148.6 million. Fair value was estimated based on quoted
    market prices or values of comparable borrowings. The carrying
    amounts of VF’s other financial assets and liabilities not
    disclosed above, principally cash and other cash equivalents,
    accounts receivable, life insurance contracts and short-term
    borrowings, approximated their fair value.

VF monitors net foreign currency exposures and may enter into
    foreign currency forward exchange contracts. These contracts
    hedge against the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on
    anticipated cash flows relating to a portion of VF’s
    foreign currency cash flows for inventory purchases and
    production costs, product sales and intercompany royalty
    payments anticipated for the following 12 months. Other
    contracts hedge against the effects of exchange rate
    fluctuations on specific foreign currency transactions,
    primarily intercompany financing arrangements. Use of hedging
    contracts allows VF to reduce its overall exposure to exchange
    rate movements since gains and losses on these contracts will
    offset losses and gains on the transactions being hedged. All
    foreign currency contracts are reviewed on a regular basis to
    ensure that each contract is effective in hedging the intended
    exposure. The counterparties to these contracts consist of a
    diverse group of financial institutions. VF continually monitors
    its hedging positions and the credit ratings of its
    counterparties and adjusts hedging positions as appropriate. At
    the end of 2008, VF did not have significant exposure to any
    individual counterparty.

The following summarizes, by currency, the contractual amounts
    of VF’s foreign currency forward exchange contracts,
    translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at the
    reporting date. The “bought” amounts represent the
    net U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to purchase
    foreign currencies, and the “sold” amounts represent
    the net U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to sell
    foreign currencies. The contracts, all of which mature in less

For foreign currency hedging contracts that have settled, VF
    recognized net pretax losses of $13.0 million and
    $8.9 million during 2008 and 2007, respectively, and gains
    of $1.7 million during 2006, primarily in Cost of Goods
    Sold in the Consolidated Statements of Income. At the end of
    2008, net pretax losses of $0.2 million were deferred in
    Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). These net
    deferred losses will be reclassified into Net Income during 2009
    at the time the underlying hedged transactions are recognized in
    earnings. Hedge ineffectiveness was not significant in any
    period.

VF may also enter into derivative financial instrument contracts
    to hedge interest rate risks. VF entered into a contract to
    hedge the interest rate risk for a notional amount of
    $150.0 million shortly before the issuance of
    $300.0 million of long-term debt in 2003. This contract was
    settled concurrent with the issuance of the debt, with the gain
    of $3.5 million deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive
    Income (Loss). As a result of the deferred gain, VF recognized
    $0.1 million during each of 2008, 2007 and 2006 as a
    reduction of Interest Expense. At the end of 2008, a pretax gain
    of $2.9 million was deferred in Accumulated Other
    Comprehensive Income (Loss), which will be reclassified into
    earnings over the remaining term of the debt.
