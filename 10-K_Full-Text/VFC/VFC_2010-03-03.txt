PART I

Item 1.

Business.

V.F. Corporation, organized in 1899, is a worldwide leader in
    branded lifestyle apparel and related products. Unless the
    context indicates otherwise, the terms “VF,”
    “we,” “us” and “our” used herein
    refer to V.F. Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. Our
    stated vision is: VF will grow by building lifestyle brands that
    excite consumers around the world.

For over 100 years, VF has grown by offering consumers high
    quality, high value branded apparel and related products. In
    recent years, we have been implementing a growth plan that is
    transforming VF’s mix of business to include more lifestyle
    brands. Lifestyle brands are those brands that connect closely
    with consumers because they are aspirational and inspirational;
    they reflect consumers’ specific activities and interests.
    Lifestyle brands generally extend across multiple product
    categories and have higher than average gross margins.
    Accordingly, this transformation has included the acquisitions
    of growing lifestyle brands, such as

Vans

®

,

Reef

®

,

Kipling

®

,

Napapijri

®

,

7 For All
    Mankind

®

,

Splendid

®

and

Ella
    Moss

®

.

    At the same time, we have continued to invest in our other
    businesses through product line extensions, geographic expansion
    particularly in Asia, new retail store openings, product
    innovation, consumer research and other marketing initiatives.
    In addition, an important step in VF’s transformation was
    the sale in 2007 of our women’s imtimate apparel business,
    which had over $800 million in revenues but lower profit
    and growth prospects.

VF is a highly diversified apparel company — across
    brands, product categories, channels of distribution and
    geographies. VF owns a broad portfolio of brands in the
    jeanswear, outerwear, packs, footwear, sportswear and
    occupational apparel categories. These products are marketed to
    consumers shopping in specialty stores, upscale and traditional
    department stores, national chains and mass merchants. A growing
    portion of our revenues, currently 17%, are derived from sales
    directly to consumers through VF-operated retail stores and
    internet sites. A global company, VF derives 30% of its revenues
    from outside the United States, primarily in Europe, Asia,
    Canada and Latin America. VF products are also sold in some
    countries through licensees and distributors. To provide many
    types of products across numerous channels of distribution in
    different geographic areas, we balance efficient and flexible
    internally-owned manufacturing with sourcing of finished goods
    from independent contractors. We utilize

state-of-the-art

technologies for inventory replenishment that enable us to get
    consumer-right products, on time, to our customers’ shelves.

VF’s businesses are organized primarily into product
    categories, and by brands within those categories, for both
    management and internal financial reporting purposes. These
    groupings of businesses are called “coalitions” and
    consist of the following: Outdoor & Action Sports,
    Jeanswear, Imagewear, Sportswear and Contemporary Brands. These
    coalitions are our reportable segments for financial reporting
    purposes. Coalition management has responsibility to build their
    brands, with certain financial, administrative and systems
    support and disciplines provided by consolidated functions
    within VF.

We consider our Outdoor & Action Sports, Sportswear
    and Contemporary Brands coalitions to be our lifestyle
    coalitions, with the potential to achieve higher long-term
    revenue and profit growth than our other businesses. Our
    Jeanswear and Imagewear coalitions are our heritage businesses
    where our focus is on maintaining our historically strong levels
    of profitability and cash flows but with lower revenue growth.

    licensed brands by coalition:

Outdoor &
    Action Sports Coalition

Our Outdoor & Action Sports Coalition, VF’s
    fastest growing business, is a group of outdoor and
    activity-based businesses that represent a collection of
    lifestyle brands. Product offerings include outerwear,
    sportswear, footwear, equipment, backpacks, daypacks, luggage
    and accessories.

The North
    Face

®

is our largest Outdoor & Action Sports Coalition
    brand. Its high performance outdoor apparel, equipment and
    footwear are sold across North and South America, Europe and
    Asia. (In Japan and South Korea,

The North
    Face

®

trademarks are owned by a third party.)

The North
    Face

®

apparel lines consist of outerwear, snow sports gear and
    functional sportswear and footwear for men, women and children.
    Its equipment line consists of tents, sleeping bags, backpacks,
    daypacks and accessories. Many of

The North
    Face

®

products are


designed for extreme applications, such as high altitude
    mountaineering and ice and rock climbing, although many
    consumers also purchase these products because they represent a
    lifestyle to which they aspire.

The North
    Face

®

products are marketed through specialty outdoor and premium
    sporting goods stores in the United States, Canada, Europe and
    Asia and select department stores in the United States. In
    addition, these products are sold through over 50 VF-operated
    full price retail and outlet stores in the United States and
    Europe and online at www.thenorthface.com. The brand is also
    sold through over 250

The North
    Face

®

retail stores operated by independent third parties dedicated to
    selling

The North
    Face

®

products in Europe and Asia.

VF manufactures and markets

Vans

®

performance and casual footwear and apparel for skateboard,
    bicycle motocross (“BMX”), surf and snow sports
    participants and enthusiasts. Products are sold on a wholesale
    basis through national chain stores in the United States and
    through skate and surf shops and specialty stores in the United
    States, Canada, Europe and Asia. The brand’s products are
    also sold through over 200 owned

Vans

®

full-price retail and outlet stores primarily in the western
    United States and in key European markets. These retail stores
    carry a wide variety of

Vans

®

footwear, along with a growing assortment of apparel and
    accessory items, most of which bear the

Vans

®

trademarks. The

Vans

®

brand is marketed through a 50%-owned joint venture in Mexico.
    The

Vans

®

brand has been recognized as part of “

The
    Facebook

®

50,

” a ranking of brands developed by

Slate

magazine’s

The Big Money

website that are making
    the best use of the social networking site,

Facebook

.

    VF is the 70% owner of the

Vans Warped
    Tour

®

music festival, which presents over 50 alternative rock and
    heavy metal bands in performances in over 40 cities across
    North America each summer.

JanSport

®

backpacks, duffel bags, luggage and accessories are sold through
    department, office supply and national chain stores, as well as
    sports specialty stores and college bookstores in the United
    States.

JanSport

®

daypacks have a leading market share in the United States. A
    technical line of

JanSport

®

backpacks is sold through outdoor and sporting goods stores.

JanSport

®

fleece and T-shirts imprinted with college logos are sold
    through college bookstores and department stores in the United
    States. In Europe,

Eastpak

®

and

JanSport

®

backpacks and a line of

Eastpak

®

clothing are sold primarily through department and specialty
    stores, where the

Eastpak

®

brand is the leading backpack brand. The

JanSport

®

and

Eastpak

®

brands are also marketed throughout Asia by licensees and
    distributors.

Eagle
    Creek

®

adventure travel gear products include luggage, daypacks and
    accessories sold through specialty luggage stores, outdoor
    stores and department stores throughout the United States and
    Europe.

Derived from the Finnish word for Arctic Circle, the

Napapijri

®

brand offers premium-priced performance skiwear and
    outdoor-inspired casual outerwear, sportswear and accessories
    for men, women and children. The

Napapijri

®

brand enjoys especially strong consumer awareness in Italy,
    where it was created, and is expanding across Europe. Products
    are sold on a wholesale basis primarily to European specialty
    shops, such as sport stores and fashion boutiques, and through
    VF-operated and independently-operated retail stores in several
    countries in Europe. The

Napapijri

®

brand is marketed through a majority-owned joint venture in
    Japan.

Kipling

®

handbags, shoulder bags, backpacks, luggage and accessories are
    stylish, colorful and fun products that are both practical and
    durable. The brand name comes from the author of

The Jungle
    Book

, Rudyard Kipling, and that provides the connection to
    the

Kipling

®

monkey mascot, which symbolizes fun and adventure. A colorful
    monkey key ring is attached to every bag, with a different
    monkey design for each product collection. Products are sold
    through specialty and department stores in Europe, Asia and
    South America, as well as through over 30 VF-operated and over
    175 independently-operated retail stores. The

Kipling

®

business in North America is managed as part of the Sportswear
    Coalition.

The

Reef

®

brand of surf-inspired products includes sandals, shoes,
    swimwear and other casual apparel and accessories for men, women
    and children. Products are marketed primarily to surf shops,
    sporting goods and specialty chains, and department stores in
    the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. In recent years, we
    have expanded the

Reef

®

brand’s presence by acquiring rights previously held by
    independent distributors to market

Reef

®

products in Europe and Canada.

We expect continued long-term growth in our Outdoor &
    Action Sports Coalition as we extend our brands into new product
    categories, open additional retail stores, expand geographically
    and acquire additional outdoor or activity-based lifestyle
    brands. Also, beginning in 2010, responsibility for the

lucy

®

brand has been moved to this Coalition. Specifically, management
    of the

The North
    Face

®

and

lucy

®

business units will work closely together to better leverage
    VF’s activity-based product development and retail
    operations experience.


Jeanswear
    Coalition

Our Jeanswear Coalition markets jeanswear and related casual
    products in the United States and in many international markets.
    The largest of these brands, the

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

brands, have long-standing traditions as authentic American
    jeans brands as they were established in 1889 and 1947,
    respectively, and have strong market positions.

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

products are sold in nearly every developed country. Products
    also include shorts, casual pants, knit and woven tops and
    outerwear, which are designed to complement the jeanswear
    products and have helped to extend our brands.

In domestic markets,

Lee

®

products are sold primarily through national chain stores and
    specialty stores.

Wrangler

®

westernwear is marketed through western specialty stores. The

Wrangler
    Hero

®

,

Rustler

®

and

Riders

®

brands are marketed to mass merchant and regional discount
    stores. Based on available data, we believe our key brands have
    been gaining market share despite significant competitive
    activity. Including all of its jeanswear brands, we believe that
    VF has the largest unit market share of jeans in the United
    States and is one of the largest marketers of jeans in the
    world. We also market cotton casual pants under the

Lee
    Casuals

®

,

Timber Creek by
    Wrangler

®

and

Wrangler

®

Khakis brands.

Our vendor-managed inventory and retail floor space management
    programs with several of our major retailer customers give us a
    competitive advantage in our domestic jeanswear business. We
    receive

point-of-sale

information from these customers on a daily basis, on an
    individual store and style-size-color stockkeeping unit
    (“SKU”) level. We then ship products based on that
    customer data to ensure their selling floors are appropriately
    stocked with products that match their shoppers’ needs. Our
    systems capabilities allow us to analyze our retail
    customer’s sales, demographic and geographic data to
    develop product assortment recommendations that maximize the
    productivity of their jeanswear selling space and minimize their
    investment in inventory.

Jeanswear in most international markets is more fashion-oriented
    and has a higher selling price than similar products in the
    United States. The jeans market internationally is also more
    fragmented than in the United States, with competitors ranging
    from global brands to a number of smaller brands marketed in a
    specific country or region.

VF’s largest international jeanswear business is located in
    Western Europe.

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

jeanswear products are sold through department stores and
    specialty stores where we employ some of the same retail floor
    space management programs described above. We also market

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

products to mass market and specialty stores in Canada and
    Mexico, as well as to department stores and specialty stores in
    Asia and South America. In many international markets, we are
    expanding our reach through VF-operated retail stores, which are
    an important vehicle for presenting our brands’ image and
    marketing message directly to consumers. We are continuing to
    expand our jeanswear brands in emerging markets, such as China
    and through our majority-owned joint venture in India. In
    foreign markets where VF does not have owned operations,

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

jeanswear and related products are marketed through
    distributors, agents or licensees.

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

products are sold in over 500 independently operated mostly
    monobrand retail stores, primarily in Eastern Europe and Asia.

In the United States, we believe our Jeanswear Coalition is
    growing its jeans market share in the mass market and national
    chain channels of distribution through superior consumer insight
    and marketing strategies and continuous product innovation. In
    our international businesses, growth will be driven by expansion
    of our existing business in Asia where we have averaged in
    excess of 25% growth per year over the last three years.

Imagewear
    Coalition

Our Imagewear Coalition consists of the Image division
    (occupational apparel and uniforms) and the Licensed Sports
    division (owned and licensed high profile sports and lifestyle
    apparel). Each division represents approximately one-half of
    Coalition revenues.

The Image division provides uniforms and career occupational
    apparel for workers in North America and internationally,
    primarily in Europe, under the

Red
    Kap

®

brand (a premium workwear brand with more than 75 years of
    history), the

Bulwark

®

brand (flame resistant and protective apparel primarily for the
    petrochemical, utility and mining industries), the

The
    Force

®

brand (apparel for law enforcement and public safety personnel)
    and the

Chef
    Designs

tm

brand (apparel for restaurant and food service staff). Products
    include work pants, slacks, work shirts, overalls, jackets and
    smocks. Image division revenues are significantly affected by
    the overall level of U.S. industrial and service
    employment, which has been declining for the last two years.
    Approximately two-thirds


of Image division sales are to industrial laundries, resellers
    and distributors that in turn supply customized workwear to
    employers for

on-the-job

wear by production, service and white-collar personnel. Since
    industrial laundries and uniform distributors maintain minimal
    inventories of work clothes, VF’s ability to offer rapid
    delivery of products in a broad range of sizes is an important
    factor in this market. Our commitment to customer service,
    supported by an automated central distribution center with
    several satellite locations, enables customer orders to be
    filled within 24 to 48 hours of receipt and has helped the

Red
    Kap

®

and

Bulwark

®

brands obtain a significant share of uniform apparel sold to
    laundries, resellers and other distributors.

The Image division also develops and manages uniform programs
    through custom-designed websites for major business customers
    (e.g., FedEx Corporation, AT&T, Air Canada, Continental
    Airlines and American Airlines) and governmental organizations
    (e.g., U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Fire Department
    of New York City, Transportation Security Administration,
    National Park Service and New York City Transit Authority).
    These websites give employees of these customers the convenience
    of shopping for their work and career apparel via the internet.
    This division is the nation’s largest supplier of
    nonmilitary apparel to the U.S. government.

In the Licensed Sports division, we design and market sports
    apparel and fanwear under licenses granted by the major sports
    leagues, individual athletes and related organizations,
    including Major League Baseball, the National Football League,
    the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League,
    NASCAR, MLB Players Association, and many major colleges and
    universities. Under license from Major League Baseball,

Majestic

®

brand uniforms are worn exclusively on-field by all 30 major
    league teams.

Majestic

®

brand adult and youth-size authentic, replica jersey and casual
    fanwear are sold through sporting goods and athletic specialty
    stores, department stores and major league stadiums. Adult and
    youth sports apparel products marketed under other licensed
    labels are distributed through department, mass market, sporting
    goods and athletic specialty stores. In addition, the Licensed
    Sports division is a major supplier of licensed

Harley-Davidson

®

apparel marketed to Harley-Davidson dealerships. With the
    exception of the Major League Baseball license, loss of any
    license would not have a material effect on the Imagewear
    Coalition.

The opportunities to grow our Imagewear Coalition revenues
    include (i) extension of its product and service
    capabilities into new industrial and service apparel markets,
    (ii) growth of its

Majestic

®

brand for Major League Baseball and growth of our National
    Football League business through rights for additional apparel
    categories and new channels of distribution, (iii) market
    share gains in key licensed categories and (iv) extension
    of VF’s floor space management and replenishment
    capabilities to more retail doors, placing product-right
    assortments on the sales floor in each geographic market.

Sportswear
    Coalition

The

Nautica

®

brand is the principal lifestyle brand of the Sportswear
    Coalition.

Nautica

®

men’s sportswear, noted for its classic styling, is
    marketed through department stores and VF-operated outlet stores
    in better outlet centers. The

Nautica Jeans
    Company

®

line features fashionable jeanswear and related tops for younger
    male consumers. We believe the

Nautica

®

brand is the number two men’s sportswear collection brand
    in department stores. This retail channel has undergone
    significant consolidation in the last few years, resulting in
    numerous store closings, which has negatively impacted sales of

Nautica

®

brand products. Other

Nautica

®

product lines include men’s outerwear, underwear and
    swimwear and men’s and women’s sleepwear.

Nautica

®

women’s sportswear is marketed in the United States at most

Nautica

®

outlet stores and at www.nautica.com.

The Sportswear Coalition operates over 100

Nautica

®

retail outlet stores in better outlet malls across the United
    States. These stores carry

Nautica

®

merchandise for men, women, boys, girls and infants. The product
    styles sold in the outlet stores are different from the

Nautica

®

styles sold to department and specialty store wholesale
    customers. These outlet stores also carry

Nautica

®

merchandise from licensees to complete their product assortment.
    In addition, independent licensees operate over 150

Nautica

®

brand retail stores across the world.

The

Nautica

®

brand is licensed to independent parties in the United States
    for apparel categories not produced by VF (e.g., tailored
    clothing, dress shirts, neckwear, women’s swimwear,
    children’s clothing, and accessories such as fragrances,
    watches and eyewear) and for nonapparel categories (e.g., bed
    and bath linens and accessories).

Nautica

®

products are licensed for sale in over 60 countries outside the
    United States. Our licensees’ wholesale sales of

Nautica

®

licensed products total approximately $400 million annually.


The Sportswear Coalition also includes the

Kipling

®

business in North America. Products include

Kipling

®

brand handbags, luggage, backpacks, totes and accessories.
    Beginning in 2010,

Kipling

®

handbags and accessories in the department store channel in the
    United States will be sold exclusively through Macy’s
    department stores. In addition, all product categories are sold
    in the United States through specialty luggage and bag stores,
    VF-operated retail stores and www.kipling.com and in Canada
    through specialty and department stores. About two-thirds of
    products sold in the United States are the same as those sold in
    Europe and other parts of the world, with the remainder designed
    for the U.S. market only.

We believe there is potential to improve

Nautica

®

brand revenue and profit performance through more accessible
    price points, store growth in existing

Nautica

®

retail outlet stores, growth in our online business and
    expansion of the licensed business internationally, particularly
    in Asia. There is also potential for expansion of our

Kipling

®

brand through our handbags and accessories relationship with
    Macy’s, Inc.

Contemporary
    Brands Coalition

Our Contemporary Brands Coalition is focused on premium-priced
    lifestyle brands. Formed in August 2007, the coalition was
    originally composed of the

7 For All
    Mankind

®

and

lucy

®

brands. During 2009, the Coalition was expanded to include the

John
    Varvatos

®

    of the other Contemporary Brands businesses, and the

    Mankind

®

is a Los Angeles-based brand of contemporary denim jeans and
    related products — knit and woven tops, sweaters,
    jackets and accessories — for women and men. Products
    are noted for their fit and for innovation in design, fabric and
    finish. We believe the

7 For All
    Mankind

®

brand is the leading premium jeans brand in the United States,
    with the premium segment defined as jeans retailing for $150 or
    more. Retail price points for the brand’s core jeans range
    from $150 - $199 for basics, with higher price points for
    more fashion-forward products. In December 2009,

Advertising
    Age

magazine selected the

7 For All
    Mankind

®

brand as one of its top ten new products of the decade,
    recognizing the brand for introducing premium denim to the
    American market and changing the way that consumers shop for
    jeans. With over two-thirds of its sales in the United States,
    the brand is marketed through premium department stores, such as
    Bloomingdale’s, Macy’s, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and
    Saks, and through specialty stores. In addition, we opened 13
    retail stores in the United States during 2009, bringing the
    total to 28 stores in the United States. Internationally, sales
    are through department stores, such as Harrods, and specialty
    stores, plus several VF-operated retail stores. We are pursuing
    growth opportunities in several areas — additional

direct-to-consumer

expansion through company-operated and partnership retail
    stores,

e-commerce,

additional sportswear product offerings, further geographic
    expansion in Europe and Asia, and licensing.

The

line of tailored clothing, sportswear, footwear and accessories
    is designed to appeal to a younger consumer at somewhat more
    accessible price points. Products are sold through upscale
    department and specialty stores, primarily in the United States,
    several VF-operated

retail locations and online at www.johnvarvatos.com. This
    business is 80% owned by VF, with the balance owned by

In March 2009, VF completed the acquisition of Mo Industries
    Holdings, Inc., owner of the

Splendid

and

Ella

brands of women’s premium sportswear. These brands are
    marketed to upscale department and specialty stores primarily in
    the United States. VF had acquired one-third of the outstanding
    equity of Mo Industries in June 2008. The first

is an authentic activewear brand designed for versatility,
    comfort and fit that can be worn by today’s active woman
    from workout to weekend. The

lucy

retail stores emphasize the brand’s four core types of
    activity-based apparel — yoga, gym, running and
    outdoor adventure. Over 90% of the products in the

lucy

retail stores are

lucy

branded, with most of the balance being complementary VF brands,
    including a limited selection of

The North

apparel. Beginning in 2010, the

lucy

®


business unit will become part of the Outdoor & Action
    Sports Coalition. The

lucy

®

brand shares attributes of our outdoor brands and will benefit
    from shared expertise in technical performance fabrics and
    product innovation.

During 2009, premium apparel sales were severely impacted by the
    recession, with many consumers significantly reducing spending
    for luxury goods, which has led to sharply lower same store
    sales comparisons in the upscale department store channel and
    the closing of a significant number of specialty shops. In 2010,
    we expect to see our Contemporary Brands businesses grow their
    revenues through additional retail and international expansion
    and product line extensions.

Direct-To-Consumer

Operations

VF-operated retail stores are an integral part of our strategy
    for growing VF’s brands, particularly our lifestyle brands.
    Our full price retail stores allow us to showcase a brand’s
    full line of current season products, with fixtures and imagery
    that support the brand’s positioning. These stores provide
    high visibility for our brands and products and enable us to
    stay close to the needs and preferences of consumers. The proper
    presentation of products in our retail stores also helps to
    increase consumer purchases of VF products sold through our
    wholesale customers. VF-operated full price retail stores
    generally provide operating margins that are equal to or above
    VF averages and a return on investment above VF averages. In
    addition, VF operates outlet stores in both upscale outlet malls
    and in more traditional value-based locations. These outlet
    stores serve an important role in our overall inventory
    management by allowing VF to effectively sell a significant
    portion of excess, discontinued and

out-of-season

products at better prices than are otherwise available from
    outside parties, while maintaining the integrity of our brands.

Our growing global retail operations include 757 stores at the
    end of 2009. Of that total, there are 681 monobrand stores
    (i.e., primarily one brand’s products offered in each
    store) that sell

and other products. Approximately three-fourths of these stores
    offer products at full price, with the remainder being outlet
    locations offering excess, discontinued and

out-of-season

products at discounted prices. In addition to the monobrand
    retail and outlet stores, we operate 76 VF Outlet stores across
    the United States that sell a broad selection of excess
    quantities of VF-branded products, as well as women’s
    intimate apparel, childrenswear, other apparel and accessories.
    Approximately three-fourths of the VF-operated retail stores are
    located in the United States. The remaining stores are located
    in Europe, Latin America and Asia.

Across the globe, internet sales (i.e.,

e-commerce)

comprise a small but growing portion of total retail sales of
    apparel, footwear and accessories.

E-commerce

sales of apparel and footwear have become the second largest
    category of

e-commerce

purchases in the United States (behind travel purchases). At VF,

e-commerce

is a growing portion of our revenues as we currently market

and other brands across Europe. Additional

Total retail store and

e-commerce

sales accounted for 17% of VF’s consolidated Total Revenues
    in 2009 and 16% in 2008. We expect our

direct-to-consumer

business to continue to grow at a faster pace than VF’s
    overall growth rate as we continue opening retail stores and
    expanding our

e-commerce

presence for our lifestyle brands. During 2009, we opened 90
    retail stores. For 2010, capital investments of approximately
    $60 million are planned for leasehold improvements,
    fixtures and equipment for approximately

80-90

new
    retail locations, concentrated where we see higher growth
    potential —

and international.

In addition to the

direct-to-consumer

venues operated by VF, our licensees, distributors and other
    independent parties operate over 1,300 primarily monobrand
    retail stores dedicated to our brands. These stores —
    located primarily in Eastern Europe and Asia and focused on

Licensing
    Arrangements

As part of our business strategy of expanding market penetration
    of VF-owned brands, we enter into licensing agreements for our
    brands for specific apparel and complementary product categories
    in identified geographic


regions if such arrangements with independent parties can
    provide more effective manufacturing, distribution and marketing
    of such products than could be achieved internally. These
    licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of VF brands and
    are for fixed terms of generally five years, with conditional
    renewal options. Each licensee pays royalties to VF based on its
    sales of licensed products, with most agreements providing for a
    minimum royalty requirement. Royalties generally range from 5%
    to 7% of the licensing partners’ net sales of licensed
    products. Gross Royalty Income was $77.2 million in 2009,
    with the largest contribution from the

Nautica

®

brand.

In addition, licensees of our brands are generally required to
    spend a specified amount to advertise VF’s products ranging
    from 1% to 5% of their net licensed product sales. In some
    cases, these advertising amounts are remitted to VF for
    advertising on behalf of the licensees. We provide support to
    these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand
    names by taking an active role in the design, quality control,
    advertising, marketing and distribution of licensed products.

VF has also entered into license agreements to use trademarks
    owned by third parties. We market apparel under licenses granted
    by Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the
    National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League,
    Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Inc., NASCAR, major colleges, and
    individual athletes and related organizations, most of which
    contain minimum annual licensing and advertising requirements.

Manufacturing,
    Sourcing and Distribution

Product design, fit, fabric, finish and quality are important in
    all of our businesses. These functions are performed by
    employees located in either our global supply chain organization
    or our branded business units across the globe.

VF’s centralized global supply chain organization sources
    product and ultimately bears the responsibility to deliver
    product to our customers. VF is highly skilled in managing the
    complexity associated with the supply chain. VF’s revenues
    are comprised of over 400 million units representing
    500,000 SKUs spread over 30 brands. VF operates over 30
    manufacturing facilities and utilizes over 1,600 contractor
    manufacturing facilities. We operate over 30 distribution
    centers and over 700 retail stores. Managing this complexity is
    made possible by our use of information systems
    technologies — with

best-of-breed

systems for product development, forecasting, order management,
    warehouse management, etc. attached to our core enterprise
    resource management platform.

Today, 16% of our products sold are manufactured in VF-owned
    facilities and 84% are products obtained from contractors,
    primarily in Asia. A combination of VF-owned and contracted
    production from different geographic regions provides
    flexibility and a competitive advantage in our product sourcing.
    We will continue to manage our supply chain from a global
    perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global
    production environment.

We operate manufacturing facilities (primarily cutting, sewing
    and finishing) located in Mexico, Central America, Poland and
    the Middle East. A significant percentage of our denim bottoms
    and occupational apparel are manufactured in these plants. For
    these owned production facilities, we purchase raw materials
    from numerous domestic and international suppliers to meet
    scheduled production needs. Raw materials include fabrics made
    from cotton, synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn,
    as well as thread and trim (product identification, buttons,
    zippers and snaps). In some instances, we contract the sewing of
    VF-owned raw materials into finished product with independent
    contractors in the United States, Mexico and Central America.
    Manufacturing in the United States is primarily limited to
    screen printing and embroidery of jerseys, T-shirts and fleece
    products, including Major League Baseball uniforms and other
    products. While we obtain fixed price commitments for denim and
    certain supplies for up to one year in advance, specific
    purchase obligations with suppliers are typically limited to the
    succeeding two to six months. Our only long-term contract is a
    commitment in connection with the sale of our childrenswear
    business in 2004 to purchase a remaining total of
    $67.5 million of childrenswear for sale through our VF
    Outlet stores, with a minimum of $15.0 million per year. No
    single supplier represents more than 3% of our total cost of
    sales.

For the U.S. market, our current sourcing strategy includes
    a balance of VF-owned production and contracted production in
    the Western Hemisphere and contracted production from Asia.
    Products manufactured in VF facilities generally have a lower
    cost and shorter lead times than contracted production. Product
    obtained from contractors in the Western Hemisphere generally
    has a higher cost than product obtained from contractors in the
    Far East but gives


us greater flexibility and shorter lead times and allows for
    lower inventory levels. The vast majority of units sold and
    dollar value of domestic Net Sales in 2009 were manufactured by
    outside contractors, primarily in Asia. This combination of
    VF-owned and contracted production, along with different
    geographic regions and cost structures, provides a balanced
    approach to product sourcing.

Our independent contractors generally own the raw materials and
    ship to VF only finished,

ready-for-sale

products. These contractors are engaged through VF sourcing hubs
    in Hong Kong (with several satellite offices across Asia) and
    Miami. These hubs are responsible for product procurement,
    product quality assurance, supplier management, transportation
    and shipping functions in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres,
    respectively. Substantially all products in the
    Outdoor & Action Sports and Sportswear Coalitions, as
    well as a growing portion of product requirements for our
    Jeanswear and Imagewear Coalitions, are obtained through these
    sourcing hubs. For most products in our Contemporary Brands
    Coalition, we contract the majority of sewing and finishing of
    VF-owned raw materials through a network of independent domestic
    and international contractors.

Management continually monitors political risks and developments
    related to duties, tariffs and quotas. We limit VF’s
    sourcing exposure through, among other measures,
    (i) extensive geographic diversification with a mix of
    VF-operated and contracted production, (ii) shifts of
    production among countries and contractors,
    (iii) allocation of production to merchandise categories
    where the free flow of product is available and
    (iv) sourcing from countries with tariff preference and
    free trade agreements. VF does not directly or indirectly source
    products from suppliers in countries that are identified by the
    State Department as state sponsors of terrorism and are subject
    to U.S. economic sanctions and export controls.

All VF-owned production facilities throughout the world, as well
    as all independent contractor facilities that manufacture
    VF-branded products, must comply with VF’s Global
    Compliance Principles. These principles, established in 1997 and
    consistent with international labor standards, are a set of
    strict standards covering legal and ethical business practices,
    workers’ ages, work hours, health and safety conditions,
    environment sustainability or standards, compliance with local
    laws and reputations. In addition, our owned factories must also
    undergo certification by the independent, nonprofit organization
    Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (“WRAP”)
    that promotes global ethics in manufacturing. VF, through its
    contractor monitoring program, audits the activities of the many
    independent businesses and contractors that produce VF-branded
    goods at locations across the globe. Each of the over 1,600
    independent contractor facilities, including those serving our
    independent licensees, must be precertified prior to performance
    of any production on behalf of VF. This precertification
    includes passing a factory inspection and signing a VF Terms of
    Engagement agreement. We maintain an ongoing audit program to
    ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated
    internal and outsourced staff. Additional information about
    VF’s Code of Business Conduct, Global Compliance
    Principles, Terms of Engagement, Factory Compliance Guidelines,
    Factory Audit Procedure and Environmental Compliance Guidelines,
    along with a Global Compliance Report, is available on the VF
    website at www.vfc.com.

VF did not experience difficulty in filling its raw material and
    contracting production needs during 2009, and we do not
    anticipate difficulties in meeting our raw materials and
    contracting production requirements during 2010. The loss of any
    one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse
    effect on our business.

Product is shipped from our independent suppliers and
    VF-operated manufacturing plants to many distribution centers in
    the United States and international markets. In limited
    instances, product is shipped directly to our customers. Product
    is inspected, sorted and stored in our distribution centers
    until needed for packing and shipping to our wholesale customers
    or our retail stores. Most distribution centers are operated by
    VF, and some support multiple brands. Our distribution centers
    use computer-controlled inventory management technology for
    efficient tracking and movement of products. A small portion of
    our distribution needs are met by contract distribution centers.

Seasonality

With its diversified product offerings, VF’s operating
    results are somewhat seasonal. On a quarterly basis and
    excluding the effect of acquisitions, consolidated Total
    Revenues for 2009 ranged from a low of approximately 21% of full
    year revenues in the second quarter to a high of 29% in the
    third quarter. This variation results primarily from the
    seasonal influences on revenues of our Outdoor &
    Action Sports Coalition, where 19% of the Coalition revenues


occurred in the second quarter and 33% in the third quarter of
    2009. With changes in our mix of business and growth of our
    retail operations, historical quarterly revenue and profit
    trends may not be indicative of future trends. We expect the
    portion of annual revenues and profits occurring in the second
    half of the year to increase.

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working
    capital increases during the first half of the year as inventory
    builds to support peak shipping periods and then decreases
    during the second half of the year as those inventories are sold
    and accounts receivable are collected. Cash provided by
    operating activities is substantially higher in the second half
    of the year due to higher net income during that period and
    reduced working capital requirements, particularly during the
    fourth quarter.

Advertising
    and Customer Support

During 2009, our advertising and promotion spending was
    $329.1 million, representing 4.6% of Net Sales. We
    advertise in consumer and trade publications, on national and
    local radio and television and on the internet. We also
    participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis
    with major retailers in print media, radio and television. We
    sponsor various sporting, music and other special events and
    sponsor a number of athletes and other personalities. We employ
    marketing sciences to optimize the impact of advertising and
    promotional spending and to identify the types of spending that
    provide the greatest return on our marketing investments.

We provide

point-of-sale

fixtures and signage to our wholesale customers to enhance the
    presentation and brand image of our products. This includes

shop-in-shops,

which are separate retail sales areas with brand
    signage — a “store within a
    store” — dedicated to a specific VF brand within
    a customers’ location. We participate in concession
    arrangements with department store customers in China and some
    other international markets. In a typical concession, a
    department store provides a dedicated sales area, along with
    check-out, credit and other services, while VF bears the risk of
    inventory ownership. Concession sales associates may be
    employees of VF or the department store.

We participate in various retail customer incentive programs.
    Incentive programs with retailers include discounts, allowances
    and cooperative advertising funds. We also offer sales incentive
    programs directly to consumers in the form of rebate and coupon
    offers. Sales incentive offers with retailers and with consumers
    are recognized as sales discounts in arriving at reported Net
    Sales (except that cooperative advertising reimbursements of
    documented retailer advertising costs are reported as
    Advertising Expense, and free product with purchase offers are
    reported in Cost of Goods Sold).

Internet websites are maintained for most of our brands. Many of
    them are

business-to-consumer

e-commerce

sites where consumers can order products from VF. Other consumer
    websites provide information about our brands and products and
    may direct consumers to our wholesale customers where they can
    purchase our products. We also operate several

business-to-business

sites where our retail customers can order VF products.

Our Outdoor & Action Sports, Jeanswear, Sportswear and
    Contemporary Brands Coalitions employ a staff of in-store
    marketing and merchandising coordinators located in major cities
    across the United States. These individuals visit our
    customers’ retail locations to ensure that our products,
    and those of our licensees, are properly presented on the
    merchandise sales floor and to inform the customers’ sales
    force about our products and related promotions.

Other
    Matters

Competitive
    Factors

Our business depends on our ability to stimulate consumer demand
    for VF’s brands and products. VF is well-positioned to
    compete in the apparel industry by developing consumer-connected
    and innovative products at competitive prices, producing high
    quality merchandise, providing high levels of service, ensuring
    product availability to the retail sales floor and enhancing
    recognition of its brands. We continually strive to improve on
    each of these areas. Many of VF’s brands have long
    histories and enjoy high recognition within their respective
    consumer segments.


Trademarks

Trademarks, patents and domain names, as well as related logos,
    designs and graphics, have substantial value in the marketing of
    VF’s products and are important to our continued success.
    We have registered this intellectual property in the United
    States and in other countries where our products are
    manufactured

and/or

sold.
    We vigorously monitor and enforce VF’s intellectual
    property against counterfeiting, infringement and violations of
    other rights where and to the extent legal, feasible and
    appropriate. In addition, we grant licenses to other parties to
    manufacture and sell products utilizing our intellectual
    property in product categories and geographic areas in which VF
    does not operate.

Customers

VF products are primarily sold through our sales force and
    independent sales agents and distributors. VF’s customers
    are specialty stores, department stores, national chains and
    mass merchants in the United States and in international
    markets. Of our Total Revenues, 30% are in international
    markets, primarily in Europe, and 17% are

direct-to-consumer

through VF-operated retail stores and

e-commerce

sites (which includes stores and internet sites in international
    markets).

Sales to VF’s ten largest customers, all of which are
    retailers based in the United States, amounted to 27% of Total
    Revenues in 2009, 26% in 2008 and 27% in 2007. These larger
    customers included (in alphabetical order) Kohl’s
    Corporation, Macy’s, Inc., J.C. Penney Company, Inc., Sears
    Holding Corporation, Target Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores,
    Inc. Sales to the five largest customers amounted to
    approximately 21% of Total Revenues in 2009 and 2008 and 22% in
    2007. Sales to VF’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores,
    Inc., totaled 11% of Total Revenues in 2009 and 2008 and 12% in
    2007, substantially all of which were in the Jeanswear Coalition.

Employees

VF employed approximately 45,700 men and women at the end of
    2009, of which approximately 19,600 were located in the United
    States. Approximately 800 employees in the United States
    are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In
    international markets, a significant percentage of employees are
    covered by trade-sponsored or governmental bargaining
    arrangements. Employee relations are considered to be good.

Backlog

The dollar amount of VF’s order backlog as of any date is
    not meaningful, may not be indicative of actual future shipments
    and, accordingly, is not material for an understanding of the
    business of VF taken as a whole.


Executive
    Officers of VF

The following are the executive officers of VF Corporation as of
    February 20, 2010. The executive officers are generally elected
    annually and serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

The following risk factors should be read carefully in
    connection with evaluating VF’s business and the
    forward-looking statements contained in this

Form 10-K.

Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect
    VF’s business, its operating results and its financial
    condition.

VF’s
    revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending
    for apparel, which is sensitive to general economic
    conditions.

The apparel industry has historically been subject to cyclical
    variations and is particularly affected by adverse trends in the
    general economy. The success of VF’s business depends on
    consumer spending. Consumer spending is influenced by a number
    of factors, including actual and perceived economic conditions
    affecting disposable consumer income (such as unemployment and
    wages), business conditions, interest rates, availability of
    credit, housing costs, the level of securities markets, energy
    prices and tax rates in the international, national, regional
    and local markets where VF’s products are sold. Consumer
    spending was constrained during 2009, and a further decline in
    general economic conditions could further reduce the level of
    consumer spending.

We do
    not expect a significant improvement in business conditions and
    consumer spending in the near future. The effects of a return to
    recessionary conditions could have a material adverse effect on
    VF.

The global recession — with rising unemployment,
    reduced availability of credit, increased savings rates and
    declines in real estate and securities values —  had a
    negative impact on retail sales of apparel and other consumer
    products. Reduced sales by our wholesale customers may lead to
    lower retail inventory levels, reduced orders to suppliers like
    VF, or order cancellations. Reduced sales by some of our
    wholesale customers, along with the possibility of their reduced
    access to, or inability to access, the credit markets, may
    result in various retailers experiencing significant financial
    difficulties. Financial difficulties of customers could result
    in reduced sales to those customers or could result in store
    closures, bankruptcies or liquidations. Higher credit risk
    relating to receivables from customers experiencing financial
    difficulty may result. If these developments occur, our
    inability


to shift sales to other customers or to collect on VF’s
    trade accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect
    on VF’s financial condition and results of operations.

A growing portion of our revenues are

direct-to-consumer

through VF-operated retail stores and

e-commerce

websites. It is possible that reduced consumer confidence, along
    with a reduction in availability of consumer credit and
    increasing unemployment, could lead to reduced purchases of
    VF’s products through VF-operated retail stores and
    websites. This could have a material adverse effect on VF’s
    financial condition and results of operations.

The
    apparel industry is highly competitive, and VF’s success
    depends on its ability to respond to constantly changing fashion
    trends and consumer demand. Reduced sales or prices resulting
    from competition could have a material adverse effect on
    VF.

VF competes with numerous brands and manufacturers of apparel.
    Some of our competitors may be larger and have more resources
    than VF in certain product categories. In addition, VF competes
    directly with the private label brands of its wholesale
    customers. VF’s ability to compete within the apparel and
    footwear industries depends on its ability to:

•

Anticipate and respond to changing consumer trends in a timely
    manner;

•

Develop attractive, quality products;

•

Maintain favorable brand recognition;

•

Price products appropriately;

•

Provide effective marketing support;

•

Ensure product availability and optimize supply chain
    efficiencies; and

•

Obtain sufficient retail floor space and effectively present its
    products at retail.

Failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly
    changing markets and trends could have a material adverse effect
    on VF’s business, financial condition and results of
    operations. In addition, if we misjudge fashion trends and
    market conditions, we could be faced with significant excess
    inventories for some products that we may have to sell at a loss
    or missed opportunities that may result in lost sales.

VF’s
    results of operations could be materially harmed if VF is unable
    to accurately forecast demand for its products.

We often schedule internal production and place orders for
    products with independent manufacturers before our
    customers’ orders are firm. Therefore, if we fail to
    accurately forecast customer demand, we may experience excess
    inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our
    customers. Factors that could affect our ability to accurately
    forecast demand for our products include:

•

An increase or decrease in consumer demand for VF’s
    products or for products of its competitors;

•

Our failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance of new
    products;

•

New product introductions by competitors;

•

Unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other
    factors, which may result in cancellations of orders or a
    reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by
    retailers;

•

Weak economic conditions or consumer confidence, which could
    reduce demand for discretionary items such as VF’s
    products; and

•

Terrorism or acts of war, or the threat of terrorism or acts of
    war, which could adversely affect consumer confidence and
    spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and
    raw materials.

Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in
    inventory write-downs and the sale of excess inventory at
    discounted prices, which could have an adverse effect on
    VF’s results of operations and financial condition. On the
    other hand, if we underestimate demand for our products, our
    manufacturing facilities or third


party manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet
    customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the
    shipment of products and lost revenues, as well as damage to
    VF’s reputation and customer relationships. There can be no
    assurance that we will be able to successfully manage inventory
    levels to exactly meet future order and reorder requirements.

A
    substantial portion of VF’s revenues and gross profit is
    derived from a small number of large customers. The loss of any
    of these customers could substantially reduce VF’s
    profits.

A few of VF’s customers account for a significant portion
    of revenues. Sales to VF’s ten largest customers were 27%
    of Total Revenues in fiscal 2009, with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
    accounting for 11% of revenues. Sales are generally on a
    purchase order basis, and we do not have long-term agreements
    with any of our customers. A decision by any of VF’s major
    customers to decrease significantly the number of products
    purchased from VF could substantially reduce revenues and have a
    material adverse effect on VF’s financial condition and
    results of operations. Moreover, in recent years, the retail
    industry has experienced consolidation and other ownership
    changes. In the future, retailers may further consolidate,
    undergo restructurings or reorganizations, realign their
    affiliations or reposition their stores’ target market.
    These developments could result in a reduction in the number of
    stores that carry VF’s products, increased ownership
    concentration within the retail industry, increased credit
    exposure or increased retailer leverage over their suppliers.
    These changes could impact VF’s opportunities in the market
    and increase VF’s reliance on a smaller number of large
    customers.

VF’s
    profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on
    margins.

The apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure
    caused by many factors, including intense competition,
    consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to
    reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand.
    These factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to
    retailers and consumers, which could cause VF’s gross
    margin to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions
    with comparable reductions in operating costs. If VF’s
    sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our
    product costs or operating expenses, VF’s profitability
    will decline. This could have a material adverse effect on
    VF’s results of operations, liquidity and financial
    condition.

Fluctuations
    in the price, availability and quality of raw materials and
    finished goods could increase costs and cause service
    delays.

Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of fabrics
    or other raw materials used by VF in its manufactured apparel,
    or of purchased finished goods, could have a material adverse
    effect on VF’s cost of sales or its ability to meet its
    customers’ demands. The prices for such fabrics depend on
    demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce
    them, particularly cotton. The price and availability of such
    raw materials may fluctuate significantly, depending on many
    factors, including crop yields and weather patterns. In the
    future, VF may not be able to pass higher costs on to its
    customers.

VF may
    not succeed in implementing its growth strategy.

One of our key strategic objectives is growth. We seek to grow
    through both organic growth and acquisitions by building new
    growing lifestyle brands, expanding our share with winning
    customers, stretching VF’s brands and customers to new
    geographies, leveraging our supply chain and information
    technology capabilities across VF, expanding our

direct-to-consumer

business and identifying and developing high potential
    employees. We may not be able to grow our existing businesses or
    achieve planned cost savings. We may have difficulty identifying
    acquisition targets, and we may not be able to successfully
    integrate a newly acquired business or achieve expected cost
    savings or synergies from such integration. We may not be able
    to expand our market share with winning customers, expand our
    brands geographically or achieve the expected results from our
    supply chain initiatives. We may also have difficulty recruiting
    or developing qualified managers. Failure to implement our
    growth strategy may have a material adverse effect on VF’s
    business.


VF’s
    operations in international markets, and earnings in those
    markets, may be affected by legal, regulatory, political and
    economic risks.

Our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our
    existing international markets and to capitalize on growth in
    existing and new international markets is subject to risks
    associated with international operations. These include the
    burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and
    regulations, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, new
    tariffs or other barriers to some international markets.

We cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes, exchange
    controls or other restrictions will be imposed by the United
    States, the European Union or other countries upon the import or
    export of our products in the future, or what effect any of
    these actions would have on VF’s business, financial
    condition or results of operations. We cannot predict whether
    there might be changes in our ability to repatriate earnings or
    capital from international jurisdictions. Changes in regulatory,
    geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect
    VF’s business or may require us to modify our current
    business practices.

Approximately one-third of VF’s income is earned in
    international jurisdictions. VF is exposed to risks of changes
    in U.S. policy for companies having business operations
    outside the United States. In recent months, the President and
    others in his Administration have proposed changes in
    U.S. income tax laws that could, among other things,
    accelerate the U.S. taxability of

non-U.S. earnings

or limit foreign tax credits. Although such proposals have been
    deferred, if new legislation were enacted, it is possible our
    U.S. income tax expense could increase, which would reduce
    our earnings.

VF
    uses foreign suppliers and manufacturing facilities for a
    substantial portion of its raw materials and finished products,
    which poses risks to VF’s business
    operations.

During fiscal 2009, approximately 84% of VF’s products sold
    were produced by and purchased from independent manufacturers
    primarily located in Asia, with substantially all of the
    remainder produced by VF-owned and operated manufacturing
    facilities located in Mexico, Central America, Poland and the
    Middle East. Although no single supplier and no one country is
    critical to VF’s production needs, any of the following
    could materially and adversely affect our ability to produce or
    deliver VF products and, as a result, have a material adverse
    effect on VF’s business, financial condition and results of
    operations:

•

Political or labor instability in countries where VF’s
    facilities, contractors and suppliers are located;

•

Political or military conflict, which could cause a delay in the
    transportation of raw materials and products to VF and an
    increase in transportation costs;

•

Heightened terrorism security concerns, which could subject
    imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent or more
    lengthy inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or
    impoundment of goods for extended periods or could result in
    decreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods,
    leading to lost sales, increased costs for VF’s
    anticounterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of its
    brands;

•

Disease epidemics and health-related concerns, such as the H1N1
    virus, bird flu, SARS, mad cow and

hoof-and-mouth

disease outbreaks in recent years, which could result in closed
    factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and
    scrutiny or embargo of VF’s goods produced in infected
    areas;

•

Imposition of regulations and quotas relating to imports and our
    ability to adjust timely to changes in trade regulations, which,
    among other things, could limit our ability to produce products
    in cost-effective countries that have the labor and expertise
    needed;

•

Imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on
    imports; and

•

Imposition or the repeal of laws that affect intellectual
    property rights.


Our
    business is subject to national, state and local laws and
    regulations for environmental, employment, safety and other
    matters. The costs of compliance with, or the violation of, such
    laws and regulations by VF or by independent suppliers who
    manufacture products for VF could have an adverse effect on our
    operations and cash flows.

Numerous governmental agencies enforce comprehensive federal,
    state and local laws and regulations on a wide range of
    environmental, employment, safety and other matters. VF could be
    adversely affected by costs of compliance or violations of those
    laws and regulations. In addition, the costs of products
    purchased by VF from independent contractors could increase due
    to the costs of compliance by those contractors. Further,
    violations of such laws and regulations could affect the
    availability of inventory, thereby affecting our net sales.

If
    VF’s suppliers fail to use acceptable ethical business
    practices, VF’s business could suffer.

We require third party suppliers to operate in compliance with
    applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working
    conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance.
    Additionally, we require all suppliers making VF-branded
    apparel, whether directly for VF or for its licensees, to comply
    with VF’s Terms of Engagement and Global Compliance
    Principles. Our staff and third parties retained for such
    purposes periodically visit and audit the operations of
    VF’s owned and operated facilities and those of independent
    contractors manufacturing product for VF to determine
    compliance. However, we do not control independent manufacturers
    or their labor and other business practices. If one of our
    independent contractors violates labor or other laws or
    implements labor or other business practices that are generally
    regarded as unethical in the United States, the shipment of
    finished products to VF could be interrupted, orders could be
    cancelled, relationships could be terminated, and VF’s
    reputation could be damaged. Any of these events could have a
    material adverse effect on VF’s revenues and, consequently,
    its results of operations.

VF’s
    business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange
    rate fluctuations. VF’s hedging strategies may not be
    effective in mitigating those risks.

Approximately 30% of VF’s Total Revenues is derived from
    international markets. VF’s foreign businesses operate in
    functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes
    in currency exchange rates may affect the U.S. dollar value
    of the foreign currency-denominated amounts at which VF’s
    international businesses purchase products, incur costs or sell
    products. In addition, for VF’s

U.S.-based

businesses, the majority of products are sourced from
    independent contractors or VF plants located in foreign
    countries. As a result, the cost of these products may be
    affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies.
    Furthermore, much of VF’s licensing revenue is derived from
    sales in foreign currencies. Changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates could have an adverse impact on VF’s
    financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In accordance with our operating practices, we hedge a
    significant portion of our foreign currency transaction
    exposures arising in the ordinary course of business to reduce
    risks in our cash flows and earnings. Our hedging strategy may
    not be effective in reducing these risks, and no hedging
    strategy can completely insulate VF from foreign exchange risk.
    We do not hedge foreign currency translation rate changes.

Further, our use of derivative financial instruments may expose
    VF to counterparty risks. Although VF only enters into hedging
    contracts with counterparties having investment grade credit
    ratings, it is possible that the credit quality of a
    counterparty could be downgraded or a counterparty could default
    on its obligations, which could have a material adverse impact
    on VF’s financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows.

VF
    borrows funds on a short-term basis, primarily to support
    seasonal working capital requirements. Long-term debt is part of
    VF’s total capital structure. VF may have difficulty
    accessing capital markets for short or long-term
    financing.

During the last two years, the global capital and credit markets
    have experienced extreme levels of volatility and disruption,
    with government intervention, mergers or bankruptcies of several
    major financial institutions, and a general decline in global
    liquidity. Many corporate issuers have been unable to access
    credit markets.


Although VF had over $700 million of cash and equivalents
    at the end of 2009, we typically use short-term commercial paper
    borrowings to support seasonal working capital requirements,
    with amounts generally repaid by the end of each year from
    strong cash flows from operations. VF was able to continue to
    borrow in the commercial paper markets during the last two
    years, and all commercial paper borrowings were repaid by the
    end of each year. In addition, VF may access the long-term
    capital markets to replace maturing debt obligations or to fund
    acquisition or other growth opportunities. There is no assurance
    that the commercial paper markets or the long-term capital
    markets will continue to be reliable sources of financing for VF.

VF has
    committed domestic and international bank credit facilities. One
    or more of the participating banks may not be able to honor
    their commitments, which could have an adverse effect on
    VF’s business.

If we were to have difficulty in accessing the short or
    long-term capital markets, VF has $1.3 billion of committed
    domestic and international bank credit facilities that expire in
    October 2012. Continued distress in the financial markets could,
    however, impair the ability of one or more of the banks
    participating in our credit agreements from honoring their
    commitments. This could have an adverse effect on our business
    if we were not able to replace those commitments or to locate
    other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms.

The
    loss of members of VF’s executive management and other key
    employees could have a material adverse effect on its
    business.

VF depends on the services and management experience of its
    executive officers and business leaders who have substantial
    experience and expertise in VF’s business. VF also depends
    on other key employees involved in the operation of its
    business. Competition for qualified personnel in the apparel
    industry is intense. The unexpected loss of services of one or
    more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect
    on VF.

VF may
    be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual
    property rights.

VF’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are
    important to its success and its competitive position. VF is
    susceptible to others imitating its products and infringing its
    intellectual property rights. With the shift in product mix to
    higher priced brands in recent years, VF is more susceptible to
    infringement of its intellectual property rights. Some of
    VF’s brands, such as

The North
    Face

®

,

Vans

®

,

JanSport

®

,

Nautica

®

,

Wrangler

®

and

Lee

®

brands, enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition, and
    the generally higher pricing of such products creates additional
    risk of counterfeiting and infringement.

Counterfeiting of VF’s products or infringement on its
    intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our
    brands or otherwise adversely affect VF revenues. Actions we
    have taken to establish and protect VF’s intellectual
    property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of its
    products by others or to prevent others from seeking to
    invalidate its trademarks or block sales of VF’s products
    as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property
    rights of others. In addition, unilateral actions in the United
    States or other countries, such as changes to or the repeal of
    laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property
    rights, could have an impact on VF’s ability to enforce
    those rights.

The value of VF’s intellectual property could diminish if
    others assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other
    intellectual property rights of VF, or trademarks that are
    similar to VF’s trademarks, or trademarks that VF licenses
    from others. We may be unable to successfully resolve these
    types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, there may
    be trademark owners who have prior rights to VF’s
    trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not
    protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do
    the laws of the United States. In other cases, there may be
    holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks. VF is from
    time to time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings
    with respect to some of its intellectual property rights.

VF is
    subject to the risk that its licensees may not maintain the
    value of VF’s brands.

During 2009, $77.2 million of VF’s revenues were
    derived from licensing royalties. Although VF generally has
    significant control over its licensees’ products and
    advertising, we rely on our licensees for, among other things,
    operational and financial controls over their businesses.
    Failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed
    products or our inability to replace existing licensees, if
    necessary, could adversely affect VF’s revenues, both


directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from
    reduced sales of our other products. Risks are also associated
    with a licensee’s ability to:

•

Obtain capital;

•

Manage its labor relations;

•

Maintain relationships with its suppliers;

•

Manage its credit risk effectively; and

•

Maintain relationships with its customers.

In addition, VF relies on its licensees to help preserve the
    value of its brands. Although we make every attempt to protect
    VF’s brands through, among other things, approval rights
    over design, production processes and quality, packaging,
    merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our
    licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of
    licensed VF brands by our licensees. The misuse of a brand by a
    licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and
    on VF.

VF has
    entered into license agreements to use the trademarks of others.
    Loss of a license could have an adverse effect on VF’s
    operating results.

VF has entered into agreements to market products under licenses
    granted by third parties, including Major League Baseball, the
    National Football League and Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Inc.
    Some of these licenses are for a short term and do not contain
    renewal options. Loss of a license, which in certain cases could
    result in an impairment charge for related operating and
    intangible assets, could have an adverse effect on VF’s
    operating results.

VF
    relies significantly on information technology. Any inadequacy,
    interruption, integration failure or security failure of that
    technology could harm VF’s ability to effectively operate
    its business.

Our ability to effectively manage and operate our business
    depends significantly on information technology systems. The
    failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with
    transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, difficulty in
    integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses, or a
    breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the
    operations of VF’s business. Moreover, VF and its customers
    could suffer harm if customer information were accessed by third
    parties due to a security failure in VF’s systems. It could
    also require significant expenditures to remediate any such
    failure, problem or breach.

If VF
    encounters problems with its distribution system, VF’s
    ability to deliver its products to the market could be adversely
    affected.

VF relies on its distribution facilities to warehouse and, using
    its own employees or in some cases independent contractors, to
    ship product to its customers. VF’s distribution system
    includes computer-controlled and automated equipment, which
    means its operations are complicated and may be subject to a
    number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the
    proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions
    or other system failures. Because substantially all of VF’s
    products are distributed from a relatively small number of
    locations, VF’s operations could also be interrupted by
    earthquakes, floods, fires or other natural disasters near its
    distribution centers. We maintain business interruption
    insurance, but it may not adequately protect VF from the adverse
    effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in
    VF’s distribution facilities, such as the long-term loss of
    customers or an erosion of brand image. In addition, VF’s
    distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of
    services by third parties, including the transportation of
    product to and from its distribution facilities. If we encounter
    problems with our distribution system, our ability to meet
    customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and
    achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be
    materially adversely affected.


VF’s
    balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets
    and goodwill. A decline in the estimated fair value of an
    intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset
    impairment charge, which would be recorded as an operating
    expense in VF’s Consolidated Statement of Income and could
    be material.

Under current accounting standards, we estimate the fair value
    of acquired assets, including intangible assets, and assumed
    liabilities arising from a business acquisition. The excess, if
    any, of the cost of the acquired business over the fair value of
    net tangible and intangible assets acquired is goodwill. The
    goodwill is then assigned to a business unit or “reporting
    unit” within VF, which depends on how the acquired business
    will be operated after integration into VF.

We evaluate trademark intangible assets that are not amortized
    and goodwill for possible impairment at least annually. In
    addition, intangible assets that are being amortized are tested
    for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that
    their carrying value might not be recoverable. For these
    impairment tests, we use various valuation methodologies to
    estimate the fair value of our business units and intangible
    assets. If the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying
    value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the
    difference. During 2009, we recognized goodwill and intangible
    asset impairment charges totaling $122.0 million.

At December 2009, VF had approximately $1.0 billion of
    indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets and
    $1.4 billion of goodwill on its balance sheet. These assets
    are not required to be amortized under current accounting rules.
    In addition, VF had approximately $0.5 billion of
    intangible assets that are being amortized under current
    accounting rules. Goodwill and intangible assets combined
    represent 45% of VF’s Total Assets and 76% of
    Stockholders’ Equity.

It is possible that we could have an impairment charge for
    goodwill or trademark intangible assets in future periods if
    (i) overall economic conditions in 2010 or future years
    vary from our current assumptions, (ii) business conditions
    or our strategies for a specific business unit change from our
    current assumptions, (iii) investors require higher rates
    of return on equity investments in the marketplace or
    (iv) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded
    companies, or of actual sales transactions of comparable
    companies, were to decline, resulting in lower comparable
    multiples of revenues and EBITDA and, accordingly, lower implied
    values of goodwill and intangible assets. Specifically regarding
    our Contemporary Brands Coalition, the recession of the last two
    years has particularly impacted the upper tier or premium
    department and specialty store channel of distribution and, in
    many cases, products sold through this premium channel. While no
    impairment is indicated for any of our business units within
    this coalition, if the premium channel does not improve from
    recessionary levels or if the growth strategies of our business
    units are not successful, it is possible that an impairment
    charge would be required. A future impairment charge for
    goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on
    our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

VF’s
    defined benefit pension plans were underfunded at the end of
    2009 due primarily to the decline in market value of the
    plans’ investment portfolios, resulting from the global
    financial and credit crisis that began near the end of 2007.
    This resulted in recognition of a significant liability
    representing the underfunded status of our plans and a
    significant charge to Stockholders’ Equity in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets at the end of 2008 and 2009, as well
    as a significant increase in our 2009 pension expense. If the
    pension plans’ investments were to decline in value or if
    the level of interest rates were to decline from the current
    level, the pension plans could be further underfunded, resulting
    in recognition of additional underfunded liabilities and
    additional charges to Stockholders’ Equity in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets, higher pension expense and possibly
    additional cash contributions to fund the plans.

VF’s defined benefit pension plans were underfunded at the
    end of 2009, resulting in recognition of $238.8 million of
    pension liabilities at the end of 2009. Differences between
    actual results and amounts estimated using actuarial assumptions
    (e.g., investment returns, discount rate, mortality) are
    deferred and amortized in future years’ pension cost.
    Deferred actuarial losses included in Stockholders’ Equity
    totaled $266.0 million. Primarily because of these deferred
    actuarial losses, our pension cost increased from
    $10.8 million in 2008 to $98.0 million in 2009. To
    improve the funded status of our pension plans, we made over
    $200 million of discretionary contributions to our plans
    during 2009.


A further decrease in the value of our plans’ assets or a
    decrease in the discount rate used to value the plans’
    liabilities to participants could result in a further decrease
    in the plans’ funded status. In that case, VF would
    recognize additional pension liabilities and additional charges
    to Stockholders’ Equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheet
    and higher pension expense in future years. Further, VF could be
    required to make additional cash funding contributions to return
    the pension plans to a fully funded status over the next few
    years.

Properties.

VF owns certain facilities used in manufacturing and
    distribution activities and leases a distribution center under a
    capital lease. Other facilities are leased under operating
    leases that generally contain renewal options. We believe all
    facilities and machinery and equipment are in good condition and
    are suitable for VF’s needs. Manufacturing, distribution
    and administrative facilities being utilized at the end of 2009
    are summarized below by reportable segment:

    facilities. The remainder represents administrative and showroom
    facilities.

In addition to the above, VF owns or leases retail locations
    totaling 7,100,000 square feet. VF also leases
    500,000 square feet of space that was formerly used in its
    operations but is now subleased to a third party through the end
    of the lease term.

Legal
    Proceedings.

On September 22, 2009, the U.S. Environmental
    Protection Agency filed a lawsuit against VF Outdoor, Inc.
    alleging violations of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and
    Rodenticide Act resulting from the alleged sale of unregistered
    pesticides in shoes. The lawsuit was filed with the Regional
    Hearing Clerk of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
    Region IX. The parties entered into an agreement to settle
    the proceeding in the first quarter of 2010. There are no
    pending material legal proceedings, other than ordinary, routine
    litigation incidental to the business, to which VF or any of its
    subsidiaries is a party or to which any of their property is the
    subject.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

Overview

VF Corporation is a leading global marketer of branded lifestyle
    and other apparel products. Management’s vision is to grow
    VF by building leading lifestyle brands that excite consumers
    around the world. Lifestyle brands, representative of the
    activities that consumers aspire to, generally extend across
    multiple geographic markets and product categories and therefore
    have greater opportunities for growth.

VF owns a diverse portfolio of brands with strong market
    positions in several consumer product categories. In addition,
    we market occupational apparel to resellers and major corporate
    and government customers. VF has a broad customer base, with
    products distributed through leading specialty stores, upscale
    and traditional department stores, national chains and mass
    merchants, plus VF-operated retail stores and internet websites.

VF’s businesses are grouped into five product categories,
    and by brands within those product categories, for management
    and internal financial reporting purposes. These groupings of
    businesses are referred to as “coalitions.” Both
    management and VF’s Board of Directors evaluate operating
    performance at the coalition level, which is consistent with
    that used for management incentive compensation. These
    coalitions represent VF’s reportable segments. These
    groupings of businesses are summarized as follows:

Impact
    of the Current Global Economic Environment

The global recession that began near the end of 2007 is the
    longest and most severe recession in the last several decades.
    This recession, which has resulted in flat-to-falling consumer
    income levels, sharp declines in real estate and global
    securities markets, volatility in commodity and currency
    markets, significant increases in unemployment, numerous
    retailer and other bankruptcies, and unprecedented government
    stimulus programs, has led to a decline in consumer spending
    that has impacted VF as well as most other companies. Recent
    statistics indicate that the U.S. and global economies are
    showing some signs of stability, but unemployment is still very
    high and consumer spending remains weak.


Consumer spending represents about 70% of the domestic economy,
    and spending at retail represents about one-half of that. The
    general reduction in household wealth and income over the last
    two years, along with reduced availability of consumer credit
    and increased savings and debt repayment rates, has reduced
    consumer purchases of discretionary items such as apparel.
    Reduced consumer spending has had a significant impact on sales
    in all retail channels, and particularly in sales of premium,
    higher priced products in the upper tier distribution channels.
    Although there are some signs of stabilization, consumer
    confidence remains weak. We believe economic conditions will
    remain difficult and that consumer spending will remain
    constrained in global markets through 2010.

In response to these market conditions, VF was aggressive in
    reducing costs and lowering inventory levels during 2009.
    However, we have continued to invest in our brands and, in 2010,
    are expecting to increase our investments in advertising,
    product development and retail store expansion. These
    investments, totaling $50 million, will be very targeted
    and concentrated in those businesses with the strongest
    opportunities for growth, including

The North
    Face

®

,

Vans

®

and

7 For All
    Mankind

®

brands, and our business in Asia. A portion of these investments
    will be targeted at further strengthening our product innovation
    and sustainability platforms. We believe that the strength of
    our brands is fundamental to our success in this economic
    climate.

Long-term
    Financial Targets

While our long-term revenue and earnings growth targets, as
    described below, were not achieved in 2009 due to global
    recessionary conditions and are not expected to be achieved in
    2010, our long-term targets remain intact. These targets are
    summarized below:

•

Revenue growth of 8% to 10% per year

— Our
    long-term revenue growth target is 8% to 10% per year, with
    approximately 6% to 7% coming from organic growth and 2% to 3%
    from acquisitions. We met this long-term target by achieving
    revenue growth of 16% in 2007. However, our revenues increased
    by 6% in 2008 and declined by 6% in 2009, reflecting the impact
    of the global economic environment discussed above. Key drivers
    of future growth, consistent with the 8% to 10% long-term
    target, include growth in our lifestyle brands, acquisitions of
    additional lifestyle brands, international expansion and
    continued growth in our direct-to-consumer business. We now
    expect our international revenues to grow to 40% of Total
    Revenues, compared with a prior long-term target of 33%.
    International revenues accounted for 30% of our Total Revenues
    in 2008 and 2009. In addition, we continue to expect our
    direct-to-consumer business to grow to a level that exceeds 20%
    of Total Revenues through an increase in sales within existing
    stores, new store openings and expansion of our

e-commerce

platforms. Direct-to-consumer revenues comprised 16% of our
    Total Revenues in 2008 and 17% in 2009. We have many programs in
    place to continue to drive organic growth, including a plan to
    invest $50 million behind our strongest brands in 2010, and
    will continue our aggressive search to acquire branded lifestyle
    businesses that meet our strategic and financial goals.

•

Operating income of 15% of revenues

— Operating
    margins of 12.3% in 2008 and of 11.9% in 2009 (excluding the
    effect of the impairment charge discussed in the “Analysis
    of Results of Continuing Operations” section below) were
    negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions. In
    addition, operating margins in 2008 included the negative impact
    from nonrecurring charges related to cost saving actions taken
    near the end of that year, and in 2009 included a significant
    increase in expense for our defined benefit pension plans. We
    expect to improve our operating margin as we (i) achieve
    disproportionate growth in our higher margin, faster growing
    lifestyle businesses, (ii) grow our international and
    retail businesses, which also have higher operating margins than
    VF averages, and (iii) continue our relentless focus on
    cost reduction.

•

Earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% per year

— While we have exceeded this target in recent
    years, we did not meet this long-term target in 2008 and 2009
    due to the negative impact of the factors discussed above. We
    expect to increase earnings per share by 9% to 11% in 2010.


•

Return on invested capital of 17%

— We believe
    that a high return on capital is closely correlated with
    enhancing total shareholder return. We calculate return on
    invested capital as follows:

Income before net interest expense, after income taxes

Average stockholders’ equity, plus average short and
    long-term debt

Excluding the effect of the impairment charge discussed in the
    “Analysis of Results of Continuing Operations” section
    below, we earned a 12.6% return on invested capital in 2009,
    compared with a 13.5% return in 2008. Our returns in these years
    were negatively impacted by the global economic conditions
    discussed above, our 2008 cost reduction initiatives, our
    incremental pension expense in 2009 and by our 2007
    acquisitions. Newly acquired businesses generally have a lower
    than average return on invested capital in their earlier years
    of ownership. We expect our return on invested capital to
    improve in 2010 and move closer to the long-term target of 17%.

•

Debt to capital of less than 40%

— We have
    established a goal of keeping our debt to less than 40% of our
    total capitalization, with capitalization defined as our
    stockholders’ equity, plus combined short and long-term
    debt. This ratio was 23.7% at the end of 2009. If cash were
    netted, the ratio would have been 10.7%. This low debt to
    capital ratio demonstrates VF’s ability to navigate
    effectively through a difficult economic environment and
    maintain financial strength.

•

Dividend payout ratio of 40%

— Our target is to
    return approximately 40% of earnings to our stockholders through
    dividends. The 2009 dividend payout ratio was 46.0% of diluted
    earnings per share (excluding the effect of the impairment
    charge discussed in the “Analysis of Results of Continuing
    Operations” section below). Our industry-leading dividend
    payout is expected to exceed 40% of earnings per share in 2010.

Strategic
    Objectives

Our strategy for growth consists of six drivers:

1.

Build more global, growing lifestyle brands.

Focus on building more global, growing lifestyle brands with
    an emphasis on activity-based brands.

2.

Expand our share with winning customers.

Develop
    brand and product strategies that will enable us to gain market
    share with successful, growing retail partners.

3.

Stretch brands and customers to new geographies.

Grow our international presence, particularly in China,
    Europe, India and Brazil.

4.

Expand our direct-to-consumer business.

Increase
    the portion of revenues obtained from VF-operated monobrand
    retail stores and

e-commerce.

5.

Fuel the growth.

Maintain our competitive
    advantage by leveraging our supply chain and information
    technology capabilities across VF to drive lower costs and
    inventory levels, increase productivity and integrate
    acquisitions efficiently to generate savings that can be
    reinvested in our brands.

6.

Build new growth enablers.

Support our growth
    plans by identifying and developing high potential employees and
    by building a diverse team of talented leaders with specific
    focus on consumer insight and innovation.

Highlights
    of 2009

There were several notable actions and achievements in 2009:

•

We continued our positive momentum in the Outdoor & Action
    Sports businesses and achieved record revenue and operating
    margin levels.

•

We gained market share in the United States in our core

Wrangler

®

and

Lee

®

brands in a very difficult economic environment.

•

Our Asia revenues increased 28%.


•

We completed the acquisition of Mo Industries Holdings, Inc.
    (“Mo Industries”), a Los Angeles-based company that
    owns the

Splendid

®

and

Ella
    Moss

®

brands of premium sportswear marketed to upscale department and
    specialty stores.

•

Our direct-to-consumer business revenues grew to 17% of Total
    Revenues and we opened 90 stores.

•

Gross margin was at a record level of 44.3%.

•

We improved the profitability of our Sportswear businesses,
    achieving double-digit operating margin.

•

We reduced inventories by 17%, reflecting our aggressive
    management of inventory levels during the economic downturn.

•

Our record $973 million of cash flow from operating
    activities allowed us to grow existing cash, while funding
    (i) $298 million of investments in capital
    expenditures and acquisitions, (ii) $262 million of
    dividends, (iii) over $200 million in contributions to
    our pension plans and (iv) $112 million of repurchases
    of our Common Stock. We ended the year with $732 million of
    cash and equivalents, almost doubling our prior year position.
    And with our “A minus” investment grade credit rating,
    we continue to have access to capital markets and have the
    ability to borrow over $1.3 billion under committed bank
    credit agreements.

•

We increased our dividends paid per share for the
    37th consecutive year.

Total Revenues consist of Net Sales of products and Royalty
    Income from licensees. Revenues declined 6% in 2009, with 2% of
    the decline due to foreign currency translation. The effect of
    global recessionary conditions on consumer spending affected all
    of our businesses in 2009. In spite of the recession, we
    reported growth in our Outdoor & Action Sports
    businesses in 2009. Revenues increased in 2008 due to overall
    unit volume increases and organic growth in our Outdoor &
    Action Sports businesses and the benefit of a full year of
    operations of our Contemporary Brands businesses acquired in
    2007. Additional details on revenues are provided in the section
    titled “Information by Business Segment.”

In translating foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar, the
    stronger U.S. dollar in relation to the functional
    currencies where VF conducts the majority of its business
    (primarily the European euro countries) negatively impacted
    revenue by $156 million in 2009 relative to 2008. A weaker
    U.S. dollar benefited revenues by $109 million in 2008
    relative to 2007. The weighted average translation rate for the
    euro was $1.39 per euro during 2009, compared with $1.47 during
    2008 and $1.36 during 2007.

Gross margins increased 1.4% in 2009 over 2008 and 1.0% in 2008
    over 2007 from the impact of our direct-to-consumer operations,
    which have gross margin percentages higher than VF averages. In
    addition, our aggressive management of inventory levels in 2009
    resulted in gross margin improvement due to a lower impact from
    the disposal of excess and obsolete inventory. The increase in
    2009 was partially offset by lower gross margins in our European
    jeanswear and imagewear businesses. The 2008 increase was
    partially offset by lower gross margins primarily in our
    European jeanswear business. See the “Information by
    Business Segment” section below.

Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses as a percent of
    revenues increased 1.2% in 2009 over 2008 due to the higher
    expense of our defined benefit pension plans and 1.1% due to
    growth in our direct-to-consumer business, which has a higher
    expense ratio than our wholesale business. The 2009 comparison
    benefited from (i) the absence of nonrecurring charges from
    cost reduction actions, which increased Marketing,
    Administrative and General Expenses as a percent of revenues by
    0.7% in 2008, and (ii) the benefit of these actions and
    other spending reductions in 2009.

Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses as a percent of
    revenues increased 1.4% in 2008 over 2007 due to the growth in
    our direct-to-consumer business and 0.7% due to nonrecurring
    charges from the cost reduction actions mentioned above. These
    increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation
    and other spending reductions in 2008.

We include costs of cooperative advertising, licensing, retail
    stores, and shipping and handling in Marketing, Administrative
    and General Expenses, as stated in our significant accounting
    policies in Note A to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. Some apparel companies classify cooperative
    advertising costs as a reduction of Net Sales and licensing
    costs as a reduction to Royalty Income. Further, some classify
    retail store costs and shipping and handling costs in Cost of
    Goods Sold. Accordingly, our gross margin and operating expenses
    may not be directly comparable with other apparel companies.

We completed our annual impairment testing for goodwill and
    indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets in the fourth
    quarter of 2009. Based on our assessment of current and expected
    future economic conditions, trends and forecasted cash flows at
    each business unit, and assumptions representative of those that
    market participants would make in valuing our business units, VF
    management determined that the carrying values of goodwill at
    its

Reef

®

,

Nautica

®

,

    and

lucy

®

business units exceeded their fair values and the carrying
    values of trademark intangible assets at its

Reef

®

and

lucy

®

business units exceeded their fair values. Accordingly, VF
    recorded noncash impairment charges totaling $122.0 million
    ($114.4 million net of related income tax benefits) to
    reduce the carrying values of goodwill and trademark intangible
    assets of these business units to their fair values. Of this
    total,

Reef

®

represented $36.7 million,

Nautica

®

represented $58.5 million, and

lucy

®

represented $26.8 million (in each case, 23%, 14% and 26%
    of its combined goodwill and nonamortized trademark intangible
    assets). For additional information, see Notes H and U to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements and the “Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates” section below.
    References to financial results excluding the impact of the
    impairment charge reflect non-GAAP measures and are addressed
    below in the “Non-GAAP Financial Information”
    section.

Interest income decreased $3.9 million in 2009 and
    $3.2 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates.
    Interest expense (including bank fees and amortization of
    deferred costs and a hedging gain) decreased $8.1 million
    in 2009 due to reduced short-term borrowing levels and lower
    interest rates. Interest expense increased $21.9 million in
    2008 due to an increase in debt related to the issuance of
    $600.0 million of senior long-term notes in October 2007 to
    fund our 2007 acquisitions. This increase was partially offset
    by lower short-term borrowing rates. Average interest-bearing
    debt outstanding totaled approximately $1,364 million for
    2009, $1,454 million for 2008 and


$1,080 million for 2007. The weighted average interest rate
    on outstanding debt was 6.1% for 2009, 6.3% for 2008 and 6.4%
    for 2007.

The effective income tax rate was 29.9% in 2009 and 26.2%
    excluding the impairment charge discussed above. These rates
    compared with 28.9% in 2008 and 32.3% in 2007. During 2009, we
    recorded tax benefits of $17.5 million related to favorable
    outcomes of U.S. state tax audits and from expirations of
    statutes of limitations in several U.S. state and
    international jurisdictions where accruals for uncertain tax
    positions had been recorded. These items lowered our 2009 annual
    tax rate by 2.7%. During 2008, we recorded tax benefits of
    $24.6 million related primarily to favorable outcomes of
    foreign tax audits, expirations of statutes of limitations in
    foreign jurisdictions and other state tax benefits that lowered
    our 2008 annual tax rate by 2.9%. In addition, during 2008, we
    recorded tax benefits of $11.5 million to reflect updated
    assessments of previously accrued amounts, which lowered our
    2008 annual tax rate by 1.4%. During 2007, we recorded tax
    benefits of $12.0 million related primarily to expirations
    of statutes of limitations in several international
    jurisdictions that lowered our 2007 annual tax rate by 1.3%. The
    remaining declines in the effective income tax rate in 2009
    (excluding the impairment charge) from 2008 and in 2008 from
    2007 were primarily attributed to growth in our international
    businesses in jurisdictions having effective tax rates that are
    substantially lower than the United States.

Net Income Attributable to VF Corporation decreased to
    $461.3 million in 2009 from $602.7 million in 2008,
    while earnings per share decreased to $4.13 in 2009 from $5.42
    in 2008. (All per share amounts are presented on a diluted
    basis.) Earnings per share in 2009 were $5.16 excluding a $1.03
    impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets. Earnings
    per share in 2009 were also negatively impacted by
    (i) incremental pension expense in our defined benefit
    pension plans of $0.48 over the 2008 level and (ii) an
    unfavorable impact of $0.18, compared with 2008, from
    translating foreign currencies into a stronger U.S. dollar.
    Earnings per share in 2009 benefited from the absence of
    nonrecurring charges of $0.30 per share for cost reduction
    actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Net Income Attributable to VF Corporation decreased 2% to
    $602.7 million in 2008 from $613.2 million in 2007,
    while earnings per share increased to $5.42 in 2008 from $5.41
    in 2007. Cost reduction actions taken during the fourth quarter
    of 2008 lowered earnings per share by $0.30. Cost reduction
    actions completed in 2007, partially offset by the gain on
    exiting the

H.I.S

®

business, reduced 2007 earnings per share by $0.06. In
    translating foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar, the
    weaker U.S. dollar had a $0.15 favorable impact on earnings
    per share in 2008 compared with 2007. Discrete tax items
    accounted for an incremental benefit of $0.16 in 2008 earnings
    per share over 2007. Earnings per share increased slightly in
    2008 on lower Income from Continuing Operations due to the
    reduced number of diluted shares outstanding in 2008.

Information
    by Business Segment

For business segment reporting purposes, Coalition Revenues and
    Coalition Profit represent net sales, royalty income and
    operating expenses under the direct control of an individual
    coalition, along with its share of centralized corporate
    expenses directly related to the coalition and amortization of
    acquisition-related intangible assets. Corporate expenses not
    apportioned to the coalitions, impairment charges for goodwill
    and intangible assets, net interest expense and a significant
    portion of our pension expense are excluded from Coalition
    Profit.

See Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
    summary of our results of operations and other information by
    coalition, along with a reconciliation of Coalition Profit to
    Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes. To
    leverage the scale of VF, there are a number of functions that
    are shared across all coalitions. Accordingly, coalition results
    are not necessarily indicative of operating results that would
    have been reported had each business coalition been an
    independent, stand-alone entity during the periods presented.
    Further, VF’s presentation of Coalition Profit may not be
    comparable with similar measures used by other companies.

Coalition Revenues in 2009 increased slightly on a reported
    basis compared with 2008 and 3% on a constant currency basis.
    Reported global revenues of the two largest brands in this
    coalition increased in 2009 —

The North
    Face

®

by 6% (including a negative impact of 3% from foreign currency
    translation) and

Vans

®

by 5% (including a negative impact of 2% from foreign currency
    translation). In addition, revenues in Asia increased by more
    than 50%, largely due to increases in the

Vans

®

brand, which was just introduced into China in 2008. These
    increases were offset by the impact of foreign currency
    translation and revenue declines in the other coalition
    businesses.

Coalition Revenues increased in 2008 led by global unit gains
    from strong consumer demand for our

The North
    Face

®

,

Vans

®

,

Kipling

®

,

Napapijri

®

and

Eastpak

®

brands. Growth in these brands, particularly

The North
    Face

®

and

Vans

®

,

    included geographic expansion and the opening of additional
    owned retail locations. Domestic revenues for our outdoor and
    action sports businesses increased 11%, while international
    revenues increased 21% with the favorable effects of foreign
    currency accounting for 6% of this increase.

Approximately one-half of the operating margin improvement in
    2009 over 2008 resulted from increased gross margins in our
    outdoor and action sports businesses, with their
    direct-to-consumer revenues making up a larger portion of total
    Coalition Revenues in 2009. In addition, the 2009 operating
    margin comparison benefited by 0.3% from an $8.3 million
    nonrecurring charge in 2008 related to cost reduction actions.
    The remainder of the operating margin improvement in 2009 over
    2008 was due to lower spending, partially offset by continued
    investments to expand the direct-to-consumer business.

The increase in operating margin in 2008 over 2007 was driven by
    higher revenues, resulting in improved leverage of operating
    expenses, and growth in our international and direct-to-consumer
    operations, where operating margins are higher. These
    improvements were partially offset by the charge related to cost
    reduction actions mentioned above.

The Jeanswear Coalition consists of our global jeanswear
    businesses, led by the

Wrangler

®

and

Lee

®

brands.

Domestic jeanswear revenues declined 4% in 2009 from 2008 due
    primarily to a difficult retail environment, including the loss
    of volume from customers who filed for bankruptcy in 2008 and a
    reduction in noncore

Riders

®

brand plus size and seasonal programs. Despite these reductions,
    we believe that we are gaining market share in our

Wrangler

®

men’s,

Lee

®

men’s and women’s, and core

Riders

®

women’s businesses, driven by the success of new product
    innovation. Domestic jeanswear revenues decreased 8% in 2008
    from 2007 due to a very difficult retail environment caused by
    the deteriorating global economy that impacted the Lee, mass
    market and western specialty businesses.

Jeanswear revenues in international markets, including Europe,
    Canada, Mexico, Latin America and Asia, declined 18% in 2009
    from 2008, with 8% of the decline resulting from the negative
    impact of foreign currency translation. The remainder of the
    decline was driven by recessionary conditions, especially in
    Europe, and the decision earlier in 2009 to exit our mass market
    jeans business in Europe. These declines were partially offset
    by a 14% increase in jeanswear revenues in Asia.

Jeanswear revenues in international markets increased 2% in 2008
    over 2007. Foreign currency translation positively impacted
    international jeanswear 2008 revenues by 5%. Therefore, revenues
    on a constant currency basis were down in 2008, reflecting
    difficult economic conditions in key European countries and the
    sale of the

H.I.S

®

business in 2007, which accounted for $25 million of
    revenues in that year. These declines were partially offset by
    revenue growth in our Asia business.


The Jeanswear operating margin comparison in 2009 benefited by
    1.0% from nonrecurring charges in 2008 of $27.3 million
    related to cost reduction actions. The negative impact of higher
    distressed inventory provisions in our European businesses in
    2009 was offset by lower spending across the coalition due in
    part to the cost reduction actions taken in 2008.

Jeanswear operating margin in 2008 was negatively impacted
    compared with 2007 due to the charges in 2008 discussed above,
    lower revenues that negatively impacted the expense to revenue
    ratio, increased promotional activities and higher product
    costs. The 2007 operating margin was favorably impacted by 0.2%
    related to the gain on the sale of

H.I.S

®

trademarks and related intellectual property during that year.

The Imagewear Coalition consists of VF’s Image division
    (occupational apparel and uniforms) and the Licensed Sports
    division (owned and licensed high profile sports and lifestyle
    apparel).

Image apparel revenues declined 17% in 2009 from 2008 due to
    rising unemployment, particularly in the manufacturing and
    petrochemical sectors. Licensed Sports revenues were down 8% in
    2009 from 2008, resulting from lower attendance at sporting
    events and the overall weak retail environment and the highly
    discretionary nature of consumer spending on these products.
    Coalition Revenues were flat in both our Image and Licensed
    Sports divisions in 2008 compared with 2007.

Operating margin declined in 2009 from 2008 due to revenue
    declines that negatively impacted the expense to revenue ratio
    and economic factors that affected obligations under royalty
    agreements in our Licensed Sports division.

The operating margin decline in 2008 from 2007 reflected
    difficult market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008 that
    especially affected consumer spending in our Licensed Sports
    division. In addition, the 2008 operating results included a
    $2.0 million nonrecurring charge for cost reduction
    activities that negatively impacted the operating margin by 0.2%
    and additional investments in advertising that accounted for
    0.4% of the margin decline.

The Sportswear Coalition consists of our

Nautica

®

lifestyle brand and the

Kipling

®

brand business in North America (whereas the

Kipling

®

brand is managed as part of the Outdoor & Action
    Sports Coalition outside North America).

The decline in Coalition Revenues in 2009 from 2008 was driven
    by a 13% decrease in

Nautica

®

brand revenues. The decline in the Nautica business resulted
    from difficult market conditions in the department store channel
    and lower volume in our retail outlet stores.

Coalition Revenues were down 7% in 2008 compared with 2007, with
    an 11% decrease in our

Nautica

®

brand revenues partially offset by a double-digit revenue gain
    in our

Kipling

®

brand businesses. The decline in the Nautica business resulted
    from the very challenging department and outlet store trends
    mentioned above and the exit in early 2008 of our women’s
    wholesale business.


Sportswear Coalition operating margin improved in 2009 from 2008
    due to aggressive cost and inventory reduction actions in our
    Nautica business. Also, the 2009 operating margin comparison
    benefited by 1.0% from $5.8 million in nonrecurring charges
    in 2008 related to cost reduction actions, including the exit of
    the

Nautica

®

women’s wholesale sportswear business.

Sportswear Coalition operating margin declined in 2008 from 2007
    due to lower

Nautica

®

brand revenues that negatively impacted the expense to revenue
    ratio and increased markdown activity related to a highly
    promotional retail environment. In addition, as mentioned above,
    the 2008 operating results included nonrecurring charges for
    cost reduction actions that negatively impacted the operating
    margin by 1.0%.

brands comprised of the earnings from our one-third equity
    investment from June 2008 through March 2009, when the remaining
    two-thirds equity interest was purchased, and the consolidated
    operating results thereafter.

The increase in Coalition Revenues in 2009 was driven by the
    acquisition of the

Splendid

®

and

Ella
    Moss

®

brands in March 2009. This increase was partially offset by an
    8% decline in our global

7 For All

®

brand revenues, driven by challenging conditions in the
    U.S. upper tier department and specialty store channel. We
    did experience growth in both the

7 For All

Asia business, where revenues nearly doubled, and the
    direct-to-consumer business, where revenues more than tripled.
    We continued to expand this brand’s reach with 21 retail
    store openings in 2009.

The increase in Coalition Revenues in 2008 was due to a full
    year of ownership of the

Operating margin was negatively impacted in 2009 compared with

    1.5% from nonrecurring charges in 2008 related to an unremitted

brands in 2009 were above the coalition average at 16% and 20%,
    respectively.

The operating margin decline in 2008 from 2007 reflects high
    levels of promotion and markdown-related expenses as a result of
    the significant impact of the economic downturn on the more
    upscale department stores. In addition, as mentioned above, the
    2008 operating results included nonrecurring charges that
    negatively impacted operating margin by 1.5%.

The Other business segment includes the VF Outlet business,
    which is a group of VF-operated retail outlet stores in the
    United States that sell a broad selection of excess quantities
    of VF products and other branded products. Revenues and profits
    of VF products are reported as part of the operating results of
    the applicable coalitions, while revenues and profits of non-VF
    products (primarily women’s intimate apparel,
    childrenswear, hosiery, underwear and accessories, which provide
    a broader selection of merchandise to attract consumer traffic)
    are reported in this business segment. Revenues in the Other
    business segment declined in 2009 due to the impact of the
    economic recession on consumer spending.

Reconciliation
    of Coalition Profit to Consolidated Income from Continuing
    Operations Before Income Taxes:

There are three types of costs necessary to reconcile total
    Coalition Profit, as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, to
    Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes. These
    costs, discussed below, are Impairment of Goodwill and
    Trademarks, Interest and Corporate and Other Expenses. See also
    Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Impairment of Goodwill and Trademarks was discussed in the
    previous “Consolidated Statements of Income” section.
    These charges resulted from our annual impairment review of
    these assets.

Interest Expense, Net was discussed in the previous
    “Consolidated Statements of Income” section. Interest
    is excluded from Coalition Profit because substantially all of
    our financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are
    not under the control of coalition management.

Corporate and Other Expenses consists of corporate
    headquarters’ and similar costs that are not apportioned to
    the operating coalitions. These expenses are summarized as
    follows:

Information Systems and Shared Services

—
    Included are costs of our management information systems and our
    centralized shared services center, which includes common
    financial, supply chain, human resources and customer management
    services that support our worldwide operations. Operating costs
    of information systems and shared services are charged to the
    coalitions based on utilization of those services, such as
    minutes of computer processing time, number of transactions or
    number of users. Costs to develop new computer applications that
    will be used across VF are not allocated to the coalitions. The
    decrease in information systems and shared services costs in
    2009 from 2008 is primarily due to reductions in third-party
    data center charges and common systems amortization. The
    decrease in information systems and shared services costs in
    2008 from 2007 resulted primarily from information systems costs
    incurred in 2007 for transition services provided to the
    acquirer of our intimate apparel business that did not recur in
    2008. The reimbursement of these costs from the acquirer in 2007
    is separately presented above.

Corporate Headquarters’ Costs

—
    Headquarters’ costs include compensation and benefits of
    corporate management and staff, certain legal and professional
    fees, and administrative and general expenses, which are not
    apportioned to the coalitions. The decline in corporate
    headquarters’ costs in 2009 from 2008 was due to reduced
    spending as part of our cost reduction efforts. The decrease in
    corporate headquarters’ costs in 2008 from 2007 resulted
    primarily from lower management incentive compensation.


Trademark Maintenance and Enforcement

— Legal
    and other costs of registering, maintaining and enforcing the
    majority of VF’s trademarks, plus related costs of
    licensing administration, are controlled by a centralized
    trademark and licensing staff and are not allocated to the
    coalitions.

Other

— This category includes (i) costs
    that result from corporate programs or corporate-managed
    decisions that are not allocated to the business units for
    internal management reporting, (ii) adjustments to convert
    the earnings of certain business units using the FIFO inventory
    valuation method for internal reporting to the LIFO method for
    consolidated financial reporting and (iii) other
    consolidating adjustments. The most significant of these other
    adjustments is related to the expense of our centrally-managed
    U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Coalition Profit of the
    business units includes only their current year service cost
    component of pension expense. Pension costs totaling
    $83.1 million for 2009, primarily representing amortization
    of deferred actuarial losses, were recorded in “other”
    expense. These costs were not significant in prior years.

Analysis
    of Financial Condition

Balance
    Sheets

Accounts Receivable decreased 9% in 2009 due to the sale of
    $74.2 million of selected accounts receivable, as discussed
    in the “Liquidity and Cash Flows” section below.

Inventories declined 17% in 2009, reflecting our aggressive
    management of inventory levels during the economic downturn.

Other Current Assets decreased at December 2009 from 2008 due
    primarily to a decrease in prepaid income taxes.

Property, Plant and Equipment was lower at the end of 2009
    compared with 2008 as depreciation expense exceeded our capital
    spending in 2009.

Intangible Assets increased in 2009 due to the Mo Industries
    acquisition in March 2009, partially offset by the impairment
    charge and amortization.

Goodwill increased in 2009 due to the Mo Industries acquisition
    in March 2009, partially offset by the impairment charge.

Other Assets decreased at December 2009 due to (i) the
    completion of the acquisition of Mo Industries in March 2009,
    resulting in the elimination of the $80.5 million equity
    investment in one-third of its stock, and (ii) a reduction
    in deferred income tax assets. These decreases were partially
    offset by an increase in the investment securities held for
    VF’s deferred compensation plans.

VF has a $1.0 billion senior unsecured committed domestic
    revolving bank credit agreement that supports issuance of up to
    $1.0 billion in commercial paper and a
    €250.0 million (U.S. dollar equivalent of
    $358.3 million) senior unsecured committed international
    revolving bank credit agreement. There were no borrowings under
    these credit agreements at December 2009 or December 2008.
    Short-term Borrowings under other international borrowing
    agreements were $45.5 million at December 2009 and
    $53.6 million at December 2008.

The decline in Accounts Payable from 2008 to 2009 is consistent
    with the decline in inventories discussed above. Accrued
    Liabilities decreased in 2009 due primarily to the payments of
    the obligations associated with the cost reduction actions taken
    in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Total Long-term Debt at December 2009 and December 2008 was
    comparable. At September 2009, $200.0 million of notes, due
    October 1, 2010, were reclassified to Current Portion of
    Long-term Debt.

Other Liabilities decreased due to the reduction in the
    underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans at the
    end of 2009, as discussed in the following paragraph. This
    decrease is partially offset by higher deferred income taxes and
    deferred compensation liabilities.

The global credit crisis and the related significant declines in
    global securities markets during 2008 resulted in a significant
    decline in the value of the investment portfolios of our defined
    benefit pension plans. As a result, our defined benefit pension
    plans are in an underfunded status, with our projected pension
    benefit obligations exceeding


the value of our plans’ investment assets. In December
    2008, the underfunded status of $414.9 million was
    recognized as a liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. To
    improve the funded status of our pension plans, we contributed
    over $200 million to these plans during 2009. Accordingly,
    the plans’ underfunded status recognized in our 2009
    Consolidated Balance Sheet was reduced to $250.9 million.
    See Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the
    “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section
    below for a discussion of asset, liability and equity balances
    related to defined benefit pension plans.

Liquidity
    and Cash Flows

The financial condition of VF is reflected in the following:

$

Current ratio

2.4 to 1

2.6 to 1

Debt to total capital

%

25.2

%

For the ratio of debt to total capital, debt is defined as
    short-term and long-term borrowings, and total capital is
    defined as debt plus stockholders’ equity. Our ratio of net
    debt to total capital, with net debt defined as debt less cash
    and equivalents, was 10.7% at the end of 2009.

VF’s primary source of liquidity is its strong cash flow
    provided by operating activities. Cash generated from
    operations, which was $973.5 million in 2009,
    $679.5 million in 2008 and $833.6 million in 2007, is
    primarily dependent on the level of Net Income, changes in
    accounts receivable, investments in inventories and other
    working capital components. Net Income was $458.5 million,
    $602.8 million, and $592.2 million in 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. The decline in Net Income in 2009 was
    primarily due to a noncash pretax impairment charge for goodwill
    and intangible assets of $122.0 million.

Operating cash flow for 2009 included $200.0 million of
    discretionary contributions to our U.S. qualified defined
    benefit pension plan. There were no contributions to this plan
    in 2007 or 2008 because of the funded status of the plan at the
    beginning of each of those years. Although VF is not required
    and does not currently intend to make a funding contribution to
    the domestic qualified plan during 2010, management is committed
    to returning each of our defined benefit plans to a fully funded
    status. VF has adequate liquidity to meet future funding
    requirements. We will continue to evaluate the funded status of
    our retirement plans and future funding requirements.

The net change in operating asset and liability components
    provided an increase to operating cash flow of
    $228.1 million in 2009, in contrast to reducing operating
    cash flows by $150.6 million in 2008 and $12.5 million
    in 2007. The positive cash generation from these components in
    2009 was driven by our aggressive management of inventory levels
    and the sale of selected accounts receivable discussed in the
    paragraph below. The changes in operating cash flow from other
    current assets resulted from an unusually high amount of prepaid
    income taxes at the end of 2008. Operating cash flow in 2008
    benefited from an additional week of collections on accounts
    receivable in the

rd

week

    of the fiscal year; that is, collections sharply exceeded credit
    sales in the additional week. Operating cash flow in 2007
    benefited from an unusually high accounts payable balance at the
    end of 2007, related to the timing of payments, that resulted in
    higher accounts payable disbursements in 2008.

During September 2009, VF entered into an agreement to sell
    selected trade accounts receivable, on a revolving basis, to a
    financial institution. This agreement covers the sale of up to
    $105.0 million of accounts receivable on a nonrecourse
    basis. Net proceeds of this accounts receivable sale program are
    recognized in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows as part
    of the accounts receivable component of cash from operations.
    The December 2009 balance of Accounts Receivable has been
    reduced by $74.2 million for amounts that had been sold
    under this program.

To finance ongoing operations and most unusual circumstances
    that may arise, VF anticipates relying on continued future
    strong cash generation. In addition, VF has significant existing
    liquidity from its available cash balances and debt capacity,
    supported by its strong credit rating. At the end of 2009,
    $985.2 million was available for borrowing under VF’s
    $1.0 billion senior unsecured committed domestic revolving
    bank credit facility, with


$14.8 million of standby letters of credit issued under the
    agreement. This credit facility is used primarily to support our
    seasonal commercial paper borrowings. Also at the end of 2009,
    €250.0 million (U.S. dollar equivalent of
    $358.3 million) was available for borrowing under VF’s
    senior unsecured committed international revolving bank credit
    facility.

We used cash of $212.3 million, $93.4 million and
    $1,060.6 million for acquisitions in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, which is net of cash balances in the acquired
    companies. These acquisitions were funded with existing VF cash
    balances as well as for the 2007 acquisitions short-term
    commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings. In 2007, we
    received $348.7 million in proceeds from the sale of our
    intimate apparel business.

Capital expenditures were $85.9 million in 2009, compared
    with $124.2 million and $113.9 million in 2008 and
    2007, respectively. Capital expenditures in each of these years
    primarily related to our retail stores, distribution network and
    information systems, as well as maintenance spending across our
    global supply chain. We expect that capital spending could reach
    $110 million in 2010. Capital spending will be funded by
    cash flow from operations.

During 2007, VF received $592.8 million in proceeds from
    the issuance of $600.0 million principal amount of
    5.95% senior notes due in 2017 and 6.45% senior notes
    due in 2037. Also during 2007, VF paid $78.1 million under
    the international bank credit agreement and $33.0 million
    in notes related to the Nautica acquisition. See Note L to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements.

At the end of 2009, VF’s long-term debt ratings were
    ‘A minus’ by Standard & Poor’s Ratings
    Services and ‘A3’ by Moody’s Investors Service,
    and commercial paper ratings were ’A-2’ and
    ’Prime-2’, respectively, by those rating agencies.
    Both agencies have a ‘stable’ outlook for VF. Existing
    long-term debt agreements do not contain acceleration of
    maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings.
    However, for the $600.0 million of senior notes issued in
    2007, if there were a change in control of VF and, as a result
    of the change in control, the notes were rated below investment
    grade by recognized rating agencies, then VF would be obligated
    to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal
    amount of notes repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid
    interest.

During 2009, 2008 and 2007, VF purchased 1.6 million,
    2.0 million and 4.1 million shares, respectively, of
    its Common Stock in open market transactions. The cost of these
    transactions was $112.0 million, $149.7 million and
    $350.0 million with an average price of $71.80 in 2009,
    $74.86 in 2008 and $85.03 in 2007. The primary objective of our
    share repurchase program is to offset, on a long-term basis,
    dilution caused by awards under equity compensation plans. Under
    its current authorization from the Board of Directors, VF may
    purchase an additional 11.6 million shares (including
    10.0 million shares authorized subsequent to the end of
    2009). We currently intend to repurchase at least
    3.0 million shares in 2010 and will continue to evaluate
    future share repurchases considering funding required for
    business acquisitions, our Common Stock price and levels of
    stock option exercises.

Cash dividends totaled $2.37 per common share in 2009, compared
    with $2.33 in 2008 and $2.23 in 2007. Our dividend payout rate
    was 46.0% in 2009 (excluding the effect of the noncash goodwill
    and intangible asset impairment charge), compared with payout
    rates of 43.0% in 2008 and 42.7% in 2007. On a longer term
    basis, we expect to pay dividends of approximately 40% of our
    diluted earnings per share. The current indicated annual
    dividend rate for 2010 is $2.40 per share.

We have other financial commitments at the end of 2009 that are
    not included in the above table but may require the use of funds
    under certain circumstances:

•

Funding contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are
    not included in the table because of uncertainty over whether or
    when further contributions will be required.

•

VF has entered into $84.5 million of surety bonds, standby
    letters of credit and international bank guarantees representing
    contingent guarantees of performance under self-insurance and
    other programs. These commitments would only be drawn upon if VF
    were to fail to meet its claims obligations.

•

Purchase orders for goods or services in the ordinary course of
    business that represent authorizations to purchase rather than
    binding commitments are not included in the table.


During 2009 VF met its obligations when due from cash flows from
    operations and, for seasonal needs, issuance of commercial
    paper; there were no borrowings under our domestic or
    international bank facilities during the year. Credit market
    conditions and the general contraction of liquidity in the
    United States and global capital markets during 2008,
    particularly during the last half of that year and continuing
    into early 2009, had a significant impact on the ability of many
    companies to access the commercial paper and other capital
    markets. VF was able to issue commercial paper for seasonal
    working capital needs during this period (although for generally
    shorter maturities and at higher spreads over U.S. Treasury
    interest rates than in prior years) reflecting our investment
    grade credit rating and a $1.0 billion committed revolving
    bank credit facility that supports our commercial paper program.
    If the commercial paper markets were not available, VF has a
    total of $1.3 billion of liquidity available under its
    domestic and international committed revolving bank credit
    agreements that do not expire until October 2012. Management
    believes that VF’s cash balances and funds provided by
    operating activities, as well as unused committed bank credit
    lines, additional borrowing capacity and access to equity
    markets, taken as a whole, provide (i) adequate liquidity
    to meet all of its current and long-term obligations when due,
    (ii) adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to
    maintain our dividend payout policy and (iii) flexibility
    to meet investment opportunities that may arise.

We do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated
    entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate
    off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes.

Risk
    Management

VF is exposed to a variety of risks in the ordinary course of
    business (discussed below), and we regularly assess these
    potential risks. We manage our exposures to these risks through
    our operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, by
    (i) taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures
    within VF, (ii) purchasing insurance from commercial
    carriers or (iii) creating offsetting positions through the
    use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial
    instruments are contracts whose value is based on, or
    “derived” from, changes in the value of an underlying
    currency exchange rate, interest rate or other financial asset
    or index. We do not use derivative financial instruments for
    trading or speculative purposes.

Insured risks

— We self-insure a substantial
    portion of our property, vehicle, medical, worker’s
    compensation, director and officer, and general liability
    exposures and purchase insurance from unrelated highly rated
    commercial carriers for losses in excess of exposures retained
    by VF.

Cash and equivalents risks

— VF had
    $731.5 million of cash and equivalents at the end of 2009.
    Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature
    within three months of their purchase. These investments consist
    of institutional money market funds that invest only in
    obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government and
    time deposits in highly rated U.S. and foreign commercial
    banks. Considering recent credit market conditions and the
    weakened financial condition of many banks and other financial
    institutions, we continually monitor VF’s cash equivalents
    and the credit ratings of VF’s financial institutions.
    Similarly, we monitor the credit quality of cash equivalents and
    fixed income investments in our pension plan portfolios.

Defined benefit pension plan risks

— VF is
    subject to funding risks of its defined benefit pension plans.
    Due to substantial pension plan investment portfolio losses
    incurred in 2008, VF recognized a significant liability
    representing the underfunded status of the plans and a
    significant charge to Stockholders’ Equity at the end of
    2008. We contributed over $200 million to the plans during
    2009 and are committed to returning the plans to a fully funded
    status, including making further contributions, if necessary, in
    future years. At the end of 2009, the underfunded status of the
    plans had improved to $250.9 million.

Interest rate risks

— We limit the risk of
    interest rate fluctuations on net income and cash flows by
    managing our mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt. In
    addition, we may also use derivative financial instruments to
    minimize our interest rate risk. Since all of our long-term debt
    has fixed interest rates, our interest rate exposure relates to
    changes in interest rates on variable rate short-term borrowings
    for seasonal working capital needs. These variable rate
    borrowings averaged approximately $220 million during 2009.
    However, any change in interest rates would also affect interest
    income earned on VF’s cash equivalents. Based on average
    amounts of borrowings having variable interest rates and cash
    equivalents during 2009, the effect on reported net income of a
    hypothetical 1.0% change in interest rates would not be
    significant.


Foreign currency exchange rate risks

— VF is a
    global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency
    fluctuations. Approximately 30% of our revenues in 2009 were
    generated in international markets. Substantially all of our
    foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than
    the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities in these foreign
    businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates. During 2007, we entered into an international
    bank credit agreement that provides for euro-denominated
    borrowings. Although there were no borrowings under this
    agreement during 2009, borrowings under the agreement could be
    used to reduce the exposure to currency rate changes for our
    euro-denominated net assets. Net advances to and investments in
    our foreign businesses, primarily in Europe, Latin America and
    Asia, are considered to be long-term, and accordingly, foreign
    currency translation effects on those net assets are deferred as
    a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in
    Stockholders’ Equity. We do not hedge these net investments
    and do not hedge the translation of foreign currency operating
    results into the U.S. dollar.

We monitor net foreign currency market exposures and in the
    ordinary course of business enter into derivative foreign
    currency contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate
    fluctuations for a significant portion of our forecasted foreign
    currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions.
    Use of these financial instruments allows us to reduce the
    overall exposure to exchange rate movements on VF’s cash
    flows, since gains and losses on these contracts will offset
    losses and gains on the cash flows or transactions being hedged.
    Our practice is to hedge a portion of our net foreign currency
    cash flows forecasted for periods of up to 20 months
    (relating to cross-border inventory purchases, production costs,
    product sales and intercompany royalty payments) by buying or
    selling primarily U.S. dollar contracts against various
    currencies. Currently, we use only forward exchange contracts
    but may use options or collars in the future.

If there were a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency
    exchange rates of 10% compared with rates at the end of 2009,
    the expected effect on the change in fair value of the hedging
    contracts outstanding would result in an unrealized loss on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet of approximately $90 million.
    Based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency
    exchange rate movements, the actual unrealized loss could
    differ. However, any such change in the fair value of the
    hedging contracts would also result in an offsetting change in
    the fair value of the underlying balance sheet positions
    impacted by the currency rate changes.

Counterparty risks

— VF is exposed to
    credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by
    counterparties to derivative hedging instruments. To manage this
    risk, we have established counterparty credit guidelines and
    enter into derivative transactions only with financial
    institutions with ’A minus/A3’ investment grade credit
    ratings or better. We continually monitor the credit rating of,
    and our hedging positions with, each counterparty. Additionally,
    we utilize a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize our
    exposure to potential counterparty defaults and will adjust our
    positions if necessary. We also monitor counterparty risk for
    derivative contracts within our defined benefit pension plans.

Commodity price risks

— VF is exposed to market
    risks for the pricing of cotton and other fibers, which may
    impact fabric prices. We manage our fabric prices by obtaining
    fixed price commitments for denim and other fabrics, in some
    cases for up to one year in advance. VF has not historically
    managed, nor do we currently intend to manage, commodity price
    exposures by using derivative instruments.

Deferred compensation and related investment security
    risks

— VF has nonqualified deferred compensation
    plans in which liabilities accrued for the plans’
    participants are based on market values of investment funds that
    are selected by the participants. The risk of changes in the
    market values of the participants’ investment selections is
    hedged by VF’s investment in a portfolio of securities that
    substantially mirrors the investment selections underlying the
    deferred compensation liabilities. Increases and decreases in
    deferred compensation liabilities are substantially offset by
    corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of
    VF’s investments, resulting in an insignificant net
    exposure to our operating results and financial position.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are
    appropriate to accurately and fairly report VF’s operating
    results and financial position in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States. We apply
    these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our
    significant accounting policies are summarized in Note A to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements.


The application of these accounting policies requires that we
    make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply
    judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, revenues, expenses, contingent assets and
    liabilities, and related disclosures. These estimates,
    assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience,
    current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under
    the circumstances. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions
    on an ongoing basis. Because our business cycle is relatively
    short (i.e., from the date that we place an order to manufacture
    or purchase inventory until that inventory is sold and the trade
    receivable is collected), actual results related to most of
    these estimates are known within a few months after any balance
    sheet date. In addition, we may retain outside specialists to
    assist in our evaluation in areas such as determining the fair
    value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities in a business
    acquisition, testing goodwill and intangible assets for possible
    impairment, equity compensation, pension benefits and
    self-insured liabilities. If actual results ultimately differ
    from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results
    of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become
    known.

We believe the following accounting policies involve the most
    significant management estimates, assumptions and management
    judgments used in preparation of our Consolidated Financial
    Statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside
    factors. We have discussed the application of these critical
    accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of
    our Board of Directors.

Inventories

Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value.
    Cost includes all material, labor and overhead costs incurred to
    manufacture or purchase the finished goods. Overhead allocated
    to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of our
    plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or
    abnormal production inefficiencies. Market value is based on a
    detailed review in each business unit, at least quarterly, of
    all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual
    style-size-color stockkeeping units (“SKUs”) to
    identify slow moving or excess products, discontinued and
    to-be-discontinued products, and off-quality merchandise. This
    review matches inventory on hand, plus current production and
    purchase commitments, with current and expected future sales
    orders. For those units in inventory that are identified as
    slow-moving or excess or off-quality, we estimate their market
    value based on historical experience and current realization
    trends. This evaluation, performed using a systematic and
    consistent methodology, requires forecasts of future demand,
    market conditions and selling prices. If the forecasted market
    value, on an individual style or SKU basis, is less than cost,
    we provide an allowance to reflect the lower value of that
    inventory. This methodology recognizes inventory exposures, on
    an individual style or SKU basis, at the time such losses are
    evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold.
    Historically, these estimates of future demand and selling
    prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to
    our timely identification and rapid disposal of these reduced
    value inventories.

Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis. We
    provide for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred
    since the last physical inventory date. Historically, our
    physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant.

Long-lived
    Assets

We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the
    fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed, with any excess purchase price recorded as
    goodwill. We evaluate fair value using three valuation
    techniques — the replacement cost, market and income
    methods — and weight the valuation method or methods
    based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances. The
    process of assigning fair values, particularly to acquired
    intangible assets, is highly subjective.

Our depreciation policies for property, plant and equipment
    reflect judgments on their estimated economic lives and residual
    value, if any. Our amortization policies for intangible assets
    reflect judgments on the estimated amounts and duration of
    future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets. In
    evaluating expected benefits to be received for customer-related
    intangible assets, we consider historical attrition patterns for
    various groups of customers. For license-related intangible
    assets, we consider historical trends and anticipated license
    renewal periods based on our experience in renewing or extending
    similar arrangements, regardless of whether there are explicit
    renewal provisions.


We review property and definite-lived intangible assets for
    possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying
    amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. We test for
    possible impairment at the asset or asset group level, which is
    the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. We
    measure recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or
    asset group by comparison with estimated undiscounted cash flows
    expected to be generated by the asset. If the total of
    undiscounted cash flows exceeds the carrying value of the asset,
    there is no impairment charge. If the undiscounted cash flows
    are less than the carrying value of the asset, we estimate the
    fair value of the asset based on the present value of its future
    cash flows and recognize an impairment charge for the excess of
    the asset’s carrying value over its fair value.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting of major
    trademarks, and goodwill are not subject to amortization.
    Rather, we evaluate those assets for possible impairment as of
    the beginning of the fourth quarter as part of our annual
    strategic planning process, or more frequently if events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than
    not that the carrying value of an asset may exceed its fair
    value. Fair value of an indefinite-lived trademark intangible
    asset is based on an income approach using the
    relief-from-royalty method. Under this method, forecasted global
    revenues for a trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would
    be charged to license the trademark (in lieu of ownership) from
    an independent party, and fair value is the present value of
    those forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark. If
    the fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeds its
    carrying value, there is no impairment charge. If the fair value
    of the asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment
    charge would be recognized for the difference.

We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill
    at each reporting unit having goodwill using a required two-step
    approach. Our reporting units are either our coalitions or a
    component of a coalition if that component is a business unit
    for which discrete financial information is available and
    reviewed by coalition management. Two or more business units may
    be aggregated for impairment testing if they have similar
    economic characteristics. In the first step of the goodwill
    impairment test, we compare the carrying value of a business
    unit, including its recorded goodwill, to the fair value of the
    business unit. We estimate the fair value of a business unit
    using both income-based and market-based valuation
    methodologies. The principal method used is an income-based
    method in which the business unit’s forecasted cash flows
    are discounted to a present value. In the market-based valuation
    method, the fair value of a business unit is estimated using
    multiples of revenues and of earnings before interest, taxes,
    depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) for
    (i) a group of comparable public companies and
    (ii) recent transactions, if any, involving comparable
    companies. We evaluate the range of fair values developed from
    the income and market-based methods and determine the best fair
    value estimate for our business unit. If the fair value of the
    business unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not
    impaired and no further review is required. However, if the fair
    value of the business unit is less than its carrying value, we
    perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to
    determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any. The
    second step involves a hypothetical allocation of the fair value
    of the business unit to its net tangible and intangible assets
    (excluding goodwill) as if the business unit were newly
    acquired, which results in an implied fair value of goodwill.
    The amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the
    recorded goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill.

The income-based fair value methodology requires
    management’s assumptions and judgments regarding economic
    conditions in the markets in which we operate and conditions in
    the U.S. capital markets, many of which are outside
    management’s control. At the business unit level, fair
    value estimation requires management’s assumptions and
    judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions
    on the specific business unit, along with assessment of the
    business unit’s strategies and forecasts of future cash
    flows. Forecasts of individual business unit cash flows involve
    management’s estimates and assumptions regarding:

•

Cash flows arising from future revenues and profitability,
    changes in working capital, capital spending, depreciation,
    amortization and income taxes for a 10 year forecast period.

•

A terminal growth rate of the business unit for years beyond our
    10 year financial forecast period. At 10 years, the
    forecast assumes that the business has matured and long-term
    growth levels have been reached. This terminal growth rate is
    generally comparable with historical growth rates for overall
    consumer spending and, more specifically, for apparel spending
    in the United States.


•

A discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in realizing
    the forecasted cash flows. A discount rate considers the
    risk-free rate of return on long-term Treasury securities, the
    risk premium associated with investing in equity securities of
    comparably-sized companies, beta obtained from comparable
    companies and the cost of debt for investment grade issuers.

Under the market-based fair value methodology, judgment is
    required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions.
    Management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment
    tests are representative of those that would be used by market
    participants performing similar valuations of our business units.

We evaluated our goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark
    intangible assets for possible impairment during the fourth
    quarter of 2009. Based on analysis of current and expected
    future economic conditions and our updated strategic plan for
    each of our business units, we concluded that the carrying
    values of goodwill at our

Reef

®

,

Nautica

®

and

lucy

®

business units and the carrying values of trademark intangible
    assets at our

Reef

®

and

lucy

®

business units exceeded their respective fair values.
    Accordingly, we recognized in our 2009 Consolidated Statement of
    Income impairment charges of $101.9 million to write down
    the carrying value of goodwill and $20.1 million to write
    down the carrying value of nonamortized trademark intangible
    assets. The total noncash charge of $122.0 million had an
    insignificant impact on our financial position and no impact on
    our liquidity or debt agreements. The charge was based on
    significant estimates and judgments by management; changes to
    the fair value assumptions used for the

®

and

®

business units potentially would have resulted in different
    goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges. See
    Notes G, H and U of the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for additional information about the impairment charges recorded
    for these business units.

For our other business units, the estimated fair values of those
    business units and the fair values of their trademark intangible
    assets exceeded their respective carrying values as of the
    beginning of the fourth quarter of 2009. Accordingly, no
    goodwill or trademark impairment charges were recorded for our
    other business units.

For our

Reef

,

Nautica

®

and

lucy

®

business units and for our other business units, it is possible
    that our conclusions regarding impairment of goodwill or
    trademark intangible assets could change in future periods if,
    for example, (i) overall economic conditions in 2010 or
    future years vary from our current assumptions,
    (ii) business conditions or our strategies for a specific
    business unit change from our current assumptions,
    (iii) investors require higher rates of return on equity
    investments in the marketplace or (iv) enterprise values of
    comparable publicly traded companies, or of actual sales
    transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting
    in lower multiples of revenues and EBITDA. A future impairment
    change for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material
    effect on our consolidated financial position or results of
    operations.

Stock
    Options

We use a lattice option-pricing model to estimate the fair value
    of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of
    the Board of Directors. We believe that a lattice model provides
    a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can
    incorporate (i) historical option exercise patterns and
    multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for
    each of several groups of option holders and (ii) inputs
    that vary over time, such as assumptions for interest rates and
    volatility. We performed a rigorous review of all assumptions
    and believe that the assumptions employed in the valuation of
    each option grant are reflective of our outstanding options and
    underlying Common Stock and of our groups of option
    participants. Our lattice valuation is based on the assumptions
    listed in Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

One of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is
    estimating the expected average life of the options before
    exercise. For each option grant, we based our estimates on
    evaluations of the historical and expected option exercise
    patterns for each of several groups of option holders that have
    historically exhibited different option exercise patterns. These
    evaluations included (i) voluntary stock option exercise
    patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of VF
    Common Stock and periods of time that options are outstanding
    before exercise and (ii) involuntary exercise patterns
    resulting from turnover, retirement and mortality.

Volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment. We
    based our estimate of future volatility on a combination of
    implied and historical volatility. Implied volatility was based
    on short-term (6 to 9 months) publicly traded
    near-the-money options on VF Common Stock. We measured
    historical volatility over a ten year period,


corresponding to the contractual term of the options, using
    daily stock price observations. Our assumption for valuation
    purposes was that expected volatility starts at a level equal to
    the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical
    volatility over the remainder of the ten year option term.

Pension
    Obligations

VF sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering
    most full-time domestic employees initially employed before 2005
    and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan that provides
    benefits that exceed limitations imposed by income tax
    regulations. VF also sponsors defined benefit plans covering
    selected international employees. The selection of appropriate
    actuarial assumptions for determination of our projected pension
    benefit liabilities and of our annual pension expense is
    significant due to the long time period over which benefits are
    accrued and paid. We annually update participant demographics
    and the expected amount and timing of benefit payments. We
    review annually the principal economic actuarial assumptions,
    summarized in Note N to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, and modify them based on current rates and trends.
    We also periodically review and modify as necessary other plan
    assumptions such as rates of compensation increases, retirement,
    termination, disability and mortality. We believe our
    assumptions are reflective of the participants in and benefits
    provided by the plans and result in the best estimate of the
    plans’ future experience. Actual results may vary from the
    actuarial assumptions used.

One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is
    the discount rate. (This discussion of discount rate, and the
    discussion of return on assets in the next paragraph, relate
    specifically to our U.S. pension plans, which comprise over
    90% of the assets and projected benefit liabilities of our
    combined domestic and international plans.) The discount rate is
    used to estimate the present value of future cash outflows
    required to meet our projected benefit obligations at each
    measurement date. The discount rate reflects the interest rate
    inherent in the price that VF could settle its projected benefit
    obligations at the valuation date. Our discount rate assumption
    is based on current market interest rates. We select our
    discount rate based on matching high quality corporate bond
    yields to the timing of projected benefit payments to be made to
    participants in our U.S. pension plans. We use the
    population of U.S. corporate bonds rated ‘Aa’ by
    Moody’s Investors Service or, if a Moody’s rating is
    not available, bonds rated ‘Aa’ by two other
    recognized rating services. From this population of over 500
    such bonds having at least $50 million outstanding that are
    noncallable/nonputtable unless with make-whole provisions, we
    exclude the highest and lowest yielding bonds. The plans’
    projected benefit payments are matched to current market
    interest rates over the expected payment period, and a present
    value is developed that produces a single equivalent discount
    rate that recognizes our plans’ distinct liability
    characteristics. We believe that those ‘Aa’ rated
    issues meet the “high quality” intent of the
    applicable accounting standards and that our 2009 discount rate
    of 6.05% appropriately reflects current market conditions and
    the long-term nature of projected benefit payments to
    participants in our domestic pension plans. This lower discount
    rate, compared with the rate of 6.50% at the end of 2008,
    reflects stabilization of the credit markets in the past year
    and the general decline in yields of high quality corporate
    bonds of all maturities. The discount rate for our plans may be
    higher than rates used for plans at some other companies because
    of our plans’ longer duration of expected benefit payments
    due to (i) a higher percentage of female participants with
    a longer life expectancy and (ii) a higher percentage of
    inactive participants who will not begin receiving vested
    benefits for many years.

Another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the
    expected long-term rate of return on investment assets in our
    domestic qualified plan’s pension trust. Our investment
    objective is to maximize the long-term return on a diversified
    portfolio of assets at an acceptable level of risk. These risks
    include market, interest rate, credit, liquidity and foreign
    securities risks. Investment assets are comprised of a
    diversified portfolio of domestic and international equity,
    corporate and governmental fixed income, real estate and
    commodity securities. We develop a projected rate of return for
    each of our investment asset classes based on several factors,
    including the estimated inflation rate, the premium to be earned
    in excess of a risk-free return, the premium for equity risk and
    the premium for longer duration fixed income securities. The
    weighted average of the projected long-term rates of return for
    the various classes of assets held by the qualified plan
    provides the basis for the expected long-term rate of return
    actuarial assumption. Our rate of return assumption was 8.00% in
    2009 and 2008 and 8.25% in 2007. The rate of return is a
    forward-looking assumption. While our actual compounded annual
    rate of return was lower than the 8.00% assumption for the
    trailing 10 and 15 year periods, our compounded rate of
    return since 1981 has exceeded 9%. We


have not changed the overall target mix of investment assets
    during 2009; however, we altered the investment mix to add
    commodities as a new asset class. Looking forward, we plan to
    increase the allocation of equity investments to international
    equity investments and reduce the allocation to domestic equity
    investments. As the qualified plan becomes fully funded, our
    intent is to lengthen the average duration of fixed income
    investments to more closely match expected benefit payments,
    thereby better matching the effect of interest rate changes on a
    portion of the value of our plan’s investment assets with
    the benefit obligations they are intended to fund. These changes
    in asset allocation should, over time, reduce the year-to-year
    variability of our domestic plan’s funded status and
    resulting pension expense. We will constantly challenge our
    plan’s asset allocation, giving consideration to changes
    that will appropriately balance anticipated investment returns
    with risk. Based on an evaluation of market conditions,
    projected market returns and planned changes in investment mix,
    we will be using a rate of return assumption of 7.75% for our
    U.S. plan for 2010.

The funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is
    reflected in the balance sheet as the excess (or deficiency) of
    pension plan assets compared with projected benefit obligations
    payable to plan participants. In 2008, there was a significant
    decline in the market value of our pension plan investment
    assets due to the global credit and financial market crisis,
    which resulted in the plans being underfunded by
    $414.9 million at the end of 2008. This underfunded status
    was presented in our 2008 Consolidated Balance Sheet by
    recognition of liabilities of that amount. Our underfunded
    status improved during 2009 primarily from substantial VF cash
    contributions to the plans totaling over $200 million and
    significant investment earnings on pension plan assets,
    partially offset by an increase in projected benefit obligations
    due to a decline in the discount rate during the year. The
    resulting underfunded status in our 2009 Consolidated Balance
    Sheet was $250.9 million, represented by $3.3 million
    of current liabilities and $247.6 million of noncurrent
    liabilities. The funded status of our plans recognized in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets could change significantly in future
    years depending on investment portfolio performance, the level
    of VF contributions to the pension plans, changes in the
    discount rate used to value projected benefit obligations or
    other factors.

Differences in any year between actual results and the
    respective actuarial assumptions (e.g., investment performance,
    discount rates and other assumptions) do not affect that
    year’s pension expense but instead are deferred as
    unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in accumulated other
    comprehensive income in the balance sheet. The substantial
    investment losses incurred in 2008 was the primary reason that
    the plans had over $450 million of pretax accumulated
    unrecognized actuarial losses at the end of 2008, which resulted
    in deferred actuarial losses of $291.0 million after tax in
    Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in our 2008
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. During 2009, investment returns in
    our pension plans substantially exceeded the actuarially assumed
    investment return, resulting in a deferred actuarial gain. This
    was partially offset, however, by a deferred actuarial loss in
    2009 from an increase in our projected benefit obligations
    resulting from a lower discount rate used to value those
    obligations at the end of 2009. Accordingly, our net pretax
    cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses of $431.5 million
    at the end of 2009 resulted in deferred actuarial losses of
    $266.0 million after tax in Accumulated Other Comprehensive
    Income (Loss) in our 2009 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our policy
    is to amortize any unrecognized actuarial gains and losses to
    pension expense as follows: amounts totaling less than 10% of
    the lower of investment assets or projected benefit obligations
    at the beginning of the year are not amortized; amounts totaling
    10% to 20% of projected benefit obligations are amortized over
    the expected average remaining service of active participants;
    and amounts in excess of 20% of projected benefit obligations
    are amortized over five years.

Pension expense recognized in our financial statements was
    $98.0 million in 2009, $10.8 million in 2008 and
    $13.1 million in 2007. This compares with the cost of
    pension benefits actually earned by our covered active employees
    (commonly called “service cost”) of $14.9 million
    in 2009 and an average of $17.7 million per year over the
    last three years. Pension expense for 2009 was significantly
    higher than the annual service cost because 2009 included a
    significant cost component for amortization of accumulated
    unrecognized actuarial losses (as discussed in the preceding
    paragraph). Looking forward, our 2010 pension expense will also
    include a significant cost component (but lower than in
    2009) for amortization of accumulated unrecognized
    actuarial losses. With this lower amortization cost component
    for 2010 and, more importantly, greater assumed earnings due to
    the sharp increase in plan assets during 2009 (including over
    $200 million of VF contributions), we expect our 2010
    pension expense to decline to approximately $66 million.


The sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on our 2009
    pension expense and on projected benefit obligations at the end
    of 2009, all other factors being equal, is illustrated by the
    following:

As previously mentioned, we made $200.0 million of
    discretionary contributions to our domestic qualified pension
    plan during 2009. VF is not required under applicable
    regulations, and does not currently intend, to make a
    contribution to the domestic qualified pension plan during 2010
    but does intend to make contributions totaling approximately
    $8 million during 2010 to its other pension plans. We
    believe that VF has sufficient liquidity to make contributions
    to our pension plans, as necessary, in future years to return
    the plans to a fully or substantially fully funded status.

Beginning in 2005, VF’s domestic defined benefit plans were
    closed to new entrants, which did not affect the benefits of
    plan participants at that date or their accrual of future
    benefits. Domestic employees hired after 2004, plus employees at
    certain acquired businesses not covered by those plans,
    participate in a defined contribution plan with VF contributing
    amounts based on a percentage of eligible compensation. Funds
    contributed are invested as directed by the participants. This
    defined contribution feature did not have a significant effect
    on our total retirement benefit expense over the last three
    years. However, on a longer-term basis, the service cost
    component of our defined benefit plans’ expense will
    decline as a percentage of our total retirement benefit expense,
    and the year-to-year variability of our retirement benefit
    expense should decrease.

Income
    Taxes

As a global company, VF is subject to income tax and files
    income tax returns in over 100 domestic and foreign
    jurisdictions each year. The calculation of our income tax
    liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex
    tax laws and regulations, which are subject to legal and factual
    interpretation and significant management judgment.

VF’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal,
    state and foreign tax authorities, and those audits may result
    in proposed adjustments. We have reviewed all issues raised upon
    examination, as well as any exposure for issues that may be
    raised in future examinations. We have evaluated these potential
    issues under the “more-likely-than-not” standard of
    the accounting literature. A tax position is recognized if it
    meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of
    benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Such
    judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements,
    court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Our
    income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent we
    prevail in a tax position or when the statute of limitations
    expires for a tax position for which accruals have been
    established, or to the extent we are required to pay amounts
    greater than established accruals. We do not currently
    anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate
    resolution of income tax uncertainties. There are no accruals
    for general or unknown tax expenses.

We have recorded $143.6 million of deferred income tax
    assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards,
    and we have recorded $99.2 million of valuation allowances
    against those assets. Realization of deferred tax assets related
    to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on
    future taxable income in specific jurisdictions, the amount and
    timing of which are uncertain, and on possible changes in tax
    laws and tax planning strategies. If in our judgment it appears
    that we will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income
    or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward
    periods, we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce those
    deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately
    realized. In addition, we have recorded $11.2 million of
    valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets
    unrelated to operating loss and capital loss


carryforwards. If in a future period we determine that the
    amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the
    net recorded amount, we would record an adjustment to income tax
    expense in that future period.

We have not provided U.S. income taxes on a portion of our
    foreign subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings because we
    have asserted that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested in
    the respective foreign jurisdictions. If we were to decide to
    remit those earnings to the United States in a future period,
    our provision for income taxes could increase in that period.

Non-GAAP Financial
    Information

VF is a global company that reports financial information in
    U.S. dollars in accordance with GAAP. Foreign currency
    exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by VF
    from translating our foreign revenues and expenses into
    U.S. dollars. These exchange rate fluctuations can have a
    significant effect on reported operating results and,
    accordingly, can affect the comparability of reported results.

To better explain our operating results, we use constant
    currency information, which excludes the effects of changes in
    foreign currency translation rates, to provide a framework to
    assess how our businesses performed relative to prior periods.
    Accordingly, we have provided supplemental constant currency
    financial information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, in
    the “Analysis of Results of Operations” section.
    Constant currency information represents the current year
    reported revenues after adjustment to eliminate the translation
    effects of changes in exchange rates. To calculate Coalition
    Revenues on a constant currency basis, revenues for the current
    year period for entities reporting in currencies other than the
    U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the
    average exchange rates in effect during the comparable period of
    the prior year (rather than the actual exchange rates in effect
    during the current year period).

We believe the following supplemental constant currency
    financial information is useful to investors to facilitate
    comparisons of operating results and better identify trends in
    our businesses:

In addition, we discuss operating results in the preceding
    “Analysis of Results of Operations” section excluding
    the impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets. We
    believe this non-GAAP financial


information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons of
    operating results and better identify trends in our businesses:

These constant currency and other non-GAAP performance measures

    to, our financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP.
    Also, this supplemental information may not be comparable to
    similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Cautionary
    Statement on Forward-Looking Statements

From time to time, we may make oral or written statements,
    including statements in this Annual Report that constitute
    “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
    federal securities laws. These include statements concerning
    plans, objectives, projections and expectations relating to
    VF’s operations or economic performance, and assumptions
    related thereto.

Forward-looking statements are made based on our expectations
    and beliefs concerning future events impacting VF and therefore
    involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We caution that
    forward-looking statements are not guarantees and actual results
    could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the
    forward-looking statements.

Known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that
    could cause the actual results of operations or financial
    condition of VF to differ materially from those expressed or
    implied by such forward-looking statements are summarized in
    Item 1A. of this Annual Report.

Item 7A.

    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures.

Conclusion
    Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures

Under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and the
    Chief Financial Officer, VF conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of VF’s
    “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

or

15d-15(e)

of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange
    Act”) as of January 2, 2010. These require that VF
    ensure that information required to be disclosed by VF in
    reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
    Commission’s rules and forms and that information required
    to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the
    Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to VF’s
    management, including the principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosures. Based on VF’s evaluation, the
    principal executive officer and the principal financial officer
    concluded that VF’s disclosure controls and procedures are
    effective.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

VF’s management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
    as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

VF’s management conducted an assessment of VF’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
    described in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework,

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
    assessment, VF’s management has determined that VF’s
    internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
    January 2, 2010. The effectiveness of VF’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2010 has
    been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
    registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
    which appears herein.

See “Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and
    Financial Statement Schedule” at the end of this annual
    report on

page F-1

for “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting.”

Changes
    in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in VF’s internal control over
    financial reporting that occurred during its last fiscal quarter
    that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
    materially affect, VF’s internal control over financial
    reporting.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of VF Corporation (“VF”) is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

VF’s management conducted an assessment of VF’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
    described in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework,

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
    assessment, VF’s management has determined that VF’s
    internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
    January 2, 2010.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of VF’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of January 2,
    2010 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
    independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
    their report included herein.

F-2

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of V.F. Corporation:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of V.F.
    Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) at
    January 2, 2010 and January 3, 2009, and the results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended January 2, 2010 in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
    statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
    Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects,
    the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with
    the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our
    opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    January 2, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for these financial statements and financial statement schedule,
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to
    express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial
    statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We
    conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

As more fully described in Note A to the consolidated
    financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it
    accounts for (i) noncontrolling interests effective
    January 4, 2009; (ii) uncertain tax positions
    effective December 31, 2006; and (iii) the measurement
    date related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement
    plans effective December 31, 2006.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Description of Business:

VF Corporation (and
    its subsidiaries, collectively known as “VF”) is a
    global apparel company based in the United States. VF designs
    and manufactures or sources from independent contractors a
    variety of apparel and footwear for all ages. Products are
    marketed primarily under VF-owned brand names. VF has
    significant market shares in outdoor and action sports apparel,
    jeanswear and sportswear. VF is also a leader in daypacks,
    backpacks and technical outdoor equipment and in occupational
    apparel.

VF markets these products to a broad customer base throughout
    the world. Products having various price points are sold through
    multiple channels of distribution, including specialty stores,
    department stores, national chains, mass merchants and
    VF-operated retail stores. VF’s ten largest customers, all

U.S.-based

retailers, accounted for 27% of 2009 total revenues. Sales are
    made on an unsecured basis under customary terms that may vary
    by product, channel of distribution or geographic region. VF
    continuously monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and
    has established internal policies regarding customer credit
    limits. The breadth of product offerings, combined with the
    large number and geographic diversity of its customers, limits
    VF’s concentration of risks.

Basis of Presentation:

All financial
    statements and related disclosures are presented in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)
    in the United States of America. The consolidated financial
    statements include the accounts of VF and its majority-owned
    subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions and
    balances. For consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly
    owned, the minority owners’ interests (noncontrolling
    interests) in net income, comprehensive income and
    stockholders’ equity are separately presented in the
    financial statements.

Investments in entities that VF does not control but has the
    ability to exercise significant influence (generally

20-50%

owned
    companies) are accounted for using the equity method of
    accounting. Equity method investments are recorded initially at
    cost in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Those
    amounts are adjusted to recognize VF’s proportional share
    of the investee’s earnings and dividends after the date of
    investment. VF’s share of net income of these investments,
    totaling $0.8 million in 2009, $7.3 million in 2008
    and $4.2 million in 2007, is included in Marketing,
    Administrative and General Expenses in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

In April 2007, VF sold its intimate apparel business consisting
    of its domestic and international women’s intimate apparel
    business units. Accordingly, the 2007 Consolidated Statement of
    Income and the 2008 and 2007 Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows present the intimate apparel businesses as discontinued
    operations. Interest expense was not allocated to the
    discontinued operations. Amounts presented herein, unless
    otherwise stated, relate to continuing operations. See
    Note C.

Fiscal Year:

VF operates and reports using a
    52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to
    December 31 of each year. All references to “2009”,
    “2008” and “2007” relate to the 52 week
    fiscal year ended on January 2, 2010, the 53 week
    fiscal year ended on January 3, 2009 and the 52 week
    fiscal year ended on December 29, 2007, respectively.
    Certain foreign subsidiaries report using a December
    31 year-end due to local statutory requirements. For
    presentation purposes in this report, all fiscal years are
    presented as ended in December.

Use of Estimates:

In preparing financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, management makes estimates and assumptions that
    affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements
    and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those
    estimates.

Reclassifications:

Certain prior year amounts
    have been reclassified to conform with the 2009 presentation.

Changes in Accounting Policies:

In June 2009,
    the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    issued the

FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification

tm

(the “ASC”) as the source of authoritative
    U.S. GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied to
    nongovernmental entities. The ASC also recognizes rules and
    interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”) as authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. The
    ASC, which

F-10

VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

became effective in 2009, supersedes all existing non-SEC
    accounting and reporting standards but does not change
    U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, references to standards issued
    prior to the codification have been replaced with a description
    of the applicable accounting guidance.

In September 2006, the FASB adopted new accounting guidance for
    the measurement date used to value pension plan assets and
    obligations. Accordingly, VF elected, effective at the beginning
    of 2007, to change its plans’ measurement date to December
    and recorded (i) a charge of $3.8 million (net of
    income taxes of $2.4 million) to Retained Earnings for
    pension expense for the period October to December 2006 and
    (ii) a credit of $22.5 million (net of income taxes of
    $14.0 million) to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
    (Loss) for the changes in plan assets and projected benefit
    obligations for that period. Further, in March 2009, the FASB
    issued new accounting guidance on disclosures for pension and
    other postretirement benefit plans. The new guidance expands
    disclosure requirements to provide information about an
    employer’s defined benefit pension plans, including the
    major categories and fair values of plan assets, investment
    policies and strategies, and concentrations of credit risk. See
    Note N.

In June 2006, the FASB clarified the accounting guidance for
    uncertainty in income tax positions. VF adopted the new
    accounting guidance by recording a cumulative effect charge of
    $2.3 million (net of $0.2 million income tax effect)
    to Retained Earnings at the beginning of 2007, a
    $2.8 million reduction in Goodwill and a $0.5 million
    reduction in unrecognized income tax benefits.

During 2009, VF adopted the FASB’s new accounting guidance
    on business combinations. The new guidance revises how business
    combinations are accounted for, both at the acquisition date and
    in subsequent periods. The new guidance changes the accounting
    model for a business acquisition from a cost allocation standard
    to recognition of the fair value of the assets and liabilities
    of the acquired business, regardless of whether a 100% or a
    lesser controlling interest is acquired.

During 2009, VF adopted the FASB’s new accounting guidance
    on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial
    statements. The new guidance requires information about the
    entity as a whole, with separate information relating to the
    parent or controlling owners and to the noncontrolling
    (minority) interests, and provides guidance on the accounting
    for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests.
    Upon adoption of the new guidance, the FASB required retroactive
    treatment for the presentation and disclosure requirements, with
    all other requirements to be applied prospectively. Accordingly,
    for VF’s previously issued financial statements:

•

Noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries were reclassified from
    Other Liabilities to a separate component of Stockholders’
    Equity.

•

Net income was adjusted to separately present net income
    attributable to noncontrolling interests.

•

Comprehensive income was adjusted to separately present
    comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

During 2009, VF adopted the FASB’s new accounting guidance
    for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The new
    guidance requires expanded disclosures related to (i) how
    and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (ii) how
    derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted
    for and (iii) how derivative instruments and related hedged
    items affect an entity’s financial position, operating
    results and cash flows. See Note V.

During 2009, VF adopted the FASB’s new accounting guidance
    on the determination of the useful life of intangible assets.
    The new guidance amends the factors to be considered in
    developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine
    the useful life of an identified intangible asset and requires
    expanded disclosures related to the determination of intangible
    asset useful lives.

F-11

VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

During 2009, VF adopted the FASB’s new guidance on
    subsequent events

,

which establishes general standards of
    accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the
    balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or
    are available to be issued. See Note X.

Foreign Currency Translation:

Financial
    statements of most foreign subsidiaries are measured using the
    local currency as the functional currency. Assets and
    liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated
    into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the
    balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at
    average exchange rates during the period. Resulting translation
    gains and losses, and transaction gains and losses on long-term
    advances to foreign subsidiaries, are reported in Other
    Comprehensive Income (Loss) (“OCI”). For a foreign
    subsidiary that uses the U.S. dollar as its functional
    currency, the effects of remeasuring assets and liabilities into
    U.S. dollars are included in the Consolidated Statements of
    Income. Net transaction gains of $21.3 million in 2009,
    losses of $18.9 million in 2008 and gains of
    $7.5 million in 2007, arising from transactions denominated
    in a currency other than the functional currency of a particular
    entity, are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Cash and Equivalents

are demand deposits and highly
    liquid investments that will mature within three months of their
    purchase. Cash equivalents consist of institutional money market
    funds that invest in short-term obligations issued or guaranteed
    by the U.S. government and short-term time deposits in
    U.S. and foreign commercial banks.

Accounts Receivable:

Trade accounts receivable
    are recorded at invoiced amounts, less estimated allowances for
    trade terms, sales incentive programs, customer markdowns and
    charge-backs, and returned products. Allowances are based on
    evaluations of specific product and customer circumstances,
    retail sales performance, historical and anticipated trends and
    current economic conditions. Royalty receivables are recorded at
    amounts earned based on the licensees’ sales of licensed
    products, subject in some cases to minimum annual amounts from
    individual licensees. VF maintains an allowance for doubtful
    accounts for estimated losses that will result from the
    inability of customers and licensees to make required payments.
    All accounts are subject to ongoing review for ultimate
    collectibility. The allowance considers specific customer
    accounts where collection is doubtful, as well as the inherent
    risk in ultimate collectibility of total balances. The amount of
    the allowance is determined considering the aging of balances,
    anticipated trends and economic conditions. Receivables are
    written off against the allowance when it is probable the
    amounts will not be recovered. There is no off-balance sheet
    credit exposure related to customer receivables.

Inventories

are stated at the lower of cost or market.
    Cost is net of purchase discounts or rebates received from
    vendors. Cost is determined on the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method for 75% of total 2009
    inventories and 77% of total 2008 inventories. For remaining
    inventories, cost is determined on the

last-in,

first-out (“LIFO”) method (primarily due to Internal
    Revenue Service conformity requirements where LIFO is used for
    income tax purposes). The LIFO method is used for jeanswear,
    wholesale sportswear and occupational apparel inventories
    located in the United States and Canada. The value of
    inventories stated on the LIFO method is not significantly
    different from the value determined under the FIFO method.
    Market value for materials and supplies is replacement cost.
    Market value for finished goods is expected net realizable
    value, which is based on the quantity and quality of
    inventories, forecasted demand, and historical and expected
    realization trends.

Long-lived Assets:

Property, plant and
    equipment, intangible assets and goodwill are stated at cost.
    Improvements to property, plant and equipment that substantially
    extend the useful life of the asset, and interest cost incurred
    during construction of major assets, are capitalized. Repair and
    maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Cost for acquired
    intangible assets is fair value based generally on the present
    value of expected cash flows. These expected cash flows consider
    the stated terms of the rights or contracts acquired and
    expected renewal periods, if applicable. The number of renewal
    periods considered is based on management’s experience in
    renewing or extending similar arrangements, regardless of
    whether the acquired rights have explicit renewal or extension
    provisions. Trademark intangible assets represent individual
    acquired trademarks, some of which are registered in over 100
    countries. Because of the significant number of trademarks,
    renewal of those rights is an ongoing process, with individual
    trademark renewals averaging 10 years. License intangible
    assets relate to numerous licensing

F-12

VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

contracts, with VF as either the licensor or licensee.
    Individual license renewals average four years. Costs incurred
    to renew or extend the lives of recognized intangible assets are
    not significant and are expensed as incurred. Goodwill
    represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the
    fair value of net tangible assets and identifiable intangible
    assets acquired. Goodwill is assigned at the business unit
    level, which at VF is typically one level below a reportable
    segment.

Depreciation of owned assets and amortization of assets under
    capital leases are computed using the straight-line method over
    the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from 3 to
    10 years for machinery and equipment and up to
    40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are
    depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or
    the lease term. Intangible assets having indefinite lives,
    consisting of major trademarks, and goodwill are not amortized.
    Other intangible assets, primarily customer relationships,
    contracts to license acquired trademarks to third parties and
    contracts to license trademarks from third parties, are
    amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from less
    than one year to 30 years. Amortization of intangible
    assets is computed using straight-line or accelerated methods
    consistent with the expected realization of benefits to be
    received. Depreciation and amortization expense related to
    producing or otherwise obtaining finished goods inventories is
    included in Cost of Goods Sold, and other depreciation and
    amortization expense is included in Marketing, Administrative
    and General Expenses. Assets held for sale are measured at the
    lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs of
    disposal. Upon retirement or disposition, the asset cost and
    related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed
    from the accounts, and a gain or loss is recognized based on the
    difference between the fair value of proceeds received and the
    asset’s carrying value.

VF’s policy is to review property and intangible assets
    with identified useful lives for possible impairment whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If
    forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset
    are not expected to be adequate to recover the asset’s
    carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess
    of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value.

VF’s policy is to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible
    assets and goodwill for possible impairment at least annually or
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. An
    intangible asset with an indefinite life (a major trademark) is
    evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the fair value of
    the asset with its carrying value. Fair value is estimated as
    the discounted value of future revenues arising from a trademark
    using a royalty rate that an independent party would pay for use
    of that trademark. An impairment charge is recorded if the
    trademark’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair
    value. Goodwill is evaluated for possible impairment by
    comparing the fair value of a business unit with its carrying
    value, including the goodwill assigned to that business unit.
    Fair value of a business unit is estimated using a combination
    of income-based and market-based valuation methodologies. Under
    the income approach, forecasted cash flows of a business unit
    are discounted to a present value using a discount rate
    commensurate with the risks of those cash flows. Under the
    market approach, the fair value of a business unit is estimated
    based on the revenues and earnings multiples of a group of
    comparable public companies and from recent transactions
    involving comparable companies. An impairment charge is recorded
    if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair
    value. See Notes H and U for information related to
    impairment charges recorded in 2009 for indefinite-lived
    trademark intangible assets and goodwill.

Derivative Financial Instruments

are measured at their
    fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains
    and losses are recognized as assets or liabilities,
    respectively, and classified as current or noncurrent based on
    the expected period of settlement. The accounting for changes in
    the fair value (i.e., gains and losses) of derivative
    instruments depends on whether a derivative has been designated
    and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and on the type
    of hedging relationship. The criteria used to determine if a
    derivative instrument qualifies for hedge accounting treatment
    are (i) whether an appropriate hedging instrument has been
    identified and designated to reduce a specific exposure and
    (ii) whether there is a high correlation between changes in
    the fair value of the hedging instrument and the identified
    exposure. A qualifying derivative is designated for

F-13

VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

accounting purposes, based on the nature of the hedging
    relationship, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a
    hedge of a net investment in a foreign business. VF’s
    hedging practices and related accounting policies for fair value
    hedges and for cash flow hedges are described in Note V. VF
    considers its foreign businesses to be long-term investments
    and, accordingly, does not hedge those net investments. VF does
    not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative
    purposes. Hedging cash flows are classified in the Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows in the same category as the items being
    hedged.

VF formally documents hedging instruments and hedging
    relationships at the inception of each contract. Further, VF
    assesses, both at the inception of a contract and on an ongoing
    basis, whether the hedging instruments are effective in
    offsetting the risk of the hedged transactions. Occasionally, a
    portion of a derivative instrument will be considered
    ineffective in hedging the originally identified exposure due to
    a decline in amount or a change in timing of the hedged
    exposure. In other cases, cash flow hedges of forecasted cash
    receipts are dedesignated as hedges when the forecasted sale is
    recognized. In those cases, hedge accounting treatment is
    discontinued for the ineffective portion of that hedging
    instrument or upon dedesignation, and any change in fair value
    is recognized in net income when it occurs.

The counterparties to the derivative contracts consist of
    financial institutions having A-rated investment grade credit
    ratings. To manage its credit risk, VF continually monitors the
    credit risks of its counterparties, limits its exposure in the
    aggregate and to any single counterparty, and adjusts its
    hedging positions as appropriate. The impact of VF’s credit
    risk and the credit risk of its counterparties, as well as the
    ability of each party to fulfill its obligations under the
    contracts, is considered in determining the fair value of the
    derivative contracts. Credit risk has not had a significant
    effect on the fair value of VF’s derivative contracts. VF
    does not have any credit risk-related contingent features or
    collateral requirements with its derivative contracts.

Revenue Recognition:

Revenue is recognized
    when (i) there is a contract or other arrangement of sale,
    (ii) the sales price is fixed or determinable,
    (iii) title and the risks of ownership have been
    transferred to the customer and (iv) collection of the
    receivable is reasonably assured. Net Sales to wholesale
    customers and sales through the internet are recognized when the
    product has been received by the customer. Net Sales at
    VF-operated retail stores are recognized at the time products
    are purchased by consumers. Shipping and handling costs billed
    to customers are included in Net Sales. Net Sales are recorded
    after reduction of estimated allowances for trade terms, sales
    incentive programs, customer markdowns and charge-backs, and
    product returns. Sales incentive programs with wholesale
    customers include stated discounts. Sales incentive programs
    directly with consumers include rebate and coupon offers. These
    allowances are estimated based on evaluations of specific
    product and customer circumstances, retail sales performance,
    historical and anticipated trends, and current economic
    conditions; historically, they have not differed significantly
    from actual results. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected
    from customers and remitted directly to governmental authorities
    are excluded from Net Sales.

Royalty Income is recognized as earned based on the greater of
    licensees’ sales of licensed products at rates specified in
    the licensing contracts or contractual minimum royalty levels.

Cost of Goods Sold

for VF-manufactured goods includes all
    materials, labor and overhead costs incurred in the production
    process. Cost of Goods Sold for contracted or purchased finished
    goods includes the purchase costs and related overhead. In both
    cases, overhead includes all costs related to manufacturing or
    purchasing finished goods, including costs of planning,
    purchasing, quality control, freight, duties, royalties paid to
    third parties and shrinkage. For product lines having a lifetime
    warranty, a provision for estimated future repair or replacement
    costs, based on historical and anticipated trends, is recorded
    when these products are sold. Sales incentives to consumers in
    the form of free products are included in Cost of Goods Sold.

Marketing, Administrative and General Expenses

include
    costs of product development, selling, marketing and
    advertising, VF-operated retail stores, warehousing, shipping
    and handling, licensing and administration. Advertising costs
    are expensed as incurred and totaled $329.1 million in
    2009, $399.1 million in 2008 and $362.1 million in
    2007. Advertising costs include cooperative advertising payments
    made to VF’s retail customers

F-14

VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

as direct reimbursement of retailers’ documented costs
    incurred for advertising VF’s products. Cooperative
    advertising costs, totaling $37.1 million in 2009,
    $42.1 million in 2008 and $39.0 million in 2007, are
    independently verified to support the fair value of advertising
    reimbursed by VF. Shipping and handling costs for delivery of
    products to customers totaled $188.2 million in 2009,
    $218.4 million in 2008 and $213.0 million in 2007.
    Expenses related to royalty income, including amortization of
    licensing intangible assets, were $14.5 million in 2009,
    $20.8 million in 2008 and $22.4 million in 2007.

Rent Expense:

VF enters into noncancelable
    operating leases for retail stores, distribution, office and
    other real estate and for equipment. Leases for real estate have
    initial terms ranging from 3 to 15 years, generally with
    renewal options. Leases for equipment typically have initial
    terms ranging from 2 to 5 years. Most leases have fixed
    rentals, with many of the real estate leases providing for
    additional payments based on sales volume or for payments of
    real estate taxes and occupancy-related costs. Contingent rent
    expense, based on Net Sales at individual retail store locations
    being in excess of a stated base amount, is recognized when the
    liability is probable. Rent expense for leases having rent
    holidays or scheduled rent increases is recorded on a
    straight-line basis over the lease term beginning when VF has
    possession or control of the leased premises. Lease incentives
    received from landlords and the difference between straight-line
    rent expense and scheduled rent payments are deferred in Other
    Liabilities and amortized as a reduction of rent expense over
    the lease term.

Self-insurance:

VF is self-insured for a
    substantial portion of its employee group medical, workers’
    compensation, vehicle, property and general liability exposures.
    Liabilities for self-insured exposures are accrued at the
    present value of amounts expected to be paid based on historical
    claims experience and actuarial data for forecasted settlements
    of claims filed and for incurred but not yet reported claims.
    Accruals for self-insured exposures are included in current and
    noncurrent liabilities based on the expected period of payment.
    Excess liability insurance has been purchased to cover claims in
    excess of self-insured amounts.

Income Taxes

are provided on Net Income for financial
    reporting purposes. Income Taxes are based on amounts of taxes
    payable or refundable in the current year and on expected future
    tax consequences of events that are recognized in the financial
    statements in different periods than they are recognized in tax
    returns. As a result of timing of recognition and measurement
    differences between financial accounting standards and income
    tax laws, temporary differences arise between amounts of pretax
    financial statement income and taxable income and between
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets and their respective tax bases. Deferred income
    tax assets and liabilities reported in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets reflect estimated future tax effects attributable to
    these temporary differences and to net operating loss and net
    capital loss carryforwards, based on tax rates expected to be in
    effect for years in which the differences are expected to be
    settled or realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is
    dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions.
    Valuation allowances are used to reduce deferred tax assets to
    amounts considered likely to be realized. U.S. deferred
    income taxes are not provided on undistributed income of foreign
    subsidiaries where such earnings are considered to be
    permanently invested. Accrued income taxes in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets include unrecognized income tax benefits,
    including related interest and penalties, appropriately
    classified as current or noncurrent. The provision for Income
    Taxes also includes estimated interest and penalties related to
    uncertain tax positions.

Earnings Per Share:

Basic earnings per share
    is computed by dividing net income attributable to VF
    Corporation common stockholders by the weighted average number
    of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. Diluted
    earnings per share considers the additional effect, if dilutive,
    of potentially dilutive securities such as stock options,
    restricted stock and restricted stock units. Stock options are
    included in diluted earnings per share when the average market
    price of VF Common Stock during the quarter exceeds the exercise
    price of the option. Performance-based restricted stock units
    are included in diluted earnings per share in the period in
    which the underlying performance and service conditions have
    been satisfied.

Legal and Other Contingencies:

Management
    periodically assesses, based on the latest information
    available, liabilities and contingencies in connection with
    legal proceedings and other claims that may arise from time to
    time. When it is probable that a loss has been or will be
    incurred, a loss, or a reasonable estimate of the loss, is

F-15

    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Estimates of
    losses are adjusted in the period in which additional
    information becomes available or circumstances change. A
    contingent liability is disclosed when there is at least a
    reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. Management
    believes that the outcome of any outstanding or pending matters,
    individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material
    adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards:

New
    accounting guidance issued by the FASB but not effective until
    after 2009 is not expected to have a significant effect on
    VF’s consolidated financial position, results of operations
    or disclosures.

Acquisitions

On March 11, 2009, VF completed the acquisition of Mo
    Industries Holdings, Inc. (“Mo Industries”), owner of
    the

Splendid

®

and

Ella
    Moss

®

brands of premium sportswear marketed to upscale department and
    specialty stores. This transaction resulted in VF acquiring the
    remaining two-thirds equity of Mo Industries for a purchase
    price of $160.8 million (consisting of $156.1 million
    of cash and $4.7 million of notes) and payment of
    $52.3 million of debt. In June 2008, VF had acquired
    one-third of the outstanding equity of Mo Industries for
    $77.4 million. The agreement included put/call rights to
    acquire the remaining equity during the first half of 2009 at a
    price based on the acquired company’s earnings. The initial
    investment was recorded in Other Assets and was accounted for
    using the equity method of accounting. The carrying value of the
    investment was $80.5 million at the time of the March 2009
    acquisition, consisting of the initial cost of the investment,
    plus the equity in net income of the investment to the date of
    acquisition. VF recognized a gain in the first quarter of
    $0.3 million from remeasuring its one-third interest in Mo
    Industries to fair value. The gain was included in Miscellaneous
    Income in VF’s Consolidated Statement of Income. This
    acquisition contributed $61.2 million to revenues and
    $12.0 million to operating earnings in 2009.
    Acquisition-related expenses were not significant. Operating
    results are reported as part of the Contemporary Brands
    Coalition.

On July 31, 2008, VF acquired 100% ownership of its former
    50%-owned joint venture that marketed

Lee

®

branded products in Spain and Portugal (“Lee Spain”).
    The cost of the additional investment was $25.4 million,
    consisting of $14.9 million in cash, plus the transfer of
    certain nonmonetary assets held by the former joint venture. The
    investment in the joint venture was accounted for using the
    equity method of accounting through July 2008, and Lee Spain is
    accounted for as a consolidated subsidiary subsequent to that
    date. Operating results are reported as part of the Jeanswear
    Coalition.

On February 28, 2007, VF acquired substantially all the
    operating assets of Majestic Athletic, Inc.
    (“Majestic”) for a cost of $131.5 million.
    Majestic holds exclusive on-field uniform rights for all 30
    major league baseball teams, including supplying each team with
    on-field

MLB Authentic
    Collection

tm

outerwear, batting practice jerseys, T-shirts, shorts and
    fleece. Majestic also markets

Majestic

®

brand baseball-related consumer apparel to wholesale accounts.
    On August 27, 2007, VF acquired lucy activewear, inc.
    (“lucy activewear”), a chain of retail stores
    marketing

lucy

®

brand women’s activewear, for a cost of
    $114.1 million. On August 31, 2007, VF acquired Seven
    For All Mankind, LLC (“Seven For All Mankind”),
    marketer of the

7 For All
    Mankind

®

brand of women’s and men’s premium denim jeanswear and
    related apparel products primarily in the United States and
    Europe, for a cost of $773.1 million. The lucy activewear
    business and the Seven For All Mankind business together formed
    the foundation for a new lifestyle-based coalition called
    Contemporary Brands. On January 26, 2007, VF acquired Eagle
    Creek, Inc. (“Eagle Creek”), maker of Eagle
    Creek

®

brand adventure travel gear that includes accessories, luggage
    and daypacks. In addition, on April 2, 2007, VF acquired
    the brand-related assets of a former licensee that had rights to
    market VF’s

The North
    Face

®

brand in China and Nepal (“The North Face —
    China”). Because the licensing arrangement represented an
    arms-length contract, no gain or loss was recognized at the
    acquisition date. The total cost of these acquisitions,
    collectively referred to as the “2007 Acquisitions,”
    was $1,070.3 million, plus the assumption of
    $11.6 million of debt.

Notes to

    Statements — (Continued)

In the Majestic acquisition, the fair value of the net assets
    acquired exceeded the purchase price by $14.0 million.
    Since there was a maximum of $10.0 million of contingent
    consideration based on growth in revenues that may result in the
    recognition of additional purchase cost, that amount was accrued
    as a deferred credit, with the remaining $4.0 million
    excess fair value at the acquisition date applied to reduce on a
    pro rata basis amounts initially assigned to noncurrent assets.
    Of the total contingent consideration, $5.2 million was
    earned in 2009 (payable in 2010), $3.3 million was earned
    in 2008 and $1.5 million was earned in 2007. Contingent
    consideration of $4.0 million and $5.1 million for
    Eagle Creek, based on a measure of profitability, was earned in
    2009 (payable in 2010) and 2008, respectively, and was recorded
    as Goodwill. In addition, contingent consideration of
    $0.8 million related to a prior year’s acquisition was
    earned and recorded as Goodwill in 2008, and an additional
    $1.7 million can be earned in 2011, which would also be
    recorded as Goodwill.

Management has allocated the purchase price of each acquisition
    to acquired tangible and intangible assets, and assumed
    liabilities, based on their respective fair values. The
    following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed for Mo Industries in
    2009 and Lee Spain in 2008 at their respective dates of
    acquisition:

trademarks and tradenames have indefinite lives. Amounts
    assigned to amortizable intangible assets relate primarily to
    customer relationships in each year, which are being amortized
    using accelerated methods over their estimated weighted average
    useful lives of 19 years. In the 2007 Acquisitions,
    $49.7 million of licensing contracts are being amortized
    using straight-line and accelerated methods over their estimated
    weighted average useful lives of 18 years.

Except for the Majestic transaction, the purchase price of each
    acquisition exceeded the fair value of the net tangible and
    intangible assets acquired, with the excess purchase price
    recorded as Goodwill. Factors that contributed to recognition of
    Goodwill included (i) expected growth rates and
    profitability of the acquired companies, (ii) the ability
    to expand the brands within their markets or to new markets,
    (iii) their experienced workforce, (iv) VF’s
    strategies for growth in sales, income and cash flows and
    (v) expected synergies with existing VF business units. The
    Mo Industries, Seven For All Mankind, lucy activewear, Majestic
    and Eagle Creek acquisitions are consistent with VF’s goal
    of acquiring strong lifestyle brands that have high growth
    potential within their target markets. The acquisitions of Lee
    Spain and The North Face — China gave VF control of
    its leading brands in additional international markets.
    Approximately $205.9 million of Goodwill in the 2007
    Acquisitions is expected to be deductible for income tax
    purposes.

Operating results of the acquisitions have been included in the
    consolidated financial statements since their respective
    acquisition dates.

Sale of Intimate Apparel Business Classified as Discontinued
    Operations:

In December 2006, management and the
    Board of Directors decided to exit VF’s domestic and
    international women’s intimate apparel business (formerly
    referred to as the Intimate Apparel Coalition, a reportable
    business segment). On April 1, 2007, VF sold the net assets
    of this business (except for an investment in marketable
    securities of an intimate apparel supplier) for
    $348.7 million, plus $28.8 million related to the
    business unit’s Cash and Equivalents. The transaction was
    consistent with VF’s stated objective of focusing on
    lifestyle businesses having high growth and profit potential.
    The results of operations and cash flows of the intimate apparel
    business are separately presented as discontinued operations.

VF recorded a charge of $42.2 million in 2006 for the
    difference between the recorded book value of the intimate
    apparel business and the expected net sales proceeds. In 2007,
    VF recorded an additional loss on disposal of $24.6 million
    due to changes in noncore assets sold, final determination of
    the sales price and income tax adjustments.

Summarized 2007 operating results for the discontinued intimate
    apparel business prior to its sale were as follows (in

    less employee termination and other exit costs, resulted in a
    $5.7 million pretax gain, which was recorded as
    $2.6 million of additional expense in Cost of Goods Sold
    and a reduction of $8.3 million in Marketing,

Represents reclassification from indefinite-lived Intangible
    Assets upon finalization of purchase price allocation.

VF completed its annual impairment testing for goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of
    2009. Based on (i) assessment of current and expected
    future economic conditions, (ii) trends, strategies and
    forecasted cash flows at each business unit and
    (iii) assumptions similar to those that market participants
    would make in valuing VF’s business units, VF management
    determined that the carrying values of goodwill and trademark
    intangible assets at its

Reef

®

,

Nautica

®

and

lucy

®

business units exceeded their fair value. Accordingly, VF
    recorded noncash impairment charges totaling $122.0 million
    in the Consolidated Statement of Income. These impairment
    charges consisted of $31.1 million, $58.5 million and
    $12.3 million to reduce goodwill at its

Reef

®

,

Nautica

®

and

lucy

®

business units to their respective implied fair values and
    $5.6 million and $14.5 million to reduce the

Reef

®

and

lucy

®

trademark assets to their respective fair values. The

Reef

®

business unit is a component of the Outdoor & Action
    Sports Coalition, the

Nautica

business unit is a component of the Sportswear Coalition, and

Short-term borrowings consist of international bank borrowings
    with a weighted average interest rate of 7.6% at the end of 2009
    and 15.0% at the end of 2008.

VF has a $1.0 billion senior domestic unsecured committed
    revolving bank credit agreement that supports issuance of up to
    $1.0 billion in commercial paper, with any unused portion
    available for general corporate purposes. This agreement, which
    expires in October 2012, has a facility fee of 0.06% per year.
    The agreement contains a financial covenant requiring VF’s
    ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated
    capitalization, as defined, remain below 60%. The agreement
    contains other covenants and events of default, including
    limitations on liens, subsidiary indebtedness, sales of assets,
    and a cross-acceleration event of default if more than
    $100.0 million of other debt is in default and has been
    accelerated by the lenders. If VF fails in the performance of
    any covenant under this agreement, the banks may terminate their
    obligation to lend, and any bank borrowings outstanding under
    this agreement may become due and payable. At the end of 2009,
    VF was in compliance with all covenants, and the entire amount
    of the credit agreement was available for borrowing, except for
    $14.8 million related to standby letters of credit issued
    under the agreement on behalf of VF.

In addition, certain international subsidiaries, with VF
    Corporation as guarantor, have a €250.0 million
    (U.S. dollar equivalent of $358.3 million at December
    2009) senior international unsecured committed revolving
    bank credit agreement, which expires in October 2012. The terms
    and conditions of the international bank credit agreement are
    substantially the same as those of VF’s $1.0 billion
    domestic credit agreement. At the end of 2009, VF was in
    compliance with all covenants, and the entire amount of the
    credit agreement was available for borrowing.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, management took a number of
    actions to realign VF’s cost structure to protect future
    profitability and to address the uncertainty posed by the
    economic crisis and recession that began in 2008. Costs totaling
    $41.0 million relating to these actions were charged to
    expense as follows: $5.0 million to Cost of Goods Sold and
    $36.0 million to Marketing, Administrative and General. Of
    the total, $35.1 million related to severance and benefits,
    and $5.9 million related to asset write-downs and lease
    exit costs. There was $40.1 million remaining to be paid at
    the end of December 2008 and $8.2 million at the end of
    December 2009, primarily in Compensation above.

All notes, along with any amounts outstanding under the domestic
    bank credit agreement and the international bank credit
    agreement (Note J), rank equally as senior obligations of
    VF. All notes contain customary covenants and events of default,
    including limitations on liens and sale-leaseback transactions
    and a cross-acceleration event of default. The
    cross-acceleration provision of the 2010 and 2033 notes is
    triggered if more than $50.0 million of other debt is in
    default and has been accelerated by the lenders. For the 2017
    and 2037 notes, the cross-acceleration trigger is
    $100.0 million. If VF fails in the performance of any
    covenant under the indenture that governs the respective

F-23

    CORPORATION

notes, the trustee or lenders may declare the principal due and
    payable immediately. At the end of 2009, VF was in compliance
    with all covenants. Existing long-term debt agreements do not
    contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes
    in credit ratings. However, for the 2017 and 2037 notes, if
    there were a change in control of VF and, as a result of the
    change in control, those notes were rated below investment grade
    by recognized rating agencies, then VF would be obligated to
    repurchase those notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount
    of notes repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. VF
    may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to
    (i) 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest to
    the redemption date, (ii) a premium for any excess of the
    U.S. Treasury rate over the stated rate for the notes, plus
    (iii) an additional 20 basis points for the 2017 notes and
    25 basis points for the 2037 notes.

The 6.00% notes, having a principal balance of
    $300.0 million, are recorded net of unamortized original
    issue discount. Interest Expense on these notes is recorded at
    an effective annual interest rate of 6.19%, including
    amortization of the original issue discount, deferred gain on an
    interest rate hedging contract (Note U) and debt
    issuance costs.

Capital leases and other included capital lease obligations of
    $37.3 million at the end of 2009 and $40.0 million at
    the end of 2008 at an effective interest rate of 5.1%.

The scheduled payments of long-term debt and future minimum

Retirement
    and Savings Benefit Plans

VF has several retirement and savings benefit plans covering
    eligible employees. VF retains the right to amend any aspect of
    the plans, or to curtail or discontinue any of the plans,
    subject to local regulations.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans:

VF sponsors a
    noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering
    most full-time domestic employees initially employed before 2005
    and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan that
    covers benefits earned that exceed limitations imposed by income
    tax regulations. VF also sponsors contributory defined benefit
    plans covering selected international employees. The defined
    benefit plans provide pension benefits based on compensation and
    years of service. The effect of these pension plans on income
    was as follows:

VF

Notes to

Accumulated benefit obligations at any pension plan measurement
    date are the present value of vested and unvested pension
    benefits earned through the measurement date, without projection
    to future periods. Projected benefit obligations are the present
    value of vested and unvested pension benefits earned, with
    projected future compensation increases.

Differences in any year between actual results and amounts
    estimated using actuarial assumptions are deferred and amortized
    as a component of future years’ pension expense. These
    unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are amortized to pension
    expense as follows: amounts totaling less than 10% of the lower
    of plan assets or projected benefit obligations at the beginning
    of the year are not amortized; amounts totaling 10% to 20% of
    projected benefit obligations are amortized over the expected
    average remaining service of active participants; and amounts in
    excess of 20% of projected benefit obligations are amortized
    over five years. Deferred actuarial losses and deferred prior
    service costs are recorded in OCI. The estimated amounts of
    Accumulated OCI to be amortized to pension expense in 2010 are
    $45.5 million of deferred actuarial losses and
    $4.0 million of deferred prior service costs.

Management’s investment objective is to invest the
    plans’ assets in a diversified portfolio of securities to
    provide long-term growth in plan assets that, along with VF
    contributions, will meet the plans’ benefit payment
    obligations. Investment strategies focus on diversification
    among several asset classes (in accordance with the target
    allocations presented below), a balance of long-term investment
    return at an acceptable level of risk and liquidity to meet
    benefit payments. Plan assets are generally liquid securities
    diversified across equity, fixed income, real estate and other
    asset classes. Funds are allocated among several independent
    investment managers who have full discretion to manage their
    portion of the investments, subject to strategy and risk
    guidelines established with each manager. The overall strategy,
    the resulting allocations of plan assets and the performance of
    individual investment managers are continually monitored.
    Derivative instruments may be used by investment managers for
    hedging purposes and by the commodity investment manager to gain
    exposure to commodities through the futures market. There are no
    investments in VF debt or equity securities and no significant
    concentrations of security risk.

The expected long-term rate of return on the plans’ assets
    was based on an evaluation of the weighted average of the
    expected returns for the major asset classes in which the plans
    invest. Expected returns by asset class were developed through
    analysis of historical market returns, current market
    conditions, inflation expectations, and equity and credit risks.

VF makes contributions to its pension plans sufficient to meet
    minimum funding requirements under applicable laws, plus
    discretionary amounts as considered prudent. VF made
    discretionary contributions totaling $200.0 million to the
    domestic qualified pension plan in 2009. VF is not required
    under applicable regulations, and does not currently intend, to
    make a contribution to the domestic qualified pension plan
    during 2010 but does intend to make contributions totaling
    approximately $8 million to the other pension plans. The
    plans’ estimated future benefit payments, including
    benefits attributable to estimated future employee service and
    compensation increases, are approximately $58.1 million in
    2010, $60.6 million in 2011, $63.6 million in 2012,
    $66.9 million in 2013, $70.5 million in 2014 and
    $407.3 million for the years 2015 through 2019.

Deferred Compensation Plans:

VF sponsors a
    nonqualified retirement savings plan for employees whose
    contributions to a tax qualified 401(k) plan would be limited by
    provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan allows
    participants to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation
    and to receive matching contributions for a portion of the
    deferred amounts. Expense under this plan was $3.7 million
    in 2009, $4.4 million in 2008 and $4.3 million in
    2007. Participants earn a return on their deferred compensation
    based on investment earnings of participant-selected mutual
    funds and VF Common Stock. Changes in the market value of the
    participants’ investment selections are recorded as an
    adjustment to deferred compensation liabilities, with an offset
    to compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements of
    Income. Deferred compensation, including accumulated

F-28

VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

earnings on the participant-directed investment selections, is
    distributable in cash at participant-specified dates or upon
    retirement, death, disability or termination of employment.
    Similarly, under a separate nonqualified plan, nonemployee
    members of the Board of Directors may elect to defer their Board
    compensation and invest it in VF Common Stock equivalents. At
    December 2009, VF’s liability to participants of the
    deferred compensation plans was $202.0 million, of which
    $19.0 million expected to be paid in 2009 was recorded in
    Accrued Liabilities (Note K) and $183.0 million
    expected to be paid beyond one year was recorded in Other
    Liabilities (Note M).

VF has purchased (i) specific mutual funds and VF Common
    Stock in the same amounts as the participant-directed investment
    selections underlying the deferred compensation liabilities and
    (ii) variable life insurance contracts that, in turn,
    invest in mutual funds that are substantially the same as other
    participant-directed investment selections. These investment
    securities and earnings thereon, held in an irrevocable trust,
    are intended to provide (i) a source of funds to meet the
    deferred compensation obligations, subject to claims of
    creditors in the event of VF’s insolvency, and (ii) an
    economic hedge of the financial impact of changes in deferred
    compensation liabilities based on changes in market value of the
    participant-selected investments underlying the liabilities. The
    mutual funds and life insurance investments are recorded at fair
    value. At December 2009, the fair value of the mutual fund and
    life insurance investments was $198.3 million, of which
    $19.0 million expected to be liquidated to fund payments to
    participants in 2010 was recorded in Other Current Assets and
    $179.3 million was recorded in Other Assets (Note I).
    The VF Common Stock purchased to match participant-directed
    investment selections is treated for financial reporting
    purposes as treasury stock (Note O), which is the primary
    reason for the difference in carrying value of the investment
    securities and the recorded deferred compensation liabilities.
    Realized and unrealized gains and losses on the mutual fund and
    life insurance investments (other than VF Common Stock) are
    recorded in compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements
    of Income and substantially offset losses and gains resulting
    from changes in deferred compensation liabilities to
    participants.

Other Retirement and Savings Plans:

VF also
    sponsors defined contribution retirement and savings plans. For
    domestic employees not covered by VF’s defined benefit
    plans or a collective bargaining agreement, VF contributes a
    specified percentage of an employee’s gross earnings to a
    qualified retirement plan. VF also sponsors 401(k) and other
    retirement and savings plans for certain domestic and foreign
    employees where cash contributions are based on a specified
    percentage of employee contributions. Expense for these plans
    totaled $17.4 million in 2009, $16.0 million in 2008
    and $14.2 million in 2007.

    at the end of 2008, and 10,042,686 treasury shares at the end of
    2007. The excess of the cost of treasury shares acquired over
    the $1 per share stated value of Common Stock is deducted from
    Retained Earnings. In addition, 241,446 shares of VF Common
    Stock at the end of 2009, 261,092 shares at the end of 2008
    and 284,103 shares at the end of 2007 were held in trust
    for deferred compensation plans (Note N). These shares held
    for deferred compensation plans are treated for financial
    reporting purposes as treasury shares at a cost of
    $11.0 million, $10.8 million and $11.8 million at
    the end of 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Stock-based
    Compensation

VF may grant nonqualified stock options, restricted stock units
    (“RSUs”) and restricted stock to officers, key
    employees and nonemployee members of VF’s Board of
    Directors under the amended and restated 1996 Stock Compensation
    Plan approved by stockholders. All stock-based compensation
    awards are classified as equity awards, which are accounted for
    in Stockholders’ Equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
    Compensation cost for all awards expected to vest is recognized
    over the shorter of the requisite service period or the vesting
    period. Awards that do not vest are forfeited. Compensation cost
    for stock option awards, which vest in equal annual installments
    over three years of continuous service, is recognized during
    each individual vesting period. Income tax benefits associated
    with stock option awards are computed under the short form
    method. Total compensation cost and the related income tax
    benefits for those awards recognized in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income were $36.0 million and
    $13.3 million for 2009, $31.6 million and
    $11.6 million for 2008 and $62.4 million and
    $23.0 million for 2007, respectively. Stock-based
    compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory was
    $0.2 million at December 2009 and $0.4 million at
    December 2008. At the end of 2009, there was $24.0 million
    of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested
    stock-based compensation arrangements, of which
    $17.2 million, $5.4 million, $0.6 million,
    $0.5 million and $0.3 million are expected to be
    recognized in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.

At the end of 2009, there were 4,656,854 shares available
    for future grants of stock options and stock awards under the
    1996 Stock Compensation Plan. VF has a practice of repurchasing
    shares of Common Stock in the open market to offset, on a
    long-term basis, dilution caused by awards under equity
    compensation plans.

Stock Options:

Stock options are granted at a
    price equal to the average of the high and low price of VF
    Common Stock on the date of grant and expire ten years after the
    date of grant. The fair value on the date of grant of each
    option award is calculated using a lattice option-pricing
    valuation model, which incorporates a range of assumptions for
    inputs between the grant date of the options and the date of
    expiration. The assumptions used and the resulting weighted
    average fair value of stock options granted are summarized below:

Volatility is a measure of the amount that the market price of
    VF Common Stock has varied or is expected to vary from period to
    period. Expected volatility over the contractual term of an
    option was based on a combination of the implied volatility from
    publicly traded options on VF Common Stock and the historical
    volatility of VF

F-30

VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Common Stock. The expected term represents the period of time
    that options that vest are expected to be outstanding before
    exercise. VF used historical data to estimate option exercise
    behaviors and to estimate the number of options that would not
    vest. Groups of employees that have historically exhibited
    similar option exercise behaviors were considered separately in
    estimating the expected term. Dividend yield represents expected
    dividends on VF Common Stock for the contractual life of the
    options. Risk-free interest rates for the periods during the
    contractual life of the option were the implied yields at the
    date of grant from the U.S. Treasury zero coupon yield
    curve.

The total fair value of stock options vested during 2009 was

    during 2007 was $20.5 million. Intrinsic value is the
    amount by which the fair value of VF Common Stock exceeds the
    exercise price of the stock option. The total intrinsic value of
    stock options exercised during 2009 was $37.7 million,
    during 2008 was $57.4 million and during 2007 was
    $53.3 million.

Restricted Stock Units:

VF has granted
    performance-based RSUs to key employees as a long-term
    incentive. Participants are eligible to receive shares of VF
    Common Stock at the end of a three year performance period. Each
    RSU has a potential final value ranging from zero to two shares
    of VF Common Stock. The number of shares earned by participants,
    if any, is based on achievement of performance goals for
    profitability, revenues and cash flow set by the Compensation
    Committee of the Board of Directors. Shares are issued to
    participants in the year following the end of each three year
    performance period.

VF has also granted nonperformance-based RSUs to key employees.
    Each RSU entitles the holder to one share of VF Common Stock.
    The RSUs vest generally four years after grant.

Dividend equivalents, payable in additional shares of VF Common
    Stock, accrue without compounding on the RSUs.

    with a value of $20.9 million were earned for the
    performance period ended in 2008, and 420,536 shares of VF
    Common Stock with a value of $32.8 million were earned for

Restricted Stock:

VF has granted restricted
    shares of VF Common Stock to certain members of management. The

As of the end of 2009, VF has not provided deferred
    U.S. income taxes on $792.7 million of undistributed
    earnings of international subsidiaries where the earnings are
    considered to be permanently invested. The undistributed
    earnings would become taxable in the United States if management
    decided to repatriate earnings for business, tax or foreign
    exchange reasons. If this were the case, U.S. income taxes
    would be provided net of foreign taxes already paid.

VF has been granted a lower effective income tax rate on taxable
    earnings in a foreign jurisdiction based on meeting certain
    increased investment and employment level requirements. This
    lower rate, when compared with the country’s statutory
    rate, resulted in an income tax reduction of $7.1 million
    ($0.06 per diluted share) in 2009, $12.6 million ($0.11 per
    diluted share) in 2008 and $15.4 million ($0.14 per share)
    in 2007. The tax status providing this benefit expired at the
    end of 2009. During 2008, VF entered into a new agreement with
    the tax authorities of that country that will result in a
    slightly higher effective income tax rate on taxable income in
    that subsidiary for 2010 through 2014. In addition, VF has been
    granted a lower effective income tax rate on taxable earnings in
    another foreign jurisdiction for the period 2010 through 2019.

VF has potential tax benefits totaling $69.6 million for
    foreign operating loss carryforwards, of which
    $53.6 million have an unlimited carryforward life. In
    addition, there are $29.4 million of potential tax benefits
    for federal operating loss carryforwards that expire between
    2017 and 2027 and $13.8 million of benefits for state

F-34

operating loss carryforwards that expire between 2010 and 2029.
    Some of the foreign and substantially all of the federal and
    state operating loss carryforward amounts relate to acquired
    companies for periods prior to their acquisition by VF. A
    valuation allowance has been provided where it is more likely
    than not that the deferred tax assets related to those operating
    loss carryforwards will not be realized.

Valuation allowances totaled $63.1 million for available
    foreign carryforwards, $13.3 million for available federal
    operating loss carryforwards, $8.4 million for available
    state operating loss carryforwards and $11.2 million for
    other foreign deferred income tax assets. During 2009, VF had a
    net increase in valuation allowances of $12.3 million
    related to foreign carryforwards and other deferred tax assets,
    $3.0 million related to state carryforwards and
    $6.6 million related to foreign currency translation
    effects, offset by a $5.0 million decrease related to
    federal capital loss carryforwards. In addition, VF has
    potential tax benefits totaling $30.8 million for federal
    capital loss carryforwards that expire between 2011 and 2014.
    Included in this amount is $19.4 million related to
    discontinued operations sold in 2007 (Note C), upon which a
    valuation allowance of $14.4 million was provided.

The unrecognized tax benefits and interest of $42.1 million

    effective tax rate.

VF files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as
    well as separate and combined income tax returns in numerous
    state and foreign jurisdictions. In the United States, the
    Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) examination of tax
    years 2002 and 2003 was settled in 2008, and the IRS examination
    of tax years 2004, 2005 and 2006 was completed in 2009. VF has
    appealed the results of the 2004 to 2006 examination to the IRS
    Appeals office. The State of North Carolina completed its
    examination of tax years 1998 to 2002 during 2009. Tax years
    2003 to 2005 are under examination by the State of Alabama. In
    addition, the State of California has commenced an examination
    of tax years 2006 and 2007. VF is also currently subject to
    examination by various other taxing authorities. Management
    believes that some of these audits and negotiations will
    conclude during the next 12 months. Management also
    believes that it is reasonably possible that within the next
    12 months the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits
    may decrease by $23.8 million due to settlement of audits
    and expiration of statutes of limitations, all of which would
    reduce income tax expense. In addition, VF intends to file
    refund claims in various tax jurisdictions during 2010; it is
    possible such refund claims would reduce income tax expense in
    2010.

Note R —

Business
    Segment Information

For internal management and reporting purposes, VF’s
    businesses are grouped principally by product categories, and by
    brands within those product categories. These groupings of
    businesses are referred to as “coalitions.” These
    coalitions represent VF’s reportable segments, as described
    below:

•

Outdoor & Action Sports

— Outerwear,
    action sports apparel and footwear, daypacks and bags, and
    technical equipment

•

Jeanswear

— Jeanswear and related products

•

Imagewear

— Occupational apparel and licensed
    apparel

•

Sportswear

— Fashion sportswear

•

Contemporary Brands

— Premium lifestyle apparel

•

Other

— Primarily VF Outlets

Operating results of the John Varvatos business unit have been
    reclassified from the Sportswear Coalition to the Contemporary
    Brands Coalition consistent with a change in internal management
    reporting beginning in 2009.

Management at each of the coalitions has direct control over and
    responsibility for its revenues, operating income and assets,
    hereinafter termed “Coalition Revenues,”
    “Coalition Profit” and “Coalition Assets,”
    respectively. VF management evaluates operating performance and
    makes investment and other decisions based on Coalition Revenues
    and Coalition Profit. Accounting policies used for internal
    management reporting at the individual coalitions are consistent
    with those in Note A, except as stated below and except
    that inventories are

F-36

VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

valued on a FIFO basis. Common costs such as information systems
    processing, retirement benefits and insurance are allocated to
    the coalitions based on appropriate metrics such as usage or
    employment.

Corporate costs, other than costs directly related to the
    coalitions, impairment charges and net interest expense are not
    controlled by coalition management and therefore are excluded
    from the Coalition Profit performance measure used for internal
    management reporting. Corporate and Other Expenses (presented
    separately in the following table) consists of corporate
    headquarters expenses that are not allocated to the coalitions
    (including compensation and benefits of corporate management and
    staff, certain legal and professional fees, and administrative
    and general) and other expenses related to but not allocated to
    the coalitions for internal management reporting (including a
    portion of defined benefit pension costs, development costs for
    management information systems, costs of maintaining and
    enforcing certain of VF’s trademarks, adjustments for the
    LIFO method of inventory valuation and miscellaneous
    consolidating adjustments). Defined benefit pension plans in the
    United States are centrally managed. The current year service
    cost component of pension cost is allocated to the coalitions,
    while other cost components (primarily amortization of deferred
    actuarial losses of $83.1 million in 2009 and insignificant
    amounts in prior years) are reported in Corporate and Other.

Coalition Assets, for internal management purposes, are those
    used directly in or resulting from the operations of each
    business unit, such as accounts receivable, inventories and
    property, plant and equipment. Corporate assets include
    investments held in trust for deferred compensation plans and
    information systems assets.

Fair
    Value Measurements

Fair value is the price that would be received from the sale of
    an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., an exit price)
    in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly
    transaction between market participants. In determining fair
    value, the accounting standards established a three-level
    hierarchy that distinguishes between (i) market data
    obtained or developed from independent sources (i.e., observable
    data inputs) and (ii) a reporting entity’s own data
    and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an
    asset or liability (i.e., unobservable data inputs). Financial
    assets and financial liabilities measured and reported at fair
    value are classified in one of the following categories, in
    order of priority of observability and objectivity of pricing
    inputs:

•

Level 1

— Fair value based on quoted
    prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2

— Fair value based on significant
    directly observable data (other than Level 1 quoted prices)
    or significant indirectly observable data through corroboration
    with observable market data. Inputs would normally be
    (i) quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or
    liabilities, (ii) quoted prices in inactive markets for
    identical or similar assets or liabilities or
    (iii) information derived from or corroborated by
    observable market data.

F-40

VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

•

Level 3

— Fair value based on prices or
    valuation techniques that require significant unobservable data
    inputs. Inputs would normally be a reporting entity’s own
    data and judgments about assumptions that market participants
    would use in pricing the asset or liability.

The fair value measurement level for an asset or liability is
    based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to
    the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques should maximize
    the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
    unobservable inputs.

For the above financial assets and financial liabilities
    measured at fair value, cash equivalents represent funds held in
    institutional money market funds and time deposits at commercial
    banks. Derivative instruments represent net unrealized gains or
    losses on foreign currency forward exchange contracts, which are
    the net differences between (i) the functional currency
    value to be received or paid at the contracts’ settlement
    date and (ii) the functional currency value to be sold or
    purchased at the current forward exchange rate. Investment
    securities, consisting primarily of mutual funds (classified as
    Level 1) and a separately managed fixed income fund
    (classified as Level 2), are purchased to offset a
    substantial portion of participant-directed investment
    selections representing underlying liabilities to participants
    in VF’s deferred compensation plans. Liabilities under
    deferred compensation plans are recorded at amounts payable to
    participants, based on the fair value of participant-directed
    investment selections.

The carrying value of other financial assets and financial
    liabilities is their cost, which may differ from fair value. The
    carrying value of VF’s cash held as demand deposits,
    accounts receivable, life insurance contracts, short-term
    borrowings, accounts payable and accrued liabilities
    approximated their fair value. The fair value of VF’s
    long-term debt, including the current portion, was
    $1,202.6 million at the end of 2009, compared with its
    carrying value of $1,141.7 million, and was
    $1,027.4 million at the end of 2008, compared with its
    carrying value of

F-41

VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to

    Statements — (Continued)

$1,144.9 million. Fair value for long-term debt was
    estimated based on quoted market prices of the identical debt
    instruments or values of comparable borrowings.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements:

Goodwill
    and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for possible
    impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each
    year. During 2009, management concluded that the carrying values
    of goodwill at its

Reef

Nautica

®

and

lucy

®

business units exceeded their respective fair values and,
    accordingly, recorded impairment charges totaling
    $101.9 million to write down the goodwill to their
    respective implied fair values (Note H). Management also
    concluded that the carrying values of its

Reef

®

and

lucy

®

trademark intangible assets exceeded their respective fair
    values and, accordingly, recorded impairment charges totaling
    $20.1 million to write down the assets to their respective

These nonrecurring fair value measurements were developed using
    significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). For goodwill,
    the primary valuation technique used was an income methodology
    based on management’s estimates of forecasted cash flows
    for each business unit, with those cash flows discounted to
    present value using rates commensurate with the risks of those
    cash flows. In addition, management used a market-based
    valuation method involving analysis of market multiples of
    revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
    amortization (“EBITDA”) for (i) a group of comparable
    public companies and (ii) recent transactions, if any, involving
    comparable companies. For trademark intangible assets,
    management used the income-based relief-from-royalty valuation
    method in which fair value is the discounted value of forecasted
    royalty revenues arising from a trademark using a royalty rate
    that an independent party would pay for use of that trademark.
    Assumptions used by management were similar to those that would
    be used by market participants performing valuations of these
    business units.

Management’s assumptions were based on analysis of current
    and expected future economic conditions and the updated
    strategic plan for each business unit. On a macro level,
    management’s assumptions included continuation of the
    current difficult economic environment with only a gradual
    recovery over the next 2-3 years. Information regarding the
    fair value assessments of the

Reef

®

Nautica

®

and

lucy

®

business units is provided below:

Reef

®

:

The

Reef

®

business unit has not met the revenue and earnings growth
    forecasted at its acquisition in 2005. Although its core sandals
    revenues have grown in both the United States and international
    markets, the expansion of

Reef

®

apparel lines has not been as successful. Factors that led to
    management’s current expectation of reduced revenue and
    earnings growth included (i) current economic conditions
    and expectation of a slow economic recovery and continued low
    consumer spending for the next several years and (ii) a
    revised business strategy, led by a new management team
    installed in 2009, to focus on the brand’s core sandals
    business and to reduce the brand’s apparel lines, in part
    by licensing rights to certain product categories to independent
    parties. After the charges in the table above, there was
    $48.3 million of goodwill and $74.4 million of
    indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets remaining at the
    end of December 2009.

Nautica

®

:

The

    department store channel of distribution in the United States
    has undergone consolidation over the last several years,
    resulting in the closing of a number of stores. Recessionary
    conditions since 2008 have negatively impacted retail sales in
    the department store channel, including sales of

Nautica

®

brand products, and have also impacted sales at

Nautica

®

retail outlet stores. Accordingly, in connection with our
    strategic planning process, management has reassessed the
    financial expectations of this business. Factors that led to
    management’s current expectation of reduced revenue and
    earnings growth included (i) current economic conditions
    and expectation of a slow economic recovery and continued low
    consumer spending for the next several years and

F-42

VF
    CORPORATION

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(ii) continued challenging conditions in the department
    store channel. After the impairment charge, there was
    $153.7 million of goodwill remaining at the end of December
    2009.

lucy

®

:

The

lucy

®

business unit was acquired in August 2007, shortly before the
    start of the current recession. Management’s intent at the
    acquisition date was to refine the product offerings and store
    design and then to aggressively open new stores for several
    years. Because we have not made as much progress as planned,
    along with recessionary conditions in the United States, the
    number of stores has not been expanded, and the business has not
    been profitable. In late 2009 responsibility for the

lucy

®

business was transferred from the Contemporary Brands Coalition
    to the Outdoor & Action Sports Coalition where the

lucy

®

business unit will benefit from the technical product expertise,
    design staff and retail competencies of

The North
    Face

®

.

    Further, several underperforming stores will be closed in 2010.
    These factors, and particularly management’s expectation of
    a slow economic recovery, have led to a reduced revenue
    forecast. After the charges in the table above, there was
    $39.3 million of goodwill and $40.3 million of
    indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets remaining at the
    end of December 2009.

Note V —

Derivative
    Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

VF is exposed to risks in its ongoing business operations. Some
    of these risks are managed by using derivative financial
    instruments. Derivative financial instruments are contracts
    whose value is based on, or “derived” from, changes in
    the value of an underlying currency exchange rate, interest rate
    or other financial asset or index.

VF conducts business in many foreign countries and therefore is
    subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
    Exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on the
    translated U.S. dollar value of operating results and net
    assets denominated in foreign currencies. VF does not attempt to
    manage translation risk but does use derivative contracts to
    manage the exchange rate risk of specified cash flows or
    transactions denominated in various foreign currencies. VF
    manages exchange rate risk on a consolidated basis, which allows
    exposures to be netted. Use of derivative financial instruments
    allows VF to reduce the overall exposure to risks in its cash
    flows and earnings, since gains and losses in the value of the
    derivative contracts offset losses and gains in the value of the
    underlying hedged exposures. In addition, in prior years VF had
    used derivatives in limited instances to hedge interest rate
    risk.

Summary of Derivative Instruments:

All of
    VF’s derivative instruments meet the criteria for hedge
    accounting at the inception of the hedging relationship.
    However, derivative instruments that are cash flow hedges of
    forecasted cash receipts are dedesignated as hedges near the end
    of their term and, accordingly, do not qualify for hedge
    accounting after the date of dedesignation. Total notional
    amounts of outstanding derivative contracts at December 2009 and
    December 2008 were $857 million and $628 million,
    respectively, consisting of contracts hedging primarily
    exposures to the euro, British pound, Mexican peso and Canadian
    dollar. Derivative contracts, consisting of forward exchange
    contracts, have maturities ranging from one month to
    20 months. Amounts of outstanding derivatives in the
    following table are presented on an individual contract basis:

VF’s Fair Value Hedge Strategies and Accounting
    Policies:

VF has a hedging program to reduce the
    risk that future cash flows for firm commitments will be
    impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. VF may
    enter into derivative contracts to hedge intercompany loans
    between the United States and a foreign subsidiary or between
    two foreign subsidiaries having different functional currencies.

For a derivative instrument that is designated and qualifies as
    a fair value hedge (i.e., hedging the exposure to changes in the
    fair value of an asset or liability attributable to a particular
    risk), changes in the fair value of the derivative are
    recognized in earnings as an offset, on the same line, to the
    earnings impact of the underlying hedged item.

    currencies. VF uses derivative contracts to hedge a portion of
    the exchange risk for its forecasted inventory purchases and
    production costs and for its forecasted cash receipts arising
    from sales of inventory. In addition, VF hedges the receipt in
    the United States of forecasted intercompany royalties from its
    foreign subsidiaries.

For a derivative instrument that is designated and qualifies as
    a cash flow hedge (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in
    expected cash flows attributable to a particular risk), periodic
    changes in the fair value of the effective portion of the
    derivative are reported as a component of OCI and deferred in
    Accumulated OCI in the balance sheet. The deferred derivative
    gain or loss is reclassified into earnings as an offset, on the
    same line, to the earnings impact of the underlying hedged
    transaction (e.g., in cost of goods sold when the hedged
    inventories are sold, or in net sales when the hedged item
    relates to cash receipts from forecasted sales). As discussed in
    the following section, cash flow hedges of forecasted cash
    receipts are dedesignated as hedges when the sale is recorded,
    and hedge accounting is not applied after that date.

Amounts recognized in earnings for the last three years for the
    ineffective portion of cash flow hedging relationships were not
    significant.

At December 2009, Accumulated OCI included $4.3 million of
    net deferred pretax losses for foreign exchange contracts that
    are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next
    12 months. Actual amounts to be reclassified to earnings
    will depend on exchange rates when currently outstanding
    derivative contracts are settled.

In addition, in 2003 VF entered into an interest rate swap
    derivative contract to hedge the interest rate risk for issuance
    of long-term debt due in 2033. The contract was terminated
    concurrent with the issuance of the debt, with the realized gain
    deferred in Accumulated OCI. The remaining pretax gain of
    $2.8 million at December 2009, deferred in Accumulated OCI,
    will be reclassified into earnings over the remaining term of
    the debt.

Derivative Contracts Not Designated as
    Hedges:

As noted in the preceding section, cash
    flow hedges of forecasted cash receipts are dedesignated as
    hedges when the forecasted sale is recognized, and accordingly,
    hedge accounting is not applied after the date of dedesignation.
    These derivatives remain outstanding and serve as an economic
    hedge of foreign currency exposures related to the ultimate
    collection of the trade receivables. During this period that
    hedge accounting is not applied, changes in the fair value of
    the derivative contracts are recognized directly in earnings.
    For 2009, VF recorded net gains of $1.1 million in
    Miscellaneous Income (Expense) for derivatives not designated as
    hedging instruments, effectively offsetting the net
    remeasurement losses on the related accounts receivable. There
    were no derivative contracts not designated as hedges in 2008 or
    2007.
