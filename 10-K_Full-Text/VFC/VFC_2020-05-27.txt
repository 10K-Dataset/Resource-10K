However, the absence of these words or similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking.

VF undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Known or unknown risks, uncertainties or other factors that could cause the actual results of operations or financial condition of VF to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those described as “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports VF files with the SEC.

PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.

V.F. Corporation, founded in 1899, is one of the world's largest apparel, footwear and accessories companies connecting people to the lifestyles, activities and experiences they cherish most through a family of iconic outdoor, active and workwear brands. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “VF,” the "Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” used herein refer to V.F. Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Unless otherwise noted, all discussion below, including amounts and percentages for all periods, reflect the results of operations and financial condition from VF’s continuing operations. As such, both the Jeans business subject to the spin-off completed May 22, 2019 and the Occupational Workwear business that met the held-for-sale and discontinued operations criteria during the three months ended March 28, 2020 have been excluded.

VF’s diverse portfolio meets consumer needs across a broad spectrum of activities and lifestyles. Our ability to connect with consumers, as diverse as our brand portfolio, creates a unique platform for sustainable, long-term growth. Our long-term growth strategy is focused on four strategic choices:

•

Drive and optimize our portfolio.

Investing in our brands to realize their full potential, while ensuring the composition of our portfolio positions us to win in evolving market conditions;

•

Distort investments to Asia.

Investing in and scaling our business across the Asia-Pacific region, especially China, to unlock growth opportunities for our brands in this fast-growing region;

•

Elevate direct channels.

Investing in our direct-to-consumer business to make it the pinnacle expression of our brands, and prioritizing serving consumers through e-commerce and digitally enabled transactions; and,

•

Accelerate our consumer-minded, retail-centric, hyper-digital business model transformation.

Becoming consumer- and retail-centric to meet and exceed consumers' needs across all channels, and operate our business differently - from the design studio to the factory floor to the point of sale - by thinking and acting more like a vertical retailer.

VF is diversified across brands, product categories, channels of distribution, geographies and consumer demographics. We own a

broad portfolio of brands in the outerwear, footwear, apparel, backpack, luggage and accessories categories. Our largest brands are

Vans

®

, The North Face

®

, Timberland

®

and

Dickies

®

.

Our products are marketed to consumers through our wholesale channel, primarily in specialty stores, department stores, national chains, mass merchants, independently-operated partnership stores and with strategic digital partners. Our products are also marketed to consumers through our own direct-to-consumer operations, which include VF-operated stores, concession retail stores, brand e-commerce sites and other digital platforms. Revenues from the direct-to-consumer business represented

41%

of VF’s total Fiscal


revenues. In addition to selling directly into international markets, many of our brands also sell products through licensees, agents and distributors. In Fiscal


, VF derived

59%

of its revenues from the Americas region,

28%

from the Europe region and

13%

from the Asia-Pacific region.

To provide diversified products across multiple channels of distribution in different geographic areas, we primarily rely on our global sourcing of finished goods from independent contractors. We utilize state-of-the-art supply chain technologies for inventory replenishment that enable us to effectively and efficiently get the right assortment of products that match consumer demand.

The chief operating decision maker allocates resources and assesses performance based on a global brand view which represents VF's operating segments. Global brands have been combined into reportable segments based on similar economic characteristics and qualitative factors. The reportable segments for financial reporting purposes have been identified as: Outdoor, Active and Work.

DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER OPERATIONS

Our direct-to-consumer business includes retail stores, brand e-commerce sites, concession retail locations and other digital platforms. Direct-to-consumer revenues were

41%

of total VF revenues in the year ended March


.

Our full-price retail stores allow us to display a brand’s full line of products with fixtures and imagery that support the brand’s positioning and promise to consumers. These experiences provide high visibility for our brands and products and enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of our consumers. The complete and impactful presentation of products in our stores also helps to increase sell-through of VF products at our wholesale customers due to increased brand awareness, education and visibility. VF-operated full-price stores generally provide gross margins that are well above VF averages.

In addition, VF operates outlet stores in both premium outlet malls and more traditional value-based locations. These outlet stores carry merchandise that is specifically designed for sale in our outlet stores and serve an important role in our overall inventory management and profitability by allowing VF to sell a significant portion of excess, discontinued and out-of-season products at better prices than otherwise available from outside parties, while maintaining the integrity of our brands.

Our growing global direct-to-consumer operations included

1,379

stores at the end of Fiscal


. We operate retail store locations for the following brands:

Vans

®

,

Timberland

®

, The North Face

®

,

Kipling

®

,

Dickies

. Approximately

56%

of our stores are located in the Americas region (

19%

in the Asia-Pacific region. We

opened


stores during Fiscal


, concentrating on the brands with the highest retail growth potential:

Vans

®

and

The North Face

®

. Additionally, we have approximately


concession retail stores located principally in Europe and Asia.

E-commerce represented approximately

28%

of our direct-to-consumer business in the year ended March


. All VF brands are marketed online. We continue to expand our e-commerce initiatives by rolling out additional, country-specific brand sites in Europe and Asia, which enhances our ability to deliver a superior, localized consumer experience. We also continue to increase focus on digital innovation and growth across other digital platforms.

We expect our direct-to-consumer business to continue growing as we accelerate our consumer-minded, retail-centric, hyper-digital business model transformation.

In addition to our direct-to-consumer operations, our licensees, distributors and other independent parties own and operate approximately

3,000

partnership stores. These are primarily mono-brand retail locations selling VF products that have the appearance of VF-operated stores. Most of these partnership stores are located in Europe and Asia, and are concentrated in the

,

and

brands.

LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS

As part of our strategy of expanding market penetration of VF-owned brands, we enter into licensing agreements with independent parties for specific apparel and complementary product categories when such arrangements provide more effective manufacturing, distribution and marketing than could be achieved internally. We provide support to these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design, quality control, advertising, marketing and distribution of licensed products.

Licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of VF brands. License agreements are for fixed terms of generally 3 to 5 years, with conditional renewal options. Each licensee pays royalties to VF based on its sales of licensed products, with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement. Royalties generally range from

4%

to

10%

of the licensing partners’ net licensed products sales. Royalty income was

$57.4 million

in the year ended March


(less than

1%

of total revenues), primarily from the

Vans

®

,

Dickies

®

and

Timberland

®

brands.

MANUFACTURING, SOURCING AND DISTRIBUTION

Product design and innovation, including fit, fabric, finish and quality, are important elements across our businesses. These functions are performed by employees located in our global supply chain organization and our branded business units across the globe.

VF’s centralized global supply chain organization is responsible for producing, procuring and delivering products to our customers. VF is highly skilled in managing the complexities associated with our global supply chain. In the year ended March 2020, VF sourced or produced approximately


million units spread across our brands. Our products were obtained from approximately


independent contractor manufacturing facilities in approximately


countries and from


VF-operated manufacturing facilities. Additionally, we operate


distribution centers and

1,379

retail stores. Managing this complexity is made possible by the use of a network of information systems for product development, forecasting, order management and warehouse management, along with our core enterprise resource management platforms.

In the year ended March 2020,

94%

of our units were obtained from independent contractors and

6%

were manufactured in VF-owned facilities. Products obtained from contractors in the Western Hemisphere generally have a higher cost than products obtained from contractors in Asia. However, contracting in the Western Hemisphere gives us greater flexibility, shorter lead times and allows for lower inventory levels for the U.S. market. The use of contracted production with different geographic regions and cost structures, provides a flexible approach to product sourcing. We will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment.

Independent contractors generally own the raw materials and ship finished, ready-for-sale products to VF. These contractors are engaged through VF sourcing hubs in Hong Kong (with satellite offices across Asia) and Panama. These hubs are responsible for managing the manufacturing and procurement of product, supplier oversight, product quality assurance, sustainability within the supply chain, responsible sourcing and transportation and shipping functions. In addition, our hubs leverage proprietary knowledge and technology to enable certain contractors to more effectively control costs and improve labor efficiency.

Management continually monitors political risks and developments related to duties, tariffs and quotas. We limit VF’s sourcing exposure through, among other measures: (i) diversifying production among countries and contractors, (ii) sourcing production to merchandise categories where product is readily available, and (iii) sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements. VF does not directly or indirectly source products from suppliers in countries that are prohibited by the U.S. State Department.

No single supplier represented more than

7%

of our total cost of goods sold during Fiscal 2020.

VF operates manufacturing facilities in Mexico, Honduras and the Dominican Republic, which are used to produce a portion of footwear and other products. For these owned production facilities, we purchase raw materials from numerous U.S. and international suppliers to meet our production needs. Raw materials include products made from cotton, leather, rubber, wool, synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn, as well as thread and trim (product identification, buttons, zippers, snaps, eyelets and laces).


VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K


In some instances, we contract the sewing of VF-owned raw materials into finished product with independent contractors. Fixed price commitments for fabric and certain supplies are generally set on a quarterly basis for the next quarter’s purchases.

The VF-operated production facilities, as well as all independent contractor facilities that manufacture VF products, must comply with VF’s Global Compliance Principles. These principles, established in 1997 and consistent with international labor standards, are a set of strict standards covering legal and ethical business practices, worker age, work hours, health and safety conditions, environmental standards and compliance with local laws and regulations. In addition, our owned factories must also undergo certification by the independent, nonprofit organization, Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (“WRAP”), which promotes global ethics in manufacturing.

VF, through its contractor monitoring program, audits the activities of the independent businesses and contractors that produce VF products at locations across the globe. Each of the approximately


independent contractor facilities, including those serving our independent licensees, must be pre-certified before producing VF products. This pre-certification includes passing a factory inspection and signing a VF Terms of Engagement agreement. We maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated internal staff and externally contracted firms. Additional information about VF’s Code of

Business Conduct, Global Compliance Principles, Terms of Engagement and Environmental Compliance Guidelines, along with a Global Compliance Report, is available on the VF website at www.vfc.com.

VF did not experience difficulty in fulfilling its raw material and contracting production needs during Fiscal 2020. Absent any material changes, VF believes it would be able to largely offset any increases in product costs through (i) the continuing shift in the mix of its business to higher margin brands, geographies and channels of distribution, (ii) increases in the prices of its products, and (iii) cost reduction efforts. The loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on our business.

Product is shipped from our independent suppliers and VF-operated manufacturing facilities to distribution centers around the world. In some instances, product is shipped directly to our customers. Most distribution centers are operated by VF, and some support more than one brand. A portion of our distribution needs are met by contract distribution centers.

Our largest distribution centers are located in Visalia, California and Prague, Czech Republic. Additionally, we operate 21 other owned or leased distribution centers primarily in the U.S., but also in Belgium, Canada, China, Mexico, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

SEASONALITY

VF’s quarterly operating results vary due to the seasonality of our individual brands, and are historically stronger in the second half of the calendar year. On a quarterly basis in Fiscal


, revenues ranged from a low of

20%

of full year revenues in the

first

fiscal quarter to a high of

30%

in the

second

fiscal quarter, while operating margin ranged from a low of

-12%

in the

fourth

fiscal quarter to a high of

17%

in the

second

fiscal quarter. This variation results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our Outdoor segment, where

13%

of the segment’s revenues occurred in the

first

fiscal quarter compared to

33%

in the

second

fiscal quarter of Fiscal


. The fourth fiscal quarter results were also negatively impacted by the novel coronavirus ("COVID-19") global pandemic. With changes in our mix of business and the growth of our retail

operations, historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be indicative of future trends.

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital typically increases early in the calendar year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then moderates later in the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected. Cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the second half of the calendar year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements, particularly during the fourth quarter of the calendar year.

ADVERTISING, CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH

During the year ended March


, our advertising and promotion expense was

$756.3 million

, representing

7%

of total revenues. We advertise in consumer and trade publications, on radio and television and through digital initiatives including social media and mobile platforms on the Internet. We also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print and digital media, radio and television. We sponsor sporting, musical and special events, as well as athletes and personalities who promote our products. We employ marketing sciences to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional spending, and to identify the types of spending that provide the greatest return on our marketing investments.

We provide advertising support to our wholesale customers, including independent partnership stores, in the form of point-of-sale fixtures and signage to enhance the presentation and brand image of our products. We also participate in shop-in-shops and

concession retail arrangements, which are separate sales areas dedicated to a specific VF brand within our customers' stores and other locations, to help differentiate and enhance the presentation of our products.

We contribute to incentive programs with our wholesale customers, including cooperative advertising funds, discounts and allowances. We also offer sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of discounts, rebates and coupon offers that are eligible for use in certain VF-operated stores, brand e-commerce sites and concession retail locations.

In addition to sponsorships and activities that directly benefit our products and brands, VF and its associates actively support our communities and various charities. For example,

The North Face

®

brand has committed to programs that encourage and enable outdoor participation, such as

The North Face Endurance Challenge

®

and

The North Face Explore Fund™

programs.

VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K



The

Timberland

®

brand has a strong heritage of volunteerism, including the

Path of Service™

program that offers full-time employees up to 40 hours of paid time off a year to serve their local communities through global service events such as Earth Day in

the spring and Serv-a-palooza in the fall. The

Vans

®

brand has hosted

Vans

®

Gives Back Day events in which all employees at the brand's headquarters spend the day volunteering in the community.

SUSTAINABILITY

VF is one of the world’s largest apparel, footwear and accessories companies. As such, we have both an opportunity and responsibility to make a positive impact on our industry and planet through advancing sustainable business practices. VF plans to achieve significant progress in several key areas of sustainability, including people, products, supply chains, materials and facilities, to create a positive global impact.

VF’s Sustainability & Responsibility strategy,

Made for Change

, targets three key pillars to drive transformational change and create value for our business. The strategy is focused on new circular and sustainable business models to (i) harness retail opportunities in new sectors, (ii) scale foundational social and environmental programs to lead the industry toward greater progress at a faster rate, and (iii) empower our brands, associates, and consumers to act with purpose and impact with intention.

VF has committed to measurably improve the lives of two million supply chain workers and others within their communities annually, by 2030. As a result, VF launched a Worker and Community Development Program with strategic initiatives focused on (i) water and sanitation, (ii) health and nutrition, and (iii) childcare and education. These programs have already impacted more than three hundred thousand people in more than 30 factories and communities. We are also prioritizing transparency to ensure our global supply chain improves the lives of people and the planet. In 2018, VF successfully launched traceability maps to demonstrate the end-to-end (farm-to-front door) traceability of nine iconic VF-brand products. In 2019, VF increased the number of published maps to 42, and will continue to scale traceability efforts over the next two years with a plan to enhance visibility across all VF brands.

Aligned with our scale for good ideology, in 2019, VF announced some of the industry’s most ambitious science-based targets. The new science-based carbon emissions targets include (i) an absolute reduction of Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions of

55 percent

by 2030, from a 2017 baseline year; and, (ii) an absolute

reduction of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions of 30 percent by 2030, from a 2017 baseline year focusing on farm-to-retail materials, sourcing operations and logistics.

Dedication to continued sustainability progress is particularly focused in the realm of VF product materials. VF set a goal of sourcing 50% recycled nylon and polyester for products by 2025, with a targeted 35% reduction in negative impact of key materials. VF also pledged to not use fur in any of our products, in support of newly released Animal Derived Materials & Forest Derived Materials policies. In December 2019, the Company created a new sustainable materials vision which establishes a clear path for environmental impact reduction through yet another bold commitment: by 2030, VF commits that 100 percent of its top nine materials, which account for approximately 90 percent of its materials-related carbon emissions, will originate from regenerative, responsibly sourced renewable, or recycled sources.

VF has set goals for internal facilities that include (i) the sourcing of 100% of electricity from renewable sources within VF-owned and operated facilities by 2025, in line with the enterprise commitment to RE100, and (ii) achieving Zero Waste at 100% of VF internal distribution center locations by 2020, with 12 facilities already verified.

VF brands are equally committed to sustainability action in their sectors. The

Vans

®

brand has launched a shoe recycling pilot at certain southern California stores. The

Timberland

®

brand used 97% "Leather Working Group" certified leather, 78% certified BCI or organic cotton, and produced 68% recycled, organic, or renewable products during 2019.

The North Face

®

brand has expanded its Climate Beneficial Wool collection by selling products made in the U.S. from sustainable farms.

The North Face

®

brand also continued its 'Renewed' collection, selling previously owned, damaged-and-repaired or used products. The recommerce model addresses one of the apparel industry’s biggest challenges, textile waste, and offers our products at a lower price point, which allows new consumers to experience our brands.

OTHER MATTERS

Competitive Factors

Our business depends on our ability to stimulate consumer demand for VF’s brands and products. VF is well-positioned to compete in the apparel, footwear and accessories sector by developing high quality, innovative products at competitive prices that meet consumer needs, providing high service levels, ensuring the right products are on the retail sales floor to meet consumer demand, investing significant amounts into existing brands and managing our brand portfolio through acquisitions and dispositions. Many of VF’s brands have long histories and enjoy strong recognition within their respective consumer segments.

Intellectual Property

Trademarks, trade names, patents and domain names, as well as related logos, designs and graphics, provide substantial value in

the development and marketing of VF’s products, and are important to our continued success. We have registered this intellectual property in the U.S. and in other countries where our products are manufactured and/or sold.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS.

The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating VF’s business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect VF’s business, its operating results and its financial condition.

VF’s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel and footwear, which is sensitive to global economic conditions and other factors. A decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on VF.

The success of VF’s business depends on consumer spending on apparel and footwear, and there are a number of factors that influence consumer spending, including actual and perceived economic conditions, disposable consumer income, interest rates, consumer credit availability, unemployment, stock market performance, weather conditions, energy prices, public health issues (including the current COVID-19 pandemic), consumer discretionary spending patterns and tax rates in the international, national, regional and local markets where VF’s products are sold. Decreased consumer spending could result in reduced demand for our products, reduced orders from customers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higher discounts, increased inventories and lower gross margins. The uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world, most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies. If global economic and financial market conditions do not improve, adverse economic trends or other factors could negatively impact the level of consumer spending, which could have a material adverse impact on VF.

Widespread outbreak of an illness or any other public health crisis, including the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic, could materially and adversely affect, and has materially and adversely affected, our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our business has been, and will continue to be, impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic in countries where we operate or our suppliers, third-party service providers, consumers or customers are located. These effects include recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities to close businesses, limit travel, avoid large gatherings or to self-quarantine, as well as temporary closures and decreased operations of the facilities of our suppliers, service providers and customers. The impacts on

us have included, and in the future could include, but are not limited to:

•

significant reductions in demand and significant volatility in demand for our products by consumers and customers resulting in reduced orders, order cancellations, lower revenues, higher discounts, increased inventories, decreased value of inventories and lower gross margins, which may be caused by, among other things: the inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other restrictions or out of fear of exposure to COVID-19, store closures of our owned stores as well as stores of our customers or reduced store hours across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific, significant declines in consumer retail store traffic to stores that have reopened, or financial hardship and unemployment, shifts in demand away from consumer discretionary products and reduced options for marketing and promotion of products or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic;

•

significant uncertainty and turmoil in global economic and financial market conditions causing, among other things: decreased consumer confidence and decreased consumer spending, now and in the mid and long-term, inability to access financing in the credit and capital markets (including the commercial paper market) at reasonable rates (or at all) in the event we, our customers or suppliers find it desirable to do so, increased exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar, and volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use for our products and in our supply chain;

•

inability to meet our consumers’ and customers’ needs for inventory production and fulfillment due to disruptions in our supply chain and increased costs associated with mitigating the effects of the pandemic caused by, among other things: reduction or loss of workforce due to illness, quarantine or other restrictions or facility closures, scarcity of and/or increased prices for raw materials, scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas, and increased freight and logistics costs, expenses and times; failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, customers, distributors, service providers and commercial banks, to meet their obligations to us or to timely meet those obligations, or significant disruptions in


VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K


their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties, including business failure or insolvency and collectability of existing receivables; and

•

significant changes in the conditions in markets in which we do business, including quarantines, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities and restrict our employees’ ability to perform necessary business functions, including operations necessary for the design, development, production, distribution, sale, marketing and support of our products.

Any of these impacts could place limitations on our ability to execute on our business plan and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies and procedures as more information and guidance become available regarding the evolving situation. The impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this “Risk Factors” section, any of which could have a material effect on us. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.

The apparel and footwear industries are highly competitive, and VF’s success depends on its ability to gauge consumer preferences and product trends, and to respond to constantly changing markets.

VF competes with numerous apparel and footwear brands and manufacturers. Competition is generally based upon brand name recognition, price, design, product quality, selection, service and purchasing convenience. Some of our competitors are larger and have more resources than VF in some product categories and regions. In addition, VF competes directly with the private label brands of its wholesale customers. VF’s ability to compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on our ability to:

•

Anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and product trends in a timely manner;

•

Develop attractive, innovative and high quality products that meet consumer needs;

•

Maintain strong brand recognition;

•

Price products appropriately;

•

Provide best-in-class marketing support and intelligence;

•

Ensure product availability and optimize supply chain efficiencies;

•

Obtain sufficient retail store space and effectively present our products at retail;

•

Produce or procure quality products on a consistent basis; and,

•

Adapt to a more digitally driven consumer landscape.

Failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing consumer preferences, markets and product trends could have a material adverse effect on VF’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, there are significant shifts underway in the wholesale and retail (e-commerce and retail store) channels. VF may not be able to manage its brands within and across channels sufficiently, which could have a material adverse effect on VF’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

VF’s business and the success of its products could be harmed if VF is unable to maintain the images of its brands.

VF’s success to date has been due in large part to the growth of its brands’ images and VF’s customers’ connection to its brands. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand, the names and images of our brands may be impaired. Even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, consumers may consider our brands’ images to be outdated or associate our brands with styles that are no longer popular. In addition, brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of qualities, including merchandise quality and corporate integrity. Negative claims or publicity regarding VF, its brands or its products, including licensed products, could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims are accurate. Social media, which accelerates the dissemination of information, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims. In the past, many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses. Our businesses may be similarly affected in the future. In addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a number of athletes, musicians and celebrities and feature those individuals in our advertising and marketing efforts. Failure to continue to obtain or maintain high-quality sponsorships and endorsers could harm our business.  In addition, actions taken by those individuals associated with our products could harm their reputations, which could adversely affect the images of our brands.

VF’s revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of its business.

VF’s business is seasonal, with a higher proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the calendar year, which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons. Poor sales in the second half of the calendar year would have a material adverse effect on VF’s full year operating results and cause higher inventories. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales.

VF’s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins.

The apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, rising commodity and conversion costs, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products, changes in consumer demand and shifts to online shopping and purchasing. Consumers may increasingly seek markdown allowances, incentives and other forms of economic support. If these factors cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers, and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, VF’s profitability will decline. This could have a material adverse effect on VF’s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

VF may not succeed in its business strategy.

One of VF’s key strategic objectives is growth. We seek to grow organically and through acquisitions. We seek to grow by building our lifestyle brands, expanding our share with winning customers, stretching VF’s brands to new regions, managing costs, leveraging our supply chain and information technology capabilities across VF and expanding our direct-to-consumer business, including

VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K



opening new stores, remodeling and expanding our existing stores and growing our e-commerce business. However, we may not be able to grow our existing businesses. For example:

•

We may have difficulty completing acquisitions or dispositions to reshape our portfolio, and we may not be able to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve the expected growth, cost savings or synergies from such integration, or it may disrupt our current business.

•

We may not be able to transform our model to be more consumer- and retail-centric.

•

We may not be able to transform our model to be more digitally focused.

•

We may not be able to expand our market share with winning customers, or our wholesale customers may encounter financial difficulties and thus reduce their purchases of VF products.

•

We may not be able to expand our brands in Asia or other geographies or achieve the expected results from our supply chain initiatives.

•

We may have difficulty recruiting, developing or retaining qualified employees.

•

We may not be able to achieve our direct-to-consumer expansion goals, including in e-commerce or other new channels, manage our growth effectively, successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations,  operate our new, remodeled and expanded stores profitably, adapt our business model or develop relationships with consumers for e-commerce or other new channels.

•

We may not be able to offset rising commodity or conversion costs in our product costs with pricing actions or efficiency improvements.

Failure to implement our strategic objectives may have a material adverse effect on VF’s business.

VF relies significantly on information technology. Any inadequacy, interruption, integration failure or security failure of this technology could harm VF’s ability to effectively operate its business.

Our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems. We rely heavily on information technology to track sales and inventory and manage our supply chain. We are also dependent on information technology, including the Internet, for our direct-to-consumer sales, including our e-commerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization. Despite our preventative efforts, our systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to damage, failure or interruption due to viruses, data security incidents, technical malfunctions, natural disasters or other causes, or in connection with upgrades to our system or the implementation of new systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of VF’s business, including our reputation, management of inventory, ordering and replenishment of products, manufacturing and distribution of products, e-commerce operations, retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing, corporate email communications and our interaction with the public on social media.

VF is subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect its business operations, results of operations or reputation.

In the normal course of business, we often collect, retain and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information, including credit card information, over public networks. There is a significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, identity theft and user privacy. Data security breaches are increasingly sophisticated, and are difficult to detect for long periods of time. Accordingly, if unauthorized parties gain access to our networks or databases, or those of our third-party service providers, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify our private and sensitive information, including credit card information and personal information. We have implemented systems and processes designed to protect against unauthorized access to or use of personal information, and rely on encryption and authentication technology to effectively secure transmission of confidential customer information, including credit card information. Despite these security measures, there is no guarantee that they are adequate and our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable and unable to anticipate or detect security breaches and data loss. In addition, employees may intentionally or inadvertently cause data security breaches that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. VF and its customers could suffer harm if valuable business data, or employee, customer and other proprietary information were corrupted, lost or accessed or misappropriated by third parties due to a security failure in VF’s systems or one of our third-party service providers. It could require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure or breach, severely damage our reputation and our relationships with customers, result in unwanted media attention and lost sales,  and expose us to risks of litigation and liability. In addition, as a result of recent security breaches at a number of prominent retailers, the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense and the regulatory environment has become increasingly uncertain, rigorous and complex. As a result, we may incur significant costs to comply with laws regarding the protection and unauthorized disclosure of personal information and we may not be able to comply with new regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act. Any failure to comply with the laws and regulations surrounding the protection of personal information could subject us to legal and reputational risk, including significant fines and/or litigation for non-compliance, any of which could have a negative impact on revenues and profits. In addition, our existing insurance policies may not reimburse us for all of the damages that we might incur as a result of a security breach.

VF’s business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. VF’s hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks.

A growing percentage of VF’s total revenues (approximately

47%

in Fiscal


) is derived from markets outside the U.S. VF’s international businesses operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in currency exchange rates affect the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency-denominated amounts at which VF’s international businesses purchase products, incur costs or sell products. In addition, for VF’s U.S.-based businesses, the majority of products are sourced from independent contractors or VF plants located in foreign countries. As a result, the costs of these products are affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies. Furthermore, much of VF’s licensing revenue is derived


VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K


from sales in foreign currencies. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on VF’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In accordance with our operating practices, we hedge a significant portion of our foreign currency transaction exposures arising in the ordinary course of business to reduce risks in our cash flows and earnings. Our hedging strategy may not be effective in reducing all risks, and no hedging strategy can completely insulate VF from foreign exchange risk.

Further, our use of derivative financial instruments may expose VF to counterparty risks. Although VF only enters into hedging contracts with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings, it is possible that the credit quality of a counterparty could be downgraded or a counterparty could default on its obligations, which could have a material adverse impact on VF’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

There are risks associated with VF’s acquisitions.

Any acquisitions or mergers by VF will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies. These risks include, among other things, higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses, the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations, systems and personnel of the companies and the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management. In addition, geographic distances may make integration of acquired businesses more difficult. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions.

Our acquisitions may cause large one-time expenses or create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant impairment charges in the future. We also make certain estimates and assumptions in order to determine purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If our estimates or assumptions used to value these assets and liabilities are not accurate, we may be exposed to losses that may be material.

VF’s operations and earnings may be affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic risks.

Our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new markets is subject to legal, regulatory, political and economic risks. These include the burdens of complying with U.S. and international laws and regulations, and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements.

Changes in regulatory, geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect VF’s business or may require us to modify our current business practices. While enactment of any such change is not certain, if such changes were adopted, our costs could increase, which would reduce our earnings.

Changes to U.S. or international trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business, as well as any negative sentiment toward

the U.S. as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business. The U.S. government has instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S., economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we conduct our business. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes.

As a result of recent policy changes of the U.S. government and recent U.S. government proposals, there may be greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade. The new tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy has in the past and could continue to trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain U.S. goods. VF, similar to many other multinational corporations, does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the U.S. and foreign countries (including governmental action related to tariffs, international trade agreements, or economic sanctions). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The United Kingdom’s impending departure from the European Union could harm our business and financial results.

The United Kingdom held a referendum on June 23, 2016 in which a majority of voters voted to exit the European Union (“Brexit”) and on March 29, 2017, the United Kingdom submitted a formal notification of its intention to withdraw from the European Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon. On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom ceased to be a member state of the European Union. European Union law applicable to the United Kingdom continues to apply to and in the United Kingdom for the duration of a transition period, which is presently scheduled to expire on December 31, 2020 (the “Transition Period”). During the Transition Period, the European Union and the United Kingdom will negotiate the terms of their future relationship. There can be no assurances that such negotiations will be successful or certainty that European Union law will continue to apply in and to the United Kingdom following the expiration of the Transition Period. Until expiration of the Transition Period and the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom is established, it is difficult to anticipate Brexit’s potential impact.

The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the United Kingdom makes to retain access to European Union markets beyond the Transition Period. Brexit could adversely affect European and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K



Changes in tax laws could increase our worldwide tax rate and tax liabilities and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.

We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“U.S. Tax Act”), which included a broad range of tax reform proposals affecting businesses, including a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax-deferred, and a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings. Taxes related to the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings due over a period of time could be accelerated upon certain triggering events, including failure to pay such taxes when due. In addition, regulatory, administrative and legislative guidance related to the U.S. Tax Act continues to be released. To the extent any future guidance differs from our interpretation of the law, it could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.

The Swiss government enacted the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (“Swiss Tax Act”) which became effective on January 1, 2020. The Swiss Tax Act was enacted to ensure that Switzerland stays in conformity with the European Union (“EU”) as well as Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) standards on international taxation. The impact of the Swiss Tax Act has been reported based on the official initial guidelines provided by the Swiss Federal and Cantonal Authorities. Future guidance that differs from our preliminary interpretation or any negative reaction from the EU member states to the Swiss Tax Act, could have material effect on our financial position and results of operations. The EU has also developed a list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes (referred to as the “blacklist”). We continuously monitor the blacklist to determine any potential impact to VF.

In addition, many countries in the EU and around the globe have adopted and/or proposed changes to current tax laws. Further, organizations such as the OECD have published action plans that, if adopted by countries where we do business, could increase our tax obligations in these countries. More specifically, the OECD has proposed an approach to address tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy. The ultimate outcome of these proposals and the agreed upon solution that is enacted into law in each country may result in a material financial impact to VF.

Due to the large scale of our U.S. and international business activities, many of these enacted and proposed changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.

We may have additional tax liabilities from new or evolving government or judicial interpretation of existing tax laws.

As a global company, we determine our income tax liability in various tax jurisdictions based on an analysis and interpretation of U.S. and local tax laws and regulations. This analysis requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation and is often based on various assumptions about the future actions of the tax authorities. These determinations are the subject of periodic U.S. and international tax audits and court proceedings. In particular, tax authorities and the courts have increased their focus on income earned in no- or low-tax jurisdictions or income that is not taxed in any jurisdiction. Tax authorities have also become skeptical of

special tax rulings provided to companies offering lower taxes than may be applicable in other countries.

For example, VF was granted a ruling which lowered the effective income tax rate on taxable earnings for years 2010 through 2014 under Belgium’s excess profit tax regime. In February 2015, the EU opened a state aid investigation into Belgium’s rulings. On January 11, 2016, the EU announced its decision that these rulings were illegal and ordered that tax benefits granted under these rulings should be collected from the affected companies, including VF.

On March 22, 2016, the Belgium government filed an appeal seeking annulment of the EU decision. Additionally, on June 21, 2016, VF Europe BVBA filed its own application for annulment of the EU decision.

On February 14, 2019 the General Court annulled the EU decision and on April 26, 2019 the EU appealed the General Court's annulment. Both listed requests for annulment remain open and unresolved. Additionally, the EU has initiated proceedings related to individual rulings granted by Belgium, including the ruling granted to VF.

Also, VF petitioned the U.S. Tax Court to resolve an Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") dispute regarding the timing of income inclusion associated with the 2011 Timberland acquisition. VF remains confident in our timing and treatment of the income inclusion, and therefore this matter is not reflected in our financial statements. We are vigorously defending our position, and do not expect the resolution to have a material adverse impact on VF's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While the IRS argues immediate income inclusion, VF's position is to include the income over a period of years. As the matter relates to 2011, nearly half of the timing in dispute has passed VF including the income, and paying the related tax, on our income tax returns. VF notes that should the IRS prevail in this timing matter, the net interest expense would be up to

$158 million

. Further, this timing matter is impacted by the U.S. Tax Act that reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. If the IRS is successful, this rate differential would increase tax expense by approximately

$136 million

.

Although we accrue for uncertain tax positions, our accrual may be insufficient to satisfy unfavorable findings. Unfavorable audit findings,  or court interpretations (involving VF or other companies with similar tax profiles) may result in payment of taxes, fines and penalties for prior periods and higher tax rates in future periods, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

VF’s balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill. A decline in the fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge, which would be recorded as an operating expense in VF’s Consolidated Statement of Income and could be material.

VF’s policy is to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount. In addition, intangible assets that are being amortized are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. For these impairment tests, we use various valuation methods to estimate the fair value of our business units and


VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K


intangible assets. If the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference.

It is possible that we could have an impairment charge for goodwill or trademark and trade name intangible assets in future periods if (i) overall economic conditions in Fiscal 2021 or future years vary from our current assumptions, (ii) business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit change from our current assumptions, (iii) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace, or (iv) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or of actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower comparable multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and, accordingly, lower implied values of goodwill and intangible assets. A future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

VF uses third-party suppliers and manufacturing facilities worldwide for a substantial portion of its raw materials and finished products, which poses risks to VF’s business operations.

During Fiscal


, approximately

94%

of VF’s units were purchased from independent manufacturers primarily located in Asia, with substantially all of the remainder produced by VF-owned and operated manufacturing facilities located in Mexico, Honduras and the Dominican Republic. Any of the following could impact our ability to produce or deliver VF products, or our cost of producing or delivering products and, as a result, our profitability:

•

Political or labor instability in countries where VF’s facilities, contractors and suppliers are located;

•

Changes in local economic conditions in countries where VF’s facilities, contractors and suppliers are located;

•

Public health issues, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, could result in (or continue to result in) closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;

•

Political or military conflict could cause a delay in the transportation of raw materials and products to VF and an increase in transportation costs;

•

Disruption at ports of entry, could cause delays in product availability and increase transportation times and costs;

•

Heightened terrorism security concerns could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent or lengthier inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods;

•

Decreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to more counterfeit goods and reduced sales of VF products, increased costs for VF’s anti-counterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of its brands;

•

Disruptions at manufacturing or distribution facilities caused by natural and man-made disasters;

•

Disease epidemics and health- and safety-related concerns could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargo of VF’s goods produced in infected areas;

•

Imposition of regulations and quotas relating to imports and our ability to adjust timely to changes in trade regulations could limit our ability to produce products in cost-effective countries that have the required labor and expertise;

•

Imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports; and,

•

Imposition or the repeal of laws that affect intellectual property rights.

Although no single supplier and no one country is critical to VF’s production needs, if we were to lose a supplier it could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to VF, cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships. This, along with the damage to our reputation, could have a material adverse effect on VF’s revenues and, consequently, our results of operations.

In addition, although we audit our third-party material suppliers and contracted manufacturing facilities and set strict compliance standards, actions by a third-party supplier or manufacturer that fail to comply could expose VF to claims for damages, financial penalties and reputational harm, any of which could have a material adverse effect in our business and operations.

Our business is subject to national, state and local laws and regulations for environmental, consumer protection, corporate governance, competition, employment, privacy, safety and other matters. The costs of compliance with, or the violation of, such laws and regulations by VF or by independent suppliers who manufacture products for VF could have an adverse effect on our operations and cash flows, as well as on our reputation.

Our business is subject to comprehensive national, state and local laws and regulations on a wide range of environmental, consumer protection, employment, privacy, safety and other matters. VF could be adversely affected by costs of compliance with or violations of those laws and regulations. In addition, while we do not control their business practices, we require third-party suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working conditions, safety, employment practices and environmental compliance. The costs of products purchased by VF from independent contractors could increase due to the costs of compliance by those contractors.

Failure by VF or its third-party suppliers to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards, or related political considerations, could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to VF, cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships. If one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws, implements labor or other business practices or takes other actions that are generally regarded as unethical, it could jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts that may reduce demand for VF’s merchandise. Damage to VF’s reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on VF’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to rebuild VF’s reputation.

Our international operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. Although we have policies and procedures to address compliance with the FCPA and similar laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, agents and other partners will not take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation could subject us to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results.

VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K



Fluctuations in wage rates and the price, availability and quality of raw materials and finished goods could increase costs.

Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of fabrics, leather or other raw materials used by VF in its manufactured products, or of purchased finished goods, could have a material adverse effect on VF’s cost of goods sold or its ability to meet its customers’ demands. The prices we pay depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them. The price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, including general economic conditions and demand, crop yields, energy prices, weather patterns, public health issues (such as the current COVID-19 pandemic) and speculation in the commodities markets. Prices of purchased finished products also depend on wage rates in Asia and other geographic areas where our independent contractors are located, as well as freight costs from those regions. Inflation can also have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins. For example, the cost of the materials, that are used in our manufacturing process, such as oil-related commodity prices and other raw materials, such as cotton, dyes and chemical and other costs, such as fuel, energy and utility costs, can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors. Similarly, a significant portion of our products are manufactured in other countries and declines in the values of the U.S. dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs. In addition, fluctuations in wage rates required by legal or industry standards could increase our costs. In the future, VF may not be able to offset cost increases with other cost reductions or efficiencies or to pass higher costs on to its customers. This could have a material adverse effect on VF’s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

We may be adversely affected by weather conditions.

Our business is adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions. A significant portion of the sales of our products is dependent in part on the weather and is likely to decline in years in which weather conditions do not favor the use of these products. For example, periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter can lead to reduced consumer spending that negatively impacts VF's direct-to-consumer business, and inventory accumulation by our wholesale customers, which can, in turn, negatively affect orders in future seasons. In addition, abnormally harsh or inclement weather can also negatively impact retail traffic and consumer spending. Any and all of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Climate change and increased focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, customers, consumers and investors on sustainability issues, including those related to climate change, may adversely affect our business and financial results and damage our reputation.

Climate change is occurring around the world and may impact our business in numerous ways. Such change could lead to an increase in raw material and packaging prices, reduced availability, for example, due to water shortages which could adversely impact raw material availability.  Increased frequency of extreme weather (storms and floods) could cause increased incidence of disruption to the production and distribution of our products and an adverse impact on consumer demand and spending.

A substantial portion of VF’s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers. The loss of any of these customers or the inability of any of these customers to pay VF could substantially reduce VF’s revenues and profits.

A few of VF’s customers account for a significant portion of revenues. Sales to VF’s ten largest customers were

17%

of total revenues in Fiscal


, with our largest customer accounting for

3%

of revenues. Sales to our customers are generally on a purchase order basis and not subject to long-term agreements. A decision by any of VF’s major customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from VF could substantially reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect on VF’s financial condition and results of operations.

The retail industry has experienced financial difficulty that could adversely affect VF's business.

Recently there have been consolidations, reorganizations, restructurings, bankruptcies and ownership changes in the retail industry. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in closed stores, and reduced consumer traffic and purchasing, as governments impose mandatory business closures and similar measures to curtail the spread of the disease, and consumers limit shopping due to illness or to avoid exposure. These events individually, and together, could have (and, in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, have had) a material, adverse effect on VF's business. These changes could impact VF’s opportunities in the market and increase VF’s reliance on a smaller number of large customers. In the future, retailers are likely to further consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations or bankruptcies, realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target markets. In addition, consumers have continued to transition away from traditional wholesale retailers to large online retailers. These developments could result in a reduction in the number of stores that carry VF’s products, an increase in ownership concentration within the retail industry, an increase in credit exposure to VF or an increase in leverage by VF’s customers over their suppliers.

Further, the global economy periodically experiences recessionary conditions with rising unemployment, reduced availability of credit, increased savings rates and declines in real estate and securities values. These recessionary conditions, including as a result of the current COVID-19 pandemic, could have a negative impact on retail sales of apparel and other consumer products. The lower sales volumes, along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets, could result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures, bankruptcies or liquidations. This could result in higher credit risk to VF relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties. If these developments occur, our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on VF’s trade accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on VF’s financial condition and results of operations.

Our ability to obtain short-term or long-term financing on favorable terms, if needed, could be adversely affected by geopolitical risk and volatility in the capital markets.

Any disruption in the capital markets could limit the availability of funds or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend capital in the future. Future volatility in the financial and credit markets, including the recent volatility due, in part, to the current COVID-19 pandemic, could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing or refinance existing debt when the need arises, including upon maturity, or on terms that would be acceptable to us. This


VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K


disruption or volatility could adversely affect our liquidity and funding resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. An inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In addition, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021.  Uncertainty regarding rates may make borrowing or refinancing our indebtedness more expensive or difficult to achieve on terms we consider favorable.

VF has a global revolving credit facility. One or more of the participating banks may not be able to honor their commitments, which could have an adverse effect on VF’s business.

VF has a $2.25 billion global revolving credit facility that expires in December 2023. If the financial markets return to recessionary conditions, the ability of one or more of the banks participating in our credit agreements could be impaired in honoring their commitments. This could have an adverse effect on our business if we were not able to replace those commitments or to locate other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms.

VF’s indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations and prevent VF from fulfilling its financial obligations, and VF may not be able to maintain its current credit ratings, may not continue to pay dividends or repurchase its common stock and may not remain in compliance with existing debt covenants.

As of March 28, 2020, VF had approximately

$3.8 billion

of debt outstanding. Following the end of the fiscal year, VF issued $3.0 billion of senior notes in a transaction that closed on April 23, 2020 and VF used some of the net proceeds from that offering to repay its borrowings under its revolving credit facility. VF’s debt and interest payment requirements could have important consequences on its business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, it could:

•

require VF to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to repaying its indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, future acquisitions, dividends, repurchase VF’s common stock and for other general corporate purposes;

•

limit VF’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to general adverse economic conditions or changes in its business and the industries in which it operates;

•

place VF at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less indebtedness outstanding; and

•

negatively affect VF's credit ratings and limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in VF’s debt documents, its ability to borrow additional funds.

In addition, VF may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions, repurchase common stock or fund other activities for general business purposes. If VF incurs additional indebtedness, it may limit VF’s ability to access the debt capital markets or other forms of financing in the future and may result in increased borrowing costs.

Although VF has historically declared and paid quarterly cash dividends on its common stock and has been authorized to repurchase its stock subject to certain limitations under its share repurchase programs, any determinations by the board of directors

to continue to declare and pay cash dividends on VF’s common stock or to repurchase VF’s common stock will be based primarily upon VF’s financial condition, results of operations and business requirements, its access to debt capital markets or other forms of financing, the price of its common stock in the case of the repurchase program and the board of directors’ continuing determination that the repurchase programs and the declaration and payment of dividends are in the best interests of VF’s stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs. In the event VF does not declare and pay a quarterly dividend or discontinues its share repurchases, VF’s stock price could be adversely affected.

VF is required to comply with certain financial and other restrictive debt covenants in its debt documents. Failure by VF to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on the Company if the lenders declare any outstanding obligations to be immediately due and payable.

The loss of members of VF’s executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on its business.

VF depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers and business leaders who have substantial experience and expertise in VF’s business. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on VF. Our future success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and engage our personnel sufficiently. Competition for experienced and well-qualified personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.

VF’s direct-to-consumer business includes risks that could have an adverse effect on its results of operations.

VF sells merchandise direct-to-consumer through VF-operated stores and e-commerce sites. Its direct-to-consumer business is subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on its results. Risks include, but are not limited to, (i) U.S. or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside VF’s control, (ii) failure of the systems that operate the stores and websites, and their related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, privacy concerns, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, (iii) credit card fraud, and (iv) risks related to VF’s direct-to-consumer distribution centers and processes. Risks specific to VF’s e-commerce business also include (i) diversion of sales from VF stores or wholesale customers, (ii) difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels, (iii) liability for online content, (iv) changing patterns of consumer behavior, and (v) intense competition from online retailers. VF’s failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in its e-commerce business, as well as damage its reputation and brands.

Our VF-operated stores and e-commerce business require substantial fixed investments in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our direct-to-consumer operations, a decline in sales or the closure of or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employee-related costs.

VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K



VF’s net sales depend on the volume of traffic to its stores and the availability of suitable lease space.

A growing portion of our revenues are direct-to-consumer sales through VF-operated stores. In order to generate customer traffic, we locate many of our stores in prominent locations within successful retail shopping centers or in fashionable shopping districts. Our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. Part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. We cannot control the development of new shopping centers or districts; the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping centers or districts; competition with other retailers for prominent locations; or the success of individual shopping centers or districts. Further, if we are unable to renew or replace our existing store leases or enter into leases for new stores on favorable terms, or if we violate the terms of our current leases, our growth and profitability could be harmed. All of these factors may impact our ability to meet our growth targets and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

VF may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights.

VF’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its competitive position. VF is susceptible to others copying its products and infringing its intellectual property rights, especially with the shift in product mix to higher priced brands and innovative new products in recent years. Some of VF’s brands, such as

The North Face

®

,

Timberland

®

,

Vans

®

,

JanSport

®

and

Dickies

®

, enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition, and the higher pricing of those products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement.

VF’s trademarks, trade names, patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property are important to VF’s success. Counterfeiting of VF’s products or infringement on its intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect VF’s revenues. Actions we have taken to establish and protect VF’s intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent copying of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its trademarks or block sales of VF’s products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others. In addition, unilateral actions in the U.S. or other countries, including changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights, could have an impact on VF’s ability to enforce those rights.

The value of VF’s intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of VF, or trademarks that are similar to VF’s trademarks, or trademarks that VF licenses from others. We may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to VF’s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. In other cases, there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks.

There have been, and there may in the future be, opposition and cancellation proceedings from time to time with respect to some of VF's intellectual property rights. In some cases, litigation may be necessary to protect or enforce our trademarks and other

intellectual property rights. Furthermore, third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us, and we may be subject to liability, required to enter into costly license agreements, if available at all, required to rebrand our products and/or prevented from selling some of our products if third parties successfully oppose or challenge our trademarks or successfully claim that we infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate their trademarks, copyrights, patents or other intellectual property rights. Bringing or defending any such claim, regardless of merit, and whether successful or unsuccessful, could be expensive and time-consuming and have a negative effect on VF's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

VF is subject to the risk that its licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of VF’s brands.

During Fiscal


,

$57.4 million

of VF’s revenues were derived from licensing royalties. Although VF generally has significant control over its licensees’ products and advertising, we rely on our licensees for, among other things, operational and financial controls over their businesses. Failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace existing licensees, if necessary, could adversely affect VF’s revenues, both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. Risks are also associated with a licensee’s ability to:

•

Obtain capital;

•

Manage its labor relations;

•

Maintain relationships with its suppliers;

•

Manage its credit risk effectively;

•

Maintain relationships with its customers; and,

•

Adhere to VF’s Global Compliance Principles.

In addition, VF relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands. Although we attempt to protect VF’s brands through approval rights over design, production processes, quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of licensed VF brands by our licensees. The misuse of a brand by a licensee, including through the marketing of products under one of our brand names that do not meet our quality standards, could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on VF.

If VF encounters problems with its distribution system, VF’s ability to deliver its products to the market could be adversely affected.

VF relies on owned or independently-operated distribution facilities to warehouse and ship product to its customers. VF’s distribution system includes computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. Because substantially all of VF’s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations, VF’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes, floods, fires or other natural disasters or other events outside VF's control affecting its distribution centers. We maintain business interruption insurance under our Property and Cyber insurance policies, but it may not adequately protect VF from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in VF’s distribution facilities. In addition, VF’s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities. If we encounter problems with


VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K


our distribution system, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected.

Volatility in securities markets, interest rates and other economic factors could substantially increase VF’s defined benefit pension costs.

VF currently has obligations under its defined benefit pension plans. The funded status of the pension plans is dependent on many factors, including returns on investment assets and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations. Unfavorable impacts from returns on plan assets, decreases in discount rates, changes in plan demographics or revisions in the applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of pension funding requirements, which could reduce cash available for VF’s business.

VF’s operating performance also may be negatively impacted by the amount of expense recorded for its pension plans. Pension expense is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market, economic and demographic conditions. Differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are deferred and amortized as part of future pension expense, which can create volatility that adversely impacts VF’s future operating results.

We may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits we expect to achieve from the spin-off.

On May 22, 2019, we completed the spin-off of our Jeans business, Kontoor Brands, Inc. ("Kontoor Brands"). Although we believe that the spin-off will enhance our long-term value, we may not be able to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits from the separation of our businesses, and the spin-off may adversely affect our business. Separating the businesses resulted in two independent, publicly traded companies, each of which is now a smaller, less diversified and more narrowly focused business than before the spin-off, which makes us more vulnerable to changing market and economic conditions. Additionally, a potential loss of synergies from separating the businesses could negatively impact the balance sheet, profit margins or earnings of both businesses and the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly traded companies may not be equal to or greater than the value of VF common stock had the spin-off not occurred. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the spin-off, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

The Kontoor Brands spin-off could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders.

We received opinions of tax advisors substantially to the effect that, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, the spin-off and certain

related transactions qualify for tax-free treatment under certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code. However, if the factual assumptions or representations made by us in connection with the delivery of the opinions are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business, we will not be able to rely on the opinions. Furthermore, the opinions are not binding on the IRS or the courts. If, notwithstanding receipt of the opinions, the spin-off transaction and certain related transactions are determined to be taxable, we would be subject to a substantial tax liability. In addition, if the spin-off transaction is taxable, each holder of our common stock who received shares of Kontoor Brands in connection with the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received.

Even if the spin-off otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction, the distribution would be taxable to us (but not to our stockholders) in certain circumstances if future significant acquisitions of our stock or the stock of Kontoor Brands are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the spin-off. In this event, the resulting tax liability could be substantial. In connection with the spin-off, we entered into a tax matters agreement with Kontoor Brands, pursuant to which Kontoor Brands agreed to not enter into any transaction that could cause any portion of the spin-off to be taxable to us without our consent and to indemnify us for any tax liability resulting from any such transaction. In addition, these potential tax liabilities may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of us.

Certain directors who serve on our Board of Directors also serve as directors of Kontoor Brands, and ownership of shares of common stock of Kontoor Brands following the spin-off by our directors and executive officers, may create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest.

Certain of our directors who serve on our Board of Directors currently serve on the Board of Directors of Kontoor Brands. This may create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest when our or Kontoor Brands' management and directors face decisions that could have different implications for us and Kontoor Brands, including the resolution of any dispute regarding the terms of the agreements governing the spin-off and the relationship between us and Kontoor Brands after the spin-off or any other commercial agreements entered into in the future between us and Kontoor Brands.

Some of our executive officers and non-employee directors currently own shares of the common stock of Kontoor Brands. The continued ownership of such common stock by our directors and executive officers following the spin-off creates or may create the appearance of a conflict of interest when these directors and executive officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and Kontoor Brands.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OVERVIEW

VF Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, collectively known as “VF” or the "Company”) is a global leader in the design, procurement, production, marketing and distribution of branded lifestyle apparel, footwear and related products. VF’s diverse portfolio meets consumer needs across a broad spectrum of activities and lifestyles. Our long-term growth strategy is focused on four drivers — drive and optimize our portfolio, distort investments to Asia, elevate direct channels and accelerate our consumer-minded, retail-centric, hyper-digital business model transformation.

VF is diversified across brands, product categories, channels of distribution, geographies and consumer demographics. We own a

broad portfolio of brands in the outerwear, footwear, apparel, backpack, luggage and accessories categories. Our products are marketed to consumers through our wholesale channel, primarily in specialty stores, department stores, national chains, mass merchants, independently-operated partnership stores and with strategic digital partners. Our products are also marketed to consumers through our own direct-to-consumer operations, which include VF-operated stores, concession retail stores, brand e-commerce sites and other digital platforms.

VF is organized by groupings of businesses represented by its reportable segments for financial reporting purposes. The three reportable segments are Outdoor, Active and Work.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

VF changed to a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to March 31 of each year. VF previously used a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to December 31 of each year. All references to the years ended March

foreign currency amounts below reflect the changes in foreign exchange rates from the year ended March


and their impact on translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. All references to foreign currency amounts also reflect the impact of foreign currency-denominated transactions in countries with highly inflationary economies. VF’s most significant foreign currency exposure relates to business conducted in euro-based countries. Additionally, VF conducts business in other developed and emerging markets around the world with exposure to foreign currencies other than the euro, such as Argentina, which is a highly inflationary economy.

On October 2, 2017, VF acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Williamson-Dickie Mfg. Co. ("Williamson-Dickie") and the business results have been included in the Work segment. On April 3, 2018, VF acquired 100% of the stock of Icebreaker Holdings Limited ("Icebreaker"). On June 1, 2018, VF acquired 100% of the stock of Icon-Altra LLC, plus certain assets in Europe ("Altra"). The business results for Icebreaker and Altra have been included in the Outdoor segment. All references to contributions from acquisition below represent the operating results of Altra for the two months ended May 2019, which reflects the one-year anniversary of the acquisition.

JanSport

®

brand collegiate businesses) sold during the year ended December 2017 have been reported as discontinued

operations in our Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These changes have been applied to all periods presented.

On October 5, 2018, VF completed the sale of the Van Moer business, which was included in the Work segment. On October 26, 2018, VF completed the sale of the

Reef

®

brand business, which was included in the Active segment. All references to dispositions below represent the impact of operating results of the

®

,

Lee

®

and

Rock & Republic

®

brands, as well as the

TM

business, into an independent, publicly traded company now operating under the name Kontoor Brands, Inc. ("Kontoor Brands"). As a result, VF reported the operating results for the Jeans business in the income from discontinued operations, net of tax line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income and the related cash flows have been reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, for all periods presented. In addition, the related assets and liabilities have been reported as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, through the date the spin-off was completed.

On January 21, 2020, VF announced its decision to explore the divestiture of its Occupational Workwear business. The Occupational Workwear business is comprised primarily of the following brands and businesses:

and

Horace Small

®

.

The business also includes certain

Dickies

®

occupational workwear products that have historically been sold through the business-to-business channel. During the three months ended March 2020, the Company determined that the Occupational Workwear business met the held-for-sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria and expects to divest this business in the next twelve months. Accordingly, the Company began to report the results of the Occupational Workwear business and the related cash flows as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, respectively. The related held-for-sale assets and liabilities have been reported as assets and liabilities of

VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Impact of COVID-19

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus ("COVID-19") a pandemic. As the global spread of COVID-19 continues, VF remains first and foremost focused on a people-first approach that prioritizes the health and well-being of its employees, customers, trade partners and consumers around the world. To help mitigate the spread of COVID-19, VF has modified its business practices, including in response to legislation, executive orders and guidance from government entities and healthcare authorities (collectively, "COVID-19 Directives"). These directives include the temporary closing of offices and retail stores, instituting travel bans and restrictions and implementing health and safety measures including social distancing and quarantines.

As a result of COVID-19 Directives, retail stores in Asia-Pacific, Europe and the Americas, whether operated by VF or our customers, were or are now closed. Currently, the majority of VF-operated retail stores have reopened in Asia-Pacific, including all in Mainland China, and while store traffic has improved recently, it remains down significantly when compared with the prior year. VF has started a phased reopening of its retail stores in Europe and North America in accordance with guidance from government entities and healthcare authorities, to allow proper training and preparation of the retail environment. VF currently expects most of its retail stores to be open by mid-calendar year 2020. While many of VF's wholesale customers in North America and Europe remain closed, most have announced reopening plans starting in the coming weeks.

Consistent with VF’s long-term strategy, the Company’s digital platform remains a high priority through which its brands stay

connected with consumer communities while providing experiential content. In accordance with local government guidelines and in consultation with the guidance of global health professionals, VF has implemented measures designed to ensure the health, safety and well-being of associates employed in its distribution and fulfillment centers around the world. Many of these facilities remain operational and support digital consumer engagement with its brands and to service retail partners as needed.

COVID-19 has also impacted some of VF's suppliers, including third-party manufacturers, logistics providers and other vendors. At this time, many of VF's facilities continue to manufacture and distribute products globally in a reduced capacity. VF is actively monitoring our supply chain and implementing mitigation plans.

The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and dynamic in nature, and continues to drive global uncertainty and disruption. As a result, COVID-19 is having a significant negative impact on the Company's business, including the consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020. While we are not able to determine the ultimate length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect store closures, both VF-operated and our customers, an anticipated reduction in traffic once stores initially reopen and a highly promotional marketplace will have a significant negative impact on our Fiscal 2021 financial performance including a decrease in revenues of approximately 50% in the first quarter.

Enterprise Protection Strategy

VF has taken a number of proactive actions to advance its Enterprise Protection Strategy in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

To enhance VF's financial flexibility and liquidity in the current unprecedented period of uncertainty, including the unknown duration and overall impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, on March 23, 2020, VF elected to draw down $1.0 billion available from its $2.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Global Credit Facility") that expires in December 2023. On April 9, 2020, VF elected to draw down an additional $1.0 billion available from the Global Credit Facility.

On April 23, 2020, VF closed its sale of senior unsecured notes including $1.0 billion of 2.050% notes due April 2022, $750.0 million of 2.400% notes due April 2025, $500.0 million of 2.800% notes due April 2027 and $750.0 million of 2.950% notes due April 2030. The net proceeds received by the Company were approximately $2.98 billion. A portion of the net proceeds was used to repay the $2.0 billion of borrowings under the Global Credit Facility noted above

and the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. Following the notes issuance and repayment, VF has approximately $2.2 billion available for borrowing against the Global Credit Facility and approximately $3.0 billion of cash and equivalents on hand.

Other actions VF has taken to support its business in response to the COVID-19 pandemic include the Company's decision to temporarily pause its share repurchase program. The Company currently has $2.8 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization. Subject to approval by its Board of Directors, VF intends to continue to pay its regularly scheduled dividend and is currently not contemplating the suspension of its dividend program. VF's planned divestiture of the Occupational Workwear business would provide an additional source of cash.

Other actions taken by VF also include the temporary reduction of CEO Steve Rendle's base salary by 50 percent and the base salaries of VF's Executive Leadership Team by 25 percent. In addition, VF’s Board of Directors will temporarily forgo their cash retainer. These


VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K


reductions will continue to be assessed as the situation progresses.

VF has implemented cost controls to reduce discretionary spending to help mitigate the loss of sales and to conserve cash while continuing to support employees. VF is also assessing its forward inventory purchase commitments to ensure proper matching of supply and demand, which will result in an overall reduction in future commitments. As VF continues to actively monitor the situation, we may take further actions that affect our operations.

We believe the Company has sufficient liquidity and flexibility to operate during the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental actions and regulations and health authority advisories and meet its obligations as they become due. However, due to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental actions in response to the pandemic, and the impact on us and our consumers, customers and suppliers, there is no certainty that the measures we take will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by COVID-19. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors." for additional discussion.

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated Statements of Income

The following table presents a summary of the changes in net revenues for the year ended March 2020 compared to the year ended March 2019:

VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K



Year Ended March


Compared to Year Ended March


VF reported a

2%

increase in revenues in


. The revenue increase was attributable to organic growth in all segments and continued strength in our direct-to-consumer and international businesses. The increase was partially offset by lower revenues due to the

Reef

®

brand and Van Moer business dispositions and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency. The overall increase was also impacted by lower revenues in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020, primarily driven by the COVID-19 outbreak, which resulted in an

11%

decrease in revenues over the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales grew in every region in


.

There is significant uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of COVID-19; however, due to store closures and an expected reduction in initial traffic once stores reopen, we anticipate there will be a significant negative impact to our Fiscal 2021 revenues including a decrease of approximately 50% in the first quarter.

Additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled “Information by Reportable Segment”.

The following table presents the percentage relationship to net revenues for components of the Consolidated Statements of Income:

Year Ended March


Compared to Year Ended March


Gross margin increased 70 basis points to

55.3%

in


compared to

54.6%

in


. Gross margin in


was positively impacted by a mix-shift to higher margin businesses and a favorable net foreign currency transaction impact.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased 30 basis points in


compared to


. This increase was primarily due to continued investments in our key strategic growth initiatives, which include direct-to-consumer, demand creation, product innovation and technology. These costs were partially offset by leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues, decreased compensation costs and lower transaction and deal-related costs in


.

VF recorded a

$323.2 million

noncash impairment charge related to the Timberland reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2020. For additional information, refer to Notes


and


to the consolidated financial statements and the "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" section below.

In


, operating margin decreased 280 basis points, to

8.8%

from

11.6%

in


, primarily due to the items described above.

Net interest expense decreased

$20.6 million

to

$72.2 million

in


. The decrease in net interest expense was due to lower rates on decreased borrowings of short-term debt, partially due to repayment activity funded by the cash received from Kontoor Brands, and higher international cash balances in higher yielding currencies. The decrease was partially offset by a deferred loss on an interest rate hedging contract of $8.5 million recognized in net interest expense in 2020 in connection with the full redemption of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2021 notes.

Outstanding interest-bearing debt averaged $2.6 billion and $3.4 billion for


and


, respectively, with short-term borrowings representing 15.2% and 35.3% of average debt outstanding for the respective years. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 3.0% in


and 3.1% in


.

Loss on debt extinguishment of

$59.8 million

was recorded in


as a result of the premiums, amortization and fees associated with cash tender offers for VF's outstanding 2033 and 2037 notes, and the full redemption of VF's outstanding 2021 notes.

Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, other components of net periodic pension cost (excluding the service cost component) and non-operating gains and losses. Other income (expense) netted to

$(68.7) million

and

$(59.1) million

in


and


, respectively. Included in other income (expense), net in 2020 is $48.3 million expense related to the release of currency translation amounts associated with the substantial liquidation of foreign entities in certain countries in South America and $27.4 million expense related to pension settlement charges. Included in other income (expense), net in 2019 is the loss on sale of the

Reef

®

brand of $14.4 million and loss on sale of $22.4 million related to the divestiture of the Van Moer business.

The effective income tax rate was

13.5%

in


compared to

16.2%

in


. The effective income tax rate is lower in


when compared to


primarily due to the discrete tax benefit associated with the transitional impact of the Swiss Tax Act. The


effective income tax rate included a net discrete tax benefit of

$92.5 million

, which primarily related to the

$93.6 million

net tax benefit recognized due to the transitional impact from the enactment of the Swiss Tax Act. The

$92.5 million

net discrete tax benefit in


reduced the effective income tax rate by

12.7%

compared to an unfavorable

2.0%

impact of discrete items for


. Excluding discrete items, the effective tax rate during


increased by approximately

12.0%

primarily due to nondeductible goodwill impairment charges and a lower percentage of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions. The international effective tax rate was

15.6%

for


.

As a result of the above, income from continuing operations in


was

$629.1 million

(

$1.57

per diluted share), compared to

$870.4 million

(

$2.17

per diluted share) in


.

There is significant uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of COVID-19; however, due to expected lower revenues, the adverse impact to gross margin due to higher promotional activity and higher net interest expense resulting from recent debt issuances, we anticipate there will be a significant negative impact to our Fiscal 2021 income from continuing operations.

Operating margin decreased 60 basis points in


compared to the


period due to higher product costs and increased investments in product innovation, demand creation and technology. The decline was partially offset by increased pricing, a mix-shift to higher margin businesses, lower relocation costs and a favorable net foreign currency transaction impact. The decrease was also partially offset by a gain of approximately $11 million on the sale of office real estate and related assets in connection with the relocation of VF's global headquarters and certain brands to Denver, Colorado during the first quarter of 2020.

As discussed above, there is significant uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of COVID-19; however, we anticipate there will be a significant negative impact to our Outdoor Fiscal 2021 segment revenues and segment profit.

Reconciliation of Segment Profit to Consolidated Income Before Income Taxes

There are three types of costs necessary to reconcile total segment profit to consolidated income before income taxes. These costs are (i) impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, which is excluded from segment profit because these costs are not part of the ongoing operations of the respective businesses, (ii) interest expense, net, and loss on debt extinguishment which are excluded from segment profit because substantially all financing costs are managed at the

corporate office and are not under the control of segment management, and (iii) corporate and other expenses, which are excluded from segment profit to the extent they are not allocated to the segments. Impairment of goodwill and net interest expense are discussed in the “Consolidated Statements of Income” section, and corporate and other expenses are discussed below.

Following is a summary of VF’s corporate and other expenses:

Information Systems and Shared Services

These costs include management information systems and the centralized finance, supply chain, human resources, direct-to-consumer and customer management functions that support worldwide operations. Operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the segments based on utilization of those services. Costs to develop new computer applications are generally not allocated to the segments. Included in information systems and shared services costs in the year ended March


and


are costs associated with software system implementations and upgrades and other strategic projects.

Corporate Headquarters’ Costs

Headquarters’ costs include compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff, legal and professional fees, and general and administrative expenses that have not been allocated to the segments. The increase in corporate headquarters’


VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K


costs in


compared to 2019 is primarily attributed to expenses associated with the acquisition, integration and separation of businesses, certain costs related to the relocation of VF's global headquarters to Denver, Colorado, and other strategic project costs.

Other

This category includes (i) costs of corporate programs or corporate-managed decisions that are not allocated to the segments, (ii) costs of registering, maintaining and enforcing certain of VF’s trademarks, and (iii) miscellaneous consolidated costs, the most significant of which is related to the expense of VF’s centrally-managed U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Included in

other expense in 2020 is $48.3 million related to the release of currency translation amounts associated with the substantial liquidation of foreign entities in certain countries in South America. Included in both 2020 and 2019 are certain corporate overhead and other costs previously included in the Work and former Jeans segments, which have been reallocated to continuing operations. The costs in 2020 associated with the former Jeans segment have been largely offset by reimbursements from Kontoor Brands related to transition services, which is the primary driver of the overall decrease when compared to costs in 2019. Also included in other expense in the year ended March 2019 is the loss on sale of the

Reef

brand business of $14.4 million and loss on sale of $22.4 million related to the divestiture of the Van Moer business.

YEAR ENDED MARCH 2019 ANALYSIS

Consolidated Statement of Income

VF reported

$10.3 billion

in revenues for the year ended March 2019. Revenues were driven by strength in all segments, the direct-to-consumer channel, international businesses and recent acquisitions, including Williamson-Dickie, Icebreaker and Altra.

TRANSITION PERIOD THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 2018 ANALYSIS

Consolidated Statement of Income

VF reported

$2.2 billion

in revenues for the three months ended March 2018. Revenues were driven by strength in the Active segment, the direct-to-consumer channel, international businesses and the Williamson-Dickie acquisition.

Direct-to-consumer revenues were 40% of total revenues in the three months ended March 2018, driven by an expanding e-commerce business. There were 1,313 total VF-owned retail stores at the end of March 2018. International revenues were 53% of total revenues in the three months ended March 2018, driven by the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions.

Gross margin was

53.8%

in the three months ended March 2018, which was due to favorable pricing and a mix-shift to higher margin businesses in the Active and Outdoor segments, partially offset by lower margins attributable to the Williamson-Dickie acquisition and product costs.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues was

47.0%

during the three months ended March 2018. This includes expenses related to the acquisition and integration of businesses and investments in our key growth priorities, which include demand creation, customer fulfillment, direct-to-consumer and product innovation. Compensation costs also impacted the three months ended March 2018.

Operating margin in the three months ended March 2018 was

6.8%

due to the items described above.

Net interest expense was

$22.6 million

in the three months ended March 2018. This was driven by interest on short-term borrowings and reflects lower interest on long-term debt due to the payoff of the $250.0 million of 5.95% fixed-rate notes on November 1, 2017. Total outstanding debt averaged $3.2 billion in the three months ended March 2018, with a weighted average interest rate of 2.9%.

11.2%

. Without discrete items, the effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 2018 was

VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K



YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2017 ANALYSIS

Consolidated Statement of Income

VF reported

$8.4 billion

in revenues for the year ended December 2017. Revenues were driven by strength in the Active and Outdoor segments, the direct-to-consumer, international businesses and the Williamson-Dickie acquisition.

Direct-to-consumer revenues were 40% of total revenues in 2017, driven by an expanding e-commerce business. There were 1,344 total VF-owned retail stores at the end of December 2017. International revenues were 49% of total revenues in 2017, driven by the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions.

Gross margin was

54.1%

in 2017, which was due to favorable pricing and a mix-shift to higher margin businesses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues was

43.6%

during 2017. This was due to investments in our key growth priorities, which include direct-to-consumer, product innovations, demand creation and technology initiatives.

Operating margin in 2017 was

10.5%

due to the items described above.

Net interest expense was

$89.0 million

in 2017. This was driven by interest on short-term borrowings and higher interest on long-term debt balances due to a full year of interest on the €850.0 million euro-denominated 0.625% fixed-rate notes issued in September 2016, which were partially offset by the payoff of the $250.0 million of 5.95% fixed-rate notes on November 1, 2017 and higher international short-term investment rates. Outstanding interest-bearing debt averaged $3.2 billion for 2017, with short-term borrowings representing 27% of average debt outstanding. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 3.1% in 2017.

Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, other components of net periodic pension cost (excluding the service cost component) and non-operating gains and losses. Other income (expense) netted to

$(6.5) million

in


.

The effective income tax rate was

66.0%

in 2017. The effective income tax rate was substantially higher in 2017 primarily due to discrete tax expense associated with the U.S. Tax Act. The U.S. Tax Act reduced the federal tax rate on U.S. earnings to

21%

and moved from a global taxation regime to a modified territorial regime. As part of the legislation, U.S. companies were required to pay a tax on historical earnings generated offshore that have not been repatriated to the U.S. Additionally, revaluation of deferred tax asset and liability positions at the lower federal base rate of

21%

was also required. The transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act resulted in a provisional net charge of

$465.5 million

, or

$1.15

per share, during the three months ended December 2017. This amount, which is included in the income taxes line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income, is primarily comprised of approximately

$512.4 million

related to the transition tax and approximately

$89.5 million

tax benefit related to revaluing U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities using the new U.S. corporate tax rate of

21%

. Other provisional charges of

$42.6 million

were primarily related to U.S. federal and state tax on foreign income and dividends and establishing a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding taxes as the Company is not asserting indefinite reinvestment on short-term liquid assets of certain foreign subsidiaries. All other foreign earnings, including basis differences of certain foreign subsidiaries, continue to be considered indefinitely reinvested.

The 2017 effective income tax rate included a net discrete tax expense of

$441.9 million

, which included the provisional net charge of

$465.5 million

related to the U.S. Tax Act and

$22.0 million

of tax benefits related to stock compensation. The

$441.9 million

net discrete tax expense in 2017 increased the effective income tax rate by

56.1%

. Without discrete items, the effective tax rate during 2017 was

9.9%

.

As a result of the above, income from continuing operations in 2017 was

$268.1 million

(

$0.66

per diluted share).

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

Balance Sheets

The following discussion refers to significant changes in balances for continuing operations at March


compared to March


:

•

Increase in inventories

— primarily due to higher inventory levels due to decreased consumer demand due to the impact of COVID-19.

•

Increase in property, plant and equipment

— primarily related to capital spending associated with the construction of distribution centers.

•

Decrease in goodwill

— primarily due to a $323.2 million goodwill impairment charge related to the Timberland reporting unit.

•

Increase in operating lease right-of-use assets

— due to amounts recorded in connection with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842,

Leases

("ASC 842").

•

Increase in other assets

— primarily due to an increase in deferred tax assets associated with the transitional impact from the enactment of the Swiss Tax Act.

•

Increase in short-term borrowings

— primarily due to a $1.0 billion draw down from VF's $2.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility in March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by repayment of

commercial paper borrowings including the use of funds provided by the cash received from Kontoor Brands.

•

Decrease in accounts payable

— driven by the timing of payments to vendors.

•

Increase in accrued liabilities

— primarily due to amounts recorded for operating lease liabilities in connection with the adoption of ASC 842, partially offset by lower accrued compensation.

•

Increase in long-term debt

— due to the issuance of €500.0 million euro-denominated 0.250% fixed rate notes and €500.0 million euro-denominated 0.625% fixed rate notes in 2020, partially offset by cash tender offers for $23.0 million and $63.1 million of VF's outstanding 2033 and 2037 notes, respectively, and the full redemption of $500.0 million of VF's outstanding 2021 notes in 2020.

•

Increase in operating lease liabilities

— due to amounts recorded for operating lease liabilities in connection with the adoption of ASC 842.

•

Decrease in other liabilities

— primarily due to the reclassification of deferred rent credits from other liabilities to operating lease right-of-use assets in connection with the adoption of ASC 842.

Liquidity and Cash Flows

The financial condition of VF is reflected in the following:

The current ratio remained flat at

March 2020

compared to

March 2019

, as increases in current assets driven by higher cash balances primarily due to debt issuances, as discussed in the "Cash Provided (Used) by Financing Activities" section below, and higher inventory balances, as discussed in the "Balance Sheets" section above, were offset by increases in current liabilities driven by higher short-term borrowings and accrued liabilities, as discussed in the "Balance Sheets" section above. The comparison was negatively impacted by the recording of the current portion of operating lease liabilities in accrued liabilities in the March 2020 period in connection with the adoption of ASC 842.

For the ratio of debt to total capital, debt is defined as short-term and long-term borrowings, in addition to operating lease liabilities, beginning in the Fiscal 2020 period. Total capital is defined as debt plus stockholders’ equity. The increase in the debt to total capital ratio at March


compared to March


was attributed to the increase in operating lease liabilities, the increase in short-term borrowings and the increase in long-term debt, as discussed in the

"Balance Sheets" section above. The increase was also attributed to a decrease in stockholders' equity, driven by share repurchases and payments of dividends, partially offset by net income and stock-based compensation activity. Excluding the operating lease liabilities, the debt to total capital ratio was

53.3%

as of

March 2020

. VF's consolidated indebtedness excluding operating lease liabilities and net of unrestricted cash of VF and its subsidiaries as a percentage of total capital (net debt to capital) was

42.4%

as of March 2020.

VF’s primary source of liquidity is the strong annual cash flow from operating activities. Cash from operations is typically lower in the first half of the calendar year as inventory builds to support peak sales periods in the second half of the calendar year. Cash provided by operating activities in the second half of the calendar year is substantially higher as inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected. Additionally, direct-to-consumer sales are typically highest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year.

VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K



In summary, our cash flows from continuing operations were as follows:

Cash Provided (Used) by Operating Activities

Cash flow related to operating activities is dependent on net income, adjustments to net income and changes in working capital. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the year ended March


compared to the year ended March


is primarily due to lower net income in the year ended March


and an increase in net cash usage for working capital.

Cash provided by operating activities in the year ended March 2019 reflects higher net income and net cash provided by working capital.

Cash used by operating activities in the three months ended March 2018 reflects net cash usage from working capital driven by the timing of payments and cash collections.

Cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December


reflects lower net income that was largely offset by working capital changes primarily related to an increase in accrued income tax payable resulting from the U.S. Tax Act.

Cash Used by Investing Activities

The increase in cash used by investing activities in the year ended March


compared to the year ended March


related primarily to

$430.3 million

of proceeds from the sale of businesses, net of cash sold in the year ended March


, partially offset by

$320.4 million

of net cash paid for acquisitions in the year ended March 2019 and $63.7 million from the sale of office real estate and related assets in connection with the relocation of VF's global headquarters and certain brands to Denver, Colorado in the year ended March 2020. Capital expenditures

increase

d

$72.4 million

compared to the year ended March


.

VF's investing activities in the year ended March 2019 include

$430.3 million

of proceeds from the sale of businesses, net of cash sold in the year. The proceeds were more than offset by

$320.4 million

of net cash paid for acquisitions, capital expenditures of $215.8 million and software purchases of $53.2 million.

VF's investing activities in the three months ended March 2018 include

$45.5 million

of capital expenditures, proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $20.8 million and $18.7 million of software purchases.

VF’s investing activities in the year ended December


related primarily to the Williamson-Dickie acquisition of

$740.5 million

, net of cash received. Additionally, the activities included

$215.0 million

of proceeds from the sale of LSG. Capital expenditures of

$140.2 million

and software purchases of

$63.6 million

offset the proceeds received.

Cash Provided (Used) by Financing Activities

The increase in cash provided by financing activities in the year ended March


compared to the year ended March


was primarily due to a net increase in short-term borrowings of

$1.4

billion

, proceeds from long-term debt of

$1.1 billion

and

$906.1 million

of cash received from Kontoor Brands, net of cash transferred, which was partially offset by an

$849.3 million

increase in share repurchases and a

$642.8 million

increase in payments on long-term debt during the year ended March


.

VF's financing activities in the year ended March 2019 include an $864.2 million net decrease in short-term borrowings, $767.1 million in cash dividends paid and $150.7 million in share repurchases.

VF's financing activities in the three months ended March 2018 include a

$795.9 million

net increase in short-term borrowings, partially offset by

$250.3 million

in share repurchases and

$181.4 million

in cash dividends paid.

VF's financing activities in the year ended December 2017 include

$1.2 billion

in share repurchases, a $250.0 million repayment of long-term debt and

$684.7 million

in cash dividends paid, partially offset by a

$686.5 million

net increase in short-term borrowings.

During the years ended March


and


, the three months ended March 2018 and the year ended December


, VF purchased 12.0 million, 1.9 million, 3.4 million and 22.2 million shares, respectively, of its Common Stock in open market transactions under the share repurchase program authorized by VF's Board of Directors. The cost was $1.0 billion, $150.7 million, $250.3 million and $1.2 billion with an average price per share of $83.33, $80.62, $74.46 and $54.04 in the years ended March


and


, the three months ended March 2018 and the year ended December


, respectively. These amounts include shares held by the Company's deferred compensation plans.

In response to the COVID-19 outbreak and to preserve financial liquidity, VF has made the decision to temporarily pause its share repurchase program. As of the end of Fiscal


, the Company had $2.8 billion remaining for future repurchases under its share repurchase program. VF will continue to evaluate its use of capital, giving first priority to business acquisitions and then to direct shareholder return in the form of dividends and share repurchases.

VF relies on continued strong cash generation to finance its ongoing operations. In addition, VF has significant liquidity from its available cash balances and credit facilities. VF maintains a $2.25 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit (the “Global Credit Facility”) that expires in December 2023. VF may request an unlimited number of one year extensions so long as each extension does not cause the remaining life of the Global Credit Facility to exceed five years, subject to stated terms and conditions. The Global Credit Facility may be used to borrow funds in both U.S. dollar and certain non-U.S. dollar currencies, and has a $50.0 million letter of credit sublimit. In addition, the Global Credit Facility supports VF’s U.S. commercial paper program for short-term, seasonal working capital requirements and general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and acquisitions. Outstanding short-term balances may vary from period to period depending on the level of corporate requirements. Borrowings


VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K


under the Global Credit Facility are priced at a credit spread of 81.0 basis points over the appropriate LIBOR benchmark for each currency. VF is also required to pay a facility fee to the lenders, currently equal to 6.5 basis points of the committed amount of the facility. The credit spread and facility fee are subject to adjustment based on VF’s credit ratings.

In April 2020, VF entered into an amendment to the Global Credit Facility that resulted in certain changes to the restrictive covenants, including an increase to the consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio financial covenant to

70%

and revised calculation of consolidated indebtedness to be net of unrestricted cash of VF and its subsidiaries.

In March 2020, VF elected to draw down $1.0 billion from the Global Credit Facility to strengthen the Company's cash position and support general working capital needs in Fiscal 2021, which was an action taken by VF in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 9, 2020, VF elected to draw down an additional $1.0 billion available from the Global Credit Facility.

VF has a commercial paper program that allows for borrowings up to $2.25 billion to the extent that it has borrowing capacity under the Global Credit Facility.  Commercial paper borrowings and standby letters of credit issued as of March


were

$215.0 million

and

$18.4 million

, respectively.

VF has

$97.3 million

of international lines of credit with various banks, which are uncommitted and may be terminated at any time by either VF or the banks. Total outstanding balances under these arrangements were

$13.8 million

and

$9.1 million

at March


and March


, respectively. Borrowings under these arrangements had a weighted average interest rate of

16.3%

and

24.6%

at March


and March


, respectively.

In February 2020, VF issued

€500.0 million

of

0.250%

euro-denominated fixed-rate notes maturing in February 2028 and

€500.0 million

of

0.625%

euro-denominated fixed-rate notes maturing in February 2032. The 2028 notes were issued as a green bond, and thus an amount equal to the net proceeds will be used to finance projects that focus on key environmental sustainability initiatives including sustainable products and materials, sustainable operations and supply chain, and natural carbon sinks.

In February and March 2020, VF completed cash tender offers for

$23.0 million

and

$63.1 million

in aggregate principal amounts of its outstanding 6.00% fixed-rate notes due 2033 and 6.45% fixed-rate notes due 2037, respectively. The cash tender offers were subject to various conditions, which resulted in premiums of

$8.6 million

and

$31.9 million

for the 2033 and 2037 notes, respectively.

In March 2020, VF completed the full redemption of

$500.0 million

in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 3.50% fixed-rate notes due 2021. The redemption price was equal to the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted to the redemption date at

120 basis points

, which resulted in a make-whole premium of

$17.0 million

.

On April 23, 2020, VF closed its sale of senior unsecured notes including $1.0 billion of 2.050% notes due April 2022, $750.0 million

of 2.400% notes due April 2025, $500.0 million of 2.800% notes due April 2027 and $750.0 million of 2.950% notes due April 2030. The net proceeds received by the Company were approximately $2.98 billion. A portion of the net proceeds was used to repay the $2.0 billion of borrowings under the Global Credit Facility noted above and the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. Following the notes issuance and repayment, VF has approximately $2.2 billion available for borrowing against the Global Credit Facility and approximately $3.0 billion of cash and equivalents on hand.

VF’s favorable credit agency ratings allow for access to additional liquidity at competitive rates. At the end of March


, VF’s long-term debt ratings were ‘A’ by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and ‘A3’ by Moody’s Investors Service, both with 'stable' outlooks, and commercial paper ratings by those rating agencies were ‘A-1’ and ‘Prime-2’, respectively. In April 2020, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services revised VF's credit rating outlook to 'negative' from 'stable' to reflect the risk that extended economic stress from the COVID-19 pandemic on operating performance could result in a downgrade due to prolonged credit measure deterioration. Similarly, in April 2020 Moody's Investor Services also revised VF's credit rating outlook to 'negative'. At the same time, both agencies affirmed VF’s long-term debt and commercial paper ratings.

None of VF’s long-term debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings. However, if there were a change in control of VF and, as a result of the change in control, the 2023, 2028, 2032 and 2037 notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies, VF would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

Cash dividends totaled $1.90 per share in the year ended March


as compared to $1.94, $0.46 and $1.72 in the year ended March


, the three months ended March


and the year ended December


, respectively. The dividend payout ratio was

111.8%

of diluted earnings per share in the year ended March


, as compared to

61.7%

,

73.0%

and

112.9%

in the year ended March


, the three months ended March


and the year ended December


, respectively. The Company has declared a dividend of $0.48 per share that is payable in the first quarter of Fiscal


. Subject to approval by its Board of Directors, VF intends to continue to pay its regularly scheduled dividend and is not contemplating the suspension of its dividend program at this time.

There is currently significant uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of COVID-19; however, we expect there will be a significant negative impact to our Fiscal 2021 cash flows. We believe the Company has sufficient liquidity and flexibility to operate during the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental actions and regulations and health authority advisories and meet its obligations as they become due. However, due to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental actions in response to the pandemic, and the impact on us and our consumers, customers and suppliers, there is no certainty that the measures we take will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by COVID-19.

VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K



Following is a summary of VF’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of March


that will require the use of funds:

(1)

Long-term debt consists of required principal payments on long-term debt and finance lease obligations.

(2)

Other recorded liabilities represent payments due for long-term liabilities in VF’s Consolidated Balance Sheet related to deferred compensation and other employee-related benefits, product warranty claims and other liabilities. These amounts are based on historical and forecasted cash outflows. Amounts exclude liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits and deferred income taxes. Obligations under our qualified defined benefit pension plans and unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan are not included in the table above. Contractual cash obligations for these plans cannot be determined due to the number of assumptions required to estimate our future benefit obligations, including return on assets, discount rate and future compensation increases. The liabilities associated with these plans are presented in

Note 16

to the consolidated financial statements. We currently estimate that we will make contributions of approximately

$19.1 million

to our pension plans during Fiscal 2021. Future contributions may differ from our planned contributions due to many factors, including changes in tax and other benefit laws, changes to the plan, or significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates.

(3)

Interest payment obligations represent required interest payments on long-term debt and the interest portion of payments on finance leases. Amounts exclude amortization of debt issuance costs, debt discounts and acquisition costs that would be included in interest expense in the consolidated financial statements.

(4)

Operating leases represent required lease payments during the noncancelable lease term. Variable payments for occupancy-related costs, real estate taxes, insurance and contingent rent are not included above. In addition,

$319.6 million

of leases (on an undiscounted basis) that have not yet commenced with terms of 2 to 15 years beginning in Fiscal 2021 are not included above.

(5)

Minimum royalty payments represent obligations under license agreements to use trademarks owned by third parties and include required minimum advertising commitments. Actual payments could exceed minimum royalty obligations.

(6)

Inventory obligations represent binding commitments to purchase finished goods, raw materials and sewing labor that are payable upon delivery of the inventory to VF. This obligation excludes the amount included in accounts payable at March


related to inventory purchases.

(7)

Other obligations represent other binding commitments for the expenditure of funds, including (i) amounts related to contracts not involving the purchase of inventories, such as the noncancelable portion of service or maintenance agreements for management information systems, and (ii) capital expenditures for approved projects.

VF had other financial commitments at the end of Fiscal


that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances:

•

$107.5 million

of surety bonds, custom bonds, standby letters of credit and international bank guarantees are not included in the above table because they represent contingent guarantees of performance under self-insurance and other programs and would only be drawn upon if VF were to fail to meet its other obligations.

•

Purchase orders for goods or services in the ordinary course of business are not included in the above table because they represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding commitments.

Management believes that VF’s cash balances and funds provided by operating activities, as well as its Global Credit Facility, additional borrowing capacity and access to capital markets, taken as a whole, provide (i) adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and long-term obligations when due, (ii) adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain the planned dividend payout rate, and (iii) flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise.

VF does not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes.


VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K


Risk Management

VF is exposed to risks in the ordinary course of business. Management regularly assesses and manages exposures to these risks through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, by (i) taking advantage of natural hedges within VF, (ii) purchasing insurance from commercial carriers, or (iii) using derivative financial instruments. Some potential risks are discussed below:

Insured risks

VF is self-insured for a significant portion of its employee medical, workers’ compensation, vehicle and general liability exposures. VF purchases insurance from highly-rated commercial carriers to cover other risks, including directors and officers, property and umbrella, and to establish stop-loss limits on self-insurance arrangements.

Cash and equivalents risks

VF had

$1.4 billion

of cash and equivalents at the end of Fiscal


. Management continually monitors the credit ratings of the financial institutions with whom VF conducts business. Similarly, management monitors the credit quality of cash equivalents.

Defined benefit pension plan risks

At the end of Fiscal


, VF’s defined benefit pension plans were

underfunded

by a net total of

$14.0 million

. The underfunded status includes a

$118.5 million

liability related to our unfunded U.S. supplemental defined benefit plan,

$52.8 million

of net liabilities related to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans, and a

$157.4 million

net asset related to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plan. VF will continue to evaluate the funded status and future funding requirements of these plans, which depends in part on the future performance of the plans’ investment portfolios. Management believes that VF has sufficient liquidity to make any required contributions to the pension plans in future years.

VF’s reported earnings are subject to risks due to the volatility of its pension expense, which has ranged in recent years from

$34.8 million

in the year ended December 2017 to

$23.6 million

in the year ended March 2020, including the

$27.4 million

settlement charge discussed below. These fluctuations are primarily due to the decrease in service costs due to the freeze of future benefit accruals in the U.S. qualified and supplemental defined benefit plans as of December 31, 2018 and varying amounts of actuarial gains and losses that are deferred and amortized to future years’ expense. The assumptions that impact actuarial gains and losses include the rate of return on investments held by the pension plans, the discount rate used to value participant liabilities and demographic characteristics of the participants.

In Fiscal 2019, VF approved a freeze of all future benefit accruals under the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and supplemental defined benefit pension plan, effective December 31, 2018. During the year ended March 2020, VF took an additional step in managing pension risk by offering former employees in the U.S. qualified plan a lump-sum option to receive a distribution of their deferred vested benefits, pursuant to which the plan paid approximately

$130 million

in distributions to settle

$170 million

of projected benefit obligations related to participants. VF recorded a

$23.0 million

settlement charge in other income (expense), net line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income during the year ended March 2020 to recognize the related deferred actuarial

losses in accumulated OCI. The U.S. qualified plan participants were reduced by 10% as a result of this offer. No additional funding of the pension plan was required as all distributions were paid out of existing plan assets, and the plan’s funded status remained materially unchanged. Refer to

Note 16

to the consolidated financial statements and the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section below.

VF has taken a series of steps to manage the risk and volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements. The U.S. qualified and supplemental defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants in 2005 and all future benefit accruals were frozen as of December 31, 2018. The investment strategy of the U.S. qualified plan continues to define dynamic asset allocation targets that are dependent upon changes in the plan’s funded status, capital market expectations, and risk tolerance. Management will continue to evaluate actions that may help to reduce VF’s risks related to its defined benefit plans.

Interest rate risks

VF limits the risk of interest rate fluctuations by managing the mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt. In addition, VF may use derivative financial instruments to manage risk. Since all of VF’s long-term debt has fixed interest rates, the exposure relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate short-term borrowings (which averaged approximately

$399.0 million

during Fiscal


). However, any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on VF’s cash equivalents. Based on the average amount of variable rate borrowings and cash equivalents during Fiscal


, the effect of a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would be a decrease in reported net income of approximately

$0.5 million

.

Foreign currency exchange rate risks

VF is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations. Approximately

47%

of VF’s revenues in the year ended March


were generated in international markets. Most of VF’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In periods where the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the euro or other foreign currencies where VF has operations, there is a negative impact on VF’s operating results upon translation of those foreign operating results into the U.S. dollar. As discussed later in this section, management hedges VF’s investments in certain foreign operations and foreign currency transactions.

The reported values of assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For net advances to and investments in VF’s foreign businesses that are considered to be long-term, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on those long-term advances is deferred as a component of accumulated OCI in stockholders’ equity. The U.S. dollar value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with changes in the underlying functional currencies. In February 2020, VF issued €1.0 billion of euro-denominated fixed-rate notes and in September 2016, VF issued €850 million of euro-denominated fixed-rate notes. These notes have been designated as net investment hedges of VF’s investment in certain foreign operations. Because this debt qualified as a nonderivative hedging instrument, foreign currency transaction gains or losses of the debt are deferred in the foreign currency translation and other component of accumulated OCI as

VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K



an offset to the foreign currency translation adjustments on the hedged investments. Any amounts deferred in accumulated OCI will remain until the hedged investment is sold or substantially liquidated.

VF monitors net foreign currency market exposures and enters into derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for a significant portion of forecasted foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions (relating to cross-border inventory purchases, production costs, product sales, operating costs and intercompany royalty payments). VF’s practice is to buy or sell foreign currency exchange contracts that cover up to 80% of foreign currency exposures for periods of up to 24 months. Currently, VF uses only foreign exchange forward contracts but may use options or collars in the future. This use of financial instruments allows management to reduce the overall exposure to risks from exchange rate fluctuations on VF’s cash flows and earnings, since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the transactions being hedged.

For cash flow hedging contracts outstanding at the end of Fiscal


, if there were a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates compared to rates at the end of Fiscal


, it would result in a change in fair value of those contracts of approximately

$239 million

. However, any change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would be substantially offset by a change in the fair value of the underlying hedged exposure impacted by the currency rate changes.

Counterparty risks

VF is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative hedging

instruments. To manage this risk, we have established counterparty credit guidelines and only enter into derivative transactions with financial institutions that have ‘A minus/A3’ investment grade credit ratings or better. VF continually monitors the credit rating of, and limits the amount hedged with, each counterparty. Additionally, management utilizes a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize exposure to potential counterparty defaults and adjusts positions as necessary. VF also monitors counterparty risk for derivative contracts within the defined benefit pension plans.

Commodity price risks

VF is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton, leather, rubber, wool and other materials, which we either purchase directly or in a converted form such as fabric or shoe soles. To manage risks of commodity price changes, management negotiates prices in advance when possible. VF has not historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments.

Deferred compensation and related investment security risks

VF has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities to the plans’ participants are based on the market values of the participants’ selection of a hypothetical portfolio of investment funds. VF invests in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the participants’ investment selections. The increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of VF’s investments, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to operating results and financial position.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

VF has chosen accounting policies that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report VF’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. VF applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Significant accounting policies are summarized in

Note 1

to the consolidated financial statements.

The application of these accounting policies requires that VF make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, contingent assets and liabilities, and related disclosures. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Because VF’s business cycle is relatively short (i.e., from the date

that inventory is received until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected), actual results related to most estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date. In addition, VF may retain outside specialists to assist in valuations of business acquisitions, impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets, equity compensation, pension benefits and self-insured liabilities. If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations when the actual amounts become known.

VF believes the following accounting policies involve the most significant management estimates, assumptions and judgments used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors. The application of these critical accounting policies and estimates is discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Inventories

VF’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes all material, labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods. Overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies. VF performs a detailed review at each business unit, at least quarterly, of all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual style-size-color stock keeping units to identify slow moving or excess products, discontinued and to-

be-discontinued products, and off-quality merchandise. This review matches inventory on hand, plus current production and purchase commitments, with current and expected future sales orders. Management performs an evaluation to estimate net realizable value using a systematic and consistent methodology of forecasting future demand, market conditions and selling prices less costs of disposal. If the estimated net realizable value is less than cost, VF provides an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory. This methodology recognizes inventory exposures


VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K

at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold. Historically, these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to VF’s timely identification and ability to rapidly dispose of these distressed inventories.

Existence of physical inventory is verified through periodic physical inventory counts and ongoing cycle counts at most locations

throughout the year. VF provides for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date. Historically, physical inventory shrinkage has not been material.

Long-Lived Assets, Including Intangible Assets and Goodwill

VF allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. VF evaluates fair value at acquisition using three valuation techniques - the replacement cost, market and income methods - and weights the valuation methods based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances. The process of assigning fair values, particularly to acquired intangible assets, is highly subjective.

Fair value for acquired intangible assets is generally based on the present value of expected cash flows. Indefinite-lived trademark or trade name intangible assets (collectively referred to herein as “trademarks”) represent individually acquired trademarks, some of which are registered in multiple countries. Definite-lived customer relationship intangible assets are based on the value of relationships with wholesale customers at the time of acquisition. Goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired, and is assigned at the reporting unit level.

VF’s depreciation policies for property, plant and equipment reflect judgments on their estimated economic lives and residual value, if any. VF’s amortization policies for definite-lived intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets. In evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets, management considers historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers.

Testing of Definite-Lived Assets

VF’s policy is to review property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. VF tests for potential impairment at the asset or asset group level, which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent. VF measures recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group by comparison to the estimated pre-tax undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the forecasted pre-tax undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset are not expected to be adequate to recover the asset’s carrying value, a fair value analysis must be performed, and an impairment charge is recorded if there is an excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value.

When testing property, plant and equipment for potential impairment, VF uses the income-based discounted cash flow method using the estimated cash flows of the respective asset or asset group. The estimated pre-tax undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group through the end of its useful life are compared to its carrying value. If the pre-tax undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group exceed its carrying value, there is no impairment charge. If the pre-tax undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group are less than its carrying value, the estimated

fair value of the asset or asset group is calculated based on the after-tax discounted cash flows using an appropriate weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"), and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group and its carrying value.

When testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment, management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition. Management uses the multi-period excess earnings method, which is a specific application of the discounted cash flow method, to value customer relationship assets. The estimated pre-tax undiscounted cash flows of the asset through the end of its useful life are compared to its carrying value. If the pre-tax undiscounted cash flows of the asset exceed its carrying value, there is no impairment charge. If the pre-tax undiscounted cash flows of the asset are less than its carrying value, the estimated fair value of the asset is calculated based on the present value of the after-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationship asset after deducting contributory asset charges, and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset and its carrying value.

Testing of Indefinite-Lived Assets and Goodwill

VF’s policy is to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount. As part of its annual impairment testing, VF may elect to assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing. If management’s assessment of these qualitative factors indicates that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset or reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then no further testing is required. Otherwise, the intangible asset or reporting unit must be quantitatively tested for impairment.

An indefinite-lived intangible asset is quantitatively tested for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. Fair value of an indefinite-lived trademark is based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. Under this method, forecasted revenues for products sold with the trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark (in lieu of ownership), and the estimated fair value is calculated as the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark. The appropriate discount rate is based on the reporting unit’s WACC that considers market participant assumptions, plus a spread that factors in the risk of the intangible asset. The royalty rate is selected based on consideration of (i) royalty rates included in active license agreements, if applicable, (ii) royalty rates received by market participants in the apparel industry, and (iii) the current

VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K


performance of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeds its carrying value, there is no impairment charge. If the estimated fair value of the trademark is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference.

Goodwill is quantitatively evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. Reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information that is available and reviewed by management.

For goodwill impairment testing, VF estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using both income-based and market-based valuation methods. The income-based approach is based on the reporting unit’s forecasted future cash flows that are discounted to present value using the reporting unit’s WACC as discussed above. For the market-based approach, management uses both the guideline company and similar transaction methods. The guideline company method analyzes market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) for a group of comparable public companies. The market multiples used in the valuation are based on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit compared to the selected guideline companies. Under the similar transactions method, valuation multiples are calculated utilizing actual transaction prices and revenue/EBITDA data from target companies deemed similar to the reporting unit.

Based on the range of estimated fair values developed from the income and market-based methods, VF determines the estimated fair value for the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required. However, if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, VF calculates the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying value of the reporting unit and the estimated fair value.

The income-based fair value methodology requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which VF operates and conditions in the capital markets, many of which are outside of management’s control. At the reporting unit level, fair value estimation requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific reporting unit, along with assessment of the reporting unit’s strategies and forecasts of future cash flows. Forecasts of individual reporting unit cash flows involve management’s estimates and assumptions regarding:

•

Annual cash flows, on a debt-free basis, arising from future revenues and profitability, changes in working capital, capital spending and income taxes for at least a 10-year forecast period.

•

A terminal growth rate for years beyond the forecast period. The terminal growth rate is selected based on consideration of growth rates used in the forecast period, historical performance of the reporting unit and economic conditions.

•

A discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in realizing the forecasted cash flows. A discount rate considers the risk-free rate of return on long-term treasury securities, the risk premium associated with investing in equity securities of comparable companies, the beta obtained from comparable companies and the cost of debt for investment grade issuers. In addition, the discount rate may consider any company-specific risk in achieving the prospective financial information.

Under the market-based fair value methodology, judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions. Management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of VF’s reporting units.

Fiscal


Impairment Testing

During the three months ended September 28, 2019 ("September 2019"), management determined that the recent downturn in the historical financial results, combined with a downward revision to the forecast included in VF's updated strategic growth plan, was a triggering event that required management to perform a quantitative impairment analysis of both the Timberland reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset. See additional discussion in the "Timberland Reporting Unit and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Analysis" section below.

Management performed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of Fiscal


. VF elected to bypass the qualitative analysis for the Timberland and Altra reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets. See additional discussion in the "Timberland Reporting Unit and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Analysis" and "Altra Reporting Unit and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Analysis" sections below. Management performed a qualitative analysis for all other reporting units and trademark intangible assets, as discussed below in the “Other Reporting Units - Qualitative impairment analysis” section.

Subsequent to the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, management determined that the unfavorable projected financial impact from COVID-19 was a triggering event that required management to perform quantitative impairment analyses of the Timberland, Altra and Icebreaker reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets. See additional discussion in the "Timberland Reporting Unit and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Analysis", "Altra Reporting Unit and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Analysis" and "Icebreaker Reporting Unit and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Analysis" sections below.

Timberland Reporting Unit and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Analysis

During the three months ended September 2019, management determined that the recent downturn in the historical financial results, combined with a downward revision to the forecast included in VF's updated strategic growth plan, was a triggering event that required management to perform a quantitative impairment analysis of both the Timberland reporting unit goodwill, which includes the

Timberland

®

brand, and the Timberland

indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset, which includes both the

Timberland

®

and

Timberland PRO

®

brands. Based on the analysis, management concluded that the goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset were not impaired. For goodwill, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 27%. The estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset exceeded its carrying value by a significant amount. The carrying values of the reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset at the


VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K

August 24, 2019 testing date were $733.5 million and $1,010.1 million, respectively.

In conjunction with VF's annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020, management performed a quantitative impairment analysis of both the Timberland reporting unit goodwill and the Timberland

indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset. This decision to bypass the optional qualitative impairment assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative impairment analysis was based on the results of the recent interim quantitative impairment analysis and continued deterioration in Timberland financial results. Based on the analysis, management concluded that the goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset were not impaired. For goodwill, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 4%. The estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset exceeded its carrying value by a significant amount. The carrying values of the reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset at the December 29, 2019 testing date were $732.7 million and $1,014.2 million, respectively.

As of March 28, 2020, management determined that the unfavorable projected financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was a triggering event that required management to perform a quantitative impairment analysis of both the Timberland reporting unit goodwill and the Timberland

indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset. Based on the analysis, management recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $323.2 million to write down the Timberland reporting unit carrying value to its estimated fair value. No impairment charge was recorded on the indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset. The estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset exceeded its carrying value by a significant amount. The remaining carrying values of the reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset at the March 28, 2020 testing date were $409.1 million and $999.5 million, respectively.

The

Timberland

®

brand, acquired in 2011, offers outdoor, adventure-inspired lifestyle footwear, apparel and accessories that combine performance benefits and versatile styling for men, women and children. Products are sold globally through chain, department and specialty stores, independent distributors and licensees, independently-operated partnership stores, concession retail stores, VF-operated stores, on brand websites with strategic digital partners and online. The Timberland reporting unit is included in the Outdoor reportable segment.

Management's revenue and profitability forecasts used in the Timberland reporting unit and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset valuations considered historical performance, strategic initiatives and industry trends. Assumptions used in the valuations were similar to those that would be used by market participants performing independent valuations of the business.

Key assumptions developed by management and used in the quantitative analysis of the Timberland reporting unit and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset include:

•

Financial projections and future cash flows, including a base year reflecting the recent deterioration of actual results including the impact of COVID-19, delayed and extended recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to other VF brands, ultimately trending towards growth rates and profitability in-line with historical trends and terminal growth rates based on the expected long-term growth rate of the brand;

•

Tax rates based on the statutory rates for the countries in which the brand operates and the related intellectual property is domiciled;

•

Royalty rates based on market data as well as active license agreements of the brand; and,

•

Market-based discount rates.

The valuation model used by management in the impairment testing assumes recovery from the recent downturn in the brand's operating results, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the return to growth rates and profitability more in-line with historical operating trends. If the brand is unable to achieve the financial projections, an impairment on the indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset or additional impairment on the reporting unit goodwill could occur in the future.

Altra Reporting Unit and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Analysis

In conjunction with VF's annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020, management performed a quantitative impairment analysis of both the Altra reporting unit goodwill and the indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset. This decision to bypass the optional qualitative impairment assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative impairment analysis was based on review of actual Altra financial performance in the period since acquisition compared to the original acquisition valuation model. Based on the analyses, management concluded that the goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset were not impaired. For goodwill, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by a significant amount. The estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset exceeded its carrying value by 18%. The carrying values of the reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset at the December 29, 2019 testing date were $61.7 million and $46.4 million, respectively.

As of March 28, 2020, management determined that the unfavorable projected financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was a triggering event that required management to perform a quantitative impairment analysis of both the Altra reporting unit goodwill and the indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset. Based on the analyses, management concluded that the goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset were not impaired. For goodwill, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 18%. The estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset exceeded its carrying value by 7%. The carrying values of the reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset at the March 28, 2020 testing date were $61.7 million and $46.4 million, respectively.

The

•

Royalty rates based on active license agreements of other VF brands; and,

•

Market-based discount rates.

The valuation model used by management in the impairment testing assumes recovery from the recent downturn in the brand's operating results due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the return to growth rates and profitability more in-line with historical operating trends and the original acquisition valuation model. If the brand is unable to achieve the financial projections, an impairment on the indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset or impairment on the reporting unit goodwill could occur in the future.

Icebreaker Reporting Unit and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Analysis

As of March 28, 2020, management determined that the unfavorable projected financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was a triggering event that required management to perform a quantitative impairment analysis of both the Icebreaker reporting unit goodwill and the indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset. Based on the analyses, management concluded that the goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset were not impaired. For goodwill, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 9%. The estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset exceeded its carrying value by a significant amount. The carrying values of the reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset at the March 28, 2020 testing date were $78.4 million and $58.6 million, respectively.

The valuation model used by management in the impairment testing assumes recovery from the recent downturn in the brand's operating results due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the return to growth rates and profitability more in-line with historical operating trends and the original acquisition valuation model. If the brand is unable to achieve the financial projections, an impairment on the indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset or impairment on the reporting unit goodwill could occur in the future.

Other Reporting Units - Qualitative Impairment Analysis

For all other reporting units, VF elected to perform a qualitative assessment during the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing to determine whether it was more likely than not that the goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets in those reporting units were impaired. In this qualitative assessment, VF considered relevant events and circumstances for each reporting unit, including (i) current year results, (ii) financial performance versus management’s annual and five-year strategic plans, (iii) changes in the reporting unit carrying value since prior year, (iv) industry and market conditions in which the reporting unit operates, (v) macroeconomic conditions, including discount rate changes, and (vi) changes in products or services offered by the reporting unit. If applicable, performance in recent years was compared to forecasts included in prior valuations. Based on the results of the qualitative assessment, VF concluded that it was not more likely than not that the carrying values of the goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets were greater than their fair values, and that further quantitative testing was not necessary.

Management’s Use of Estimates and Assumptions

Management made its estimates based on information available as of the date of our assessments, using assumptions we believe market participants would use in performing an independent valuation of the business. It is possible that VF’s conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets in any reporting unit could change in future periods. There can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future, if, for example, (i) the businesses do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in Fiscal


or future years vary from current assumptions (including changes in discount rates), (iii) business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions, including loss of major customers, (iv) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace, or (v) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and EBITDA.

A future impairment charge for goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets could have a material effect on VF’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.


VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K

Stock Options

VF uses a lattice option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the Board of Directors. VF believes that a lattice model provides a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can incorporate (i) historical option exercise patterns and multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders, and (ii) inputs that vary over time, such as assumptions for interest rates and volatility. Management performs an annual review of all assumptions employed in the valuation of option grants and believes they are reflective of the outstanding options and underlying Common Stock and of groups of option participants. The lattice valuation incorporates the assumptions listed in

Note 18

to the consolidated financial statements.

One of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before they are exercised. For each option grant, VF estimated the expected average life based on evaluations of the historical and expected

option exercise patterns for each of the groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns. These evaluations included (i) voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of VF Common Stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise, and (ii) involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover, retirement and death.

Volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment. Management bases its estimates of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility. Implied volatility is based on short-term (6 to 9 months) publicly traded near-the-money options on VF Common Stock. VF measures historical volatility over a ten-year period, corresponding to the contractual term of the options, using daily stock prices. Management’s assumption for valuation purposes is that expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical volatility over the remainder of the ten-year option term.

Pension Obligations

VF sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most full-time U.S. employees hired before 2005 and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan ("U.S. pension plans") that provides benefits in excess of the limitations imposed by income tax regulations. In Fiscal 2019, VF approved a freeze of all future benefit accruals under the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and supplemental defined benefit pension plan, effective December 31, 2018. VF also sponsors certain non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The selection of actuarial assumptions for determining the projected pension benefit liabilities and annual pension expense is significant due to amounts involved and the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid.

Annually, management reviews the principal economic actuarial assumptions summarized in

Note 16

to the consolidated financial statements, and revises them as appropriate based on current rates and trends as of the valuation date. VF also periodically reviews and revises, as necessary, other plan assumptions such as rates of compensation increases, retirement, termination, disability and mortality. VF believes the assumptions appropriately reflect the participants’ demographics and projected benefit obligations of the plans and result in the best estimate of the plans’ future experience. Actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used.

The below discussion of discount rate, return on assets and mortality assumptions relates specifically to the U.S. pension plans, as they comprise approximately

91%

of VF’s total defined benefit plan assets and approximately

88%

of VF’s total projected benefit obligations of the combined U.S. and international plans.

One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate, which is used to estimate the present value of future cash outflows necessary to meet projected benefit obligations for the specific plan. It is the estimated interest rate that VF could use to settle its projected benefit obligations at the valuation date. The discount rate assumption is based on current market interest rates. VF selects a discount rate for each of the U.S. pension plans by matching high quality corporate bond yields to the timing of projected benefit payments to participants in each plan. VF uses

the population of U.S. corporate bonds rated ‘Aa’ by Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services. VF excludes the highest and lowest yielding bonds from this population of approximately


such bonds. The bonds must be noncallable/nonputable unless make-whole provisions exist. Each plan’s projected benefit payments are matched to current market interest rates over the expected payment period to calculate an associated present value. A single equivalent discount rate is then determined that produces the same present value. The resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan’s distinct liability characteristics. VF believes that those ‘Aa’ rated issues meet the “high quality” intent of the applicable accounting standards and that the March 2020 discount rates of 3.44% for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and 3.46% for the unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan appropriately reflect current market conditions and the long-term nature of projected benefit payments to participants in the U.S. pension plans.

VF utilizes the spot rate approach to measure service and interest costs. Under the spot rate approach, the full yield curve is applied separately to cash flows for each projected benefit obligation, service cost, and interest cost for a more precise calculation.

Another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected long-term rate of return on investments. VF’s investment objective is to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets with an acceptable level of risk to maximize the long-term return while minimizing volatility in the value of plan assets relative to the value of plan liabilities. These risks include market, interest rate, credit, liquidity, regulatory and foreign securities risks. Investment assets consist of cash equivalents, U.S. and international equity, corporate and governmental fixed-income securities, insurance contracts, and alternative assets. VF develops a projected rate of return for each of the investment asset classes based on many factors, including historical and expected returns, the estimated inflation rate, the premium to be earned in excess of a risk-free return, the premium for equity risk and the premium for longer duration fixed-income securities. The weighted average projected long-term rates of return of the various assets held by the U.S. qualified plan provide the basis for the expected long-term rate of return

VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K


actuarial assumption. VF’s rate of return assumption was 5.70% and 5.50% in the year ended March


due to the December 2019 interim remeasurement for the lump-sum offer settlement event, 5.70% in the year ended March


, 5.85% in the three months ended March 2018 and 6.00% in the year ended December 2017. In recent years, VF has altered the investment mix by (i) increasing the allocation to fixed-income investments and reducing the allocation to equity investments, and (ii) increasing the allocation in equities to more international investments. The changes in asset allocation are anticipated, over time, to reduce the year-to-year variability of the U.S. qualified plan’s funded status and impact on pension expense. Management monitors the plan’s asset allocation to balance risk with anticipated investment returns in a given year. Based on an evaluation of market conditions and projected market returns, VF will be using a rate of return assumption of 5.25% for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan for Fiscal 2021.

We consistently review all of our demographic assumptions as part of the normal management of our defined benefit plans, and update these assumptions as appropriate. The Company performed a demographic assumptions study in 2017 and updated the assumptions, as necessary, in the year ended March 2019 valuations.

VF utilizes the RP-2014 base table and MP-2014 mortality improvement scale, which were adjusted for characteristics of our plan-specific populations and other data where appropriate, in developing our best estimate of the expected mortality rates of plan participants in the U.S. pension plans. In 2019, the Society of Actuaries (SOA) issue a new mortality table (PRI-2012) and improvement scale (MP-2019) which reflect a decrease in life expectancies compared to the previous table and scales. Management considered the PRI-2012 table and MP-2019 scale and determined they are directionally consistent with the current assumptions and concluded no change was needed for the year ended March


.

Differences between actual results in a given year and the actuarially determined assumed results for that year (e.g., investment performance, discount rates and other assumptions) do not affect that year’s pension expense, but instead are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At the end of Fiscal


for all pension plans, there were

$358.0 million

of pretax accumulated deferred actuarial losses, plus

$0.7 million

of pretax net deferred prior service credits, resulting in an after-tax amount of $

262.5 million

in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the March


Consolidated Balance Sheet. The net deferred loss will be amortized as a component of pension expense.

Pension expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements was

$23.6 million

in the year ended March


,

$39.7 million

in the year ended March


,

$4.6 million

in the

three months ended March 2018

and

$34.8 million

in the year ended December 2017, respectively. Pension expense for the year ended March 2020 was higher as it included a

$23.0 million

settlement charge resulting from

2,400

participants accepting a one-time option to receive a distribution of their deferred vested benefits (refer to

Note 16

). The cost of pension benefits actually earned each year by covered active employees (commonly called “service cost”) was

$14.5 million

in the year ended March 2020,

$22.4 million

in the year ended March


,

$5.9 million

in the

three months ended March 2018

and

$24.9 million

in the year ended December 2017. Pension expense was lower in the year ended March 2020 compared to the year ended March 2019 due primarily to lower service costs due to the freeze in future benefit accruals in the U.S. qualified and nonqualified plans, lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses and lower interest costs resulting from lower interest rates. Looking forward, VF expects pension income for the next 12 months of approximately

$8.7 million

primarily due to expected return on plan assets exceeding the other components of pension expense.

The sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on Fiscal


pension expense and on projected benefit obligations related to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan at the end of Fiscal


, all other factors being equal, is illustrated by the following:

As discussed in the “Risk Management” section above, VF has taken a series of steps to reduce volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements. On a longer-term basis, VF believes the year-to-year variability of the retirement benefit expense should decrease.


VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K

Income Taxes

As a global company, VF is subject to income taxes and files income tax returns in over 100 U.S. and foreign jurisdictions each year. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or changes in interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations or rulings by courts or government authorities leading to exposure to additional tax liabilities. In particular, tax authorities and the courts have increased their focus on income earned in no- or low-tax jurisdictions or income that is not taxed in any jurisdiction. Tax authorities have also become skeptical of special tax rulings provided to companies offering lower taxes than may be applicable in other countries. VF makes an ongoing assessment to identify any significant exposure related to increases in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which VF operates.

As discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, VF has been granted a lower effective income tax rate on taxable earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions.

Furthermore, in February 2015, the European Union Commission (“EU”) opened a state aid investigation into Belgium’s tax rulings. On January 11, 2016, the EU announced its decision that these rulings were illegal and ordered that tax benefits granted under these rulings should be collected from the affected companies, including VF. On March 22, 2016, the Belgium government filed an appeal seeking annulment of the EU decision. Additionally, on June 21, 2016, VF Europe BVBA filed its own application for annulment of the EU decision. On December 22, 2016, Belgium adopted a law which entitled the Belgium tax authorities to issue tax assessments and demand timely payments from companies which benefited from the excess profits regime. On January 10, 2017, VF Europe BVBA received an assessment for

€31.9 million

tax and interest related to excess profits benefits received in prior years. VF Europe BVBA remitted

€31.9 million

(

$33.9 million

) on January 13, 2017, which was recorded as an income tax receivable in 2017 based on the expected success of the aforementioned requests for annulment. An additional assessment of

€3.1 million

(

$3.8 million

) was received and paid in January 2018. On February 14, 2019 the General Court annulled the EU decision and on April 26, 2019 the EU appealed the General Court’s annulment. Both listed requests for annulment remain open and unresolved. Additionally, the EU has initiated proceedings related to individual rulings granted by Belgium, including the ruling granted to VF.  If this matter is adversely resolved, these amounts will not be collected by VF.

The calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations, which are subject to legal interpretation and significant management judgment. VF’s income tax returns are regularly examined by

federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and those audits may result in proposed adjustments. VF has reviewed all issues raised upon examination, as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations. VF has evaluated these potential issues under the “more-likely-than-not” standard of the accounting literature. A tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. Such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements, court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent VF prevails in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which a liability for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances have been established, or to the extent VF is required to pay amounts greater than the established liability for unrecognized tax benefits. VF does not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties. There are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses.

As of March 2020, VF has

$237.3 million

of gross deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards, and

$166.6 million

of valuation allowances against those assets. Realization of deferred tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions, the amount and timing of which are uncertain, and on possible changes in tax laws. If management believes that VF will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods, VF records valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized. If in a future period management determines that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount, VF would record an adjustment to income tax expense in that future period.

On May 19, 2019, Switzerland voted to approve the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (“Swiss Tax Act”). Provisions of the Swiss Tax Act were enacted for Swiss federal purposes during the second quarter of Fiscal 2020, and later enacted for certain cantons during the fourth quarter. In addition to changes to the federal and cantonal tax rates, there were transitional measures allowing companies to recognize a step-up in tax basis that is subsequently amortized over a period of time. Calculation of the additional tax basis involves estimates and application of specific guidelines determined by the Swiss federal authorities as well as through ongoing discussions with Swiss cantonal tax authorities. These provisions resulted in adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities such that a net tax benefit of $93.6 million was recorded in the year ended March 2020.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of V. F. Corporation

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of V. F. Corporation and its subsidiaries

(the “Company”) as of March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for the years ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, and for the year ended December 30, 2017, including the related notes and financial statement schedule for the years ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, and for the year ended December 30, 2017 listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)2 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of March 28, 2020, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated

financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, and for the year ended December 30, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 28, 2020, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the COSO.

Changes in Accounting Principles

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases on March 31, 2019 and the manner in which it accounts for revenues from contracts with customers on April 1, 2018.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Goodwill Impairment Analysis - Timberland Reporting Unit

As described in Notes 1, 9 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $1,156.0 million as of March 28, 2020, and total goodwill associated with the Timberland reporting unit was $409.1 million. In the year ended March 28, 2020, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $323.2 million related to the Timberland reporting unit. Management evaluates goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of goodwill may be below its carrying amount.  The impairment analysis involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including the goodwill assigned to that reporting unit.  . As disclosed by management, the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using both income-based and market-based valuation methods. Fair value of a reporting unit using the income-based method is based on management’s estimate of forecasted future cash flows, which included significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, the terminal growth rate, tax rates and the discount rate. Fair value of a reporting unit using the market-based methods includes analyzing actual transaction prices and revenue/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) data from target companies deemed similar to the reporting unit, as well as evaluating market multiples of revenues and EBITDA for a group of comparable public companies.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment analysis for the Timberland reporting unit is a critical audit matter are (i) there was significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurement of the reporting unit, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort was involved in performing procedures and evaluating management’s future cash flow projections and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, the terminal growth rate, the discount rate, and market multiples of revenues and EBITDA for a group of target and comparable public companies, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment analysis, including controls over the valuation of the Company’s reporting units. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the Timberland reporting unit, evaluating the appropriateness of the income-based and market-based valuation methods, testing the completeness, accuracy and relevance of underlying data used in the methods, and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management, including revenue growth rates, the terminal growth rate, the discount rate, and market multiples of revenues and EBITDA for a group of target and comparable public companies. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to revenue growth rates, the terminal growth rate, the discount rate, and market multiples of revenues and EBITDA for a group of target and comparable public companies involved assessing whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.  Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s income-based and market-based valuation methods and certain assumptions, including the discount rate and applicable market multiples of revenues and EBITDA for a group of target and comparable public companies.

Tax-Free Determination of the Divestiture of the Jeans Business

As described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, on May 22, 2019, the Company completed the spin-off of its Jeans business, which included the

Wrangler

®

,

Lee

®

and

Rock & Republic

®

brands, as well as the

VF Outlet

™ business, into an independent, publicly traded company.  The spin-off was effected through a stock distribution to VF shareholders.  As disclosed by management, the divestiture of the Jeans business was determined to qualify for tax-free treatment under certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code. The determination of the transaction as tax-free requires management to make significant judgments about the interpretation of tax laws and regulations. This determination is the subject of periodic U.S. and international tax audits. Unfavorable audit findings and tax rulings may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the tax-free determination of the divestiture of the Jeans business is a critical audit matter are (i) there was significant judgment by management with regards to interpretation of the facts and the application of tax laws and regulations in order to conclude that the divestiture would qualify as a tax-free transaction, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort was involved in performing procedures and evaluating the facts and assumptions made by management in connection with the tax-free determination, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the divestiture of the

F-4

VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K


Jeans business, including controls over the key assumptions relating to the determination of the tax-free treatment of the transaction.  These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the information, including opinions of third-party tax advisors, tax laws and regulations and other relevant documents, used by management to support the Company’s position that the transaction qualified for tax-free treatment and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions and interpretation of the tax laws and regulations by comparing to the determinations reached for similar transactions by comparable companies. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the transaction, related assumptions and certain representations made by management, as well as management’s application of the relevant tax laws and regulations.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description of Business

VF Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, collectively known as “VF” or the "Company”) is a global apparel, footwear and accessories company based in the United States. VF designs, procures, produces, markets and distributes a variety of branded products, including outerwear, footwear, apparel, backpacks, luggage and accessories for consumers of all ages. Products are marketed primarily under VF-owned brand names.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements and related disclosures are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S (“GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of VF and its controlled subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances.

On January 21, 2020, VF announced its decision to explore the divestiture of its Occupational Workwear business. The Occupational Workwear business is comprised primarily of the following brands and businesses:

Red Kap

®

,

VF Solutions

®

, Bulwark

®

,

Workrite

®

,

Walls

®

,

Terra

®

,

Kodiak

®

, Work Authority

®

and

Horace Small

®

.

The business also includes certain

Dickies

®

occupational workwear products that have historically been sold through the business-to-business channel.

During the three months ended March 2020, the Company determined that the Occupational Workwear business met the held-for-sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria and expects to divest this business in the next twelve months. Accordingly, the Company has reported the results of the Occupational Workwear business and the related cash flows as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, respectively. The related held-for-sale assets and liabilities have been reported as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These changes have been applied to all periods presented.

On May 22, 2019, VF completed the spin-off of its Jeans business, which included the

Wrangler

®

,

Lee

®

and

Rock & Republic

®

brands, as well as the

VF Outlet

TM

business, into an independent, publicly traded company. As a result, VF reported the operating results for the Jeans business and the related cash flows as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, respectively. In addition, the related assets and liabilities have been reported as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, through the date the spin-off was completed. These changes have been applied to all periods presented.

The

Nautica

®

brand business sold on April 30, 2018 and the Licensing Business (which comprised the Licensed Sports Group and

JanSport

®

brand collegiate businesses) sold during the year ended December 2017 have been reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, respectively. These changes have been applied to all periods presented.

Unless otherwise noted, discussion within these notes to the consolidated financial statements relates to continuing operations. Refer to

Note 4

for additional information on discontinued operations.

Fiscal Year

VF operates and reports using a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to March 31 of each year. VF previously used a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to December 31 of each year. VF's current fiscal year ran from March 31, 2019 through March 28, 2020 ("Fiscal 2020"). All references to the periods ended March


, March


and December


relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended

March 28, 2020

,

March 30, 2019

("Fiscal 2019") and

December 30, 2017

, respectively. All references to the period ended March 2018 relate to the 13-week transition period ended March 31, 2018. Certain foreign subsidiaries reported using a December 31 year-end for the year ended December 2017 and using a March 31 year-end for Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019 due to local statutory requirements. The impact to VF's consolidated financial statements is not material.

Use of Estimates

In preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The duration and severity of the novel coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic and its impact on VF's business is subject to uncertainty; however, the estimates and assumptions made by management include those related to the COVID-19 impact based on available information. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transaction

The financial statements of most foreign subsidiaries are measured using the foreign currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. Resulting translation gains and losses, and transaction gains and losses on long-term advances to foreign subsidiaries, are reported in other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”).

Foreign currency transactions are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of a particular entity. These transactions generally result in receivables or payables that are fixed in the foreign currency. Transaction gains or losses arise when exchange rate fluctuations either increase or decrease the functional currency cash flows from the originally recorded transaction. As discussed in

Note 24

, VF enters into derivative contracts to manage foreign currency risk on certain of these transactions. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, net of the related hedging losses and gains, were a gain of

$

2.9

million

in the year ended March


, a loss of

$

9.3

million

in the year ended March


, a gain of

$

4.4

million

in the

three months ended March 2018

and a loss of

$

1.6

million

in the year ended December


.

Cash and Equivalents

Cash and equivalents are demand deposits, receivables from third-party credit card processors and highly liquid investments that mature within three months of their purchase dates. Cash equivalents totaling

Accounts Receivable

Upon adoption of the new revenue recognition standard at the beginning of Fiscal 2019, trade accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts, less contractual allowances for trade terms, sales incentive programs and discounts. Prior to the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, trade accounts receivable were recorded at invoiced amounts, less estimated allowances for trade terms, sales incentive programs, discounts, markdowns, chargebacks and returns as discussed below in the "Revenue Recognition" section. Royalty receivables are recorded at amounts earned based on the licensees’ sales of licensed products, subject in some cases to contractual minimum royalties due from individual licensees. VF maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that will result from the inability of customers and licensees to make required payments. The allowance is determined based on review of specific customer accounts where collection is doubtful, as well as an assessment of the collectability of total receivables considering the aging of balances, historical and anticipated trends and current economic conditions. All accounts are subject to ongoing review of ultimate collectability. Receivables are written off against the allowance when it is probable the amounts will not be recovered.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out method and is net of discounts or rebates received from vendors. Management performs an evaluation to estimate net realizable value using a systematic and consistent methodology of forecasting future demand, market conditions and selling prices less costs of disposal. If the estimated net realizable value is less than cost, VF provides an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory. This methodology recognizes inventory exposures at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold. Historically, these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to VF’s timely identification and ability to rapidly dispose of these distressed inventories.

Long-lived Assets, Including Intangible Assets and Goodwill

Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill are initially recorded at cost. VF capitalizes improvements to property, plant and equipment that substantially extend the useful life of the asset, and interest cost incurred during construction of major assets. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Cost for acquired intangible assets represents the fair value at acquisition date, which is generally based on the present value of expected cash flows. Trademark intangible assets represent individual acquired trademarks, some of which are registered in multiple countries. Customer relationship intangible assets are based on the value of relationships with wholesale customers in place at the time of acquisition.

Goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is assigned at the reporting unit level.

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from


to


years for machinery and equipment and up to


years for buildings. Amortization expense for leasehold improvements and assets under finance leases is recognized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease terms, and is included in depreciation expense.

Intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives, consisting of major trademarks and trade names, are not amortized. Other intangible assets determined to have a finite life primarily consist of customer relationships, which are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from


to


years using an accelerated method consistent with the timing of benefits expected to be received.

Depreciation and amortization expense related to producing or otherwise obtaining finished goods inventories is included in cost of goods sold, and other depreciation and amortization expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

VF’s policy is to review property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If forecasted pre-tax undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset are not expected to recover the asset’s carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value.

VF’s policy is to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount. VF may first assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing. If VF determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an asset or reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then no further testing is required. Otherwise, the assets must be quantitatively tested for impairment.

An indefinite-lived intangible asset is quantitatively evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset with its carrying value. An impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value.

Goodwill is quantitatively evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including the goodwill assigned to that reporting unit. An impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.

Leases

VF determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception and determines its classification as an operating or finance lease at lease commencement. The Company leases certain retail locations, office space, distribution facilities, machinery and equipment, and vehicles. While the substantial majority of these leases are operating leases, one of VF's distribution centers is a finance lease.

Leases for real estate typically have initial terms ranging from


to


years, generally with renewal options. Leases for equipment typically have initial terms ranging from


to


years and vehicle leases typically have initial terms ranging from


to


years. In determining the lease term used in the lease right-of-use asset and lease liability calculations, the Company considers various factors such as market conditions and the terms of any renewal or termination options that may exist. When deemed reasonably certain, the renewal and termination options are included in the determination of the lease term and calculation of the lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.

Most leases have fixed rental payments. Many of the real estate leases also require additional variable payments for occupancy-related costs, real estate taxes and insurance, as well as other payments (i.e., contingent rent) owed when sales at individual retail store locations exceed a stated base amount. Variable lease payments are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability and are recognized in profit and loss in the period in which the event or conditions that triggers those payments occur.

VF estimates the amount it expects to pay to the lessor under a residual value guarantee and includes it in lease payments used to measure the lease liability only for amounts probable of being owed by VF at the commencement date.

VF calculates lease liabilities as the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Lease right-of-use assets are calculated based on the initial measurement of the respective lease liabilities adjusted for any lease payments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date, lease incentives received and initial direct costs incurred. When readily determinable, the Company uses the implicit rate to determine the present value of lease payments, which generally does not happen in practice. As the rate implicit in the majority of the Company's leases is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date, including the lease term, currency, country specific risk premium and adjustments for collateralized debt.

Operating lease expense is recorded as a single lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, right-of-use asset amortization and interest on lease liabilities are presented separately in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The Company assesses whether a sale leaseback transaction qualifies as a sale when the transaction occurs. For transactions qualifying as a sale, VF derecognizes the underlying asset and recognizes the entire gain or loss at the time of the sale. The corresponding lease entered into with the buyer-lessor is accounted for as an operating lease. During the year ended March 2020, the Company entered into a sale leaseback transaction for certain office real estate and related assets. The transaction qualified as a sale, and thus the Company recognized a  gain of

$

11.3

million

resulting from the transaction during the year ended March 2020.

As of March 2020, the Company has signed certain distribution center leases that have not yet commenced but will create significant rights and obligations. The leases will commence in Fiscal 2021 and have lease terms of


years

. Other leases signed that have not yet commenced are not individually significant. The Company does not have material subleases.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized as assets and liabilities, respectively, and classified as current or noncurrent based on the derivatives’ maturity dates. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments (i.e., gains and losses) depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships must be formally documented at the inception of the hedges and must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows of hedged transactions. VF’s hedging practices are described in

Note 24

. VF does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Hedging cash flows are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same category as the items being hedged.

VF formally documents hedging instruments and hedging relationships at the inception of each contract. Further, at the inception of a contract and on an ongoing basis, VF assesses whether the hedging instruments are highly effective in offsetting the risk of the hedged transactions. When hedging instruments are determined to not be highly effective, hedge accounting treatment is discontinued, and any future changes in fair value of the instruments are recognized in net income. Unrealized gains or losses related to hedging instruments remain in accumulated OCI until the hedged forecasted transaction occurs and impacts earnings. If the hedged forecasted transaction is deemed probable of not occurring, any unrealized gains or losses in accumulated OCI are immediately recognized in net income.

VF also uses derivative contracts to manage foreign currency exchange risk on certain assets and liabilities, and to hedge the exposure on the foreign currency denominated purchase price of acquisitions. These contracts are not designated as hedges, and are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in fair value recognized directly in net income.

The counterparties to the derivative contracts are financial institutions having at least A-rated investment grade credit ratings. To manage its credit risk, VF continually monitors the credit risks of its counterparties, limits its exposure in the aggregate and to any single counterparty, and adjusts its hedging positions as appropriate. The impact of VF’s credit risk and the credit risk of its counterparties, as well as the ability of each party to fulfill its obligations under the contracts, is considered in determining the fair value of the derivative contracts. Credit risk has not had a significant effect on the fair value of VF’s derivative contracts. VF does not have any credit risk-related contingent features or collateral requirements with its derivative contracts.

Revenue Recognition

Upon adoption of the new revenue recognition standard at the beginning of Fiscal 2019, revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied based on the transfer of control of promised goods or services. The transfer of control typically occurs at a point in time based on consideration of when the customer has (i) an obligation to pay for, (ii) physical possession of, (iii) legal title to, (iv) risks and rewards of ownership of, and (v) accepted the goods or services. The timing of revenue recognition within the wholesale channel occurs either on shipment or delivery of goods based on contractual terms with the customer. The timing of revenue recognition in the direct-to-consumer channel generally occurs at the point of sale within VF-operated or concession retail stores and either on shipment or delivery of goods for e-commerce transactions based on contractual terms with the customer. For finished products shipped directly to customers from our suppliers, the Company's promise to the customer is a performance obligation to provide the specified goods, and thus the Company is the principal in the arrangement and revenue is recognized on a gross basis at the transaction price. For sourcing arrangements, the Company's promise to the customer is to arrange for certain goods, typically finished products, to be provided and thus the Company is acting as an agent and revenue is recognized on a net basis at the fee amount earned.

The duration of contractual arrangements with our customers in the wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels is typically less than one year. Payment terms with wholesale customers are generally between 30 and 60 days while direct-to-consumer arrangements have shorter terms. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component as it is expected, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of the promised good or service to the customer and the customer payment for the good or service will be one year or less.

The amount of revenue recognized in both wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels reflects the expected consideration to be received for providing the goods or services to the customer, which includes estimates for variable consideration. Variable consideration includes allowances for trade terms, sales incentive programs, discounts, markdowns, chargebacks and product returns. Estimates of variable consideration are determined at contract inception and reassessed at each reporting date, at a minimum, to reflect any changes in facts and circumstances. The Company utilizes the expected value method in determining its estimates of variable consideration, based on evaluations of specific product and customer circumstances, historical and anticipated trends, and current economic conditions. Allowances for estimates of sales incentive programs, discounts, markdowns, chargebacks and returns are recorded as accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Certain products sold by the Company include an assurance warranty. Product warranty costs are estimated based on historical and anticipated trends, and are recorded as cost of goods sold at the time revenue is recognized.

Revenue from the sale of gift cards is deferred and recorded as a contract liability until the gift card is redeemed by the customer, factoring in breakage as appropriate.

Various VF brands maintain customer loyalty programs where customers earn rewards from qualifying purchases or activities, which are redeemable for discounts on future purchases or other rewards. For its customer loyalty programs, the Company estimates the standalone selling price of the loyalty rewards and allocates a portion of the consideration for the sale of products to the loyalty points earned. The deferred amount is recorded as a contract liability, and is recognized as revenue when the points are redeemed or when the likelihood of redemption is remote.

The Company has elected to treat all shipping and handling activities as fulfillment costs and recognize the costs as selling, general and administrative expenses at the time the related revenue is recognized. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net revenues. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected from customers and remitted directly to governmental authorities are excluded from the transaction price.

The Company has licensing agreements for its symbolic intellectual property, most of which include minimum guaranteed royalties. Royalty income is recognized as earned over the respective license term based on the greater of minimum guarantees or the licensees' sales of licensed products at rates specified in the licensing contracts. Royalty income related to the minimum guarantees is recognized using a measure of progress with variable amounts recognized only when the cumulative earned royalty exceeds the minimum guarantees.

The Company has applied the practical expedient to recognize incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that otherwise would have been recognized is one year or less.

For periods prior to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, revenue was recognized when (i) there was a contract or other arrangement of sale, (ii) the sales price was fixed or determinable, (iii) title and the risks of ownership had been transferred to the customer, and (iv) collection of the receivable was reasonably assured. Sales to wholesale customers were recognized when title and the risks and rewards of ownership had passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. E-commerce sales were generally recognized when the product had been received by the customer. Sales at Company-operated and concession retail stores were recognized at the time products were purchased by consumers.

Revenue from the sale of gift cards was deferred until the gift card was redeemed by the customer or the Company determined that the likelihood of redemption was remote and that it did not have a legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift card to any jurisdiction under unclaimed property regulations.

Various VF brands maintained customer loyalty programs where customers earned rewards from qualifying purchases or activities. VF recognized revenue when (i) rewards were redeemed by the customer, (ii) points or certificates expired, or (iii) a breakage factor was applied based on historical redemption patterns.

Net revenues reflected adjustments for estimated allowances for trade terms, sales incentive programs, discounts, markdowns, chargebacks and returns. These allowances were estimated based on evaluations of specific product and customer circumstances, historical and anticipated trends and current economic conditions.

Shipping and handling costs billed to customers were included in net revenues. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected from customers and remitted directly to governmental authorities were excluded from net revenues.

Royalty income was recognized as earned based on the greater of the licensees’ sale of licensed products at rates specified in the licensing contracts or contractual minimum royalty levels.

Cost of Goods Sold

Cost of goods sold for purchased finished goods includes the purchase costs and related overhead. Cost of goods sold for VF-manufactured goods includes all materials, labor and overhead costs incurred in the production process. In both cases, overhead includes all costs related to manufacturing or purchasing finished goods, including costs of planning, purchasing, quality control, depreciation, freight, duties, royalties paid to third parties and shrinkage. For product lines with a warranty, a provision for estimated future repair or replacement costs, based on historical and anticipated trends, is recorded when these products are sold.

Self-insurance

VF is self-insured for a significant portion of its employee medical, workers’ compensation, vehicle, property and general liability exposures. Liabilities for self-insured exposures are accrued at the present value of amounts expected to be paid based on historical claims experience and actuarial data for forecasted settlements of claims filed and for incurred but not yet reported claims. Accruals for self-insured exposures are included in current and noncurrent liabilities based on the expected periods of payment. Excess liability insurance has been purchased to limit the amount of self-insured risk on claims.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are provided on pre-tax income for financial reporting purposes. Income taxes are based on amounts of taxes payable or refundable in the current year and on expected future tax consequences of events that are recognized in the consolidated financial statements in different periods than they are recognized in tax returns. As a result of timing of recognition and measurement differences between financial accounting standards and income tax laws, temporary differences arise between amounts of pretax financial statement income and taxable income, and between reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect the estimated future tax impact of these temporary differences and net operating loss and net capital loss carryforwards, based on tax rates currently enacted for the years in which the differences are expected to be settled or realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions. Valuation allowances are used to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts considered more likely than not to be realized. Accrued income taxes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets include unrecognized income tax benefits, along with related interest and penalties, appropriately classified as current or noncurrent. All deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as noncurrent in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The provision for income taxes also includes estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share assumes conversion of potentially dilutive securities such as stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units.

Concentration of Risks

VF markets products to a broad customer base throughout the world. Products are sold at a range of price points through multiple wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels. VF’s

ten

largest customers accounted for


%

of Fiscal


total revenues. Sales to VF’s largest customer accounted for


%

total revenues. Sales are generally made on an unsecured basis under customary terms that may vary by product, channel of distribution or geographic region. VF continuously monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and has established internal policies regarding customer credit limits. The breadth of product offerings, combined with the large number and geographic diversity of its customers, limits VF’s concentration of risks.

Legal and Other Contingencies

Management periodically assesses liabilities and contingencies in connection with legal proceedings and other claims that may arise from time to time. When it is probable that a loss has been or will be incurred, an estimate of the loss is recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Estimates of losses are adjusted when additional information becomes available or circumstances change. A contingent liability is disclosed when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss may have been incurred. Management believes that the outcome of any outstanding or

Recently Adop

ted Accounting Standards

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02,

“Leases (Topic 842)”

, a new accounting standard on leasing. The FASB subsequently issued updates to the standard to provide additional clarification on specific topics, including permitted transition methods. Collectively, the guidance is referred to as FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 842. This standard requires companies to record most leased assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, and also retains a dual model approach for assessing lease classification and recognizing expense. The Company adopted this standard on March 31, 2019, utilizing the modified retrospective method and recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard in retained earnings. The effective date of the adoption was used as the date of initial application, and thus comparative prior period financial information has not been restated and continues to be reported under accounting standards in effect for those periods.

The standard provides certain optional practical expedients for transition. The Company elected the transition relief package of practical expedients by applying previous accounting conclusions under ASC Topic 840,

Leases

("ASC 840"), to all leases that existed prior to the transition date. As a result, VF did not reassess (i) whether existing or expired contracts contain leases, (ii) lease classification for any existing or expired leases, or (iii) whether lease origination costs qualified as initial direct costs. The Company also elected the land easement practical expedient, which allowed the Company to apply ASC 842 prospectively to land easements after the adoption date if they were not previously accounted for under ASC 840. Certain leases contain both lease and non-lease components. For leases associated with specific asset classes, including certain real estate, vehicles, manufacturing machinery and IT equipment, VF elected the practical expedient which permits entities to account for separate lease and non-lease components as a single component. For all other lease contracts, the Company elected to account for each lease component separately from the non-lease components of the contract. When applicable, VF will measure the consideration to be paid pursuant to the agreement and allocate this consideration to the lease and non-lease components based on relative standalone prices. Further, the Company made an accounting policy election to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with terms of 12 months or less.

The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in a net decrease of

$

2.5

million

in the retained earnings line item of the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2019. The adoption of ASC 842 also resulted in the recognition of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, leases previously referred to as "capital leases" are now referred to as "finance leases" under ASC 842. Refer to Note 10 for additional lease disclosures.

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12,

"Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities"

, an update that amends and simplifies certain aspects of hedge accounting rules to better portray the economic results of risk management activities in the financial statements. The FASB subsequently issued updates to the standard to provide additional guidance on specific topics. This guidance became effective for VF in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020, but did not impact VF's consolidated financial statements.

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02

, "Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)

:

Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

", an update that addresses the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("U.S. Tax Act") on items within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The guidance became effective for VF in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020. The Company elected to reclassify the income tax effects of the U.S. Tax Act on items within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of

$

61.9

million

to retained earnings, which primarily related to deferred taxes previously recorded for pension benefits. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on VF's consolidated results of operations or cash flows.

In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, "

Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting"

, an update that expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. This guidance became effective for VF in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020, but did not impact VF's consolidated financial statements.

In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-09,

"Codification Improvements"

, an update that provides technical corrections, clarifications and other improvements across a variety of accounting topics. The transition and effective date guidance is based on the facts and circumstances of each update; however, many of them became effective for VF in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020. The guidance did not impact VF's consolidated financial statements.

In April 2020, the FASB issued a Staff Question-and-Answer ("Q&A") to clarify whether lease concessions related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic require the application of the lease modification guidance under ASC 842. In light of the guidance, management has elected to account for lease concessions related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as though enforceable rights and obligations for those concessions existed (regardless of whether those enforceable rights and obligations for the concessions explicitly exist in the lease contract), provided that the concessions result in the total payments required by the modified contract being substantially the same as or less than total payments required by the original lease contract. Lease concessions meeting this criteria are reflected within variable rent expense. The Company applied this guidance within its Fiscal 2020 consolidated financial statements; however, it did not have a material impact.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,

forward-looking approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables. The FASB has subsequently issued updates to the standard to provide additional clarification on specific topics. This guidance will be effective for VF in the first quarter of the year ending April 3, 2021 ("Fiscal 2021"). The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on VF's consolidated financial statements.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13,

"Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement"

, an update that modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying or adding certain disclosures. The guidance will be effective for VF in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on VF's disclosures.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14,

"Compensation— Retirement Benefits—Defined Benefit Plans—General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans"

, an update that modifies the disclosure requirements for employers who sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The guidance will be effective for VF in Fiscal 2021.The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on VF's disclosures.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15,

"Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud

, an update that aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The guidance will be effective for VF in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on VF's consolidated financial statements.

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, "

The guidance will be effective for VF in the first quarter of the year ending April 2, 2022 ("Fiscal 2022") with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact that adopting this guidance will have on VF's consolidated financial statements.

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04,

"Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting",

an update that provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The optional guidance is provided to ease the potential burden of accounting for reference rate reform. The guidance is effective and can be adopted no later than December 31, 2022. The Company is evaluating the impact that adopting this guidance would have on VF's consolidated financial statements.

REVENUES

Performance Obligations

Disclosure is required for the aggregate transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied at the end of a reporting period, unless the optional practical expedients are applicable. VF has elected the practical expedients to not disclose the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for (i) variable consideration related to sales-based royalty arrangements, and (ii) contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less.

As of

March 2020

, the Company expects to recognize

$

70.9

million

of fixed consideration related to the future minimum guarantees in effect under its licensing agreements and expects such amounts to be recognized over time through December 2029. The variable consideration related to licensing arrangements is not disclosed as a remaining performance obligation as it qualifies for the sales-based royalty exemption.

As of

March 2020

, there are no arrangements with transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations other than contracts for which the Company has applied the practical expedients and fixed consideration related to future minimum guarantees discussed above.

For the year ended

March 2020

, revenue recognized from performance obligations satisfied, or partially satisfied, in prior periods was not material.

Contract Balances

Accounts receivable represent the Company's unconditional right to receive consideration from a customer and are recorded at net invoiced amounts, less an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts.

Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that have been transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. Once the Company has an unconditional right to consideration under a contract, amounts are invoiced and contract assets are reclassified to accounts receivable. The Company's primary contract assets relate to sales-based royalty arrangements, which are discussed in more detail within

Note 1

.

Contract liabilities are recorded when a customer pays consideration, or the Company has a right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional, before the transfer of a good or service to the customer and thus represent the Company's obligation to transfer the good or service to the customer at a future date. The Company's primary contract liabilities relate to gift cards, loyalty programs and sales-based royalty arrangements, which are discussed in more detail within

The change in the contract asset and contract liability balances primarily results from the timing differences between the Company's satisfaction of performance obligations and the customer's payment.

Disaggregation of Revenue

The following tables disaggregate our revenues by channel and geography, which provides a meaningful depiction of how the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenues are affected by economic factors. The wholesale channel includes fees generated from sourcing activities as the customers and point-in-time revenue recognition are similar to other wholesale arrangements. We adopted the new revenue recognition standard at the beginning of Fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. As a result, revenue reported for the three months ended March 2018 and the year ended December 2017 have not been presented.

ACQUISITIONS

Williamson-Dickie

On October 2, 2017, VF acquired


%

of the outstanding shares of Williamson-Dickie Mfg. Co. (“Williamson-Dickie”) for

$

800.7

million

in cash, subject to working capital and other adjustments. The purchase price was primarily funded with short-term borrowings. The purchase price decreased

$

2.3

million

during the three months ended March 2018, related to working capital adjustments, resulting in a final purchase price of

$

798.4

million

.

Williamson-Dickie was a privately held company based in Ft. Worth, Texas, and was one of the largest companies in the workwear sector with a portfolio of brands including

Dickies

®

,

Workrite

®

,

Walls

®

,

Terra

®

and

Kodiak

®

. The acquisition of Williamson-Dickie brings together complementary assets and capabilities, and creates a workwear business that serves an even broader set of consumers and industries around the world.

For the six months ended September 2018, Williamson-Dickie contributed revenues of

$

471.9

million

and net income of

$

33.3

million

, including restructuring charges. Given the ongoing integration and change in operating nature of the acquired business, it is impracticable to determine the revenues or operating results contributed subsequent to September 2018. Williamson-Dickie contributed revenues of

$

233.1

million

and net income of

$

4.9

million

to VF in the three months ended March 2018, including restructuring charges. For the period from October 2, 2017 through December 30, 2017, Williamson-Dickie contributed revenues of

$

247.2

million

and net income of

Total transaction expenses for the Williamson-Dickie acquisition were

$

15.0

million

, all of which were recognized in the year ended December 2017 in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

On January 21, 2020, VF announced its decision to explore the divestiture of its Occupational Workwear business, which includes certain brands and businesses obtained as part of the Williamson-Dickie acquisition including

Workrite

®

,

Walls

®

,

Terra

®

, Kodiak

®

and

Work Authority

®

.

The business also includes certain

Dickies

®

occupational workwear products that have historically been sold through the business-to-business channel. During the three months ended March 2020, the Company determined the Occupational Workwear business met the held-for-sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria and expects to divest this business in the next twelve months. Accordingly, the Company has reported the results of these brands and businesses as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and presented the related held-for-sale assets and liabilities as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The disclosures above do not reflect the discontinued operations presentation for the Occupational Workwear business and thus represent the historical amounts for the acquired Williamson-Dickie business. Refer to

Note 4

for additional information on discontinued operations.

The following unaudited pro forma summary presents historical consolidated information of VF as if the acquisition of Williamson-Dickie had occurred on January 3, 2016:

These pro forma amounts have been calculated after applying VF’s accounting policies and adjusting the results of Williamson-Dickie to reflect the additional depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets had been applied from January 3, 2016, with related tax effects. The pro forma amounts do not reflect the discontinued operations presentation for the Occupational Workwear business discussed above or the Jeans business that was subject to the spin-off completed in Fiscal 2020. Refer to

Note 4

for additional information on discontinued operations.

The pro forma financial information in the year ended December 2017 excludes

$

41.6

million

of expense related to Williamson-Dickie’s executive compensation plans, which were terminated concurrent with the merger.

Pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of VF’s operating results if the acquisition had been effected at the date indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating results. Amounts do not include any marketing leverage, operating efficiencies or cost savings that VF believes are achievable.

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

VF maintains a

$

2.25

billion

senior unsecured revolving line of credit (the “Global Credit Facility”) that expires December 2023. VF may request an unlimited number of

one year

extensions so long as each extension does not cause the remaining life of the Global Credit Facility to exceed

five years

, subject to stated terms and conditions. The Global Credit Facility may be used to borrow funds in both U.S. dollar and certain non-U.S. dollar currencies, and has a

$

50.0

million

letter of credit sublimit. In addition, the Global Credit Facility supports VF’s U.S. commercial paper program for short-term, seasonal working capital requirements and general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and acquisitions. Borrowings under the Global Credit Facility are priced at a credit spread of

81.0 basis points

over the appropriate LIBOR benchmark for each currency. VF is also required to pay a facility fee to the lenders, currently equal to

6.5 basis points

of the committed amount of the facility. The credit spread and facility fee are subject to adjustment based on VF’s credit ratings.

The Global Credit Facility contains certain restrictive covenants, which include maintenance of a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio, as defined therein, equal to or below


%

. If VF fails in the performance of any covenants, the lenders may terminate their obligation to make advances and declare any outstanding obligations to be immediately due and payable. As of March


, VF was in compliance with all covenants. In April 2020, VF entered into an amendment to the Global Credit Facility that resulted in certain changes to the restrictive covenants, including an increase to the consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio financial covenant to


%

and a revised calculation of consolidated indebtedness to be net of

unrestricted cash of VF and its subsidiaries. Refer to Note 27 for additional information.

In March 2020, VF elected to draw down

$

1.0

billion

from the Global Credit Facility to strengthen the Company's cash position and support general working capital needs in Fiscal 2021, which was an action taken by the Company in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The borrowings have an interest rate of

1.81

%

and were repaid in April 2020 with proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes. Refer to Note 27 for additional information.

VF’s commercial paper program allows for borrowings of up to

$

2.25

billion

to the extent it has borrowing capacity under the Global Credit Facility. Outstanding commercial paper borrowings totaled

$

215.0

million

and

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

March 2020

All notes, along with any amounts outstanding under the Global Credit Facility (

Note 12

), rank equally as senior unsecured obligations of VF. All notes contain customary covenants and events of default, including limitations on liens and sale-leaseback transactions and a cross-acceleration event of default. The cross-acceleration provision of the 2033 notes is triggered if more than

$

50.0

million

of other debt is in default and has been accelerated by the lenders. For the other notes, the cross-acceleration trigger is

$

100.0

million

. If VF fails in the performance of any covenant under the indentures that govern the respective notes, the trustee or lenders may declare the principal due and payable immediately. As of March


, VF was in compliance with all covenants. None of the long-term debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings. However, if there were a change in control of VF and, as a result of the change in control, the 2023, 2028, 2032 and 2037 notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies, then VF would be obligated to repurchase those notes at


%

of the aggregate principal amount plus any accrued interest.

VF may redeem its notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to the greater of (i)


%

of the principal amount, plus accrued interest to the redemption date, or (ii) the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted to the redemption date at an adjusted treasury rate, as defined, plus

15 basis points

for the 2023, 2028, 2032 and 2033 notes, and

25 basis points

for the 2037 notes, plus accrued interest to the redemption date. In addition, the 2023 and 2032 notes can be redeemed at


%

of the principal amount plus accrued interest to the redemption date within the three months prior to maturity, and the 2028 notes can be redeemed at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest to the redemption date within two months prior to maturity.

RETIREMENT AND SAVINGS BENEFIT PLANS

VF has several retirement and savings benefit plans covering eligible employees. VF retains the right to curtail or discontinue any of the plans, subject to local regulations.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Defined benefit plans provide pension benefits based on participant compensation and years of service. VF sponsors a noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most full-time U.S. employees employed before 2005 (the “U.S. qualified plan”) and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits in excess of limitations imposed by income tax regulations

(the “U.S. nonqualified plan”). The U.S. qualified plan is fully funded at the end of Fiscal


, and VF’s net underfunded status primarily relates to obligations under the unfunded U.S. nonqualified plan. The U.S. qualified and nonqualified plans comprise


%

of VF’s total defined benefit plan assets and


%

of VF’s total projected benefit obligations at March


, and the remainder relates to non-U.S. defined benefit plans. A March 31 measurement date is used to value plan assets and obligations for all pension plans.

The amounts reported in these disclosures have not been segregated between continuing and discontinued operations.

The components of pension cost for VF’s defined benefit plans were as follows:

(a)

Rate of compensation increase is calculated as the weighted average rate of compensation increase for active plans. Frozen plans are excluded from the calculation.

VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

March 2020

During the year ended March 2020, the Company offered former employees in the U.S. qualified plan a lump-sum option to receive a distribution of their deferred vested benefits. Approximately

2,400

participants accepted a distribution, representing approximately


%

of offered participants and an approximate


%

reduction in the total number of plan participants. In December 2019, the plan paid approximately

$


million

in lump-sum distributions to settle approximately

$


million

of projected benefit obligations related to these participants. VF recorded a

$

23.0

million

settlement charge in the other income (expense), net line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income during the year ended March 2020 to recognize the related deferred actuarial losses in accumulated OCI.

Additionally, VF reported

$

4.4

million

of settlement charges in the other income (expense), net line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended March 2020, as well as

$

8.9

million

for the year ended March 2019. The settlement charges related to the recognition of deferred actuarial losses resulting

from lump-sum payments of retirement benefits in the U.S. nonqualified plan.

In Fiscal 2019, VF approved a freeze of all future benefit accruals under the U.S. qualified and U.S. nonqualified plans, effective December 31, 2018. Accordingly, the Company recognized a

$

9.5

million

pension curtailment loss in the other income (expense), net line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended March 2019.

In the year ended December 2017, the Company recorded curtailment charges of

$

1.7

million

which comprised (i)

$

1.1

million

within the U.S. qualified plan related to the sale of the Licensing Business (recorded in the income from discontinued operations, net of tax line item), and (ii)

$

0.6

million

within the U.S. nonqualified plan related to restructuring initiatives (recorded in the other income (expense), net line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income).

The following provides a reconciliation of the changes in fair value of VF’s defined benefit plan assets and projected benefit obligations for each period, and the funded status at the end of each period:

VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

March 2020

Pension benefits are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a net asset or liability based on the overfunded or underfunded status of the defined benefit plans, assessed on a plan-by-plan basis.

The amounts reported in the table above for the prior period have not been segregated between continuing and discontinued operations. The March 2019 balances include

$

11.0

million

of pension liabilities related to the Jeans business, which were transferred in connection with the spin-off.

(a)

Rate of compensation increase is calculated as the weighted average rate of compensation increase for active plans. Frozen plans are excluded from the calculation.

Accumulated benefit obligations at any measurement date are the present value of vested and unvested pension benefits earned, without considering projected future compensation increases. Projected benefit obligations are the present value of vested and unvested pension benefits earned, considering projected future compensation increases.

Deferred actuarial gains and losses are changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the value of plan assets resulting from differences between expected amounts for a year using actuarial assumptions and the actual results for that year. These amounts are deferred as a component of accumulated OCI and amortized to pension expense in future years. For the U.S. qualified plan, amounts in excess of


%

of projected benefit obligations at the beginning of the year are amortized over

five years

; amounts between (i)


%

of the greater of projected benefit obligations or plan assets, and (ii)


%

of projected benefit obligations are amortized over the expected average life expectancy of all participants; and amounts less than the greater of


%

of projected benefit obligations or plan assets are not amortized. For the U.S. nonqualified plan, amounts in excess of


%

of the pension benefit obligations are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected average life expectancy of all participants.

Deferred prior service credits and costs related to plan amendments are also recorded in accumulated OCI and amortized to pension expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining years of service for active employees.

The estimated amounts of accumulated OCI to be amortized to pension expense in Fiscal


are

$

11.1

million

of deferred actuarial losses and an insignificant amount of deferred prior service costs.

Management’s investment objectives are to invest plan assets in a diversified portfolio of securities to provide long-term growth,

minimize the volatility of the value of plan assets relative to plan liabilities, and to ensure plan assets are sufficient to pay the benefit obligations. Investment strategies focus on diversification among multiple asset classes, a balance of long-term investment return at an acceptable level of risk and liquidity to meet benefit payments. The primary objective of the investment strategies is to more closely align plan assets with plan liabilities by utilizing dynamic asset allocation targets dependent upon changes in the plan’s funded ratio, capital market expectations and risk tolerance.

Plan assets are primarily composed of common collective trust funds that invest in liquid securities diversified across equity, fixed-income, real estate and other asset classes. Fund assets are allocated among independent investment managers who have full discretion to manage their portion of the fund’s assets, subject to strategy and risk guidelines established with each manager. The overall strategy, the resulting allocations of plan assets and the performance of funds and individual investment managers are continually monitored. Derivative financial instruments may be used by investment managers for hedging purposes to gain exposure to alternative asset classes through the futures markets. There are no direct investments in VF debt or equity securities and no significant concentrations of security risk.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was based on an evaluation of the weighted average expected returns for the major asset classes in which the plans have invested. Expected returns by asset class were developed through analysis of historical market returns, current market conditions, inflation expectations and equity and credit risks. Inputs from various investment advisors on long-term capital market returns and other variables were also considered where appropriate.

Cash equivalents include cash held by individual investment managers of other asset classes for liquidity purposes (Level 1), and an institutional fund that invests primarily in short-term U.S. government securities measured at their daily net asset value. The fair values of insurance contracts are provided by the insurance companies and are primarily based on accumulated contributions plus returns guaranteed by the insurers (Level 2). Commodities consist of derivative commodity futures contracts (Level 1).

Equity and fixed-income securities generally represent institutional funds measured at their daily net asset value derived from quoted prices of the underlying investments. Alternative investments are primarily in funds of hedge funds (“FoHFs”), which are comprised of different and independent hedge funds with various investment strategies. The administrators of the FoHFs utilize unobservable inputs to calculate the net asset value of the FoHFs on a monthly basis.

VF makes contributions to its defined benefit plans sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable laws, plus discretionary amounts as determined by management. VF does not currently plan to make any contributions to the U.S. qualified plan during Fiscal

Other Retirement and Savings Plans

VF sponsors a nonqualified retirement savings plan for employees whose contributions to a 401(k) plan would be limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan allows participants to defer a portion of their compensation and to receive matching contributions for a portion of the deferred amounts. Participants earn a return on their deferred compensation based on their selection of a hypothetical portfolio of publicly traded mutual funds and a separately managed fixed-income fund. Changes in the fair value of the participants’ hypothetical investments are recorded as an adjustment to deferred compensation liabilities and compensation expense. Expense under this plan was

$

2.7

million

in the year ended March


,

$

1.5

million

in the year ended March

2019,

$

0.5

million

in the

three months ended March 2018

and

$

1.1

million

in the year ended December


. Deferred compensation, including accumulated earnings, is distributable in cash at participant-specified dates upon retirement, death, disability or termination of employment. VF sponsors a similar nonqualified plan that permits nonemployee members of the Board of Directors to defer their Board compensation. VF also has remaining obligations under other deferred compensation plans, primarily related to acquired companies. At March


, VF’s liability to participants under all deferred compensation plans was

$

113.3

million

, of which

$

8.8

million

was recorded in accrued liabilities (

Note 13

) and

$

104.5

million

was recorded in other liabilities (

Note 15

).

VF has purchased (i) publicly traded mutual funds and a separately managed fixed-income fund in the same amounts as most of the participant-directed hypothetical investments underlying the deferred compensation liabilities, and (ii) variable life insurance contracts that invest in institutional funds that are substantially the same as the participant-directed hypothetical investments. These investment securities and earnings thereon are intended to provide a source of funds to meet the deferred compensation obligations, and serve as an economic hedge of the financial impact of changes in deferred compensation liabilities. They are held in an irrevocable trust but are subject to claims of creditors in the event of VF’s insolvency. VF also has assets related to deferred compensation plans of acquired companies, which are primarily invested in life insurance contracts. At March


, the fair value of investments held for all deferred compensation plans was

$

139.3

million

, of which

$

6.8

million

was recorded in other current assets and

$

132.5

million

was recorded in other assets (

Note 11

). Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these deferred compensation assets are recorded in compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income and substantially offset losses and gains resulting from changes in deferred compensation liabilities to participants.

VF sponsors 401(k) plans as well as other domestic and foreign retirement and savings plans. Expense for these plans totaled

$

48.7

in the year ended March

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Pursuant to the amended and restated 1996 Stock Compensation Plan approved by stockholders, VF is authorized to grant nonqualified stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock to officers, key employees and nonemployee members of VF’s Board of Directors. Substantially all stock-based compensation awards are classified as equity awards, which are accounted for in stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On a limited basis, cash-settled stock appreciation rights

are granted to employees in certain international jurisdictions. These awards are accounted for as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and remeasured to fair value each reporting period until the awards are settled. Compensation cost for all awards expected to vest is recognized over the shorter of the requisite service period or the vesting period, including accelerated recognition for retirement-eligible employees. Awards that do not vest are forfeited.

Total stock-based compensation cost and the associated income tax benefits recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income, and stock-based compensation costs included in inventory in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, on a continuing operations basis, are as follows:

At the end of March


, there was

$

34.5

year

.

At the end of March


, there were

26,994,754

shares available for future grants of stock options and stock awards under the 1996 Stock Compensation Plan. Shares for option exercises are issued from VF’s authorized but unissued Common Stock. VF has a practice of repurchasing shares of Common Stock in the open market to offset, on a long-term basis, dilution caused by awards under equity compensation plans.

Spin-Off of Jeans Business

In connection with the spin-off of the Jeans business on May 22, 2019, the Company adjusted its outstanding equity awards in accordance with the terms of the Employee Matters Agreement between the Company and Kontoor Brands. Adjustments to the underlying shares and terms of outstanding stock options, RSUs and restricted stock were made to preserve the intrinsic value of the awards immediately before the separation. The adjustment of the underlying shares and exercise prices, as applicable, was determined using a ratio based on the relative values of the VF pre-distribution stock value and the VF post-distribution stock value as determined by the Company. The outstanding awards continue to vest over their original vesting periods. The Company will recognize

$

Stock Options

Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of VF Common Stock on the date of grant. Employee stock options vest in equal annual installments over

three years

, and compensation cost is recognized ratably over the shorter of the requisite service period or the vesting period. Stock options granted to nonemployee members of VF’s Board of Directors vest upon grant and become exercisable

one year

from the date of grant. All options have

ten

-year terms.

The grant date fair value of each option award is calculated using a lattice option-pricing valuation model, which incorporates a range of assumptions for inputs as follows:

Expected volatility over the contractual term of an option was based on a combination of the implied volatility from publicly traded options on VF Common Stock and the historical volatility of VF Common Stock. The expected term represents the period of time over which vested options are expected to be outstanding before exercise. VF used historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and to estimate the number of options that would vest.

Groups of employees that have historically exhibited similar option exercise behaviors were considered separately in estimating the expected term for each employee group. Dividend yield represents expected dividends on VF Common Stock for the contractual life of the options. Risk-free interest rates for the periods during the contractual life of the option were the implied yields at the date of grant from the U.S. Treasury zero coupon yield curve.

Stock option activity for the year ended March

Restricted Stock Units

VF grants performance-based RSUs that enable employees to receive shares of VF Common Stock at the end of a

three

-year period. Each performance-based RSU has a potential final payout ranging from

zero

to

two

shares of VF Common Stock. For performance-based RSUs granted prior to February 2018, the number of shares earned by participants, if any, is based on achievement of a

three

-year baseline profitability goal and annually established performance goals set by the Talent and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. For performance-based RSUs granted in the three months ended March 2018, Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2020, the number of shares earned by participants, if any, is based on achievement of three-year financial targets set by the Talent and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. For all performance-based RSUs, shares are issued to participants in the year following the conclusion of each

three

-year performance period.

The actual number of shares earned may also be adjusted upward or downward by


%

of the target award, based on how VF’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) over the

three

March 2020

On May 19, 2019, Switzerland voted to approve the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing ("Swiss Tax Act"). Provisions of the Swiss Tax Act were enacted for Swiss federal purposes during the second quarter of Fiscal 2020, and later enacted for certain cantons during the fourth quarter. These provisions resulted in adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities such that a net tax benefit of

$

93.6

million

was recorded for the year ended March 2020.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("U.S. Tax Act"). In response to the complexities and ambiguity surrounding the U.S. Tax Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") to provide companies with relief around the initial accounting for the U.S. Tax Act, providing a one-year measurement period for companies to analyze and finalize accounting for the Tax Act.

VF finalized its accounting for the U.S. Tax Act during the one-year measurement period under SAB 118 and recognized additional net

charges of

$

18.2

million

, resulting in a cumulative net charge of

$

483.7

million

. The measurement period adjustments included

$

5.1

million

of net tax benefit recognized in the three months ended March 2018 and

$

23.3

million

of net tax expense recognized during the year ended March 2019.

On January 15, 2019 final regulations under Section 965 related to the transition tax were released. After analyzing these regulations, the Company recorded an additional net charge of

$

13.9

million

during the year ended March 2019, primarily comprised of

$

20.7

million

tax expense related to transition tax and a net tax benefit of

$

6.8

million

related to a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the final regulations.

The income tax payable attributable to the transition tax is due over an 8-year period beginning in 2018. At March 28, 2020, a noncurrent income tax payable of approximately

$

372.3

million

attributable to the transition tax is reflected in the other liabilities line item of the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The differences between income taxes computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate and income tax expense reported in the consolidated financial statements are as follows:

Income tax expense includes tax benefits of

$

13.4

$

6.3

in the years ended March


and

three months ended March 2018

and the year ended December


, respectively, from favorable audit outcomes on certain tax matters and from expiration of statutes of limitations.

VF was granted a ruling which lowered the effective income tax rate on taxable earnings for years 2010 through 2014 under Belgium’s excess profit tax regime. In February 2015, the European Union Commission (“EU”) opened a state aid investigation into Belgium’s rulings. On January 11, 2016, the EU announced its decision that these rulings were illegal and ordered that tax benefits granted under these rulings should be collected from the affected companies, including VF.

On March 22, 2016, the Belgium government filed an appeal seeking annulment of the EU decision. Additionally, on June 21, 2016, VF Europe BVBA filed its own application for annulment of the EU decision.

On December 22, 2016, Belgium adopted a law which entitled the Belgium tax authorities to issue tax assessments, and demand timely payments from companies which benefited from the excess profits regime. On January 10, 2017, VF Europe BVBA received an assessment for

€

31.9

million

tax and interest related to excess profits benefits received in prior years. VF Europe BVBA remitted

€

31.9

million

(

$

33.9

million

) on January 13, 2017, which was recorded as an income tax receivable in 2017 based on the expected success of the aforementioned requests for annulment. An additional assessment of

€

3.1

million

(

$

3.8

million

) was received and paid in January 2018. On February 14, 2019 the General Court annulled the EU decision and on April 26, 2019 the EU appealed the General Court's annulment. Both listed requests for annulment remain open and unresolved. Additionally, the EU has initiated proceedings related to individual rulings granted by Belgium, including the ruling granted to VF. If this matter is adversely resolved, these amounts will not be collected by VF.

In addition, VF has been granted a lower effective income tax rate on taxable earnings in another foreign jurisdiction that will expire as of the end of June 2020. This lower rate, when compared with

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following:

At the end of Fiscal 2020, the Company is not asserting indefinite reinvestment with regards to short-term liquid assets of its foreign subsidiaries, as well as certain noncurrent assets that are expected to be converted to liquid assets in the foreseeable future. All other foreign earnings, including basis differences of certain foreign subsidiaries, continue to be considered indefinitely reinvested. As of the end of Fiscal 2020, there was

$

3.9

billion

of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries which have substantially been included for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but if distributed could result in additional U.S. state income or other taxes. The Company has not determined the deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and basis differences, as such determination is not practicable.

VF has potential tax benefits totaling

REPORTABLE SEGMENT INFORMATION

The chief operating decision maker allocates resources and assesses performance based on a global brand view which represents VF's operating segments. The operating segments have been evaluated and combined into reportable segments because they have met the similar economic characteristics and qualitative aggregation criteria set forth in the relevant accounting guidance. Based on this assessment, the Company's reportable segments have been identified as: Outdoor, Active and Work.

Below is a description of VF's reportable segments and the brands included within each:

Other

- included in the tables below for purposes of reconciliation of revenues and profit, but it is not considered a reportable segment. Other includes results related to the sale of non-VF products and transition services primarily related to the sale of the

Nautica

®

brand business.

The Company continuously assesses the composition of its portfolio to ensure it is aligned with its strategic objectives and positioned to maximize growth and return to shareholders. In doing so, it evaluates whether changes may need to be made to our internal reporting structure to better support and assess the operations of our business going forward. If changes are made, we will assess the resulting effect on our reportable segments, operating segments and reporting units, if any.

The primary financial measures used by management to evaluate the financial results of VF's reportable segments are segment revenues and segment profit. Segment profit comprises the operating income and other income (expense), net line items of each segment.

Accounting policies used for internal management reporting at the individual segments are consistent with those in

Note 1

, except as stated below. Corporate costs (other than common costs allocated to the segments), impairment charges and net interest expense are not controlled by segment management and therefore are excluded from the measurement of segment profit. Common costs such as information systems processing, retirement benefits and insurance are allocated from corporate costs to the segments based on appropriate metrics such as usage or employment.

Corporate costs that are not allocated to the segments consist of corporate headquarters expenses (including compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff, certain legal and professional fees and administrative and general costs) and other expenses which include a portion of defined benefit pension costs, development costs for management information systems, costs of registering, maintaining and enforcing certain of VF’s trademarks and miscellaneous consolidated costs. Defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. are centrally managed. The current year service cost component of pension cost is allocated to the segments, while the remaining pension cost components are reported in corporate and other expenses.

Segment assets, for internal management purposes, are those used directly in or resulting from the operations of each business, which are accounts receivable and inventories. Segment assets included in the Other category represent balances related to transition services and other corporate activities, and are provided for purposes of reconciliation as the Other category is not considered a reportable segment. Total expenditures for additions to long-lived assets are not disclosed as this information is not regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker at the segment level.

Contingencies

The Company petitioned the U.S. Tax Court to resolve an IRS dispute regarding the timing of income inclusion associated with the 2011 Timberland acquisition. The Company remains confident in our timing and treatment of the income inclusion, and therefore this matter is not reflected in our financial statements. We are vigorously defending our position, and do not expect the resolution to have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While the IRS argues immediate income inclusion, the Company's position is to include the income over a period of years. As the matter relates to 2011, nearly half of the timing in dispute has passed with the Company including the income, and paying the related tax, on our income tax returns. The Company notes that should the IRS prevail in this timing matter, the net interest expense would be up to

$


million

. Further, this timing matter is impacted by the U.S. Tax Act that reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. If the IRS is successful, this rate differential would increase tax expense by approximately

$


million

.

The Company is currently involved in other legal proceedings that are ordinary, routine litigation incidental to the business. The resolution of any particular proceeding is not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Financial assets and financial liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified in a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation process. A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is based on the observability and objectivity of the pricing inputs, as follows:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2 — Significant directly observable data (other than Level 1 quoted prices) or significant indirectly observable

data through corroboration with observable market data. Inputs would normally be (i) quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, (ii) quoted prices in inactive markets for identical or similar assets or liabilities, or (iii) information derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

•

Level 3 — Prices or valuation techniques that require significant unobservable data inputs. These inputs would normally be VF’s own data and judgments about assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements

The following table summarizes financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured and recorded in the consolidated financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis:

The amounts reported in the table above for the prior period have not been segregated between continuing and discontinued operations. The March 2019 balances include

$

50.8

million

of deferred compensation liabilities and associated assets related to the Jeans business, which were transferred in connection with the spin-off.

(a)

There were no transfers among the levels within the fair value hierarchy during the years ended March


or


.

VF’s cash equivalents include money market funds and short-term time deposits that approximate fair value based on Level 1 measurements. The fair value of derivative financial instruments, which consist of foreign exchange forward contracts, is determined based on observable market inputs (Level 2), including spot and forward exchange rates for foreign currencies, and considers the credit risk of the Company and its counterparties. Investment

securities are held in VF’s deferred compensation plans as an economic hedge of the related deferred compensation liabilities (

Note 16

). These investments primarily include mutual funds (Level 1) that are valued based on quoted prices in active markets, and as of March 2019, also included a separately managed fixed-income fund (Level 2) with underlying investments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or

VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K

F-52


VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

March 2020

quoted prices in inactive markets for identical assets. Liabilities related to VF’s deferred compensation plans are recorded at amounts due to participants, based on the fair value of the participants’ selection of hypothetical investments.

All other financial assets and financial liabilities are recorded in the consolidated financial statements at cost, except life insurance contracts which are recorded at cash surrender value. These other financial assets and financial liabilities include cash held as demand deposits, accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. At March


and


, their carrying values approximated their fair values. Additionally, at March


and


, the carrying values of VF’s long-term debt, including the current portion, were

$

2,609.3

million

and

$

2,121.1

million

, respectively, compared with fair values of

$

2,672.9

million

and

$

2,318.6

million

at those respective dates. Fair value for long-term debt is a Level 2 estimate based on quoted market prices or values of comparable borrowings.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements

Certain non-financial assets, primarily property, plant and equipment, lease right-of-use assets, goodwill and intangible assets, are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are reported at carrying value. However, these assets are required to be assessed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be fully recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. In the event an impairment is required, the asset is adjusted to fair value, using market-based assumptions.

The Company recorded

$

14.6

million

,

$

6.0

million

and

$

17.2

million

of impairments in the years ended March


and


and the year ended December


, respectively, related to retail store assets, associated lease right-of-use assets and other fixed assets. These impairments are recorded in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income. There were

no

significant impairment charges during the

three months ended March 2018

.

During the three months ended September 28, 2019, management performed a quantitative impairment analysis of the Timberland reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset. Based on the analysis, management concluded that the goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset were not impaired.

Management performed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of Fiscal


. Management performed a quantitative analysis of the Timberland and Altra reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets. A qualitative analysis was performed for all other reporting units and indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets. No impairment charges of goodwill or indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets were recorded as a result of the annual impairment testing completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020.

As of March 28, 2020, management determined that the unfavorable projected financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was a triggering event that required management to perform quantitative impairment analyses over the Timberland, Altra and Icebreaker reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark

intangible assets. A goodwill impairment charge of

$

323.2

million

was recorded in the year ended March


related to the Timberland reporting unit. No other impairment charges were recorded as a result of the impairment testing completed as of March 28, 2020.

See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates within Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional discussion regarding non-recurring fair value measurements during the year ended March


.

No

impairment charges of goodwill or intangible assets were recorded in the year ended March


, the three months ended March 2018 or the year ended December 2017 for VF's continuing operations.

Our impairment testing of goodwill, trademarks and customer relationship intangible assets utilizes significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) to determine fair value.

The fair value of reporting units for goodwill impairment testing is determined using a combination of two valuation methods: an income approach and a market approach. The income approach is based on projected future (debt-free) cash flows that are discounted to present value. The appropriate discount rate is based on the reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) that takes market participant assumptions into consideration. For the market approach, management uses both the guideline company and similar transaction methods. The guideline company method analyzes market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) for a group of comparable public companies. The market multiples used in the valuation are based on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit compared to the selected guideline companies. Under the similar transactions method, valuation multiples are calculated utilizing actual transaction prices and revenue/EBITDA data from target companies deemed similar to the reporting unit.

Management uses the income-based relief-from-royalty method to value trademark intangible assets. Under this method, revenues expected to be generated by the trademark are multiplied by a selected royalty rate. The royalty rate is selected based on consideration of (i) royalty rates included in active license agreements, if applicable, (ii) royalty rates received by market participants in the apparel industry, and (iii) the current performance of the reporting unit. The estimated after-tax royalty revenue stream is then discounted to present value using the reporting unit’s WACC plus a spread that factors in the risk of the intangible asset.

Management’s revenue and profitability forecasts used in the reporting unit and intangible asset valuations were developed in conjunction with management’s strategic plan review, and our resulting revised outlook for business performance, and considered recent performance and trends, including the projected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, strategic initiatives and industry trends. Assumptions used in the valuations are similar to those that would be used by market participants performing independent valuations of these businesses.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Summary of Derivative Financial Instruments

All of VF’s outstanding derivative financial instruments are foreign exchange forward contracts. Although derivatives meet the criteria for hedge accounting at the inception of the hedging relationship, a limited number of derivative contracts intended to hedge assets and liabilities are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. The notional amounts of all outstanding derivative

contracts were

$

2.6

billion

and

$

2.8

billion

at March


and


, respectively, consisting primarily of contracts hedging exposures to the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, Swiss franc, South Korean won, Swedish krona, Japanese yen, Polish zloty and New Zealand dollar. Derivative contracts have maturities up to


months

.

The following table presents outstanding derivatives on an individual contract basis:

VF records and presents the fair values of all of its derivative assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross basis, even though they are subject to master netting agreements. If VF were to offset and record the asset and liability balances of its foreign exchange forward contracts on a net basis in accordance with the terms of its master netting agreements, the amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March

Derivative Contracts Not Designated as Hedge

s

VF uses derivative contracts to manage foreign currency exchange risk on third-party accounts receivable and payable, as well as intercompany borrowings. These contracts are not designated as hedges, and are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair values of these instruments are recognized directly in earnings. Gains or losses on these contracts largely offset the net transaction losses or gains on the related assets and liabilities. In the case of derivative contracts executed on foreign currency exposures that are no longer probable of occurring, VF de-designates these hedges and the fair value changes of these instruments are also recognized directly in earnings. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions expected to be taken by the Company, certain derivative contracts were de-designated as hedged forecasted transactions were no longer deemed probable of occurring. Accordingly, the Company reclassified amounts from accumulated OCI and recognized a

loss was recorded in net revenues.

Foreign currency exchange contracts not designated as hedges as of March


also include contracts still owned by VF that are related to the former Jeans business. In connection with the spin-off, VF transferred the value of the unrecognized gain on these contracts to Kontoor Brands.

The changes in fair value of derivative contracts not designated as hedges that have been recognized as gains or losses in VF's Consolidated Statements of Income were not material for the years ended March

Other Derivative Information

At March


, accumulated OCI included

$

60.2

million

of pre-tax net deferred gains for foreign currency exchange contracts that are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next 12 months. The amounts ultimately reclassified to earnings will depend on exchange rates in effect when outstanding derivative contracts are settled.

VF entered into interest rate swap derivative contracts in 2011 and 2003 to hedge the interest rate risk for issuance of long-term debt due in


and


, respectively. In each case, the contracts were terminated concurrent with the issuance of the debt, and the realized gain or loss was deferred in accumulated OCI. In connection with the full redemption of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2021 notes in March 2020, the remaining pre-tax net deferred loss of

$

8.5

million

was recorded in the interest expense line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The remaining pre-tax net deferred gain, associated with the 2033 notes, in accumulated OCI was

$

1.4

million

at March


, which will be reclassified into interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining terms of the associated debt instrument. During the years ended March


and


, the

three months ended March 2018

and the year ended December


, VF reclassified

$

13.2

million

,

$

5.0

million

,

$

1.2

million

and

$

4.7

million

, respectively, of net deferred losses from accumulated OCI into interest expense. VF expects to reclassify

$

0.1

million

to interest expense during the next 12 months.

Net Investment Hedge

The Company has designated its

€

1.850

billion

of euro-denominated fixed-rate notes as a net investment hedge of VF’s investment in certain foreign operations. Because this debt qualified as a nonderivative hedging instrument, foreign currency transaction gains or losses of the debt are deferred in the foreign currency translation and other component of accumulated OCI as an offset to the foreign currency translation adjustments on the hedged investments. During the years ended March


and


, the

three months ended March 2018

and the year ended December


, the Company recognized an after-tax loss of

$

8.8

million

, an after-tax gain of

$

69.5

million

, an after-tax loss of

$

19.2

million

and an after-tax loss of

$

92.9

million

, respectively, in OCI related to the net investment hedge transaction. Any amounts deferred in accumulated OCI will remain until the hedged investment is sold or substantially liquidated.
