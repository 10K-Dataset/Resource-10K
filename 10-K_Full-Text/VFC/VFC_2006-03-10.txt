PART I

Item 1. Business

VF Corporation, organized in 1899, is a worldwide leader in the manufacturing and marketing of
branded lifestyle apparel and related products. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term
“VF” used herein means VF Corporation and its subsidiaries.

For over 100 years, VF has grown by offering consumers high quality, high value branded apparel and
other products. Management’s vision is to continue to grow VF by building lifestyle
brands that excite customers around the world. Lifestyle brands, representative of the activities
that consumers aspire to, will generally extend across multiple product categories and therefore
have greater opportunity for growth. VF follows an overall strategy of identifying specific brands
to market to a specific channel of distribution. Accordingly, products and brands are sold through
specialty store, department store, mid-tier, chain store and discount store channels. In addition,
many products are available through VF-operated retail stores, as well as through licensees and
distributors dedicated to offering these products directly to consumers. To provide these products
across this broad distribution network, VF has implemented a strategy that combines efficient and
flexible internally-owned manufacturing with the sourcing of finished goods from independent
contractors. As a result, VF satisfies the needs of millions of apparel consumers around the
world.



VF’s businesses are organized into five product categories, and by brands within those product
categories, for both management and internal financial reporting purposes. These groupings of
businesses are called “coalitions” and consist of the following: Jeanswear, Outdoor, Intimate
Apparel, Imagewear and Sportswear. These coalitions are treated as reportable segments for
financial reporting purposes. Coalition management has the responsibility to build and develop
brands within guidelines established by VF management. Corporate management at VF headquarters
oversees the operations of these individual businesses and provides them with financial and
administrative resources.

The following table summarizes VF’s primary owned and licensed brands by coalition:

Jeanswear Coalition

Jeanswear and related shirts and casual products are marketed in the United States and in many
international markets.

Lee

â

and

Wrangler

â

products are
sold in nearly every developed country. In fact, including all of its jeanswear brands, VF has the
largest jeanswear market share of any company in the world. The

Lee

â

and

Wrangler

â

brands also have long-standing traditions, as they were established in
1889 and 1947, respectively.

In addition to these brands, VF markets the

Wrangler Hero

â

,

Rustler

â

and

Riders

â

brands in the United States. VF also

in Spain and Portugal. In foreign markets where VF does not have owned operations,

Lee

â

and

Wrangler

â

jeanswear and related products are marketed
through distributors, agents or licensees.

Subsequent to the end of 2005, VF sold the

Earl Jean

â

trademarks and certain
assets for an amount approximating book value.

Outdoor Coalition

The Outdoor Coalition is a group of outdoor-related businesses that represent a collection of
lifestyle brands. Product offerings include outerwear, sportswear, footwear, equipment, backpacks,
daypacks and luggage.

products use
them for less extreme activities.

The North Face

â

products are marketed through
specialty outdoor and premium sporting goods stores in the United States, Canada and Europe and
select department stores in the United States. In addition, these products are sold through
VF-operated full price retail and outlet stores in the United States, as well as stores operated by
licensees and distributors dedicated to selling

The North Face

â

brand in
Europe and Asia. These products are marketed throughout Asia by licensees and distributors, except
in Japan and South Korea where rights to the brand are owned by a third party.

JanSport

stores and college bookstores in the United States.

JanSport

â

Europe. A technical line of

JanSport

â

JanSport

â

and

Eastpak

â

brands are also
marketed throughout Asia by licensees and distributors.

Vans is a manufacturer and marketer of

Vans

â

performance and casual footwear and
apparel for skateboarders and other action sports participants and enthusiasts. These products are
sold on a wholesale (primarily through mid-tier stores) and retail basis. The retail strategy of
Vans includes full price retail stores and outlet stores. These retail stores carry a wide variety
of

Vans

â

footwear products, along with apparel and accessory items, most of which
bear the

Vans

â

brand name and logo. Vans currently operates full-price retail
stores in the United States located in a mix of mall and freestanding locations. A new prototype
store concept has been developed, which will be used to retrofit many of the existing retail stores
and improve retail sell-through. In addition to full-price retail stores, Vans operates outlet
stores in the United States, the United Kingdom, Austria, Spain and Puerto Rico.

Napapijri

â

brand premium casual outdoor apparel products are primarily positioned
in the mid-to-high price range and sold on a wholesale basis, primarily to European specialty shops
such as sport stores and fashion boutiques. In addition, these products are sold in Europe through
VF-operated stores and stores operated by licensees and distributors.

Napapijri

â

has very strong brand awareness in Italy, where the brand was created, and is also well-known
across Europe. The sportswear design talent for the

Napapijri

â

brand is being
utilized to develop

Nautica

â

apparel in Europe. In addition to anticipated
growth overseas, there are plans to develop a business in upper-tier department stores and add
VF-operated retail stores in the United States.

Kipling

â

bags, backpacks and accessories are sold in Europe, Asia, the United
States and South America. Products are sold through VF-operated as well as independently-operated
retail establishments. In addition to global retail expansion, there are plans for expanding the
department store distribution in the United States.

VF acquired the common stock of Reef Holdings Corporation (“Reef”) on April 14, 2005. Reef designs
surf-inspired products, including sandals, apparel, shoes and accessories under the

Reef

â

brand. These products are marketed primarily to sporting goods stores and
surf shops. This acquisition is consistent with VF’s strategy of acquiring strong lifestyle brands
with superior growth potential.

Intimate Apparel Coalition

VF markets women’s intimate apparel under the

Vanity Fair

â

,

Lily of
France

â

and

Exquisite Form

â

brands to department and
specialty stores located in the United States. Products in the Intimate



Apparel Coalition include
bras, panties, daywear, shapewear and sleepwear. Women’s intimate apparel is also marketed under
the

Vassarette

â

,

Bestform

â

,

Curvation

â

and licensed

Ilusión

â

brands for sale to the mass market channel of distribution. Also, VF has
a significant private label lingerie business with various specialty, national chain and discount
stores in the United States.

VF markets several of its intimate apparel brands to discount stores and department stores in
Mexico and Canada through joint ventures in which VF maintains a controlling interest.

In the European market, women’s intimate apparel is marketed to department and specialty stores
under the

Lou

â

,

Bolero

â

,

Gemma

â

,

Intima Cherry

â

,

Vanity Fair

â

and

Belcor

â

brands. Intimate apparel is marketed in discount stores under the

Variance

â

,

Vassarette

â

and

Bestform

â

brands. In addition, VF markets women’s swimwear under the

Majestic

â

and licensed

Nike

â

labels in Europe.

Management believes that VF is one of the top two marketers of branded intimate apparel in the
United States. In international markets, management believes that VF’s brands occupy the number
two and three market share positions in Spain and France, respectively.

Imagewear Coalition

VF produces workwear, career and safety apparel sold under the

Red
Kap

â

,

Bulwark

â

,

The Force™

and

Chef Designs™

brands.
Over one-half of these sales are to industrial laundries that in turn supply work clothes to
employers, primarily on a rental basis, for on-the-job wear by production, service and white-collar
personnel. Products include work pants, slacks, work and dress shirts, overalls, jackets and
smocks. Since industrial laundries maintain minimal inventories of work clothes, a supplier’s
ability to offer rapid delivery is an important factor in this market. VF’s commitment to customer
service, supported by an automated central distribution center with satellite locations, has
enabled customer orders to be filled within 24 hours of receipt and has helped the

Red
Kap

â

brand obtain a significant share of the industrial laundry rental business.

VF also markets corporate image uniforms and casual apparel through its Imagewear Coalition. To
better service its national accounts, VF operates a number of catalog web sites for major business
customers and for governmental organizations such as U.S. Customs & Border Protection and the
Bureau of Land Management. These web sites give more than 400,000 employees of these customers the
convenience of shopping and paying for their work and career apparel via the internet.

The Imagewear Coalition includes VF’s activewear apparel businesses. VF designs and markets
decorated sports apparel under licenses granted by the four major American professional sports
leagues, Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Inc., NASCAR, most major colleges and universities, and
other organizations. These sports apparel products for adults and youth are distributed through
department, sporting goods and athletic specialty stores under the

Lee Sport

â

and
the licensed

Chase Authentics

â

brands. Growth in recent years has been driven by
a five year agreement signed in 2002 with the National Football League, which was subsequently
extended to 2008 for adult men’s and women’s apparel. Under this agreement, VF is the exclusive
supplier for selected men’s and women’s tops and bottoms decorated with NFL team logos marketed to
mid-tier department stores, specialty stores and mass retailers. VF also entered into a new five
year contract with Major League Baseball in 2004.

In early 2005, VF acquired the assets of Holoubek, Inc., a business having rights to manufacture
and market T-shirts and fleece under the licensed

Harley-Davidson

â

brand.

The remaining component of this coalition is the marketing of blank knitted fleecewear and other
knit and



woven tops to wholesalers principally under the

Lee

â

brand.

Sportswear Coalition

In August 2003, VF acquired Nautica Enterprises, Inc. (“Nautica”). The

Nautica

â

branded sportswear business provided broad product capabilities related to a lifestyle brand and a
significantly greater presence in the department store and specialty store channels of
distribution.

The principal product line for Nautica is men’s sportswear, noted for its classic styling.

Nautica
Jeans Company

â

brand features fashionable jeanswear and related tops for
younger male consumers. The

Nautica Competition

â

brand

is a line of
casual apparel for active consumers. Other product lines sold by VF under the

Nautica

â

brand include men’s outerwear, underwear and sleepwear, and women’s
sleepwear and panties. A collection of women’s sportswear will be launched in department stores in
Fall 2006.

Nautica operates outlet stores in better outlet malls across the United States. These stores carry

Nautica

â

merchandise for men, boys and girls. Products sold in the outlet stores
are different styles from those sold by Nautica to its department and specialty store wholesale
customers. In addition, the stores carry

Nautica

â

merchandise from licensees to
complete their product assortment.

As part of the Nautica acquisition, VF acquired the

John Varvatos

â

business. The

John Varvatos

â

brand is a luxury apparel and accessory collection for men
including tailored clothing, sportswear, leather accessories and footwear. These products are sold
through upscale department and specialty stores, as well as through five

John
Varvatos

â

brand retail locations. During 2005, VF formed a joint venture in which
Mr. John Varvatos has a 20% ownership and VF has an 80% interest.

The Sportswear Coalition also includes the

Kipling

â

brand business in North
America, acquired in late 2004 as part of the Kipling acquisition in Europe.

Retail Operations

VF-operated retail stores are an integral part of VF’s strategy for building its brands, providing
visibility for its products and brands and enabling VF to stay close to the needs of core
consumers. In addition, outlet stores serve an important role in VF’s overall inventory management
by allowing VF to effectively sell a significant portion of discontinued and out-of-season products
at better prices than are otherwise available.

VF currently operates approximately 305 full-price stores and 110 outlet stores around the world
that sell specific brands, including

The North Face

â

, Vans

â

,
Napapijri

â

, Kipling

â

,

Nautica

â

,
Lee

â

and

Wrangler

â

. Also, VF has granted the right to licensees
and distributors to sell the

JanSport

â

,

Eastpak

â

,

The North
Face

â

, Vans

â

,

Napapijri

â

and

Kipling

â

brands through over 200 independently-operated stores located primarily in Europe and Asia.

In addition to the mono-brand retail outlet operations discussed above, VF operates approximately
110 outlet stores across the United States and Europe that sell a broad selection of VF products.
Sales and profits of VF products sold through these outlet stores are reported as part of the
operating results of the respective coalitions.

Retail sales accounted for approximately 12% and 10% of VF’s consolidated Total Revenues in 2005
and 2004, respectively. VF management expects the retail business to continue to grow and is
planning a



capital investment of approximately $35 million in retail space during 2006.

In addition, VF offers products directly to the consumer via the internet. Products sold through
the internet include uniforms (Imagewear Coalition) and

Vans

â

footwear (Outdoor
Coalition). Internet sales in 2005 were approximately 1% of VF’s consolidated Total Revenues.

Licensing Arrangements

In connection with VF’s business strategy of expanding market penetration of its owned brands, VF
enters into licensing agreements for certain products and geographic regions if such arrangements
provide more effective manufacturing, distribution and marketing of such products than could be
achieved internally. These licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of VF brands and are for
fixed terms that
may include renewal options. In addition, certain foreign licensees and distributors have been
granted the right to open retail stores under the licensed brand name and sell only licensed
branded products in these stores. Each licensee pays royalties to VF based upon its sales of
branded products, with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty. These payments generally
range from 3% to 7% of the licensing partners’ net sales of the licensed products.

In addition, licensees are generally required to spend an amount between 1% and 5% of their sales
to advertise VF’s products. In some cases, these advertising amounts are remitted to VF for
advertising on behalf of the licensees. VF provides support to these business partners and seeks
to preserve the integrity of brand names by taking an active role in the design, quality control,
advertising, marketing and distribution of each licensed product, most of which are subject to VF’s
prior approval and continuing oversight. Gross Royalty Income was $74 million and $70 million in
2005 and 2004, respectively.

While licensing activities exist for all coalitions, the largest component of this business,
approximately 43% of gross Royalty Income, is in the Sportswear coalition. The

Nautica

â

brand is licensed in the United States for apparel categories not
produced by VF (e.g., tailored clothing, dress shirts, neckwear, accessories, women’s swimwear) and
for nonapparel categories (e.g., home furnishings, fragrances, watches, eyewear). In addition,

Nautica

â

apparel and certain nonapparel products are licensed for sale in over 100
countries outside the U.S. Wholesale sales of

Nautica

â

branded products by
licensees are in excess of $420 million annually.

VF has also entered into license agreements to use the trademarks of others. Apparel is marketed
under licenses granted by the National Football League, Major League Baseball, the National
Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, NASCAR, NIKE, Inc. and Harley-Davidson Motor
Company, Inc. Some of these license arrangements contain minimum annual licensing and advertising
requirements. Some are for a short term and may not contain specific renewal options. Management
believes that the loss of any license would not have a material adverse effect on VF.

Raw Materials and Sourcing

Raw materials include fabrics made from cotton, synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn,
as well as thread and trim (product identification, buttons, zippers, snaps and lace). These raw
materials are purchased from numerous suppliers. While in some cases VF has obtained fixed price
commitments for up to one year, specific purchase obligations with suppliers are typically limited
to the succeeding two to six months. VF does not have any long-term supplier contracts for the
purchase of raw materials. However, in connection with the sale of VF’s childrenswear business in
2004, VF has committed to purchase a total of approximately $130 million of finished product for
sale through its owned outlet stores, with a minimum of $15 million per year through 2013.



For most domestic operations, VF purchases fabric from several domestic and international suppliers
in conjunction with scheduled production. Purchased fabric is cut and sewn into finished garments
in VF-owned domestic and offshore manufacturing facilities located in Mexico and the Caribbean
Basin. In addition, VF contracts the sewing of VF-owned raw materials into finished product to
independent contractors, primarily in Mexico and the Caribbean Basin.

To an increasing extent, VF is using independent contractors in Asia and the Caribbean Basin who
own the raw materials and provide only finished, ready-for-sale products to VF. These contractors
are engaged through sourcing hubs in Asia and Miami. The Miami location handles the majority of
the sourcing for the Western Hemisphere. These hubs are responsible for the product procurement,
product quality assurance and supplier management and handling functions. All products in the
Outdoor and
Sportswear Coalitions, as well as many items in VF’s other operating units, are sourced through
these operations.

All contracted production must meet VF’s high quality standards. Further, all independent
contractors who manufacture apparel products for VF must be pre-certified and sign a Terms of
Engagement agreement prior to performance of any production on VF’s behalf. These requirements
provide strict standards covering hours of work, age of workers, health and safety conditions and
conformity with local laws. VF maintains an ongoing program to audit compliance with dedicated and
outsourced staff.

The current sourcing strategy for products sold in the United States allows VF to balance its needs
with a mix of VF-owned and contracted production in the Western Hemisphere, combined with
contracted production primarily from Asia. Product obtained from Western Hemisphere contractors
has somewhat higher cost but gives VF greater flexibility, shorter lead times and lower inventory
levels as compared with production obtained from the Far East and other more distant resources.
This combination of VF-owned and contracted production, along with different geographic regions and
cost structures, provides a balanced approach to product sourcing.

Over the last five years, VF closed a significant number of manufacturing facilities in the
United States and shifted production to lower cost locations. As a result of this shift in
sourcing, the amount of sales in the United States derived from products manufactured in lower cost
locations outside the United States has increased each year over the last three years. During
2005, only 1% of domestic Net Sales were manufactured in VF-owned plants in the United States. In
contrast, at the end of 2000, approximately one-third of VF’s products sold in the United States
were manufactured in VF-owned plants in the United States. Today, of the total products supporting
sales to customers in the United States, 31% were manufactured in VF-owned facilities in Mexico and
the Caribbean Basin and 68% were obtained from contractors, primarily in Asia.

For VF’s international businesses, fabric, thread and trim are purchased from several international
suppliers. In the European jeanswear operations, fabric is cut and sewn into finished garments in
owned plants located in Malta, Poland and Turkey, with the balance sourced from independent
contractors in the Middle East, Africa and the Far East. In the international intimate apparel
businesses, fabric is sewn into finished garments in owned plants in Spain and Tunisia,
with the remainder manufactured by independent contractors. To obtain a more balanced sourcing
mix, European jeanswear and intimate apparel sourcing has been shifting from owned plants in
Western Europe to lower cost owned and contracted production outside of Western Europe. For the
European outdoor coalition businesses, nearly all products are sourced from contractors located in
Asia.

VF did not experience difficulty in obtaining its raw material and contracting production needs
during 2005. Management does not anticipate difficulties in obtaining its raw materials and
contracting



production requirements during 2006. The loss of any one supplier or contractor would
not have a significant adverse effect on VF’s business.

Imports and Import Restrictions

VF is exposed to certain risks of doing business outside of the United States. VF imports goods
from VF-owned facilities in Mexico and the Caribbean Basin and from suppliers in those areas and in
Asia, Europe Africa and the Middle East. These import transactions had been subject to the
constraints imposed by bilateral agreements between the United States and a number of governments.
These agreements were negotiated either under the framework established by the World Trade
Organization (“WTO”) or other applicable statutes, and they imposed quotas that limited the amount
of certain categories of merchandise
from these countries that could be imported into the United States and the European Union. All
restrictions under these agreements had ended as of December 31, 2004.

Pursuant to a 1995 Agreement on Textiles and Clothing under the WTO, effective January 1, 2005 the
United States and other WTO member countries were required, with few exceptions, to remove quotas
on goods from WTO member countries. The complete removal of quotas may benefit VF as well as other
apparel companies in the long run by allowing them to source products, without quantitative
limitation, from any country. The only significant exceptions to the removal of quota that could
affect VF are Vietnam and China. Vietnam is not a WTO member and is therefore still subject to
quota on certain products to various countries. Safeguard quotas pursuant to the terms of China’s
Accession Agreement to the WTO have been imposed against Chinese exports and will last through
2008. These new restraints include products that VF imports and sells. However, VF management was
well aware of developments with regards to safeguards and made sourcing decisions accordingly. Any
effect of the imposition of safeguards is not expected to be material to VF.

Management continually monitors new developments and risks related to duties, tariffs and quotas.
In response to the changing import environment resulting from the elimination of quotas, management
has chosen to continue its balanced approach to manufacturing and sourcing. VF limits its sourcing
exposure through, among other measures, (1) extensive geographic diversification with a mix of
VF-operated and contracted production, (2) utilization of tariff preference and free trade
agreements to lower customs duties, (3) allocation of production to merchandise categories where
the free flow of product is available and (4) shifts of production among countries and contractors.
VF will continue to manage its supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to
changes in the global production environment.

Seasonality

The apparel industry in the United States has four primary retail selling seasons — Spring,
Summer, Back-to-School and Holiday, while international markets typically have Spring and Fall
selling seasons. Sales to retail customers generally precede the retail selling seasons, although
demand peaks have been reduced as more products are being sold directly to consumers or to
retailers on a replenishment basis.

Overall, with its diversified product offerings, VF’s operating results are somewhat seasonal. On
a quarterly basis, consolidated Total Revenues for 2005 ranged from a low of approximately 22% of
full year revenues in the second quarter to a high of 28% in the third quarter. This disparity
results primarily from the sales of outdoor apparel and equipment, which are more seasonal in
nature. Approximately 36% of outdoor apparel and equipment sales occurred in the third quarter.

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital increases during the first
half of the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and, accordingly, decreases
during the second half. Cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the
second half of the year



due to higher net income and reduced working capital requirements during
that period.

Advertising

VF supports its brands through extensive advertising and promotional programs. VF advertises on
national and local radio and television and in consumer and trade publications and participates in
cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in radio, television and
various print media. VF sponsors various sporting, music and other special events. In addition,
point-of-sale fixtures and signage are used to promote products at the retail level. VF spent $337
million advertising and promoting its products in 2005, an increase of 7% from the 2004 level.

VF also participates in various retail customer incentive programs. These incentive programs with
retailers include stated discounts, discounts based on the retailer agreeing to advertise or
promote the products, or margin support funds. VF also offers sales incentive programs directly to
consumers in the form of rebate and coupon offers. These sales incentive offers with retailers and
with consumers are recognized as sales discounts in arriving at reported Net Sales.

Other Matters

Competitive Factors

VF’s business depends on its ability to stimulate consumer demand for its brands and products. VF
is well-positioned to compete in the apparel industry by developing consumer-driven and innovative
products at competitive prices, producing high quality merchandise, providing high levels of
service, ensuring product availability to the retail sales floor and enhancing recognition of its
brands. VF continually strives to improve on each of these areas. Many of VF’s brands have long
histories and enjoy high recognition within their respective consumer segments.

Trademarks

Trademarks have substantial value in the marketing of VF’s products. VF has registered these
trademarks in the United States and with governmental agencies in other countries where VF’s
products are manufactured and/or sold. VF vigorously monitors and protects these trademarks
against infringement and dilution where legally feasible and appropriate. In addition, VF grants
licenses to other parties to manufacture and sell products with its trademarks in product
categories and in geographic areas in which VF does not operate.

Customers

VF products are primarily sold through VF’s sales force and independent sales agents and
distributors. VF’s customers are primarily department, chain, specialty and discount stores in the
United States and in international markets, primarily in Europe. Sales to VF’s ten largest
customers, all of which are retailers based in the United States, amounted to 34% of total revenues
in 2005, 38% in 2004 and 40% in 2003. Sales to the five largest of those customers amounted to
approximately 29% of total revenues in 2005 and 2004 and 33% in 2003. Sales to VF’s largest
customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., totaled 15.7% of total sales in 2005, 15.0% in 2004 and 16.4% in
2003, substantially all of which were in the Jeanswear and Intimate Apparel coalitions.

Employees

VF employed approximately 52,300 men and women as of the end of 2005, of which 17,500 were located



in the United States. Approximately 350 employees in the United States are covered by a collective
bargaining agreement. In international markets, a significant percentage of employees are covered
by trade-sponsored or governmental bargaining arrangements. Employee relations are considered to
be good.

Backlog

The dollar amount of VF’s order backlog as of any date is not material for an understanding of the
business of VF taken as a whole.

Executive Officers of VF

The following are the executive officers of VF Corporation as of February 10, 2006. The officers
are generally elected annually and serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. There is no
family relationship among any of the VF Corporation executive officers.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating VF’s business and
the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could
materially adversely affect VF’s business, its operating results and its financial condition.

RISKS SPECIFIC TO VF CORPORATION

A substantial portion of VF’s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large
customers. The loss of any of these customers could substantially reduce VF’s profits.

A few of VF’s customers account for a significant portion of revenues. Sales to VF’s ten largest
customers were 34% of revenues in fiscal 2005, with Wal-Mart accounting for 16% of revenues. Sales
are generally on a purchase order basis, and VF does not have long-term agreements with any of its
customers. A decision by any of VF’s major customers to decrease significantly the number of
products purchased from VF could substantially reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect
on VF’s financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the retail industry has
experienced consolidation and other ownership changes, such as the merger of Federated Department
Stores, Inc. and The May Department Stores Company and the merger of Sears, Roebuck and Company and
Kmart Holding Corporation in 2005. In the future, retailers may further consolidate, undergo
restructurings or reorganizations, realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target
market. These developments could decrease the number of stores that carry VF’s products or
increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry. These changes could both impact
VF’s opportunities in the market and increase VF’s reliance on a smaller number of large customers.

VF’s business could be adversely affected by financial instability experienced by its customers.

During the past several years, various retailers have experienced significant financial
difficulties, which in some cases have resulted in bankruptcies, liquidations and store closings.
VF sells a large portion of its products on open account to national and regional department,
mid-tier and mass market stores in the United States. The financial difficulties of a customer
could result in reduced business with that customer. VF may also assume higher credit risk
relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty. If these developments
occur, VF’s inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on its trade accounts
receivable from one of its major customers could substantially reduce VF’s income and have a
material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.

The apparel industry is highly competitive, and VF’s success depends on its ability to respond to
constantly changing fashion trends and consumer demand. Reduced sales or prices resulting from
competition could have a material adverse effect on VF.

VF competes with numerous domestic and foreign brands and manufacturers of apparel. In addition,
VF competes directly with the private label brands of its wholesale customers. VF’s ability to
compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on its ability to:



•

ensure product availability and optimize supply chain efficiencies; and

•

obtain sufficient retail floor space and effectively present its products at retail.

VF attempts to minimize risks associated with competition, including risks related to changing
style trends and product acceptance, by studying retail sales trends. The failure, however, to
compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing markets and trends could have a material
adverse effect on VF’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if VF
misjudges fashion trends and market conditions, VF could be faced with significant excess
inventories for some products that it may have to sell at a loss and missed opportunities with
others that may result in lost sales.

VF’s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins.

VF’s industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense
competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of
products and changes in consumer demand. These factors may cause VF to reduce its sales prices to
retailers and consumers, which could cause VF’s gross margin to decline if VF is unable to offset
price reductions with comparable reductions in its operating costs. If VF’s sales prices decline
and VF fails to sufficiently reduce its product costs or operating expenses or increase its selling
prices, VF’s profitability will decline. This could have a material adverse effect on VF’s results
of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

VF may not succeed in implementing its growth strategy.

One of VF’s key strategic objectives is growth. VF seeks to grow through organic growth and
acquisitions, building new growing lifestyle brands, expanding its share with winning customers,
stretching its brands and customers to new geographies, fueling the growth by leveraging its supply
chain and information technology capabilities across VF, expanding its direct-to-consumer business
and building new growth enablers by identifying and developing high potential employees. VF may
have difficulty identifying acquisition targets, and it may not be able to successfully integrate a
newly acquired business or achieve any expected cost savings or synergies from such integration.
VF may not be able to achieve planned cost savings from its ongoing businesses. VF may not be able
to expand its share with winning customers, expand its brands geographically or achieve the
expected results from its supply chain initiatives. VF may also have difficulty recruiting or
developing qualified managers. The failure to implement its growth strategies may have a material
adverse effect on VF’s business.

If VF encounters problems with its distribution system, VF’s ability to deliver its products to the
market would be adversely affected.

VF relies on its distribution facilities to warehouse and, using its own employees or in some cases
independent contractors, to ship product to its customers. VF’s distribution system includes
computer- controlled and automated equipment, which means its operations are complicated and may be
subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of
software and hardware, electronic or power interruptions or other system failures. Because
substantially all of VF’s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations,
VF’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes, floods, fires or other natural disasters
near its distribution centers. VF maintains business interruption insurance, but it may not
adequately protect VF from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in
VF’s distribution facilities, such as the long-term loss of customers or an erosion of brand image.
In addition, VF’s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by
third parties, including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities. If
VF encounters problems with its distribution system, VF’s ability to meet customer expectations,
manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be
materially adversely affected.

VF relies significantly on information technology. Any inadequacy, interruption, integration
failure or security failure of that technology could harm VF’s ability to effectively operate its
business.



VF’s ability to effectively manage and operate its business depends significantly on its
information technology systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with
transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, difficulty in integrating new systems or systems
of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the
operations of VF’s business. It could also require significant expenditures to remediate any such
failure, problem or breach.

VF uses foreign suppliers and manufacturing facilities for a substantial portion of its finished
products and raw materials, which poses risks to VF’s business operations.

During fiscal 2005, in excess of 65% of VF’s products sold were produced by and purchased or
procured from independent manufacturers located in countries in the Far East, Indian subcontinent,
Caribbean and
Central America, and more than 30% were produced by VF-owned and operated manufacturing facilities
located in Europe, Mexico and the Caribbean. Although no single supplier and no one country is
critical to VF’s production needs, any of the following could materially and adversely affect VF’s
ability to produce or deliver its products and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on VF’s
business, financial condition and results of operations:

If VF’s suppliers fail to use acceptable ethical business practices, VF’s business could suffer.

VF requires third party suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and
regulations regarding working conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance.
Additionally, VF requires all suppliers making VF-branded apparel, whether directly for VF or for
its licensees, to comply with its Terms of Engagement and Global Compliance Principles. VF’s staff
and third parties retained for such purposes periodically visit and audit the operations of VF’s
independent manufacturers and owned and operated facilities to determine compliance. However, VF
does not control its independent manufacturers or their labor and other business practices. If one
of VF’s manufacturers violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices
that are generally regarded as unethical in the United States, the shipment of finished products to
VF could be interrupted, orders could be cancelled, relationships could be terminated and VF’s
reputation could be damaged. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on VF’s
revenues and, consequently, its results of operations.

VF’s results of operations could be materially harmed if VF is unable to accurately forecast demand
for its products.



VF often places orders for products with its manufacturers before its customers’ orders are firm.
Therefore, if VF fails to accurately forecast customer demand, VF may experience excess inventory
levels or a shortage of product to deliver to its customers. Factors that could affect VF’s
ability to accurately forecast demand for its products include:

Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs and the sale of
excess inventory at discounted prices, which would have an adverse effect on VF’s results of
operations and financial condition. In addition, if VF underestimates the demand for its products,
its manufacturing facilities or third party manufacturers may not be able to produce products to
meet VF’s customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of its products
and its ability to recognize revenue, as well as damage to its reputation and customer
relationships. There can be no assurance that VF will be able to successfully manage inventory
demand to meet future order and reorder requirements.

The loss of members of VF’s executive management and other key employees could have a material
adverse effect on its business.

VF depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers who have substantial
experience and expertise in VF’s business. VF also depends on other key employees involved in the
operation of its business. Competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense.
The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could materially adversely
affect VF.

VF may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights.

VF’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its
competitive position. VF is susceptible to others imitating its products and infringing its
intellectual property rights. With the shift in product mix to higher priced brands, VF is more
susceptible to infringement of its intellectual property rights. Some of VF’s brands, such as

The
North Face

â

,

JanSport

â

,

Nautica

â

,
Wrangler

â

and Lee

â

brands, enjoy significant worldwide consumer
recognition, and the generally higher pricing of such branded products creates additional risk of
counterfeiting and infringement.

Imitation or counterfeiting of VF’s products or infringement of its intellectual property rights
could diminish the value of its brands or otherwise adversely affect VF revenues. Actions VF has
taken to establish and protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be
adequate to prevent imitation of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to
invalidate its trademarks or block sales of VF’s products as a violation of the trademarks and
intellectual property rights of others.



The value of VF’s intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in, or ownership of,
trademarks and other intellectual property rights of VF’s or in trademarks that are similar to VF’s
or trademarks that VF licenses and/or markets. VF may be unable to successfully resolve these
types of conflicts to its satisfaction. In some cases, there may be trademark owners who have
prior rights to VF’s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect
intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. In other
cases, there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks. VF is, from time to time,
involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some items of its intellectual
property.

VF obtains licensing royalties and relies on its licensees to maintain the value of its brands.

Although only a relatively small portion of VF’s revenues, $74 million or 1.1%, were derived from
licensing royalties in 2005, and although VF generally has significant control over its licensee’s
products and advertising, VF relies on its licensees for, among other things, operational and
financial controls over their businesses. Failure of its licensees to successfully market licensed
products or VF’s inability to replace its existing licensees could adversely affect VF’s revenues,
both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of its other
products. Risks are also associated with a licensee’s ability to:

In addition, VF relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands. Although VF makes
every attempt to protect its brands through, among other things, approval rights over design,
production processes and quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion
of its products, VF cannot completely control the use by its licensees of each of its licensed
brands. The misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand.

RISKS APPLICABLE TO THE APPAREL INDUSTRY

VF’s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel, which is sensitive
to general economic conditions and other factors affecting consumer confidence.

The apparel industry has historically been subject to substantial cyclical variations and is
particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy. The success of VF’s operations
depends on consumer spending. Consumer spending is influenced by a number of factors, including
actual and perceived economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income (such as unemployment
and wages), business conditions, interest rates, energy prices, availability of credit and tax
rates in the international, national, regional and local markets where VF’s products are sold. Any
significant deterioration in general economic conditions, recession or increases in interest rates
could reduce the level of consumer spending and inhibit consumers’ use of credit. A significant
decline in the securities markets could materially affect consumer confidence, the financial
condition of VF’s customers, and its operating costs through higher contributions to its pension
plan. In addition, natural disasters, war, terrorist activity or the threat of war or terrorist
activity could adversely affect consumer spending and thereby have a material adverse effect on
VF’s financial condition and results of operations.



Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could increase costs and cause
delay.

Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of the fabrics or other raw materials used by
VF in its manufactured apparel could have a material adverse effect on VF’s cost of sales or its
ability to meet its customers’ demands. The prices for such fabrics depend on demand and market
prices for the raw materials used to produce them, particularly cotton. The price and availability
of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, including crop yields
and weather patterns. In the future, VF may not be able to pass all or a portion of such higher raw
materials prices on to its customers.

VF’s business is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations.

Approximately 25% of VF’s Total Revenues is derived from international markets. VF’s foreign
businesses operate in functional currencies other than the United States dollar. Assets and
liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates. In addition, VF sources and manufactures much of its products overseas. As a result, the
cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies. Changes
in currency exchange rates may also affect the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency
denominated prices at which VF’s international businesses sell products. Furthermore, VF’s
international sales and licensing revenue are derived from sales in foreign currencies. Although
VF hedges some exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising in the ordinary
course of business, foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on its
financial condition and results of operations.

VF’s ability to sell products in international markets may be affected by legal, regulatory,
political and economic risks.

VF’s ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain the current level
of operations in its existing international markets is subject to risks associated with
international operations. These include the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and
regulations, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, new tariffs or other barriers to some
international markets.

VF cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes or other similar restrictions will be imposed by
the United States, the European Union, Japan or other countries upon the import or export of its
products in the future, or what effect any of these actions would have on VF’s business, financial
condition or results of operations. Changes in regulatory, geopolitical policies and other factors
may adversely affect VF’s business or may require VF to modify its current business practices.

In addition, VF owns or leases various administrative and office space having 2,200,000 square feet
of space and owns or leases 4,700,000 square feet that are used for outlet and other retail
locations.
Approximately 79% of the outlet space is used for selling and warehousing VF’s products, with the
balance consisting of space leased to tenants and common areas. In addition to the above, VF owns
facilities having 1,000,000 square feet of space formerly used in operations but now held for sale.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, VF conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of VF’s “disclosure controls and
procedures” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934
(the “Exchange Act”) as of December 31, 2005. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that VF’s disclosure controls and procedures are
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by VF in reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Additionally, the
disclosure controls and procedures were also effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to VF’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

VF’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). VF’s management conducted an
