PART I

Item 1. Business

VF Corporation, organized in 1899, is a worldwide leader in the manufacturing and marketing of
branded apparel and related products. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the term “VF” used
herein means VF Corporation and its subsidiaries.

For over 100 years, VF has grown by offering consumers high quality, high value branded apparel and
other products . VF follows an overall strategy of identifying specific brands to market
to a specific channel of distribution. Accordingly, products and brands are sold through specialty
store, department store, chain store and discount store channels. In addition, many products are
available through VF-owned retail stores, as well as through licensees and distributors dedicated
to offering these products directly to consumers. To provide these products across this broad
distribution network, VF has implemented a strategy that combines efficient and flexible
internally-owned manufacturing with externally-owned sourcing of raw materials and finished goods.
As a result, VF satisfies the needs of millions of apparel consumers around the world.

VF’s businesses are organized into five product categories, and by brands within those product
categories, for both management and internal financial reporting purposes. These groupings of
businesses are called “coalitions” and consist of the following: Jeanswear, Outdoor Apparel and
Equipment, Intimate Apparel, Imagewear and Sportswear. These coalitions are treated as reportable
segments for financial reporting purposes. Coalition management has the responsibility to build
and develop brands within guidelines established by VF management. Corporate management at VF
headquarters oversees the operations of these individual businesses and provides them with
financial and administrative resources.

The following table summarizes VF’s primary owned and licensed brands by coalition:

products are also manufactured and marketed through a 50%-owned joint venture in Spain
and Portugal. In foreign markets where VF does not have owned operations,

Lee

Ò

and

Wrangler

Ò

jeanswear and related products are marketed through distributors, agents or
licensees.

Outdoor Apparel and Equipment Coalition

The Outdoor Apparel and Equipment Coalition is a group of outdoor-related businesses that
represent a collection of lifestyle brands. Product offerings include outerwear, sportswear,
footwear, equipment, luggage, backpacks and daypacks.

The North Face

Ò

brand of high performance outdoor apparel, equipment and footwear is
sold across the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia

.

The North Face

Ò

apparel products
consist of outerwear, snowsports gear and functional sportswear. Equipment consists of tents,
sleeping bags, backpacks, daypacks and accessories.

The North Face

Ò

products are designed
for extreme applications, such as high altitude mountaineering and ice and rock climbing, although
many consumers who purchase those products use them for less extreme activities.

The North
Face

Ò

products are marketed through specialty outdoor and premium sporting goods stores in
the United States, Canada and Europe and select department stores in the United States. In
addition, these products are sold through VF-operated full price retail and outlet stores in the
United States, as well as stores operated by licensees and distributors dedicated to selling

The
North Face

Ò

brand in Europe and Asia. These products are marketed throughout Asia by
licensees and distributors, except in Japan and South Korea where rights to the brand are owned by
a third party.

JanSport

Ò

daypacks and luggage are sold through department and sports specialty stores and
college bookstores in the United States.

JanSport

Ò

daypacks have a leading market share in
the United States.

Eastpak

Ò

and

JanSport

Ò

daypacks are sold primarily through
department and specialty stores in Europe. A technical line of

JanSport

Ò

backpacks is sold
through outdoor and sporting goods stores.

JanSport

Ò

fleece casualwear and T-shirts
imprinted with college logos are sold through college bookstores and department stores in the
United States. The

JanSport

Ò

and

Eastpak

Ò

brands are also marketed throughout Asia by
licensees and distributors. In addition, VF is planning to launch a complete

Eastpak®

branded
apparel collection in Europe in 2005.


During the second quarter of 2004, VF acquired three outdoor apparel businesses. See Note B of the
consolidated financial statements in the 2004 Annual Report for financial information related to
these acquisitions.

The most significant of these transactions was the acquisition on June 30, 2004 of Vans, Inc.
(“Vans”), a manufacturer and marketer of

Vans

® performance and casual footwear and apparel for
skateboarders and other action sports participants and enthusiasts. In its most recent fiscal year
prior to VF ownership, Vans had sales of $344 million with sales being split approximately equally
among domestic wholesale accounts, domestic retail stores and international operations. The retail
strategy of Vans includes full price retail stores and outlet stores. These retail stores carry a
wide variety of

Vans

® footwear products, along with apparel and accessory items, most of which bear
the

Vans

® brand name and logo. Vans currently operates full-price retail stores in the United
States located in a mix of mall and freestanding locations. The first flagship retail store in
Europe opened in London at the end of 2003. In addition, a prototype store concept has been
developed, which will be used to retrofit many of the existing retail stores and improve retail
sell-through. In addition to full-price retail stores, Vans operates outlet stores in the United
States, the United Kingdom, Austria, Spain and Puerto Rico.

On May 31, 2004, VF acquired the

Napapijr

i® (“Napapijri”) brand of premium casual outdoor apparel.

Napapijri

® products are primarily in the mid-to-high price range and sold in the wholesale channel,
primarily to specialty shops such as sport stores and fashion boutiques. In addition, these
products are sold in Europe through owned stores and stores operated by licensees and distributors.
Napapijri has very strong brand awareness in Italy, where the operations are based, and is also
well-known across Europe. In addition to anticipated growth in European markets, there are plans
to
develop a business in upper-tier department stores and add VF-owned retail stores in the United
States. Napapijri had sales of $76 million in its most recent fiscal year prior to VF ownership.

VF acquired

Kipling®

(“Kipling”) bags, backpacks and accessories on June 14, 2004.

Kipling®

products are sold in Europe, Asia, the United States, and South America. Products are sold through
VF-owned as well as externally-owned retail establishments. In addition to global retail
expansion, there are plans for developing a department store distribution in the United States.
Based in Belgium, Kipling had sales of $69 million in its most recent fiscal year prior to VF
ownership.

Vans, Napapijri and Kipling add lifestyle brands that have global growth potential to VF’s Outdoor
Apparel and Equipment Coalition. These brands are targeted to specific consumer groups, and their
products extend across multiple product categories. Vans and Kipling provide expertise and growth
opportunities in two new product categories for VF — footwear and women’s accessories. In
addition, the sportswear design talent at Napapijri will be utilized to launch

Nautica®

apparel in
Europe. Each of the businesses should benefit from VF’s existing systems and infrastructure, which
supports VF’s growing portfolio of international brands.

Intimate Apparel Coalition

VF markets women’s intimate apparel under the

Vanity Fair

Ò

,

Lily of
France

Ò

and

Exquisite Form

Ò

brands and the licensed

Tommy Hilfiger

Ò

brand to department and specialty stores located in the United States. Products in the Intimate
Apparel Coalition include bras, panties, daywear, shapewear and sleepwear. Women’s intimate
apparel is also marketed under the

Vassarette

Ò

and

Bestform

Ò

brands for sale to
the mass market channel of distribution. Also, VF successfully launched the

Curvation

Ô

brand
in 2003 for the full-figured woman shopping in the mass channel. VF has a significant private
label lingerie business with various speciality, national chain and discount stores in the United
States. This business strengthened in 2004 with one of its largest


customers supporting a major
new product launch.

VF acquired 51% ownership of a newly created intimate apparel marketing company in Mexico during
2004. This new company markets several of VF’s intimate apparel brands, as well as the

Ilusión

®
brand owned by the minority partner, to discount stores and department stores in Mexico. Business
operations began in the third quarter of 2004 and are managed as part of the U.S. intimate apparel
business.

In the European market, women’s intimate apparel is marketed to department and specialty stores
under the

Lou

Ò

,

Bolero

Ò

,

Gemma

Ò

,

Intima Cherry

Ò

,

Vanity
Fair

Ò

and

Belcor

Ò

brands. Intimate apparel is marketed in discount stores under the

Variance

Ò

,

Vassarette

Ò

and

Bestform

Ò

brands. In addition, VF markets
women’s swimwear under the

Majestic

Ò

and licensed

Nike

Ò

labels in Europe.

Management believes that VF is one of the top two marketers of branded intimate apparel in the
United States. In international markets, management believes that VF’s brands occupy the number
two market share positions in France and Spain.

Imagewear Coalition

VF produces workwear, career and safety apparel sold under the

Red Kap

Ò

,

Horace
Small Apparel Company

Ò

,

Penn State Textile™

and

Bulwark

Ò

brands. Over
one-half of these sales are to industrial laundries that in turn supply work clothes to employers,
primarily on a rental basis, for on-the-job wear by production, service and white-collar personnel.
Products include work pants, slacks,
work and dress shirts, overalls, jackets and smocks. Since industrial laundries maintain minimal
inventories of work clothes, a supplier’s ability to offer rapid delivery is an important factor in
this market. VF’s commitment to customer service, supported by an automated central distribution
center with satellite locations, has enabled customer orders to be filled within 24 hours of
receipt and has helped the

Red Kap

Ò

brand obtain a significant share of the industrial
laundry rental business.

VF also markets corporate image uniforms and casual apparel through its VF Solutions business unit.
To better service its national accounts, VF operates a number of catalog web sites for major
business customers and for governmental organizations such as U.S. Customs & Border Protection and
the Bureau of Land Management. These web sites give more than 400,000 employees of these customers
the convenience of shopping and paying for their work and career apparel via the internet.

This coalition includes VF’s activewear apparel businesses. VF designs and markets decorated
sports apparel under licenses granted by the four major American professional sports leagues,
NASCAR, most major colleges and universities, and other organizations. These sports apparel
products for adults and youth are distributed through department, sporting goods and athletic
specialty stores under the

Lee Sport

Ò

and the licensed

Chase Authentics

Ò

brands.
Growth in recent years has been driven by a five year agreement signed in 2002 with the National
Football League. Under this agreement, VF is the exclusive supplier for selected men’s and boy’s
tops and bottoms decorated with NFL team logos marketed to mid-tier department stores, specialty
stores and mass merchandisers. In addition, 2004 was the first year of a new five year contract
with Major League Baseball.

In early 2003 and early 2005, VF acquired two businesses that have rights to manufacture and market
apparel products under license from Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Inc.

The remaining component of this coalition is the marketing of blank knitted fleecewear and other
knit


and woven tops to wholesalers principally under the

Lee

Ò

brand.

Sportswear Coalition

In August 2003, VF acquired Nautica Enterprises, Inc. (“Nautica”). The

Nautica

® branded sportswear
business provided broad product capabilities related to a lifestyle brand and a significantly
greater presence in the department store and specialty store channels of distribution.

The principal product line for Nautica is men’s sportswear, noted for its classic styling.

Nautica
Jeans Company

Ò

brand features fashionable jeanswear and related tops for younger male
consumers. The

Nautica Competition

Ò

brand

is a line of casual apparel for active
consumers. Other product lines sold by VF under the

Nautica

Ò

brand include men’s
outerwear, underwear and sleepwear, and women’s sleepwear. The unprofitable women’s jeans business
in the department store channel was closed in 2004, but will be evaluated for a potential relaunch.
VF expects to make substantial progress toward defining its strategy and direction for the women’s
sportswear business in 2005. Plans are also underway to launch

Nautica

Ò

branded apparel in
Europe beginning in late 2005.

Nautica operates outlet stores in better outlet malls across the United States. These stores carry

Nautica

®

merchandise for men, boys and girls. Products sold in the outlet stores are
different from those sold by Nautica to its department and specialty store wholesale customers. In
addition, the stores carry

Nautica

®

merchandise from licensees to complete the desired
product assortment.

As part of the Nautica acquisition, VF acquired the

John Varvatos

Ò

,

Earl Jean

Ò

and

E.
Magrath

Ò

brand businesses. The

John Varvatos

® brand is a luxury apparel and accessory
collection for men and women including tailored clothing, sportswear, leather accessories and
footwear. These products are sold through upscale department and specialty stores, as well as
through four John Varvatos retail locations. The

Earl Jean

Ò

brand is a premium line of jeans
and sportswear marketed in the United States, Europe and Asia. This brand will be managed and
reported with the Jeanswear Coalition beginning in 2005.

E. Magrath

Ò

golf apparel is sold
through pro shops in the United States and is managed as part of the Imagewear Coalition.

Playwear Business

The Playwear business consisted primarily of VF’s

Healthtex

® childrenswear. Trademarks and certain
operating assets of this business were sold in May 2004, and retained inventories and other assets
were liquidated during the balance of the year.

Retail Operations

VF-owned retail stores are an integral part of VF’s strategy for building its brands, providing
visibility for its products and brands and enabling VF to stay close to the needs of core
consumers. In addition, outlet stores serve an important role in VF’s overall inventory management
by allowing VF to effectively sell a significant portion of discontinued and out-of-season products
at better prices than otherwise available.

VF currently operates approximately 180 full-price stores and 320 outlet stores around the world
that sell specific brands, including

The North Face®, Vans®, Napapijri®, Kipling®

,

Nautica®, Lee

®
and

Wrangler

®. Also, some of VF’s brands, including

JanSport®

,

Eastpak®

,

The North Face®, Vans®

,

Napapijri®

and

Kipling®

, are offered through over 150 independently-owned stores located primarily
in Europe and Asia.


In addition to the retail operations discussed above, VF operates approximately 100 outlet stores
across the United States and Europe that sell a broad selection of VF products. Sales and profits
of VF products sold through these outlet stores are reported as part of the operating results of
the respective coalitions.

Retail sales accounted for approximately 10% and 9% of VF’s consolidated Net Sales in 2004 and
2003, respectively. VF management expects the retail business to continue to grow and is planning
a capital investment of approximately $40 million in retail space during 2005.

In addition, VF offers other products directly to the consumer via the internet consisting of the
corporate uniform business in the Imagewear Coalition and

Van

s® products. Internet sales in 2004
were approximately 1% of VF’s consolidated Net Sales.

Licensing Arrangements

In connection with VF’s business strategy of expanding market penetration of its owned brands, VF
enters into licensing agreements for certain products and geographic regions if such arrangements
provide more effective manufacturing, distribution and marketing of such products than could be
achieved internally. These licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of VF products and are
for fixed terms that may include renewal options. In addition, certain foreign licensees are
granted the right to open retail stores under the licensed brand name and sell only licensed
branded products in these stores. Each licensee pays royalties to VF based upon its sales of
branded products, with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty. These payments generally
range from 3% to 7% of the
licensing partners’ net sales of the licensed products. In addition, licensees are generally
required to spend an amount between 1% and 5% of their sales to advertise VF’s products. In some
cases, these advertising amounts are remitted to VF for advertising on behalf of the licensees. VF
provides support to these business partners and seeks to preserve the integrity of brand names by
taking an active role in the design, quality control, advertising, marketing and distribution of
each licensed product, most of which are subject to VF’s prior approval and continuing oversight.
Net licensing income was $50 million and $29 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, with the
increase attributed to the inclusion of the Nautica licensing business for a full year in 2004.

While licensing activities exist for all coalitions, the largest component of this business,
approximately 42% of net licensing income, is in the Sportswear coalition. The

Nautica

Ò

brand is licensed in the United States for apparel categories not produced by
VF (e.g., tailored clothing, dress shirts, neckwear, accessories, women’s swimwear) and for
nonapparel categories (e.g., home furnishings, fragrances, watches, eyewear). In addition,

Nautica

Ò

apparel and certain nonapparel products are licensed for sale in over 100 countries.
Wholesale sales of

Nautica

Ò

branded products by licensees are in excess of $400 million
annually.

VF has also entered into license agreements to use the trademarks of others. Apparel is marketed
under licenses granted by the National Football League, Major League Baseball, the National
Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, NASCAR, NIKE, Inc., Tommy Hilfiger Corporation,
Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Inc. and others. Some of these license arrangements contain minimum
annual licensing and advertising requirements. Some are for a short term and may not contain
specific renewal options. Management believes that the loss of any license would not have a
material adverse effect on VF.


Raw Materials and Sourcing

Raw materials include fabrics made from cotton, synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn,
as well as thread and trim (product identification, buttons, zippers, snaps and lace). These raw
materials are purchased from numerous suppliers. While in some cases VF has obtained fixed price
commitments for up to one year, specific purchase obligations with suppliers are typically limited
to the succeeding two to six months. VF does not have any long-term supplier contracts for the
purchase of raw materials. However, in connection with the sale of VF’s childrenswear business in
2004, VF has committed to purchase $15 million of finished goods per year through 2013.

For most domestic operations, VF purchases fabric from several domestic and international suppliers
in conjunction with scheduled production. Purchased fabric is cut and sewn into finished garments
in VF-owned domestic and offshore manufacturing facilities located in Mexico and the Caribbean
Basin. In addition, VF contracts the sewing of VF-owned raw materials to independent contractors,
primarily in Mexico and the Caribbean Basin. To an increasing extent, VF is using contractors in
Asia and the Caribbean Basin who own the raw materials and provide only finished, ready-for-sale
products to VF.

Over the last five years, VF closed a significant number of manufacturing facilities in the United
States and shifted production to lower cost locations. As a result of this shift in sourcing, the
amount of sales in the United States derived from products manufactured in lower cost locations
outside the United States has increased each year over the last three years. During 2004, 3% of
the units VF sold in the United States were manufactured in VF-owned plants in the United States.
In contrast, at the end of 2000, approximately one-third of VF’s products sold in the United States
were manufactured
in VF-owned plants in the United States. Today, of the total products supporting sales to
customers in the United States, 38% were manufactured in VF-owned facilities in Mexico and the
Caribbean Basin and 59% were obtained from contractors, primarily in Asia.

The current sourcing strategy for products sold in the United States allows VF to balance its needs
with a mix of VF-owned and contracted production in the Western Hemisphere, combined with
contracted production primarily from Asia. Product obtained from the Western Hemisphere has
somewhat higher cost but gives VF greater flexibility, shorter lead times and lower inventory
levels as compared with production obtained from the Far East and other more distant resources.
This combination of VF-owned and contracted production, along with different geographic regions and
cost structures, provides a balanced approach to product sourcing. In 2005, a new sourcing hub
will be opening in Miami. This facility is expected to handle all of the sourcing for the Western
Hemisphere.

For VF’s international businesses, fabric, thread and trim are purchased from several international
suppliers. In the European jeanswear operations, fabric is cut and sewn into finished garments in
owned plants located in Malta, Poland and Turkey, with the balance sourced from independent
contractors in the Middle East, Africa and the Far East. In the international intimate apparel
businesses, fabric is sewn into finished garments in owned plants in Spain, France and Tunisia,
with the remainder manufactured by independent contractors. To obtain a more balanced sourcing
mix, European jeanswear and intimate apparel sourcing has been shifting from owned plants in
Western Europe to lower cost owned and contracted production outside of Western Europe. For the
European outdoor coalition businesses, nearly all products are sourced from contractors located in
Asia.

All contracted production must meet VF’s high quality standards. Further, all independent
contractors who manufacture products for VF must be pre-certified and adhere to the VF Contractor
Terms of Engagement. These requirements provide strict standards covering hours of work, age of


workers, health and safety conditions and conformity with local laws. Each new contractor must be
inspected and sign a Terms of Engagement agreement prior to performance of any production on VF’s
behalf. VF periodically audits compliance with these standards.

VF did not experience difficulty in obtaining its raw material and contracting production needs
during 2004. Management does not anticipate difficulties in obtaining its raw materials and
contracting production requirements during 2005. The loss of any one supplier or contractor would
not have a significant adverse effect on VF’s business.

Imports and Import Restrictions

VF is exposed to certain risks of doing business outside of the United States. VF imports goods
from VF-owned facilities in Mexico and the Caribbean Basin and from suppliers in those areas and in
Asia, Europe and Africa. These import transactions had been subject to the constraints imposed by
bilateral agreements between the United States and a number of governments. These agreements were
negotiated either under the framework established by the World Trade Organization (“WTO”) or other
applicable statutes, and they imposed quotas that limited the amount of certain categories of
merchandise from these countries that could be imported into the United States and the European
Union. Restrictions under these agreements ended on December 31, 2004.

Pursuant to a 1995 Agreement on Textiles and Clothing under the WTO, effective January 1, 2005 the
United States and other WTO member countries were required, with few exceptions, to remove quotas
on goods from WTO member countries. The complete removal of quotas would benefit VF as well as
other apparel companies by allowing them to source products without quantitative limitation
from any countries. The only significant exceptions to the removal of quota that could affect VF
are Vietnam and China. Vietnam is not a WTO member and is therefore still subject to quota on
certain products to various countries. It is possible for countries to restrict China with
safeguard quotas pursuant to the terms of China’s Accession Agreement to the WTO. The United
States is expected to use the safeguard quota mechanisms on certain products sometime during 2005.
Any of these actions could impact VF’s ability to import products but are monitored closely by our
management to evaluate the possible business impact. Any effect of the imposition of safeguards is
not expected to have a material impact on VF.

Management continually monitors new developments and risks related to duties, tariffs and quotas.
In response to the changing import environment resulting from the elimination of quotas, management
has chosen to continue its balanced approach to manufacturing and sourcing. VF limits its sourcing
exposure through, among other measures, (1) extensive geographic diversification with a mix of
VF-owned and contracted production, (2) allocation of production to merchandise categories where
the free flow of product is available and (3) shifts of production among countries and contractors.
VF will continue to manage its supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to
changes in the global production environment.

Seasonality

The apparel industry in the United States has four primary retail selling seasons — Spring,
Summer, Back-to-School and Holiday, while international markets typically have Spring and Fall
selling seasons. Sales to retail customers generally precede the retail selling seasons, although
demand peaks have been reduced as more products are being sold on a replenishment basis.

Overall, with its diversified product offerings, VF’s operating results are somewhat seasonal. On
a quarterly basis, consolidated Net Sales for 2004 ranged from a low of approximately 21% of full
year


sales in the second quarter to a high of 30% in the third quarter. This disparity results
primarily from the sales of outdoor apparel and equipment, which are more seasonal in nature.
Assuming we had owned Vans, Napapijri, and Kipling for the full year in 2004, approximately 37% of
outdoor apparel and equipment sales would have occurred in the third quarter. In addition,
consolidated Net Sales for 2004 would have ranged from a low of approximately 22% in the second
quarter to a high of 29% in the third quarter. These percentages are relatively consistent with
prior years.

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital increases during the first
half of the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and, accordingly, decreases
during the second half. Cash provided by operations is substantially higher in the second half of
the year due to higher net income and reduced working capital requirements during that period.

Advertising

VF supports its brands through extensive advertising and promotional programs. VF advertises on
national and local radio and television and in consumer and trade publications and participates in
cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in radio, television and
various print media. VF sponsors various sporting, music and other special events. In addition,
point-of-sale fixtures and signage are used to promote products at the retail level. VF spent
$314.1 million advertising and promoting its products in 2004, an increase of 21% from the 2003
level.

VF also participates in various retail customer incentive programs. These incentive programs with
retailers include stated discounts, discounts based on the retailer agreeing to advertise or
promote the products, or margin support funds. VF also offers sales incentive programs directly to
consumers in
the form of rebate and coupon offers. These sales incentive offers with retailers and with
consumers are recognized as sales discounts in arriving at reported Net Sales.

Other Matters

Competitive Factors

VF’s business depends on its ability to stimulate consumer demand for its brands and products. VF
is well-positioned to compete in the apparel industry by developing consumer-driven and innovative
products at competitive prices, producing high quality merchandise, providing high levels of
service, ensuring product availability to the retail sales floor and enhancing recognition of its
brands. VF continually strives to improve on each of these areas. Many of VF’s brands have long
histories and enjoy high recognition within their respective consumer segments.

Although VF is one of the largest apparel companies in the world, the apparel industry is highly
competitive and consists of a number of domestic and foreign companies. In most product
categories, there are numerous competing branded products, and in many product categories, there
are competing specialty retailer branded products and private label products. In certain product
categories and geographic areas in which VF operates, there may be several competitors that have
more sales and assets than VF in those specific categories or geographic areas.

Trademarks

Trademarks have substantial value in the marketing of VF’s products. VF has registered these
trademarks in the United States and with governmental agencies in other countries where VF’s
products are manufactured and/or sold. VF vigorously monitors and protects these trademarks
against infringement and dilution where legally feasible and appropriate. In addition, VF grants


licenses to other parties to manufacture and sell products with our trademarks in product
categories and in geographic areas in which VF does not operate.

Customers

VF products are primarily sold through VF’s sales force and independent sales agents. VF’s
customers are primarily department, chain, specialty and discount stores in the United States and
in international markets, primarily in Europe. Sales to VF’s ten largest customers, all of which
are retailers based in the United States, amounted to 38% of total sales in 2004, 41% in 2003 and
42% in 2002. Sales to the five largest of those customers amounted to approximately 29% of total
sales in 2004, 33% in 2003 and 34% in 2002. Sales to VF’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,
totaled 15.2% of total sales in 2004, 16.5% in 2003 and 16.2% in 2002, substantially all of which
were in the Jeanswear and Intimate Apparel coalitions.

Employees

VF employed approximately 53,200 men and women as of the end of 2004, of which 17,500 were located
in the United States. Approximately 500 employees in the United States are covered by various
collective bargaining agreements. In international markets, a significant percentage of employees
are covered by trade-sponsored or governmental bargaining arrangements. Employee relations are
considered to be good.

Backlog

The dollar amount of VF’s order backlog as of any date is not material for an understanding of the
business of VF taken as a whole.

Executive Officers of VF

The following are the executive officers of VF Corporation as of February 18, 2005. The officers
are generally elected annually and serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. There is no
family relationship among any of the VF Corporation executive officers.

completed during 2004. VF intends to repurchase 2 million shares in 2005, although the actual
number purchased during 2005 will depend on acquisition opportunities that may arise. Also, under
the Mid-Term Incentive Plan implemented under VF’s 1996 Stock Compensation Plan, VF must withhold
from the shares of Common Stock issuable in settlement of a participant’s performance-based
restricted stock units the number of shares having an aggregate fair market value equal to any

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, we conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of VF’s “disclosure controls and
procedures” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934
(the “Exchange Act”) as of January 1, 2005. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that VF’s disclosure controls and procedures are
effective to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by VF in reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Additionally,
the disclosure
controls and procedures were adequate to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to
VF’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

VF’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). VF’s management conducted an
assessment of VF’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework described in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework,

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, VF’s management has determined that VF’s internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of January 1, 2005.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of VF’s internal control over financial reporting as
of January 1, 2005 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2004
Annual Report, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 13 to this report.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in VF’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our
last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal


control over financial reporting.
