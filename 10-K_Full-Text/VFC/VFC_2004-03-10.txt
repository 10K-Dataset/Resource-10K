PART I

Item 1. Business

VF Corporation, through its operating subsidiaries, designs, manufactures and
sources and markets branded jeanswear, sportswear, intimate apparel, outdoor
apparel and equipment, occupational apparel and other apparel. VF Corporation,
organized in 1899, oversees the operations of its individual businesses,
providing them with financial and administrative resources. Unless the context
indicates otherwise, the term “VF” or “Company” used herein means VF
Corporation and its subsidiaries.

VF manages its business through over 25 consumer-focused marketing units that
support specific brands. Management of the individual marketing units has the
responsibility to build and develop their brands within guidelines established
by Company management. Marketing units with generally similar products have
been grouped together into four reportable business segments — Consumer
Apparel, Outdoor Apparel and Equipment, Occupational Apparel and All Other.

Certain financial information regarding the Company’s four reportable segments,
as well as geographic information and sales by product category, is included in
Note R of the consolidated financial statements in VF’s Annual Report to
Shareholders for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2004 (the “2003 Annual
Report”), which is incorporated herein by reference.

Consumer Apparel Segment

Jeanswear and related products

In jeanswear, as well as certain other product categories, VF follows a
strategy of identifying specific brands to market to a specific channel of
distribution. This allows certain products and brands from the Company’s
diversified portfolio to be offered to department stores, discount stores or
specialty stores. As a result, the Company satisfies the needs of millions of
different consumers who shop in various channels of distribution.

Jeanswear and related shirts and other casual products are marketed in the
United States and in many international markets. The

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

branded products are sold in nearly every developed country in the world.

In the United States, jeanswear products are marketed primarily under the

Wrangler

®

,

Lee

®

,

Rustler

®

and

Riders

®

brands. The Company also markets
jeanswear products under the

Chic

®

,

Gitano

®

and

Brittania

®

brands and offers
cotton casual pants under the

Lee Casuals

®

,

Timber Creek by Wrangler

®

and

Wrangler Khakis

®

brands.

In domestic markets,

Lee

®

branded products are sold through department stores,
national chain stores and specialty stores.

Wrangler

®

westernwear is marketed
through western specialty stores. The

Wrangler Hero

®

,

Rustler

®

and

Riders

®

brands are marketed to mass merchant and national and regional discount chains.
The

Chic

®

,

Gitano

®

and

Brittania

®

brands are offered to national and regional
discount chains. Sales for all brands are generally made directly to retailers
through full-time salespersons.

Current market share data indicates that VF has the largest combined unit
market share of the U.S. jeanswear market at approximately 20%, with the

Wrangler

®

and

Lee

®

brands having the second


and third largest unit shares of national branded jeans in the United States,
respectively.

In international markets, the Company’s largest jeanswear business is located
in Western Europe, where the Company markets

Lee

®

,

Wrangler

®

,

H.I.S

®

,

Hero by
Wrangler

®

,

Maverick

®

and

Old Axe

®

jeanswear and related products.

Lee

®

,

Wrangler

®

and

H.I.S

®

jeanswear products are sold through department stores and
specialty stores, while the

Hero by Wrangler

®

,

Maverick

®

and

Old Axe

®

brands
are sold to mass market and discount stores. Jeanswear in Europe and in most
international markets is fashion-driven and has a higher relative price than
similar products in the United States. Jeanswear products are sold to
retailers through the Company’s sales forces and independent sales agents.

VF markets the

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

brands in Canada and Mexico, and in South
America through businesses based in Chile, Brazil and Argentina. These
products are sold through department and specialty stores. The Company markets

Lee

®

products in China and launched the

Wrangler

®

brand there during 2003.
Also during 2003, VF began selling

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

jeanswear products
directly to retailers in Russia instead of through distributors.

Lee

®

brand products are also manufactured and marketed through a 50%-owned
joint venture in Spain and Portugal. In foreign markets where the Company does
not have owned operations,

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

jeanswear and related products
are marketed through distributors, agents or licensees.

Sportswear

In August 2003, VF acquired Nautica Enterprises, Inc. (Nautica) and related
rights for a total purchase price of $683.9 million. The Nautica acquisition
provides VF with (1) provides a growth platform for sportswear, a new product
category for VF, (2) provides broader product capabilities related to a
lifestyle brand and (3) a significantly greater presence in the department
store and specialty store channels of distribution. The Nautica acquisition is
expected to represent approximately $550 million of VF’s 2004 full year sales.

The

Nautica

®

brand is a leading lifestyle brand in the department and specialty
store channel of distribution. The principal product line is men’s sportswear,
noted for its classic styling.

Nautica Competition

®

is a line of casual
apparel for active consumers.

Nautica Jeans Company

®

features fashionable
jeanswear and related tops for younger male consumers. Other product lines
sold by VF under the

Nautica

®

label include men’s outerwear, underwear and
sleepwear and women’s sleepwear.

Nautica operates 115

Nautica

®

outlet stores in better outlet malls across the
United States. These stores carry a complete line of

Nautica

®

merchandise.
Products sold in the outlet stores are different from those sold by Nautica to
its department and specialty store wholesale customers. Products in the outlet
stores are merchandised specifically for the outlets and consist of core styles
and successful product offerings sold to wholesale customers in prior seasons.
In addition, the stores may carry some

Nautica

®

branded merchandise from
licensees to complete the desired product assortment. The retail stores
promote the

Nautica

®

brand name and image and are complementary to, but do not
compete with, Nautica’s wholesale customers.

An additional component of the Nautica business is licensing. The

Nautica

®

brand is licensed, primarily in the United States, for several apparel
categories not produced by the Company (e.g., tailored clothing, dress shirts,
women’s swimwear, accessories) and for several nonapparel categories


(e.g., home furnishings, furniture, eyewear, fragrances, watches). In
addition,

Nautica

®

apparel and certain nonapparel products are licensed for
sale in over 100 countries. Wholesale sales of

Nautica

®

branded products by
licensees are in excess of $400 million annually.

As part of the Nautica acquisition, VF acquired the

Earl Jean

®

, the

John
Varvatos

®

and the

E. Magrath

®

businesses.

Earl Jean

®

is a premium line of
jeans and sportswear marketed in the United States, Europe and Asia. VF is
seeking to sell the

John Varvatos

®

line which would have no effect on the
Company’s financial position or results of operations. The

E. Magrath

®

business of golf apparel sold through pro shops was absorbed into the All Other
apparel business segment.

Intimate apparel

VF markets women’s intimate apparel under the

Vanity Fair

®

,

Lily of France

®

,

Exquisite Form

®

, and the licensed

Tommy Hilfiger

®

and

Natori

®

labels to
department, chain and specialty stores located in the United States. Products
include bras, panties, daywear, shapewear and sleepwear. Women’s intimate
apparel is also marketed under the

Vassarette

®

and

Bestform

®

brands for sale to
the discount store channel of distribution. In 2003, the Company successfully
launched the

Curvation

™

brand for the full-figured woman shopping in the mass
channel of distribution. The Company also has a significant private label
lingerie business with various national chain, discount and specialty stores in
the United States. Products are sold through the Company’s sales force.

In the European market, women’s intimate apparel is marketed to department and
specialty stores under the

Lou

®

,

Bolero

®

,

Gemma

®

,

Intima Cherry

®

,

Vanity Fair

®

and

Belcor

®

brands. Intimate apparel is marketed in discount stores under the

Variance

®

,

Vassarette

®

and

Bestform

®

brands. In addition, the Company markets
women’s swimwear under the

Majestic

®

and licensed

Nike

®

labels in Europe.

Management believes that the Company is one of the top three marketers of
branded intimate apparel in the United States. In international markets,
management believes that the Company’s brands occupy the number two market
share positions in France and Spain.

Children’s playwear

Infant and children’s apparel is marketed to department and specialty stores in
the United States under the

Healthtex

®

and

Lee

®

brands and under the licensed

Nike

®

label. Management has decided to sell this business considering the
increasing presence of private label childrenswear products in department
stores and the resulting decline in sales and current operating losses of this
business unit. This business had 2003 sales of $141 million. Any effect on
VF’s financial position or operating results from the possible disposition of
this business would not be significant.

Outdoor Apparel and Equipment Segment

The Outdoor Apparel and Equipment Segment includes VF’s outdoor-related
businesses. Product offerings include outerwear, sportswear, footwear,
equipment, backpacks and daypacks.

The North Face

®

brand of high performance
outdoor apparel and equipment is sold across the United States, Canada, Europe
and Asia.

The North Face

®

apparel products consist of outerwear, snowsports
gear and functional sportswear. Equipment consists of tents, sleeping bags,
backpacks, daypacks and accessories.

The North Face

®

products are designed for
extreme applications, such as high altitude mountaineering, and ice and rock
climbing, although many consumers who purchase those products use them for less
extreme activities.

The North Face

®

brand products are marketed through
specialty


outdoor and premium sporting goods stores in the United States and Europe and
selected department stores in the United States. Products are also sold
through seven Company-operated full price retail stores in the United States,
including a new store opened in New York City in 2003. In early 2003, the
Company introduced a new subbrand,

A5

™, utilizing natural fabrics and
functional styling to be worn by The North Face core consumers as everyday
casual, lifestyle apparel.

VF markets

JanSport

®

brand daypacks and luggage sold through department and
sports specialty stores and college bookstores in the United States.

JanSport

®

daypacks have a leading market share in the United States.

JanSport

®

and

Eastpak

®

brand daypacks are sold primarily through department and specialty
stores in Europe. A more technical line of

JanSport

®

backpacks is sold through
outdoor and sporting goods stores. In addition,

JanSport

®

branded fleece
casualwear and T-shirts imprinted with college logos are sold through college
bookstores and department stores in the United States.

The

JanSport

®

and

Eastpak

®

brands are marketed throughout Asia by licensees and
distributors.

The North Face

®

brand is also marketed throughout Asia by
licensees and distributors, except in Japan and South Korea where the brand is
owned by a third party.

Occupational Apparel Segment

VF produces workwear, career and safety apparel sold under the

Red Kap

®

,

Horace
Small Apparel Company

®

,

PST

®

and

Bulwark

®

brands. Over one-half of these sales
are to industrial laundries that in turn supply work clothes to employers,
primarily on a rental basis, for on-the-job wear by production, service and
white-collar personnel. Products include work pants, slacks, work and dress
shirts, overalls, jackets and smocks. Since industrial laundries maintain
minimal inventories of work clothes, a supplier’s ability to offer rapid
delivery is an important factor in this market. The Company’s commitment to
customer service, supported by an automated central distribution center with
satellite locations, has enabled customer orders to be filled within 24 hours
of receipt and has helped the

Red Kap

® brand obtain a significant share of the
industrial laundry rental business.

VF’s business of selling workwear and career apparel to professional laundries
has been declining in recent years, led largely by workforce reductions in the
domestic manufacturing sector. This trend is expected to continue. In
addition, there has been an ongoing consolidation of the industrial laundry
industry, with many in that industry placing greater reliance on their in-house
or contract manufacturing and thereby purchasing less from suppliers such as
the Company.

To offset some of this decline, the Company also markets corporate image
uniforms and casual apparel through its VF Solutions business unit. To better
service its national accounts, the Company operates a number of catalog web
sites for major business customers such as American Airlines, Federal Express
Corporation and BellSouth Corporation and for governmental organizations such
as U.S. Customs and the Bureau of Land Management. These web sites give more
than 400,000 of their employees the convenience of shopping and paying for
their work and career apparel via the internet.

All Other Segment

The All Other segment includes VF’s activewear apparel businesses. The Company
designs and markets decorated sports apparel under licenses granted by the four
major American professional sports leagues, NASCAR, most major colleges and
universities, and other organizations. These sports apparel products for
adults and youth are distributed through department, sporting goods and
athletic specialty stores under the

Lee Sport

®

and the licensed

Chase
Authentics

®

brands. Growth in


the last two years has been driven by a five year agreement with the National
Football League. Under this agreement, VF is the exclusive supplier for
selected men’s and boy’s tops and bottoms decorated with NFL team logos under
the

NFL Red

®

brand, which is marketed to mid-tier department stores and
specialty stores.

NFL White

®

and

CSA

®

branded products are distributed through
mass merchandisers and discount stores. In early 2003, the Company acquired a
firm that markets apparel under license from Harley-Davidson Motor Company.
Certain of these trademark licensing agreements contain provisions for payment
of minimum royalties. Agreements are generally renewable for additional
periods. VF also markets blank knitted fleecewear and other knit and woven
tops to wholesalers principally under the

Lee

®

brand.

In addition to the

Nautica

®

and

The North Face

®

retail stores discussed above,
the Company operates approximately 110 retail outlet stores across the United
States and Europe that sell a broad selection of VF products. These stores
primarily sell excess quantities of first quality VF products. Retail sales
and related cost of goods sold and operating expenses of these outlet stores
are reported as part of the operating results of the respective segments.

Raw Materials and Sourcing

Raw materials include fabrics made from cotton, synthetics and blends of cotton
and synthetic yarn, as well as thread and trim (product identification,
buttons, zippers, snaps and lace). These raw materials are purchased from
numerous suppliers. While in some cases the Company has obtained fixed price
commitments for up to one year, specific purchase obligations with suppliers
are typically limited to the succeeding one to three months. VF does not have
any long-term supplier contracts for the purchase of raw materials.

For most domestic operations, VF purchases fabric from several domestic and
international suppliers against scheduled production. Purchased fabric is cut
and sewn into finished garments in domestic and offshore manufacturing
facilities located in Mexico and the Caribbean Basin. In addition, VF
contracts the sewing of Company-owned raw materials to independent contractors,
primarily in Mexico and the Caribbean Basin. To an increasing extent, VF is
using contractors in Asia and the Caribbean Basin who own the raw materials and
provide only finished products to the Company.

Over the last several years, the Company has shifted from primarily owned
plants in the United States to lower cost offshore locations to support its
domestic product needs. At the end of 2003, approximately 95% of the products
sold by VF in the United States were obtained from international locations. Of
this total, approximately 45% are manufactured in VF-owned facilities in Mexico
and the Caribbean Basin, and 50% is sourced from contractors located in Asia,
the Caribbean and Mexico.

The current sourcing strategy for products sold in the United States allows VF
to balance its needs with a mix of VF-owned and contracted production in the
Western Hemisphere, combined with contracted production primarily from Asia.
Product obtained from the Western Hemisphere has somewhat higher cost but gives
VF greater flexibility, shorter lead times and lower inventory levels as
compared with production obtained from the Far East and other more distant
resources.

For VF’s international businesses, fabric, thread and trim are purchased from
several international suppliers. In the European jeanswear operations, fabric
is cut and sewn into finished garments in owned plants located in Malta, Poland
and Turkey, with the balance sourced from independent contractors in the Middle
East, Africa and the Far East. In the international intimate apparel
businesses, fabric is sewn into finished garments in owned plants in Spain and
Tunisia, with the


remainder manufactured by independent contractors. To obtain a more balanced
sourcing mix, European jeanswear and intimate apparel sourcing has been
shifting from owned plants in Western Europe to lower cost owned and contracted
production outside of Western Europe. For the European outdoor coalition
businesses, nearly all products are sourced from contractors located in Asia.

All contracted production must meet VF’s high quality standards. Further, all
independent contractors who manufacture products for the Company must be
precertified and adhere to the VF Contractor Terms of Engagement. These
requirements provide strict standards covering hours of work, age of workers,
health and safety conditions and conformity with local laws. Each contractor
must be inspected and sign a Terms of Engagement agreement prior to performance
of any production on the Company’s behalf. VF periodically audits compliance
with these standards.

The Company did not experience difficulty in obtaining its raw material and
contracted production needs during 2003. Even though some suppliers are
operating in bankruptcy or have experienced financial difficulties, management
does not anticipate difficulties in obtaining its raw materials and
contracted production requirements during 2004. The loss of any one supplier or
contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on the Company’s
business.

Imports and Import Restrictions

VF is exposed to the risks of doing business outside of the United States in
importing goods from VF-owned facilities in Mexico and the Caribbean Basin and
from suppliers in those areas and in Asia, Europe and Africa. These import
transactions may be subject to the constraints imposed by bilateral agreements
between the United States and a number of governments. These agreements are
negotiated either under the framework established by the World Trade
Organization or other applicable statutes, and they impose quotas that limit
the amount of certain categories of merchandise that may be imported into the
United States from these countries. Textile and apparel quotas are currently
scheduled to expire as of January 1, 2005; this change may significantly
impact sourcing patterns.

Management continually monitors new developments and risks related to duties,
tariffs and quotas. In response to the changing import environment resulting
from the elimination of quotas, management has chosen to continue its balanced
approach to manufacturing and sourcing. The Company limits its sourcing
exposure through, among other measures, (1) extensive geographic
diversification with a mix of VF-owned and contracted production, (2)
allocation of production to merchandise categories where more quota is
available and (3) shifts of production among countries and contractors. VF
will continue to manage its supply chain from a global perspective and adjust
as needed to changes in the quota environment.

The United States and other countries in which VF products are manufactured may
impose new quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions. Or those countries
may alter prevailing quotas or the scheduled elimination of quota or duty or
tariff levels. Any of these actions could impact the Company’s ability to
import products at current or increased levels.

Seasonality

The apparel industry in the United States has four primary retail selling
seasons — Spring, Summer, Back-to-School and Holiday, while international
markets typically have Spring and Fall selling seasons. Sales to retail
customers generally precede the retail selling seasons, although demand peaks
have been reduced as more products are being sold on a replenishment basis.


Overall, with its diversified product offerings, VF’s operating results are not
highly seasonal. On a quarterly basis, Net Sales range from a low of
approximately 23% of full year sales in the second quarter to a high of 28% in
the third quarter. Sales of outdoor apparel and equipment are more seasonal in
nature, with approximately 36% of outdoor apparel and equipment sales occurring
in the third quarter.

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital
increases during the first half of the year as inventory builds to support peak
shipping periods and, accordingly, decreases during the second half. Cash
provided by operations is substantially higher in the second half of the year
due to higher net income and reduced working capital requirements during that
period.

Advertising

VF supports its brands through extensive advertising and promotional programs.
The Company advertises on national and local radio and television and in
consumer and trade publications and participates in cooperative advertising on
a shared cost basis with major retailers in radio, television and various print
media. The Company sponsors various sporting, music and other special events.
These include the

Wrangler

® National Finals Rodeo and the

Lee National Denim
Day

® fund-raiser for the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. In addition,
point-of-sale fixtures and signage are used to promote products at the retail
level. The Company spent $258.6 million advertising and promoting its products
in 2003, an increase of 6% from the 2002 level.

The Company also participates in various retail customer incentive and
“partnership” programs. These incentive programs with retailers include stated
discounts, discounts based on the retailer informally agreeing to advertise or
promote the products, or margin support funds. VF also offers sales incentive
programs directly to consumers in the form of rebate and coupon offers. These
sales incentive offers with retailers and with consumers are recognized as
sales discounts in arriving at reported Net Sales.

Other Matters

Competitive Factors

The apparel industry is highly competitive and consists of a number of domestic
and foreign companies. Management believes that Sara Lee Corporation is the
only U.S. competitor that has sales and assets in the apparel industry greater
than those of VF. However, in certain product categories and geographic areas
in which the Company operates, there may be several competitors that have more
sales and assets than the Company in those categories or geographic areas. In
most product categories, there are numerous competing branded products, and in
many product categories, there are competing specialty retailer branded
products and private label products.

VF competes in its product categories by developing consumer-driven and
innovative products at competitive prices, producing high quality merchandise,
providing high levels of service, ensuring product availability to the retail
sales floor and enhancing recognition of its brands. The Company continually
strives to improve upon each of these areas.

Trademarks and Licenses

Trademarks are of material importance to all of VF’s marketing efforts.
VF-owned brands are protected by registration or otherwise in the United States
and most other markets where the Company’s brands are sold. These trademark
rights are enforced and protected by litigation against


infringement as necessary.

VF has granted licenses to other parties to manufacture and sell specified
products under the Company’s trademarks in specified geographic areas. These
licenses, which typically cover product categories and geographic areas in
which the Company does not operate, extend the image of the licensed brands.
The agreements are for fixed terms and may include renewal options if sales
targets are met. The Company receives royalty payments based on specified
percentages of net sales of the licensed products. In addition, the agreements
require that the licensees spend certain minimum amounts to advertise the
licensed products. In some cases, these advertising amounts are remitted to
the Company, who places advertising on behalf of the licensees.

In some instances, VF has entered into license agreements to use the trademarks
of others. Apparel is marketed under licenses granted by the National Football
League, Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the
National Hockey League, NASCAR, NIKE, Inc., Tommy Hilfiger Corporation,
Harley-Davidson Motor Company and others. Some of these license arrangements
contain minimum annual licensing and advertising commitments. Some are for a
short term and may not contain specific renewal options. Management believes
that the loss of any license would not have a material adverse effect on the
Company.

Customers

The Company’s customers are primarily department, chain, specialty and discount
stores in the United States and in international markets, primarily in Europe.
Sales to the Company’s ten largest customers, all of which are retailers based
in the United States, amounted to 41% of total sales in 2003 and 42% in 2002
and 2001. Sales to the five largest of those customers amounted to
approximately 33% of total sales in 2003 and 34% in the prior two years. Sales
to the Company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., totaled 16.5% of
total sales in 2003, 16.2% in 2002 and 15.1% in 2001, substantially all of
which were in the Consumer Apparel segment.

Employees

VF employed approximately 52,300 men and women as
of the end of 2003, of which
17,700 were located in the United States. Approximately 700 employees in the
United States are covered by various collective bargaining agreements. In
international markets, a significant percentage of employees are covered by
trade-sponsored or governmental bargaining arrangements. Employee relations
are considered to be good.

Backlog

The dollar amount of backlog of orders as of any date is not material for an
understanding of the business of the Company taken as a whole.

Executive Officers of the Company

The following are the executive officers of VF Corporation as of February 20,
2004. The officers are generally elected annually and serve at the pleasure of
the Board of Directors. There is no family relationship among any of the VF
Corporation executive officers.

including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

There was no change in VF’s internal controls during the fiscal quarter ended
January 3, 2004 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to
materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.
