PART I

Item 1. Business

VF Corporation, through its operating subsidiaries, designs, manufactures and
markets branded jeanswear, intimate apparel, occupational apparel, knitwear,
outdoor apparel and equipment, children’s playwear and other apparel. VF
Corporation, organized in 1899, oversees the operations of its individual
businesses, providing them with financial and administrative resources. Unless
the context indicates otherwise, the term “Company” used herein means VF
Corporation and its subsidiaries.

The Company manages its business through approximately 25 consumer-focused
marketing units that support specific brands. Management of the individual
marketing units has the responsibility to build and develop their brands within
guidelines established by Company management. Marketing units with generally
similar products have been grouped together into four reportable business
segments — Consumer Apparel, Occupational Apparel, Outdoor Apparel and
Equipment, and All Other.

Certain financial information regarding the Company’s four reportable segments,
as well as geographic information and sales by product category, is included in
Note Q of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in the Company’s
Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended January 4, 2003 (“2002
Annual Report”), which is incorporated herein by reference.

Discontinued Operations and Restructuring Costs

Apparel companies are facing significant challenges. Consumers who enjoy an
increasing number of choices are demanding more value, including lower prices,
in the products they purchase. To meet the needs of retail customers and
consumers and to remain competitive, manufacturers must reduce costs in all
areas of their business.

To address this increasingly competitive environment in the apparel industry,
management approved a series of restructuring actions. These actions
aggressively attacked the Company’s cost structure and eliminated a portion of
its asset base that has been generating low returns.

In the fourth quarter of 2001, management decided to exit two business units
having total sales of approximately $300 million. Liquidation of the Private
Label knitwear business unit began in late 2001 and was substantially completed
during the third quarter of 2002. Most of the operating assets of the Jantzen
swimwear business unit were sold in March 2002, with the Company retaining
inventories, other working capital and real estate. Liquidation of the
remaining Jantzen working capital was substantially completed during the third
quarter of 2002. Because the Company has exited those businesses, the
operating results, assets, liabilities and cash flows of the businesses are
separately presented in 2002 as discontinued operations in the consolidated
financial statements, and amounts for prior periods have been similarly
reclassified. See Note B to the consolidated financial statements for further
details about the discontinued operations. Unless otherwise stated, the
remaining sections of this description of business relate to continuing
operations.

Regarding continuing operations, the Company incurred net restructuring charges
of $26 million in 2002, $114 million in 2001 and $117 million in 2000 for
approved actions. These charges related to:

•

Reduction of manufacturing capacity and continued shift in sourcing to lower cost owned capacity or to independent
contractors,

•

Consolidation of distribution functions and reduction of administrative functions, and

•

Exit of underperforming businesses.



The restructuring actions of 2000 resulted in $45 million of cost reduction
benefits during 2001. The 2001 restructuring actions resulted in cost
reductions exceeding $100 million in 2002. Incremental cost reduction benefits
exceeding $30 million related to the restructuring actions of 2001 and 2002
should be realized during 2003 and beyond. These cost reductions have been
offset, in part, by labor, insurance, pension and other employee benefit costs
during these years. In addition, the Company has reinvested a portion of the
cost savings in higher advertising focused on certain of the Company’s leading
brands. The cost reduction actions, plus the closure of underperforming
business units, have increased the Company’s overall profitability and return
on invested capital. See Note O to the consolidated financial statements in
the 2002 Annual Report for additional details of the restructuring charges
incurred.

Change in Accounting Policy

The Company adopted FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, as of the beginning of 2002. This required change in accounting policy
resulted in a noncash charge of $527.3 million, or $4.69 per share,
representing the cumulative effect of adopting the new policy. Under this
Statement, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not
amortized but instead must be tested at least annually for possible impairment.
See Note A to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.

Consumer Apparel Segment

Jeanswear and related products

In jeanswear, as well as certain other product categories, the Company follows
a strategy of marketing multiple brands in multiple channels of distribution.
This allows certain products and brands from the Company’s diversified
portfolio to be offered to department stores, discount stores or specialty
stores. As a result, the Company satisfies the needs of millions of different
consumers who shop in various channels of distribution.

Jeanswear and related shirts and other casual products are manufactured and
marketed in the United States and in many international markets. The

Lee

® and

Wrangler

® brands are sold in nearly every developed country in the world.

In the United States, jeanswear products are manufactured and marketed
primarily under the

Wrangler

®,

Lee

®,

Rustler

® and

Riders

® brands. The Company
also markets jeanswear products under the

Chic

®,

Gitano

® and

Brittania

® brands
and offers cotton casual pants and shirts under the

Lee Casuals

® and

Timber
Creek by Wrangler

® brands.

In domestic markets,

Lee

® branded products are sold through department,
national chain stores and specialty stores.

Wrangler

® westernwear is marketed
through western specialty stores. The

Wrangler Hero

®

,

Rustler

® and

Riders

®
brands are marketed to mass merchant and national and regional discount chains.
The

Chic

®,

Gitano

® and

Brittania

® brands are offered to national and regional
discount chains. Sales for all brands are generally made directly to retailers
through full-time salespersons.

According to current industry data, approximately 576 million pairs of jeans
made of denim, twill, corduroy and other fabrics were sold in the United States
in 2002, representing a slight increase over 2001 and a 3% increase over 2000.
This represents a projected market size of $11.7 billion in retail sales value
in 2002. The data also indicates that the Company has the largest combined
unit market



share at approximately 21%, up slightly from 2001, with the

Wrangler

®,

Lee

® and

Rustler

® brands having the second, third and fourth largest unit shares of
national branded jeans in the United States, respectively. This same data
indicates that approximately 36% of the jeans units are represented by private
label jeans marketed by major retailers.

In international markets, the Company’s largest jeanswear operation is located
in Western Europe, where the Company manufactures and markets

Lee

®,

Wrangler

®,

H.I.S

®,

Hero by Wrangler

®,

Maverick

® and

Old Axe

® jeanswear and related
products. In late 2000, the Company acquired 85% of the common stock of H.I.S
sportswear AG and, during 2001 and 2002, acquired the remaining minority
shares.

H.I.S

® brand jeanswear products are manufactured and marketed
primarily for women.

Lee

®,

Wrangler

® and

H.I.S

® jeanswear products are sold through department
stores and specialty stores, while the

Hero by Wrangler

®,

Maverick

® and

Old
Axe

® brands are sold to mass market and discount stores. Jeanswear in Europe
and in most international markets is fashion-driven and has a higher relative
price than similar products in the United States. Jeanswear products are sold
to retailers through the Company’s sales forces and independent sales agents.

The Company markets the

Lee

® and

Wrangler

® brands in Canada and Mexico, and in
South America through operations based in Brazil, Argentina and Chile. These
products are sold through department and specialty stores. The Company also
markets

Lee

® products in China and is preparing to launch the

Wrangler

® brand
there in 2003. In 2003, the Company will begin selling

Lee

® and

Wrangler

®
jeanswear products directly to retailers in Russia instead of through
distributors.

Lee

® brand products are also manufactured and marketed through a 50% owned
joint venture in Spain and Portugal. In foreign markets where the Company does
not have owned operations,

Lee

® and

Wrangler

® jeanswear and related products
are marketed through distributors, agents or licensees.

Intimate apparel

The Company manufactures and markets women’s intimate apparel under the

Vanity
Fair

®,

Lily of France

®,

Exquisite Form

®, and the licensed

Tommy Hilfiger

® and

Natori

® labels for sale to department, chain and specialty stores located in
the United States. Products include bras, panties, daywear, shapewear and
sleepwear. Women’s intimate apparel is also manufactured and marketed under
the

Vassarette

® and

Bestform

® brands for sale to the discount store channel of
distribution. In 2003, the Company will introduce the

Curvation

™ brand, a new
brand for the curvaceous woman that will be marketed in the mass channel of
distribution. The Company also has a significant private label lingerie
business with various national chain, discount and specialty stores in the
United States. Products are sold through the Company’s sales force. During
2002, the former Bestform business unit was integrated into the Company’s VF
Intimates business unit.

In the European market, women’s intimate apparel is manufactured and marketed
to department and specialty stores under the

Lou

®,

Bolero

®,

Gemma

®,

Intima
Cherry

®,

Vanity Fair

®,

Exquisite Form

® and

Belcor

® brands. Intimate apparel is
marketed in discount stores under the

Variance

®,

Vassarette

® and

Bestform

®
brands. In addition, the Company markets women’s swimwear under the

Majestic

®,

Tropic

®,

Bilytis

® and licensed

Nike

® labels in Europe.

Management believes that the Company is one of the top three marketers of
branded intimate apparel in the United States. In international markets,
management believes that the Company’s brands



occupy the number two market share positions in France and Spain.

Children’s playwear

Infant and children’s apparel is manufactured and marketed in the United States
under the

Healthtex

® and

Lee

® brands and under the licensed Nike and Michael
Jordan businesses. Products are sold primarily to department and specialty
stores. The

Healthtex

® brand is also offered directly to consumers over the
internet through its website, www.healthtex.com.

To strengthen its business portfolio, the Company has divested certain
underperforming and nonstrategic businesses during the last two years.
Considering the factors impacting the children’s playwear business, the Company
has decided to explore strategic options for its childrenswear business unit,
including its possible sale. This business unit had 2002 sales of $175
million. Any effect on the Company’s financial position or operating results
as a result of actions taken in conjunction with this process would not be
significant.

Occupational Apparel Segment

The Company produces workwear, career and safety apparel sold under the

Red
Kap

®,

Horace Small Apparel Company

®,

Penn State Textile

®, and

Bulwark
Protective Apparel

® labels in the United States. Over one-half of these sales
are to industrial laundries that in turn supply work clothes to employers,
primarily on a rental basis, for on-the-job wear by production, service and
white-collar personnel. Products include work pants, slacks, work and dress
shirts, overalls, jackets and smocks. Since industrial laundries maintain
minimal inventories of work clothes, a supplier’s ability to offer rapid
delivery is an important factor in this market. The Company’s commitment to
customer service, supported by an automated central distribution center with
several satellite locations, has enabled customer orders to be filled within 24
hours of receipt and has helped the

Red Kap

® brand obtain a significant share
of the industrial laundry rental business.

The Company’s business of selling workwear and career apparel to professional
laundries has been declining in recent years, led largely by workforce
reductions in the domestic manufacturing sector. This trend is expected to
continue. In addition, there has been an ongoing consolidation of the
industrial laundry industry, with many of the companies’ customers placing
greater reliance on their in-house or contract manufacturing and thereby
purchasing less from suppliers such as the Company.

To offset some of this decline, the Company also markets corporate image
uniforms and casual apparel through the VF Solutions business unit. To better
service its national accounts, the Company operates a number of catalog web
sites for major business customers such as American Airlines and Continental
Airlines and for governmental organizations such as U.S. Customs and the Bureau
of Land Management. These web sites give more than 400,000 of their employees
the convenience of shopping and paying for their work and career apparel via
the internet. During 2002, the Company entered into a contract with the newly
formed Transportation Security Administration and outfitted over 50,000 airport
security personnel during the first five months of the contract.

Outdoor Apparel and Equipment Segment

The Outdoor Apparel and Equipment Segment includes the Company’s
outdoor-related businesses represented by outerwear, equipment, backpacks and
daypacks.

The North Face

® brand of high performance outdoor apparel and
equipment is sold across the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia

.

The North
Face

® apparel products consist of outerwear, snowsports gear and functional
sportswear. Equipment consists of tents, sleeping bags, backpacks, daypacks
and accessories.

The



North Face

® products are designed for extreme applications, such as high
altitude mountaineering, and ice and rock climbing, although many consumers who
purchase those products use them for less extreme activities.

The North Face

®
brand products are marketed through specialty outdoor and premium sporting
goods stores in the United States and Europe and selected department stores in
the United States. Products are also sold through six Company-operated full
price retail stores in the United States, with a new store in New York City to
open in 2003. In early 2003, the Company introduced a new subbrand,

A5

™,
utilizing natural fabrics and functional styling to be worn by The North Face
core consumers as everyday casual, lifestyle apparel.

The Company manufactures and markets

JanSport

® brand daypacks sold through
department and sports specialty stores and college bookstores in the United
States and through department and specialty stores in Europe and Asia.

JanSport

® daypacks and bookbags have a leading market share in the United
States. The

Eastpak

® brand is sold primarily through sports, other specialty
and mass market stores in the United States and through department and
specialty stores in Europe. A more technical line of

JanSport

® backpacks is
sold through outdoor and sporting goods stores. In addition,

JanSport

® branded
fleece casualwear and T-shirts imprinted with college logos are sold through
college bookstores in the United States.

The

JanSport

® and

Eastpak

® brands are marketed throughout Asia by licensees and
distributors.

The North Face

® brand is also marketed throughout Asia by
licensees and distributors, except in Japan and South Korea where the brand is
owned by a third party.

All Other Segment

The All Other segment includes the Company’s knitwear apparel businesses. The
Company designs, manufactures and markets imprinted sports apparel under
licenses granted by the four major American professional sports leagues, NASCAR
and other organizations. These sports apparel products for adults and youth
are distributed through department, sporting goods and athletic specialty
stores under the

Lee Sport

® and the licensed

Chase Authentics

® brands. In late
2001, the Company entered into a five year agreement with the National Football
League to become the exclusive supplier for selected men’s and boy’s tops and
bottoms decorated with NFL team logos under the

NFL Red

® brand, which is
marketed to mid-tier department stores and specialty stores.

NFL White

® and

CSA

® branded products are distributed through mass merchandisers and discount
stores. In early 2003, the Company acquired a small company that manufactures
and markets apparel under license from Harley-Davidson Motor Company. Certain
of these trademark licensing agreements contain provisions for payment of
minimum royalties on anticipated sales of those products in future periods.
The Company also markets blank knitted fleecewear and other knit and woven tops
under the

Lee

® brand primarily to wholesalers.

The Company operates approximately 90 retail outlet stores across the United
States and Europe that sell a broad selection of the Company’s products. These
stores primarily sell excess quantities of first quality products. Retail
sales and related costs of these outlet stores are reported as part of the
operating results of the respective segments.

Raw Materials and Production

Raw materials include fabrics made from cotton, synthetics and blends of cotton
and synthetic yarn, as well as thread and trim (product identification,
buttons, zippers, snaps and lace). These raw materials are purchased from
numerous suppliers. While in some cases the Company has obtained fixed price
commitments for up to one year, specific purchase obligations with suppliers
are typically limited to the succeeding one to three months. The Company does
not have any long-term supplier



contracts for the purchase of raw materials.

For most domestic operations, the Company purchases fabric from several
domestic and international suppliers against scheduled production. Purchased
fabric is cut and sewn into finished garments in domestic and offshore
manufacturing facilities located in Mexico and the Caribbean Basin. In
addition, the Company contracts the sewing of Company-owned raw materials to
independent contractors, primarily in Mexico and the Caribbean Basin. To an
increasing extent, the Company is using contractors in Asia and the Caribbean
Basin who own the raw materials and provide only finished products to the
Company.

Over the last several years, the Company has shifted from primarily owned
plants in the United States to lower cost offshore locations to
support its
domestic product needs. The current offshore sourcing mix allows the Company
to balance its needs with production from Mexico and the Caribbean Basin
(shorter lead times) and production from the Far East (longer lead times but at
a lower cost). During 2002, approximately 85% of the products sold by the
Company in the United States were obtained from international locations. Once
the 2002 restructuring actions have been completed, less than 10% of the
Company’s United States sales will be obtained from products manufactured in
the Company’s domestic plants. Of the remainder, approximately one-half will
be manufactured in the Company’s facilities in Mexico and the Caribbean Basin,
and one-half manufactured by contractors primarily in Mexico, the Caribbean
Basin and Asia.

All contracted production must meet the Company’s high quality standards.
Further, all independent contractors who manufacture products for the Company
must be precertified and adhere to the VF Contractor Terms of Engagement.
These requirements provide strict standards covering hours of work, age of
workers, health and safety conditions, and conformity with local laws. Each
contractor must be inspected and sign a copy of the Terms of Engagement prior
to performance of any production on the Company’s behalf. The Company
periodically audits compliance with application of those standards.

For the Company’s international businesses, fabric, thread and trim are
purchased from several international suppliers. In the European jeanswear
operations, fabric is cut and sewn into finished garments in owned plants
located in Malta, Poland and Turkey, with the balance (mostly tops) sourced
from independent contractors in the Middle East, Africa and the Far East. In
the international intimate apparel businesses, fabric is sewn into finished
garments in owned plants in Spain, France and Tunisia, with the remainder
manufactured by independent contractors. To obtain a more balanced sourcing
mix, European jeanswear and intimate apparel sourcing has been shifting from
owned plants in Western Europe to lower cost owned and contracted production
outside of Western Europe. For the European outdoor coalition businesses,
nearly all products are sourced from contractors located in Asia.

The Company did not experience difficulty in obtaining its raw material and
contracted production needs during 2002. Even though some suppliers are
operating in bankruptcy or have experienced financial difficulties, management
does not anticipate difficulties in obtaining its raw materials and contracted
production requirements during 2003. The loss of any one supplier or contractor
would not have a significant adverse effect on the Company’s business.

Seasonality

The apparel industry in the United States has four primary retail selling
seasons — Spring, Summer, Back-to-School and Holiday, while international
markets typically have Spring and Fall selling seasons. Sales to retail
customers generally precede the retail selling seasons, although demand



peaks have been reduced in recent years as more products are being sold on a
replenishment basis.

Overall, with its diversified product offerings, the Company’s operating
results are not highly seasonal. On a quarterly basis, consolidated net sales
range from a low of approximately 22% of full year sales to a high of 27% in
the third quarter. Sales of outdoor clothing and equipment are more seasonal
in nature, with approximately 35% of outdoor apparel and equipment sales
occurring in the third quarter.

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital
increases during the first half of the year as inventory builds to support peak
shipping periods and, accordingly, decreases during the second half. Cash
provided by operations is substantially higher in the second half of the year
due to higher net income and reduced working capital requirements during that
period.

Advertising

The Company supports its brands through extensive advertising and promotional
programs. The Company advertises on national and local radio and television
and in consumer and trade publications and participates in cooperative
advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in radio, television
and various print media. The Company sponsors various sporting, music and
other special events. These include the

Wrangler

® National Finals Rodeo and
the

Lee National Denim Day

® fund-raiser for the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer
Foundation. In addition, point-of-sale fixtures and signage are used to
promote products at the retail level. The Company spent $245 million
advertising and promoting its products in 2002, an increase of 11% from the
2001 level. The Company also participates in various retail customer incentive
and partnership programs, which are recognized as sales discounts in arriving
at reported net sales.

Other Matters

Competitive Factors

The apparel industry is highly competitive and consists of a number of domestic
and foreign companies. Management believes that there is only one competitor
in the United States, Sara Lee Corporation, that has sales and assets in the
apparel industry greater than those of the Company. However, in certain
product categories and geographic areas in which the Company operates, there
are several competitors that have more sales and assets than the Company in
those categories or geographic areas. In most product categories, there are
numerous competing branded products, and in many product categories, there are
competing specialty retailer branded products and private label products.

The Company competes in its product categories by developing consumer-driven
and innovative products at competitive prices, producing high quality
merchandise, providing high levels of service, ensuring product availability to
the retail sales floor, and enhancing recognition of its brands. The Company
continually strives to improve upon each of these areas.

Trademarks and Licenses

Trademarks are of material importance to all of the Company’s marketing
efforts. Company-owned brands are protected by registration or otherwise in
the United States and most other markets where the Company’s brands are sold.
These trademark rights are enforced and protected by litigation against
infringement as necessary. The Company has granted licenses to other parties
to manufacture and sell products under the Company’s trademarks in product
categories and in geographic areas in



which the Company does not operate.

In some instances, the Company enters into license agreements to use the
trademarks of others. Apparel is manufactured and marketed under licenses
granted by Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the
National Football League, the National Hockey League, NASCAR, NIKE, Inc., Tommy
Hilfiger Corporation and others. Some of these license arrangements contain
minimum annual licensing and advertising commitments. Some are for a short
term and may not contain specific renewal options. Management believes that
the loss of any license would not have a material adverse effect on the
Company.

Customers

The Company’s customers are primarily department, chain, specialty and discount
stores in the United States and in international markets, primarily in Europe.
Sales to the Company’s ten largest customers, all of which are based in the
United States, amounted to 42% of total sales in 2002 and 2001 and 40% in 2000.
In each of the three years, sales to the five largest of those customers
amounted to approximately 34% of total sales. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
totaled 16.2% of total sales in 2002, 15.1% in 2001 and 14.8% in 2000,
substantially all of which were in the Consumer Apparel segment.

Employees

The Company employed approximately 56,000 men and women as of the end of 2002,
of which 20,000 were located in the United States. However, approximately
3,800 of those United States employees have been notified that their employment
is being terminated as part of the restructuring actions approved by management
near the end of 2002. Approximately 1,200 employees in the United States are
covered by various collective bargaining agreements. In international markets,
a significant percentage of employees are covered by trade-sponsored or
governmental bargaining arrangements. Employee relations are considered to be
good.

Backlog

The dollar amount of backlog of orders as of any date is not material for an
understanding of the business of the Company taken as a whole.

Cautionary Statement on Forward-looking Statements

Information concerning forward-looking statements, as reported under the
caption “Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements” in the 2002 Annual
Report, is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 2. Properties.

The Company owns most of its facilities used in manufacturing and distribution
activities. Certain other facilities are leased under operating leases that
generally contain renewal options. Management believes all facilities and
machinery and equipment are in good condition and are suitable for the
Company’s needs. Manufacturing and distribution facilities being utilized at
the end of 2002 are summarized below by reportable segment:



Square

Footage

Consumer Apparel

12,300,000

Occupational Apparel

1,200,000

Outdoor Apparel and Equipment

700,000

All Other

1,400,000

15,600,000

In addition, the Company also owns or leases various administrative and office
space having 2,000,000 square feet of space and owns or leases 3,400,000 square
feet that are used for outlet and other retail locations. Approximately 76% of
the factory outlet space is used for selling and warehousing the Company’s
products, with the balance consisting of space leased to tenants and common
areas. As part of the Strategic Repositioning Program and the resulting
facility closures, the Company will reduce its total owned space listed above
by 600,000 square feet, and such properties will be held for sale.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

There are no pending material legal proceedings, other than ordinary, routine
litigation incidental to the business, to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or to which any of their property is the subject.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

Not applicable.

Item 4A. Executive Officers of the Company.

The following are the executive officers of VF Corporation as of March 4, 2003.
The term of office of each of the executive officers continues to the next
annual meeting of the Board of Directors to be held April 22, 2003. There is
no family relationship among any of the VF Corporation executive officers.
