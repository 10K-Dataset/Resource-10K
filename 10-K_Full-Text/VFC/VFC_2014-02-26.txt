PART I

Item 1.

Business.

V.F.
Corporation, organized in 1899, is a worldwide leader in the manufacturing and distribution of branded lifestyle apparel, footwear and related products. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “VF,” “we,” “us”
and “our” used herein refer to V.F. Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Our vision
is to grow by building leading lifestyle brands that excite consumers around the world. Lifestyle brands enable us to forge close connections with consumers through inspirational and performance-based products that enhance their specific activities,
areas of interest and ability to express their own individualism. Our largest lifestyle brands are

The North Face

7 For All Mankind

®

and

. We continue to invest in all of our businesses through geographic expansion, product innovation, consumer research, marketing and our direct-to-consumer infrastructure,
including retail store openings, e-commerce and omni-channel retailing.

VF is highly diversified — across brands,
product categories, channels of distribution, geographies and consumer demographics. We own a broad portfolio of brands in the outerwear, footwear, jeanswear, backpacks, luggage, sportswear, occupational and performance apparel categories. These
products are marketed to consumers shopping in specialty stores, upscale and traditional department stores, national chains, mass merchants and our own direct-to-consumer operations. Revenues from our direct-to-consumer business, which includes
VF-operated stores and e-commerce sites, represented 22% of total VF revenues in 2013. VF derived 38% of its 2013 revenues from outside the U.S., primarily in Europe, Asia, Canada, Latin America and Mexico. Many of our brands sell products in
countries through licensees, distributors and independently-operated partnership stores. To provide diversified products across multiple channels of distribution in different geographic areas, we balance efficient and flexible owned manufacturing
with sourcing of finished goods from independent contractors. We utilize state-of-the-art technologies for inventory replenishment that enable us to effectively and efficiently get the right assortment of products that match consumer demand.

For both management and internal financial reporting purposes, VF is organized by groupings of businesses called
“coalitions” that consist of the following: Outdoor & Action Sports, Jeanswear, Imagewear, Sportswear and Contemporary Brands. These coalitions are our reportable segments for financial reporting purposes. Coalition management has
the responsibility to build and operate their brands, with certain financial, administrative and systems support and disciplines provided by central functions within VF.

Our lifestyle business is represented by brands included in the Outdoor & Action Sports, Sportswear and Contemporary Brands Coalitions, which have the greatest potential in our portfolio to
achieve higher long-term revenue, profit growth and profit margins compared to our other businesses. VF’s Jeanswear and Imagewear Coalitions have demonstrated historically strong levels of profitability and cash flow but lower revenue growth
rates.



The following table summarizes VF’s primary owned and licensed brands by coalition:

Financial information regarding VF’s coalitions is included in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, which are included at Item 8 of this report.

We expect continued long-term growth in our Outdoor & Action
Sports Coalition as we focus on product innovation, extend our brands into new product categories, open additional stores, expand geographically and acquire additional lifestyle brands.

Jeanswear Coalition

Our Jeanswear Coalition markets
jeanswear and related casual products in the U.S. and in many international markets. The largest of these brands, the

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

brands, have long-standing traditions as authentic American jeans brands as they were established in 1889 and 1947, respectively, and have strong market
positions.

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

products are sold in nearly
every developed country through a combination of wholesale accounts, VF-operated stores, independently-operated partnership stores and online through our brands’ websites. Products also include shorts, casual pants, knit and woven tops and
outerwear, which are designed to complement the jeanswear products and extend our brands. We also market jeanswear and related casual products under the

Lee
Casuals

®

and

Timber Creek by Wrangler

®

brands.

In the U.S.
market,

Lee

®

branded products are sold primarily through mid-tier department stores and specialty stores.

Wrangler

®

westernwear is marketed primarily through western specialty stores. The

Wrangler

®

,

Rustler

®

and

Riders

®

by Lee

®

brands are marketed to mass merchant and regional discount stores. Additionally, we own the

Rock & Republic

®

brand, and we have an exclusive wholesale distribution and licensing arrangement with Kohl’s Corporation that covers all

Rock & Republic

®

apparel, accessories, and other merchandise in the U.S.

Our world-class supply chain, including owned manufacturing facilities along with advanced vendor-managed inventory and retail floor space management programs with many of our major retailer customers,
gives us a competitive advantage in our jeanswear business. We receive point-of-sale information from these customers on a daily or weekly basis, at an individual store and style-size-color stock keeping unit (“SKU”) level. We then ship
products based on that customer data to ensure their selling floors are appropriately stocked with products that match their shoppers’ needs. Our system capabilities allow us to analyze our retail customers’ sales, demographic and
geographic data to develop product assortment recommendations that maximize the productivity of their jeanswear selling space and optimize their inventory investment.

Jeanswear in most international markets is more fashion-oriented and has a higher selling price than similar products in the U.S. The international jeans market is also more fragmented than the U.S.
market, with competitors ranging from global brands to a number of smaller brands marketed in a specific country or region.



VF’s largest international jeanswear businesses are located in
Europe and Asia, where

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

jeanswear products are sold through
department stores and specialty stores. We also market

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

products to mass market, department and specialty stores in Canada and Mexico, as well as to department stores and specialty stores in Asia and South America. In key international markets, we are expanding our reach through VF-operated stores, which
are an important vehicle for presenting our brands’ image and marketing message directly to consumers. We currently have more than 65 VF-operated stores primarily located in South America, Europe and Asia and are continuing to expand our
jeanswear brands in emerging markets. In foreign markets where VF does not have owned operations,

Lee

®

and

Wrangler

®

products are marketed through distributors, agents, licensees and over 800 independently operated single brand or multi-brand partnership stores.

In the U.S., we intend to drive growth in the mass market and western specialty businesses through superior consumer insight and
marketing strategies and continuous product innovation. Internationally, growth will be driven by expansion of our existing businesses in Asia and key European markets.

Imagewear Coalition

Our Imagewear Coalition consists of the Image business
(occupational apparel and uniforms) and Licensed Sports business (owned and licensed athletic apparel). The Image and Licensed Sports businesses represent approximately 55% and 45%, respectively, of total coalition revenues.

The Image business provides uniforms and career occupational apparel for workers in North America and
internationally, under the

Red Kap

®

brand (a premium workwear brand with 90 years of history), the

Bulwark

®

brand (flame resistant and protective apparel primarily for the petrochemical, utility and mining industries) and the

Horace Small

®

brand (apparel for law enforcement and public safety personnel with over 60 years of history). Products include a wide range of functionally designed shirts, pants,
coveralls and outerwear. Image revenues are significantly correlated with the overall level of manufacturing and oil and gas industry employment in the U.S.

Approximately 70% of Image revenues are from industrial laundries, resellers and distributors that in turn supply
customized workwear to employers for production, service and white-collar personnel. Since industrial laundries and distributors maintain minimal inventories of work clothes, VF’s ability to offer rapid delivery of products in a broad range of
sizes is an important advantage in this market. Our commitment to customer service, supported by an automated central distribution center with several satellite locations, enables customer orders to be filled within 24 hours of receipt and has
helped the

Red Kap

®

and

Bulwark

®

brands obtain a significant share of uniform
apparel sold to industrial laundries, resellers and distributors.

The Image business also develops and manages uniform
programs through custom-designed websites for major business customers and governmental organizations. These websites provide the employees of our customers with the convenience of shopping for their work and career apparel via the Internet.

In the Licensed Sports business, we design and market sports apparel and fanwear under licenses granted
by major U.S.-based sports leagues, individual athletes and related organizations, including Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the MLB Players Association, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League and
selected major colleges and universities. In addition, the Licensed Sports division is a major supplier of licensed

Harley-Davidson

®

apparel to
Harley-Davidson dealerships.

Under license from Major League Baseball, the

Majestic

®

brand is the official on-field uniform of all 30 major league
teams.

Majestic

®

brand adult and youth-size authentic, replica jerseys and fanwear are sold through sporting goods and athletic specialty stores,
department stores and major league stadiums. Sports apparel and fanwear marketed under other licensed labels are distributed through department, mass market, sporting goods and athletic specialty stores and e-commerce partners. Our quick response
capabilities allow us to deliver products to retailers within hours following major sporting events such as the Super Bowl, the World Series and conference or division playoff championships.



The opportunities to grow Imagewear Coalition revenues include
(i) extension of product and service capabilities to new industrial and service apparel distribution channels, markets, and geographies, (ii) expansion of Image’s traditional business-to-business workwear brands into consumer
channels, (iii) growth of the

Majestic

®

brand for Major League Baseball as well as our licensed National Football League business, (iv) market
share gains in key licensed categories such as women’s sports apparel, (v) expansion of our college and university fanwear program, and (vi) expansion of our on-field licensed model and fanwear expertise to new geographies.

Sportswear Coalition

The Sportswear Coalition consists of the

Nautica

®

and

Kipling

®

brand businesses in North America (the

Kipling

®

brand outside of North America is
managed by the Outdoor & Action Sports Coalition).

Nautica

®

brand men’s sportswear is marketed through department stores, specialty stores, VF-operated outlet stores and at www.nautica.com. The

Nautica

®

brand is one of the leading men’s sportswear collection brands in department stores in the U.S.

Nautica

®

women’s sportswear is sold in the U.S. in department stores, at most

Nautica

®

outlet stores and at www.nautica.com. Other

Nautica

®

product lines include men’s outerwear, underwear and swimwear and men’s and women’s
sleepwear. We operate over 85

Nautica

®

brand outlet stores in premium and better outlet centers across the U.S.

The

Nautica

®

brand
is licensed to independent parties in the U.S. for apparel categories not produced by VF (e.g., tailored clothing, dress shirts, neckwear, women’s swimwear and outerwear, children’s clothing) and for non-apparel categories (e.g.,
accessories, fragrances, watches, eyewear, footwear, luggage, bed and bath products, furniture).

Nautica

®

products are licensed for sale in over 50
countries outside the U.S. In addition, independent licensees operate over 300

Nautica

®

brand stores across the world, most of which are full-price
stores in Asia, North and South America and the Middle East.

The Sportswear Coalition also includes
the

Kipling

®

business in North America whose products
include

Kipling

®

brand handbags, luggage, backpacks, totes and accessories.

Kipling

®

products are sold in the U.S. through department, specialty and luggage stores, at over 25 VF-operated full price and outlet stores and at www.kipling.com, and in
Canada through specialty and department stores. In the U.S., the

Kipling

®

brand has seen significant growth in 2013, driven by new stores, comparable
store growth and increased distribution.

We believe there is the potential to grow

Nautica

®

brand revenue and improve profit performance through the growth of core Nautica sportswear products, increased
average selling prices, improved product assortments and an enhanced customer experience at

Nautica

®

brand outlet stores, growth in the brand’s
online business and expansion of the licensed business, both domestically and internationally. There is also the potential for expanding
the

Kipling

®

brand through our handbag and accessories relationship with Macy’s, Inc., e-commerce, the travel-related retail distribution channel
and additional VF-operated stores.

Contemporary Brands Coalition

Our Contemporary Brands Coalition is focused on premium upscale lifestyle brands, and includes the

7 For All
Mankind

®

,

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

brands.

7 For
All Mankind

®

is a Los Angeles-based brand of premium denim jeans and related products for women and men. While the core business remains focused on denim, the
collection also includes sportswear products, such as knit and woven tops, sweaters, jackets and accessories.

7 For All Mankind

®

is a leading premium jeans
brand in the U.S., where it generates more than 60% of its sales, and is marketed through premium department stores, specialty stores and VF-operated stores. International sales are through department stores, specialty stores, VF-operated stores and
over 60 independently-operated partnership stores, the majority of which are in Europe and Asia. The

7 For All Mankind

®

brand has approximately 75
VF-operated stores in the U.S., Europe and Canada. Products are also sold online at www.7forallmankind.com.



The

Splendid

®

brand offers premium tops and casual apparel for women, men and children, and the

Ella Moss

®

brand offers premium sportswear for women and girls. These brands, noted for their soft wearable fabrics and vibrant colors, are marketed to upscale department and
specialty stores primarily in the U.S. They are also sold through approximately 30 VF-operated

Splendid

®

brand stores and two

Ella Moss

®

brand stores, and at www.splendid.com and www.ellamoss.com.

We believe the

7 For All Mankind

®

,

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

brands can grow their revenues
through new stores, e-commerce, new product offerings, licensing arrangements and in the wholesale channel. We are also focusing on international growth opportunities, primarily through VF-operated and partnership stores in Europe, Asia and South
America.

Direct-To-Consumer Operations

Our direct-to-consumer business includes full-price stores, outlet stores and e-commerce. Direct-to-consumer revenues accounted for 22% of VF’s consolidated total revenues in 2013, compared with 21%
in 2012.

Our full price stores allow us to showcase a brand’s full line of products with fixtures and imagery that
support the brand’s positioning and promise to consumers. These stores provide high visibility for our brands and products and enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of our consumers. The proper presentation of products in our
stores, particularly in our showcase stores, also helps to increase sell-through of VF products at our wholesale customers. VF-operated full price stores generally provide margins and return on investment that are well above VF averages. In
addition, VF operates outlet stores in both premium outlet malls and more traditional value-based locations. These outlet stores serve an important role in our overall inventory management and profitability by allowing VF to sell a significant
portion of excess, discontinued and out-of-season products at better prices than are otherwise available from outside parties, while maintaining the integrity of our brands.

Our growing global retail operations include 1,246 stores at the end of 2013. Of that total, there are 1,166 single
brand stores (i.e., primarily one brand’s product offerings in each store) that sell

stores in the U.S. that sell a broad selection of excess quantities of VF-branded products, as well as women’s intimate apparel, children’s wear, other
apparel and accessories. Approximately 70% of VF-operated stores offer products at full price, and the remainder are outlet locations. Approximately 60% of our stores are located in the U.S. and the remaining 40% are located in Europe, Asia, Latin
America, Mexico and Canada.

E-commerce is our fastest growing direct-to-consumer channel and represents
approximately 13% of our direct-to-consumer business. We currently market

and other brands internationally. We are continuing to expand our e-commerce initiatives by rolling out additional brand sites in Europe and Asia, and
enhancing each brand’s site to deliver a superior consumer experience.

We expect our
direct-to-consumer business to continue to grow at a faster pace than VF’s overall growth rate as we continue to drive comparable store sales, open new stores and expand our e-commerce presence. We opened 164 stores during 2013 and we are
planning to open approximately 150 additional locations in 2014, concentrated in the brands where we see higher retail growth potential

In addition to our direct-to-consumer operations, our licensees, distributors and other independent parties own and operate
over 3,000 partnership stores. These are primarily monobrand stores selling VF-branded



products, and have the appearance of VF-operated stores. Most of these partnership stores are located in Europe and Asia, and are concentrated in

Licensing Arrangements

As part of our business strategy of expanding market penetration of VF-owned brands, we enter into licensing agreements for specific
apparel and complementary product categories when such arrangements with independent parties provide more effective manufacturing, distribution and marketing of such products than could be achieved internally. We provide support to these business
partners and ensure the integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design, quality control, advertising, marketing and distribution of licensed products.

Licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of VF brands. License agreements are for fixed terms of generally
three to five years, with conditional renewal options. Each licensee pays royalties to VF based on its sales of licensed products, with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement. Royalties generally range from 4% to 10% of the
licensing partners’ net licensed products sales. Royalty income was $117.3 million in 2013 (1% of total revenues), primarily from the

Nautica

®

,

Vans

®

,

Timberland

®

, Lee

®,

and

Wrangler

®

brands. In addition, licensees of our brands are
generally required to spend from 1% to 5% of their net licensed product sales to advertise VF’s products. In some cases, these advertising amounts are remitted to VF for advertising on behalf of the licensees.

VF has also entered into license agreements to use trademarks owned by third parties. We market apparel under licenses granted by Major
League Baseball, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Inc., major colleges and universities, and individual athletes and related organizations, most of which
contain minimum annual royalty and advertising requirements.

Manufacturing, Sourcing and Distribution

Product design and innovation, including fit, fabric, finish and quality, are important elements across all of our businesses. These
functions are performed by employees located in our global supply chain organization and our branded business units across the globe.

VF’s centralized global supply chain organization is responsible for sourcing and delivering products to our customers. VF is highly skilled in managing the complexities associated with our global
supply chain. On an annual basis, VF sources or produces approximately 500 million units spread across 35 brands. VF operates 28 manufacturing facilities and utilizes approximately 1,800 contractor manufacturing facilities in 60 countries. We
operate 29 distribution centers and 1,246 retail stores. Managing this complexity is made possible by the use of a network of information systems for product development, forecasting, order management and warehouse management, attached to our core
enterprise resource management platforms.

In 2013, 27% of our units were manufactured in VF-operated facilities and 73% were
obtained from independent contractors, primarily in Asia. Products manufactured in VF facilities generally have a lower cost and shorter lead times than contracted production. Products obtained from contractors in the Western Hemisphere generally
have a higher cost than products obtained from contractors in Asia. However, contracting in the Western Hemisphere gives us greater flexibility, shorter lead times and allows for lower inventory levels. This combination of VF-owned and contracted
production, along with different geographic regions and cost structures, provides a well-balanced approach to product sourcing. We will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global
production environment.



VF operates manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Mexico, Central and South America, the
Caribbean, Europe and the Middle East. A significant percentage of denim bottoms and occupational apparel are manufactured in these plants, as well as a smaller percentage of footwear. For these owned production facilities, we purchase raw materials
from numerous domestic and international suppliers to meet our production needs. Raw materials include products made from cotton, leather, rubber, wool, synthetics and blends of cotton and synthetic yarn, as well as thread and trim (product
identification, buttons, zippers, snaps, eyelets and laces). In some instances, we contract the sewing of VF-owned raw materials into finished product with independent contractors. Manufacturing in the U.S. includes all Major League Baseball
uniforms, along with screen printing and embroidery of jerseys, T-shirts and fleece products. Fixed price commitments for fabric and certain supplies are generally set on a quarterly basis for the next quarter’s purchases. No single supplier
represents more than 5% of our total cost of sales.

Independent contractors generally own the raw materials and ship finished
ready-for-sale products to VF. These contractors are engaged through VF sourcing hubs in Hong Kong (with satellite offices across Asia) and Panama. These hubs are responsible for coordinating the manufacturing and procurement of product, supplier
management, product quality assurance, and transportation and shipping functions in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, respectively. Substantially all products in the Outdoor & Action Sports and Sportswear Coalitions, as well as a portion
of products for our Jeanswear and Imagewear Coalitions, are obtained through these sourcing hubs. For most products in our Contemporary Brands Coalition, we contract the sewing and finishing of VF-owned raw materials through a network of independent
contractors based in the U.S.

Management continually monitors political risks and developments related to duties, tariffs and
quotas. We limit VF’s sourcing exposure through, among other measures, (i) diversifying geographies with a mix of VF-operated and contracted production, (ii) shifting of production among countries and contractors, (iii) sourcing
production to merchandise categories where product is readily available and (iv) sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements. VF does not directly or indirectly source products from suppliers in countries identified
by the State Department as state sponsors of terrorism and subject to U.S. economic sanctions and export controls.

All
VF-operated production facilities throughout the world, as well as all independent contractor facilities that manufacture VF-branded products, must comply with VF’s Global Compliance Principles. These principles, established in 1997 and
consistent with international labor standards, are a set of strict standards covering legal and ethical business practices, workers’ ages, work hours, health and safety conditions, environmental standards and compliance with local laws and
regulations. In addition, our owned factories must also undergo certification by the independent, nonprofit organization, Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (“WRAP”), which promotes global ethics in manufacturing. VF, through its
contractor monitoring program, audits the activities of the independent businesses and contractors that produce VF-branded goods at locations across the globe. Each of the approximately 1,800 independent contractor facilities, including those
serving our independent licensees, must be pre-certified before producing any VF products. This precertification includes passing a factory inspection and signing a VF Terms of Engagement agreement. We maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure
compliance with these requirements by using dedicated internal staff and externally contracted firms. Additional information about VF’s Code of Business Conduct, Global Compliance Principles, Terms of Engagement, Factory Compliance Guidelines,
Factory Audit Procedure and Environmental Compliance Guidelines, along with a Global Compliance Report, is available on the VF website at www.vfc.com.

VF did not experience difficulty in filling its raw material and contracting production needs during 2013 and does not anticipate any difficulty in 2014. We believe that we will be able to remain cost
competitive in 2014 due to our scale and significance to our suppliers. Absent any material changes, VF believes it would be able to largely offset any increases in product costs through: (i) the continuing shift in the mix of its business to
higher margin brands, geographies and channels of distribution; (ii) increases in the prices of its products; and (iii) cost reduction opportunities. The loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on
our business.



Product is shipped from our independent suppliers and VF-operated manufacturing facilities
to distribution centers in the U.S. and international locations. In some instances, product is shipped directly to our customers. Most distribution centers are operated by VF, and some support more than one brand. A portion of our distribution needs
are met by contract distribution centers.

Seasonality

VF’s operating results vary from quarter-to-quarter throughout the year due to the differing sales patterns of our individual businesses. On a quarterly basis, consolidated total revenues for 2013
ranged from a low of 19% of full year revenues in the second quarter to a high of 29% in the third quarter, while consolidated operating income ranged from a low of 12% in the second quarter to a high of 35% in the third quarter. This variation
results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our Outdoor & Action Sports Coalition, where 17% of the Coalition’s revenues occurred in the second quarter and 31% in the third quarter of 2013. With changes in our mix of
business and the growth of our retail operations, historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be indicative of future trends. We expect the portion of annual revenues and profits occurring in the second half of the year to continue to
increase.

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital increases during the first half of the year
as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then moderates during the second half of the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected. Cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the
second half of the year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements, particularly during the fourth quarter.

Advertising, Customer Support and Community Outreach

During 2013, our
advertising and promotion expense was $671.3 million, representing 5.9% of net sales. We advertise in consumer and trade publications, on radio and television, and through digital initiatives including social media and mobile platforms on the
Internet. We also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print media, radio and television. We sponsor sporting, musical and special events, as well as athletes and personalities who promote our
products. We employ marketing sciences to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional spending and to identify the types of spending that provide the greatest return on our marketing investments.

We provide advertising support to our wholesale customers in the form of point-of-sale fixtures and signage to enhance the presentation
and brand image of our products. We also participate in shop-in-shops and concession arrangements, which are separate sales areas dedicated to a specific VF brand within our customers’ stores, to help differentiate and enhance the presentation
of our products.

We participate in incentive programs with our retailer customers, including customer loyalty, discounts,
allowances and cooperative advertising funds. We also offer sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of rebate and coupon offers.

In addition to sponsorships and activities that directly benefit our products and brands, VF and its associates actively support our communities and various charities. For example,

The North Face

®

brand has committed to programs that encourage and enable outdoor participation, such as the

Planet Explore

®

(www.planetexplore.com), the

The North Face Endurance Challenge

®

and the

Explore Your
Parks

TM

programs. The

Timberland

®

brand has a heritage of volunteerism, including the

Path of Service

™ program that offers full-time employees up to 40 hours of paid time off a year
to serve their local communities. The

Timberland

®

brand also sponsors two annual global service events, Earth Day in the spring and Serv-a-palooza in the
fall, when employees provide assistance to local communities through various volunteer efforts. The

Nautica

®

brand supports Oceana, a not-for-profit
organization focused on ocean conservatism, and Charity: Water, a not-for-profit organization focused on providing clean, safe water to people in need. In addition, 2013 marked the eighteenth year of support for the

Lee National Denim
Day

®

event, one of the



country’s largest single-day fundraisers for breast cancer that has raised over $89 million since its inception to fight breast cancer. VF also supports company-wide sustainability efforts,
and recognizes the “VF 100” to honor the 100 VF associates worldwide having the highest number of volunteer service hours during the year.

Other Matters

Competitive Factors

Our business depends on our ability to stimulate consumer demand for VF’s brands and products. VF is well-positioned to compete in
the apparel and footwear industries by developing high quality innovative products at competitive prices that meet consumer needs, providing high service levels, ensuring the right products are on the retail sales floor to meet consumer demand,
investing significant amounts behind existing brands and continuing to evaluate the potential for acquiring additional brands. We continually strive to improve in each of these areas. Many of VF’s brands have long histories and enjoy strong
recognition within their respective consumer segments.

Intellectual Property

Trademarks, patents and domain names, as well as related logos, designs and graphics, provide substantial value in the development and
marketing of VF’s products and are important to our continued success. We have registered this intellectual property in the U.S. and in other countries where our products are manufactured and/or sold. We vigorously monitor and enforce VF’s
intellectual property against counterfeiting, infringement and violations of other rights where and to the extent legal, feasible and appropriate. In addition, we grant licenses to other parties to manufacture and sell products utilizing our
intellectual property in product categories and geographic areas in which VF does not operate.

Customers

VF products are primarily sold on a wholesale basis to specialty stores, department stores, national chains and mass
merchants. In addition, we sell products on a direct-to-consumer basis through VF-operated stores and e-commerce sites, which accounted for 22% of our total revenues in 2013. Our sales in international markets are growing and represented 38% of our
total revenues in 2013, the majority of which were in Europe.

Sales to VF’s ten largest customers, all of which are
retailers based in the U.S., amounted to 21% of total revenues in 2013, 21% in 2012 and 23% in 2011. Sales to the five largest customers amounted to approximately 16% of total revenues in 2013, 16% in 2012 and 18% in 2011. Sales to VF’s largest
customer totaled 8% of total revenues in 2013, 8% in 2012 and 9% in 2011, the majority of which were in the Jeanswear Coalition.

Employees

VF had approximately 59,000 employees at the end of 2013,
of which approximately 26,000 were located in the U.S. Approximately 630 employees in the U.S. are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In international markets, a significant percentage of employees are covered by trade-sponsored or
governmental bargaining arrangements. Employee relations are considered to be good.

Backlog

The dollar amount of VF’s order backlog as of any date is not meaningful, may not be indicative of actual future shipments and,
accordingly, is not material for an understanding of the business of VF taken as a whole.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating VF’s business and the
forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect VF’s business, its operating results and its financial condition.

VF’s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel, which is sensitive to general economic
conditions and other factors. A return to recessionary conditions or a decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on VF.

The apparel industry has historically been subject to cyclical variations and is particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy. The success of VF’s business depends on consumer
spending, and there are a number of factors that influence consumer spending, including actual and perceived economic conditions, disposable consumer income, interest rates, consumer credit availability, unemployment, stock market performance,
extreme weather conditions, energy prices and tax rates in the international, national, regional and local markets where VF’s products are sold. A decline in actual or perceived economic conditions or other factors could negatively impact the
level of consumer spending and have a material adverse impact on VF.

Fluctuations in the price, availability and
quality of raw materials and finished goods could increase costs.

Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality
of fabrics, leather or other raw materials used by VF in its manufactured products, or of purchased finished goods, could have a material adverse effect on VF’s cost of sales or its ability to meet its customers’ demands. The prices we pay
depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them. The price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, including general economic conditions and demand, crop yields,
energy prices, weather patterns and speculation in the commodities markets. Prices of purchased finished products also depend on wage rates in Asia and other geographic areas where our independent contractors are located, as well as freight costs
from those regions. In the future, VF may not be able to offset cost increases with other cost reductions or efficiencies or to pass higher costs on to its customers. This could have a material adverse effect on VF’s results of operations,
liquidity and financial condition.

We may be adversely affected by weather conditions.

Our business is adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions. A significant portion of the sales of our products is dependent in
part on the weather and is likely to decline in years in which weather conditions do not favor the use of these products. Periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows. Inventory accumulation by



our wholesale customers resulting from unseasonable weather in one season generally negatively affects orders in future seasons, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows. Abnormally harsh or inclement weather can also negatively impact retail traffic and consumer spending.

The apparel and footwear industries are highly competitive, and VF’s success depends on its ability to respond to constantly changing markets.

VF competes with numerous apparel and footwear brands and manufacturers. Competition is generally based upon brand name recognition,
price, design, product quality, selection, service and purchasing convenience. Some of our competitors are larger and have more resources than VF in some product categories and regions. In addition, VF competes directly with the private label brands
of most of its wholesale customers. VF’s ability to compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on our ability to:

•

Anticipate and respond to changing consumer trends in a timely manner;

•

Develop attractive, innovative and high quality products that meet consumer needs;

•

Maintain strong brand recognition;

•

Price products appropriately;

•

Provide best-in-class marketing support and intelligence;

•

Ensure product availability and optimize supply chain efficiencies;

•

Obtain sufficient retail store space and effectively present our products at retail; and

•

Produce or procure quality products on a consistent basis.

Failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing markets and trends could have a material adverse effect on VF’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

VF’s results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to gauge consumer preferences and product
trends and accurately forecast demand for our products.

Our success depends in part on management’s ability to
effectively anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and product trends and to translate trends into marketable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer. Even if we are successful in anticipating
consumer demands, we must continue to be able to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products in order to sustain consumer demand.

We often schedule internal production and place orders for products with independent manufacturers before our customers’ orders are firm. Factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast
demand for our products include:

•

Our failure to anticipate changing styles or trends or accurately forecast customer acceptance of new products;

•

New, well-received product introductions by competitors;

•

Unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which result in cancellations of orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of
reorders placed by retailers;

•

Weak economic conditions or consumer confidence, which reduce demand for VF’s products; and

•

Terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, which adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of
products and raw materials.



There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully anticipate changing consumer
preferences and product trends or economic conditions and, as a result, we may not successfully manage inventory levels to meet our future order requirements. If we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand, we may experience excess inventory
levels or a shortage of product required to meet the demand. Inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory write-downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could have an adverse effect on the image and
reputation of VF’s brands and negatively impact profitability. On the other hand, if we underestimate demand for our products, our manufacturing facilities or third party manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet consumer
requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues, as well as damage to VF’s reputation and relationships. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image as well as our results of
operations and financial condition.

VF’s business and the success of its products could be harmed if VF is unable
to maintain the images of its brands.

VF’s success to date has been due in large part to the growth of its
brands’ images and VF’s customers’ connection to its brands. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand, the names and images of our brands may be impaired. Even if we react appropriately to
changes in consumer preferences, consumers may consider our brands’ images to be outdated or associate our brands with styles that are no longer popular. In addition, brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of
qualities, including merchandise quality and corporate integrity. Negative claims or publicity regarding VF, its brands or its products, including licensed products, could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims
are accurate. Social media, which accelerates the dissemination of information, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims. In the past, many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed
by periods of declining sales and losses. Our businesses may be similarly affected in the future. In addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a number of athletes and musicians and feature those individuals in our advertising and marketing
efforts. Actions taken by those individuals associated with our products could harm their reputations and adversely affect the images of our brands.

VF relies significantly on information technology. Any inadequacy, interruption, integration failure or security failure of this technology could harm VF’s ability to effectively operate its
business.

Our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology
systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses, or a breach in security of these systems could
adversely impact the operations of VF’s business, including corporate email communications, e-commerce operations, retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing, and our interaction with the public on social media.

In the normal course of business we often collect, retain and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer
information, including credit card information, over public networks. There is a significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy.
Despite the security measures we currently have in place, our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches and VF and its customers could suffer harm if customer information were
accessed by third parties due to a security failure in VF’s systems. It could require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure, problem or breach and severely damage our reputation and our relationships with customers.



A substantial portion of VF’s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small
number of large customers. The loss of any of these customers or the inability of any of these customers to pay VF could substantially reduce VF’s revenues and profits.

A few of VF’s customers account for a significant portion of revenues. Sales to VF’s ten largest customers were 21% of total
revenues in fiscal 2013, with our largest customer accounting for 8% of revenues. Sales to our customers are generally on a purchase order basis and not subject to long-term agreements. A decision by any of VF’s major customers to significantly
decrease the volume of products purchased from VF could substantially reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect on VF’s financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, in recent years, the retail industry has experienced
consolidation and other ownership changes. In the future, retailers may further consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations, realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target markets. These developments could result in a
reduction in the number of stores that carry VF’s products, an increase in ownership concentration within the retail industry, an increase in credit exposure to VF or an increase in leverage by VF’s customers over their suppliers. These
changes could impact VF’s opportunities in the market and increase VF’s reliance on a smaller number of large customers.

Further, the global economy periodically experiences recessionary conditions with rising unemployment, reduced availability of credit, increased savings rates and declines in real estate and securities
values. These recessionary conditions could have a negative impact on retail sales of apparel and other consumer products. The lower sales volumes, along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets, could result in our
customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures, bankruptcies or liquidations. This could result in higher credit risk to VF relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties. If
these developments occur, our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on VF’s trade accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on VF’s financial condition and results of operations.

VF’s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins.

The apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in
the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. If these factors cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers, and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or
operating expenses, VF’s profitability will decline. This could have a material adverse effect on VF’s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

VF may not succeed in its growth strategy.

One of VF’s key
strategic objectives is growth. We seek to grow organically and through acquisitions. We seek to grow by building new lifestyle brands, expanding our share with winning customers, stretching VF’s brands to new regions, managing costs,
leveraging our supply chain and information technology capabilities across VF and expanding our direct-to-consumer business, including opening new stores and remodeling and expanding our existing stores. We may not be able to grow our existing
businesses. We may have difficulty completing acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve the expected growth, cost savings or synergies from such integration. We may not be able to expand our
market share with winning customers, expand our brands geographically or achieve the expected results from our supply chain initiatives. We may have difficulty recruiting, developing or retaining qualified employees. We may not be able to achieve
our store expansion goals, manage our growth effectively, successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new, remodeled and expanded stores profitably. Failure to implement our growth strategy may have a material
adverse effect on VF’s business.

There are risks associated with VF’s acquisitions.

Any acquisitions or mergers by VF will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies. These risks include,
among other things, higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses,



the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations, systems and personnel of the companies and the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management. In addition,
geographic distances may make integration of acquired businesses more difficult. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions.

Our acquisitions may cause large one-time expenses or create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant
impairment charges in the future. We also make certain estimates and assumptions in order to determine purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If our estimates or assumptions used to value
these assets and liabilities are not accurate, we may be exposed to losses that may be material.

VF’s operations
in international markets, and earnings in those markets, may be affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic risks.

Our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new international markets is subject to risks associated with
international operations. These include the burdens of complying with foreign laws and regulations, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs or other barriers in some international markets.

We cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes, exchange controls or other restrictions will be imposed by the U.S., the European Union
or other countries on the import or export of our products, or what effect any of these actions would have on VF’s business, financial condition or results of operations. We cannot predict whether there might be changes in our ability to
repatriate earnings or capital from international jurisdictions. Changes in regulatory, geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect VF’s business or may require us to modify our current business practices.

Approximately 60% of VF’s 2013 net income was earned in jurisdictions outside the U.S. VF is exposed to risks of changes in U.S.
policy for companies having business operations outside the U.S. There have been a number of proposed changes to U.S. income tax laws, including overall corporate and individual tax reform. Some of these tax law changes and tax reform proposals,
among other things, consider accelerating the U.S. taxability of non-U.S. earnings or limiting foreign tax credits. While enactment of any such proposal is not certain, if new legislation were enacted, it is possible our U.S. income tax expense
could increase, which would reduce our earnings.

We may have additional tax liabilities.

As a global company, we determine our income tax liability in various tax jurisdictions based on an analysis and interpretation of local
tax laws and regulations. This analysis requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation and is often based on various assumptions about the future actions of the local tax authorities. These determinations are the subject of periodic
domestic and foreign tax audits. Although we accrue for uncertain tax positions, our accrual may be insufficient to satisfy unfavorable findings. Unfavorable audit findings and tax rulings may result in payment of taxes, fines and penalties for
prior periods and higher tax rates in future periods, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Further, in an effort to deal with budget deficits, governments around the world are
focusing on increasing tax revenues through increased audits and, potentially, increased tax rates for corporations. Changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly affect
the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.



VF uses third party suppliers and manufacturing facilities worldwide for a substantial
portion of its raw materials and finished products, which poses risks to VF’s business operations.

During fiscal
2013, approximately 73% of VF’s units were purchased from independent manufacturers primarily located in Asia, with substantially all of the remainder produced by VF-owned and operated manufacturing facilities located in the U.S., Mexico,
Central and South America, the Caribbean, Europe and the Middle East. Any of the following could impact our ability to produce or deliver VF products:

•

Political or labor instability in countries where VF’s facilities, contractors and suppliers are located;

•

Political or military conflict could cause a delay in the transportation of raw materials and products to VF and an increase in transportation costs;

•

Disruption at ports of entry could cause delays in product availability and increase transportation times and costs;

•

Heightened terrorism security concerns could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent or more lengthy inspections, leading to
delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods;

•

Decreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to more counterfeit goods and reduced sales of VF products, increased costs for
VF’s anticounterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of its brands;

•

Disruptions at manufacturing or distribution facilities caused by natural and man-made disasters;

•

Disease epidemics and health-related concerns, such as the H1N1 virus, bird flu, SARS, mad cow and hoof-and-mouth disease outbreaks in recent years,
could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargo of VF’s goods produced in infected areas;

•

Imposition of regulations and quotas relating to imports and our ability to adjust timely to changes in trade regulations could limit our ability to
produce products in cost-effective countries that have the labor and expertise needed;

•

Imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports; and

•

Imposition or the repeal of laws that affect intellectual property rights.

Although no single supplier and no one country is critical to VF’s production needs, if we were to lose a supplier it could result
in interruption of finished goods shipments to VF, cancellation of orders by customers, and termination of relationships. This, along with the damage to our reputation, could have a material adverse effect on VF’s revenues and, consequently,
our results of operations.

Our business is subject to national, state and local laws and regulations for environmental,
employment, safety and other matters. The costs of compliance with, or the violation of, such laws and regulations by VF or by independent suppliers who manufacture products for VF could have an adverse effect on our operations and cash flows, as
well as on our reputation.

Our business is subject to comprehensive federal, state and local laws and regulations on a
wide range of environmental, employment, safety and other matters. VF could be adversely affected by costs of compliance with or violations of those laws and regulations. In addition, while we do not control their business practices, we require
third party suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance. The costs of products purchased by VF from independent contractors could
increase due to the costs of compliance by those contractors.

Failure by VF or its third party suppliers to comply with such
laws and regulations, as well as with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards, or related political considerations, could result in interruption



of finished goods shipments to VF, cancellation of orders by customers, and termination of relationships. If one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws or implements labor or
other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical, it could jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts that may reduce demand for VF’s merchandise. Damage to VF’s
reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on VF’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to rebuild VF’s
reputation.

VF’s business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. VF’s
hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks.

A growing percentage of VF’s total revenues
(approximately 38% in 2013) is derived from markets outside the U.S. VF’s international businesses operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in currency exchange rates may affect the U.S. dollar value of the foreign
currency-denominated amounts at which VF’s international businesses purchase products, incur costs or sell products. In addition, for VF’s U.S.-based businesses, the majority of products are sourced from independent contractors or VF
plants located in foreign countries. As a result, the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies. Furthermore, much of VF’s licensing revenue is derived from sales in foreign currencies. Changes in
foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on VF’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In accordance with our operating practices, we hedge a significant portion of our foreign currency transaction exposures arising in the ordinary course of business to reduce risks in our cash flows and
earnings. Our hedging strategy may not be effective in reducing all risks, and no hedging strategy can completely insulate VF from foreign exchange risk. We do not hedge foreign currency translation rate changes.

Further, our use of derivative financial instruments may expose VF to counterparty risks. Although VF only enters into hedging contracts
with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings, it is possible that the credit quality of a counterparty could be downgraded or a counterparty could default on its obligations, which could have a material adverse impact on VF’s
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

VF borrows funds on a short-term basis, primarily to support
seasonal working capital requirements. Long-term debt is part of VF’s total capital structure. Because of conditions in global credit markets, VF may have difficulty accessing capital markets for short or long-term financing.

Particularly in 2008 and continuing to a lesser extent during the last five years, global capital and credit markets
have experienced extreme volatility and disruption, with government intervention, mergers or bankruptcies of several major financial institutions, and a general decline in global liquidity. Many corporate issuers have been unable to access credit
markets.

We typically use short-term commercial paper borrowings to support seasonal working capital requirements, with
amounts generally repaid by the end of each year from strong cash flows from operations. VF has been able to borrow in the commercial paper markets in recent years. In the future, VF may seek to access the long-term capital markets to replace
maturing debt obligations or to fund acquisitions or other growth opportunities. There is no assurance that the commercial paper markets or the long-term capital markets will continue to be reliable sources of financing for VF. If VF does not have
access to financing, it could have a material adverse impact on VF’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

VF has a global revolving credit facility. One or more of the participating banks may not be able to honor their commitments, which could have an adverse effect on VF’s business.

VF has a $1.25 billion global revolving credit facility that expires in December 2016. If the financial



markets return to recessionary conditions, this could impair the ability of one or more of the banks participating in our credit agreements from honoring their commitments. This could have an
adverse effect on our business if we were not able to replace those commitments or to locate other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms.

The loss of members of VF’s executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on its business.

VF depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers and business leaders who have substantial experience and
expertise in VF’s business. VF also depends on other key employees involved in the operation of its business. Competition for experienced and well-qualified personnel is intense. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these
individuals could have a material adverse effect on VF.

VF’s direct-to-consumer business includes risks that could
have an adverse effect on its results.

VF sells merchandise direct-to-consumer through VF-operated stores and over the
Internet through its websites. Its direct-to-consumer business is subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on its results. Risks include, but are not limited to, (a) domestic or international resellers purchasing
merchandise and reselling it overseas outside VF’s control, (b) failure of the systems that operate the stores and websites, and their related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, privacy concerns,
telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, (c) credit card fraud and (d) risks related to VF’s direct-to-consumer distribution centers. Risks specific to VF’s e-commerce business also include
(a) diversion of sales from VF stores or wholesale customers, (b) difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels and (c) liability for online content. VF’s failure to successfully respond to these risks
might adversely affect sales in its Internet business, as well as damage its reputation and brands.

Our VF-operated stores
and e-commerce business requires substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Due to the high
fixed-cost structure associated with our direct-to-consumer operations, a decline in sales or the closure of or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and
leasehold improvements, and employee-related costs.

VF’s net sales depend on a volume of traffic to its stores and
the availability of suitable lease space.

A growing portion of our revenues are direct-to-consumer sales through
VF-operated stores. In order to generate customer traffic, we locate many of our stores in prominent locations within successful retail shopping centers or in fashionable shopping districts. Our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center
and other attractions in an area to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. Part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs
providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. We cannot control the development of new shopping centers or districts; the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping centers or districts; competition with
other retailers for prominent locations; or the success of individual shopping centers or districts. Further, if we are unable to renew or replace our existing store leases or enter into leases for new stores on favorable terms, or if we violate the
terms of our current leases, our growth and profitability could be harmed. All of these factors may impact our ability to meet our growth targets and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

VF may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights.

VF’s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its competitive position. VF is susceptible
to others copying its products and infringing its intellectual property rights especially with the shift in product mix to higher priced brands and innovative new products in recent years. Some of VF’s



brands, such as

The North Face

®

,

Timberland

®

,

Vans

®

,

JanSport

®

,

Nautica

®

,

Wrangler

®

and

Lee

®

, enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition, and the higher pricing
of those products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement.

VF’s trademarks, trade names, patents,
trade secrets and other intellectual property are important to VF’s success. Counterfeiting of VF’s products or infringement on its intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect VF’s
revenues. Actions we have taken to establish and protect VF’s intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent copying of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its trademarks or block sales of
VF’s products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others. In addition, unilateral actions in the U.S. or other countries, including changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual
property rights, could have an impact on VF’s ability to enforce those rights.

The value of VF’s intellectual
property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of VF, or trademarks that are similar to VF’s trademarks, or trademarks that VF licenses from others. We may be unable to
successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to VF’s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights
to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. In other cases, there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks. VF is from time to time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some of its intellectual
property rights.

We may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe on their trademarks,
copyrights, patents or other intellectual property rights. Defending infringement claims could be expensive and time-consuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements.

VF is subject to the risk that its licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of VF’s brands.

During 2013, $117.3 million of VF’s revenues were derived from licensing royalties. Although VF generally has
significant control over its licensees’ products and advertising, we rely on our licensees for, among other things, operational and financial controls over their businesses. Failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or
our inability to replace existing licensees, if necessary, could adversely affect VF’s revenues, both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. Risks are also associated with a
licensee’s ability to:

•

Obtain capital;

•

Manage its labor relations;

•

Maintain relationships with its suppliers;

•

Manage its credit risk effectively;

•

Maintain relationships with its customers; and

•

Adhere to VF’s Global Compliance Principles.

In addition, VF relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands. Although we attempt to protect VF’s brands through approval rights over design, production processes, quality,
packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of licensed VF brands by our licensees. The misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that
brand and on VF.



VF has entered into license agreements to use the trademarks of others. Loss of a
license could have an adverse effect on VF’s operating results.

VF has entered into agreements to market products
under licenses granted by third parties, including Major League Baseball, the National Football League and Harley-Davidson Motor Company, Inc. Some of these licenses are for a short term and do not contain renewal options. Loss of a license, which
in certain cases could result in an impairment charge for related operating and intangible assets, could have an adverse effect on VF’s operating results.

If VF encounters problems with its distribution system, VF’s ability to deliver its products to the market could be adversely affected.

VF relies on owned or independently-operated distribution facilities to warehouse and ship product to its customers. VF’s
distribution system includes computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures.
Because substantially all of VF’s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations, VF’s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes, floods, fires or other natural disasters affecting its distribution centers.
We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect VF from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in VF’s distribution facilities, such as the long-term loss of customers or an erosion of
brand image. In addition, VF’s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities. If we encounter problems with our
distribution system, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected.

VF’s balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill. A decline in the fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset
impairment charge, which would be recorded as an operating expense in VF’s Consolidated Statement of Income and could be material.

We evaluate goodwill and nonamortizing trademark and trade name intangible assets for possible impairment at least annually. In addition, intangible assets that are being amortized are tested for
impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value might not be recoverable. For these impairment tests, we use various valuation methods to estimate the fair value of our business units and intangible assets. If the fair
value of an asset is less than its carrying value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference.

It is possible
that we could have an impairment charge for goodwill or trademark and trade name intangible assets in future periods if (i) overall economic conditions in 2014 or future years vary from our current assumptions, (ii) business conditions or
our strategies for a specific business unit change from our current assumptions, (iii) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or (iv) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or
of actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower comparable multiples of revenues and EBITDA and, accordingly, lower implied values of goodwill and intangible assets. A future impairment charge for goodwill
or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Volatility in securities markets, interest rates and other economic factors could substantially increase VF’s defined benefit
pension costs.

VF currently has unfunded obligations under its defined benefit pension plans. The funded status of the
pension plans is dependent on many factors, including returns on investment assets and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations. Unfavorable returns on plan assets, a lower discount rate or unfavorable changes in the applicable laws
or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of pension funding requirements, which could reduce cash available for VF’s business.



VF’s operating performance also may be negatively impacted by the amount of expense
recorded for its pension plans. Pension expense is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market, economic and demographic conditions. Differences between estimated and actual results give
rise to gains and losses that are deferred and amortized as part of future pension expense, which can create volatility that adversely impacts VF’s future operating results.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.

Overview

VF Corporation (“VF”) is a worldwide leader in the manufacturing and distribution of branded lifestyle apparel, footwear and related products. Our vision is to grow by building leading lifestyle
brands that excite consumers around the world. We continue to invest in all of our businesses through geographic expansion, product innovation, consumer research, marketing and our direct-to-consumer infrastructure, including retail store openings,
e-commerce and omni-channel retailing.

VF is highly diversified — across brands, product categories, channels of
distribution, geographies and consumer demographics. We own a broad portfolio of brands in the outerwear, footwear, jeanswear, backpacks, luggage, sportswear, occupational and performance apparel categories. These products are marketed to consumers
shopping in specialty stores, upscale and traditional department stores, national chains, mass merchants and our own direct-to-consumer operations.

VF is organized by groupings of businesses called “coalitions”. The five coalitions are Outdoor & Action Sports, Jeanswear, Imagewear, Sportswear and Contemporary Brands. These
coalitions are our segments for financial reporting purposes.

Highlights of 2013

All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis and reflect the four-for-one stock split in December 2013:

•

Revenues grew to a record $11.4 billion, a 5% increase over 2012.

•

International revenues rose 8% and accounted for 38% of VF’s total revenues in 2013.

•

Direct-to-consumer revenues increased 13% over 2012 and accounted for 22% of VF’s total revenues in 2013. VF opened 164 retail stores in 2013.

•

Gross margin increased 160 basis points to 48.1% in 2013.

•

Cash flow from operations exceeded $1.5 billion in 2013.

•

Earnings per share increased 12% to $2.71 in 2013 from $2.43 in 2012.

In addition, VF made a discretionary contribution of $100.0 million to its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension
plan, repaid $400.0 million of floating rate debt and increased the quarterly dividend rate by 21%, marking the

st

consecutive year of increase in the rate of dividends
paid per share.



Analysis of Results of Operations

Consolidated Statements of Income

The following table presents a summary of the changes in total revenues during the last two years:

VF reported revenue growth of 5% in 2013 driven by an increase in unit volume, with particular strength
in the Outdoor & Action Sports and Sportswear Coalitions. Our international and direct-to-consumer businesses continued to expand, growing revenues by 8% and 13%, respectively. The increase in 2012 revenues compared with 2011 is primarily
due to the Outdoor & Action Sports Coalition, driven by the acquisition of The Timberland Company (“Timberland”) and organic growth. Additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled “Information by Business
Segment”.

VF’s foreign currency exposure primarily relates to businesses conducted in euro-based countries. The
weighted average translation rates for the euro were $1.33, $1.28 and $1.39 per euro for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In addition, VF has foreign currency exposure related to businesses in developed and emerging markets around the world.
Changes in foreign currency translation rates for all currencies positively impacted revenue comparisons by $45.8 million in 2013 and negatively impacted revenue comparisons by $169.8 million in 2012.

The following table presents the percentage relationship to total revenues for components of the Consolidated Statements of Income:

Gross margin increased 160 basis points to 48.1% in 2013 compared with 46.5% in 2012, with improvements
in nearly every coalition. The increase in gross margin reflects lower product costs and the continued shift in the revenue mix towards higher margin businesses, including Outdoor & Action Sports, international and direct-to-consumer.

Gross margin increased 70 basis points to 46.5% in 2012 compared with 45.8% in 2011. This increase in gross margin was driven
by the continued shift in the revenue mix towards higher margin businesses, partially offset by benefits in 2011 that did not recur in 2012 related to a gain on a facility closure and change in inventory accounting policy.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 50 basis points higher in 2013 compared with 2012 due
to additional marketing and direct-to-consumer investments to support future growth for our largest and fastest growing businesses, partially offset by the leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues and lower acquisition-related expenses for
Timberland.



Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were higher
in 2012 compared with 2011 due to the inclusion of a full year of Timberland, which has higher expense ratios than other VF businesses, as well as increases in pension and marketing expenses. These increases were partially offset by lower Timberland
acquisition-related expenses in 2012 and the leverage of operating expenses on higher total revenues.

Operating margin
increased 90 basis points, to 14.4% in 2013 from 13.5% in 2012. The increase in operating margin for 2013 was due to improved gross margin and the leverage of operating expenses on higher revenues, partially offset by increased marketing and
direct-to-consumer investments in 2013.

Operating margin increased 30 basis points, to 13.5% in 2012 from 13.2% in 2011.
Timberland negatively impacted 2012 operating margin by 90 basis points, including 30 basis points from the impact of acquisition-related expenses. Timberland negatively impacted 2011 operating margin by 40 basis points, including 30 basis points
from the impact of acquisition-related expenses.

Net interest expense decreased $9.6 million to $80.6 million in 2013, due to
(i) lower average levels of short-term borrowings, (ii) the repayment of $400.0 million of floating rate notes during the third quarter of 2013 and (iii) increased amounts of interest capitalized for significant projects. Net interest
expense increased $17.5 million to $90.3 million in 2012 primarily due to (i) the issuance of $900.0 million of term debt in 2011 to fund the Timberland acquisition and (ii) higher average levels of short-term borrowings throughout 2012.

Outstanding interest-bearing debt averaged $1.9 billion for 2013, $2.5 billion for 2012 and $1.7 billion for 2011, with
short-term borrowings representing 10%, 25% and 24% of average debt outstanding for the respective years. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 4.5% for 2013, 3.7% for 2012 and 4.5% for 2011. The weighted average interest rate
increased in 2013 primarily due to (i) lower average levels of short-term borrowings, which have lower interest rates than the average of all outstanding debt and (ii) fewer months outstanding of the $400.0 million floating rate debt,
which had a lower interest rate than the average of all outstanding debt, and was repaid during the year. The decrease in the weighted average interest rate in 2012 from 2011 resulted from the full year inclusion of the lower average interest rates
on the $900.0 million term debt noted above.

Other income (expense) netted to expense of $4.0 million in 2013 compared with
income of $46.9 million in 2012. The expense in 2013 was primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses. The income in 2012 was primarily due to the $42.0 million gain on the sale of VF’s 80% ownership in John Varvatos Enterprises, Inc.
(“John Varvatos”).

Other income (expense) netted to income of $46.9 million in 2012 compared with expense of $7.2
million in 2011. The income in 2012 was primarily due to the $42.0 million gain on the sale of John Varvatos and foreign currency exchange gains. The expense in 2011 was primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses.

The effective income tax rate for 2013 was 22.6%, which is 1.0% lower than the effective rate in 2012. The 2013 tax rate included a net
$26.0 million in discrete tax benefits, primarily related to the retroactive impact of the American Tax Relief Act of 2012 discussed below ($8.7 million tax benefit), prior year refund claims and tax credits ($7.0 million tax benefit), unrecognized
tax benefits and interest (net $5.9 million tax benefit) and changes in valuation allowances for capital and operating loss carryforwards (net $3.4 million tax benefit). These discrete items collectively lowered the 2013 annual tax rate by 1.7%,
compared with 2.2% in 2012. Without discrete items, the effective tax rate during 2013 decreased by approximately 1.5% primarily due to the 2013 impact of tax law changes in the U.S. (related to the American Tax Relief Act of 2012) and a higher
percentage of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions compared with 2012. The international effective tax rate was 12.1% and 13.6% for 2013 and 2012, respectively.

The effective income tax rate was 23.6% for both 2012 and 2011. The 2012 effective income tax rate included a net $31.0 million in discrete tax benefits primarily related to changes in valuation
allowances for



capital and operating loss carryforwards (net $33.0 million tax benefit) and unrecognized tax benefits and interest (net $2.0 million tax expense). These discrete items collectively lowered the
2012 annual tax rate by 2.2%, compared with 1.4% in 2011. Without discrete items, the effective tax rate during 2012 increased by approximately 0.8% primarily due to tax law changes in the U.S., partially offset by a higher percentage of income in
lower tax rate jurisdictions compared with 2011. The 2011 income tax rate included a net $16.3 in discrete tax benefits primarily related to changes in valuation allowances for operating loss carryforwards (net $12.1 million benefit) and
unrecognized tax benefits and interest (net $4.2 million benefit), which together lowered the 2011 annual tax rate by 1.4%.

The American Tax Relief Act of 2012, signed into law in January 2013, retroactively extended certain tax credits and incentives through
tax year 2013. The impact of this tax law change to the 2012 tax year was considered a discrete tax benefit when recorded in the first quarter of 2013. The change in tax law also provided tax credits and incentives applicable to the 2013 tax
year which were not considered discrete items. These tax incentives do not extend beyond 2013 and therefore have been excluded from future tax rates. VF expects the 2014 annual tax rate to approximate 23.5% to 24%.

Net income attributable to VF Corporation in 2013 increased to $1.2 billion ($2.71 per share), compared with $1.1 billion ($2.43 per
share) in 2012. The increase in earnings per share in 2013 resulted primarily from improved operating performance, as discussed in the “Information by Business Segment” section below as well as the other factors described above. In
addition, earnings per share in 2013 compared with 2012 benefited by $0.04 per share due to lower Timberland acquisition-related expenses.

Net income attributable to VF Corporation in 2012 increased to $1.1 billion ($2.43 per share), compared with $888.1 million ($2.00 per share) in 2011. The increase in earnings per share in 2012 resulted
primarily from improved operating performance, as discussed in the “Information by Business Segment” section below as well as the other factors described above. In addition, earnings per share in 2012 compared with 2011 benefited by a
$0.12 per share incremental contribution from Timberland (net of acquisition-related expenses) and an $0.08 per share gain on the sale of John Varvatos.

Information by Business Segment

Management at each of the coalitions has
direct control over and responsibility for its revenues and operating income, hereinafter termed “coalition revenues” and “coalition profit”, respectively. VF management evaluates operating performance and makes investment and
other decisions based on available opportunities and analysis of coalition revenues and coalition profit. Common costs such as information systems processing, retirement benefits and insurance are allocated to the coalitions based on appropriate
metrics such as sales, usage or number of employees.



The following tables present a summary of the changes in coalition revenues and coalition
profit during the last two years:

The following section discusses changes in revenues and profitability by coalition:

Outdoor & Action Sports:

The Outdoor & Action Sports Coalition includes the following brands:

The
North Face

,

Vans

®

,

Timberland

®

,

Kipling

®

(outside of North America),

Napapijri

®

and

Eagle Creek

®

.



The Outdoor & Action Sports Coalition revenues increased 9% in
2013 over 2012 primarily due to an increase in unit volume.

The North Face

®

,

Vans

®

,

and

Timberland

®

brands achieved global revenue growth of 7%, 17% and
5%, respectively. U.S. revenues increased 7% in 2013 and international revenues increased 10% with balanced growth in Europe and Asia Pacific. Direct-to-consumer revenues rose 15% in 2013 driven by increases of 28% and 15% for

The North Face

®

and

Vans

®

brands, respectively. New store openings, comp store growth and an
expanding e-commerce business all contributed to the direct-to-consumer revenue growth. Foreign currency translation positively impacted revenues by $53.4 million in 2013.

Coalition revenues increased 29% in 2012 over 2011. Of this increase, 10% related to organic growth (which is net of
a 3% negative impact from foreign currency translation) and 19% related to the inclusion of Timberland. In particular,

The North Face

®

and

Vans

®

brands achieved global revenue growth of 9% and 23%, respectively. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted revenues by $117.9 million in 2012.

U.S. revenues increased 21% in 2012, with 12 percentage points of the increase coming from the Timberland
acquisition. International revenues rose 37% in 2012, reflecting 11% organic growth (net of a 6% negative impact from foreign currency translation) and 26% growth due to the inclusion of Timberland. Direct-to-consumer revenues rose 37% in 2012 with
23 percentage points of the growth from the Timberland acquisition. The direct-to-consumer businesses of

The North
Face

®

and

Vans

®

brands increased 13% and 18%, respectively, in 2012. New store openings, comp store growth and an expanding e-commerce business all contributed to the
direct-to-consumer revenue growth.

Operating margin decreased 10 basis points in 2013 due to additional
marketing and direct-to-consumer investments for the coalition’s three largest brands,

The North Face

®

,

Vans

®

and

Timberland

®

, partially offset by increased leverage of operating expenses on
higher revenues.

The decrease in operating margin for 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to the inclusion for the full
year of Timberland, which has a lower operating margin than the overall coalition average.

Jeanswear:

The Jeanswear Coalition consists of the global jeanswear businesses, led by the

Wrangler

®

and

Lee

®

brands.

Global
Jeanswear revenues increased 1% in 2013 over 2012, driven by 2% growth in the U.S. within the combined Mass, Western Specialty and

Lee

®

brand businesses, despite continued weakness in the mid-tier channel and a slowdown in the Mass business. International Jeanswear revenues decreased 1% in 2013 driven
by an 8% decrease in Asia Pacific, where the

Wrangler

®

brand in China converted from direct wholesale to
a licensing model, and the

Lee

®

brand in China was impacted by an industry-wide inventory build-up that
began during the latter part of 2012. Partially offsetting the decrease in Asia Pacific revenues was a 2% increase in Jeanswear Europe primarily resulting from the benefit of foreign currency translation gains. Revenues in the Americas (non-U.S.)
region were about flat in 2013 compared with 2012.

Global Jeanswear revenues increased 2% in 2012 over
2011, led by 5% revenue growth in the U.S. business. The increase in U.S. revenues was primarily due to growth in the Mass and Western Specialty businesses as well as in our newest brand,

Rock & Republic

®

, offsetting a decline in the

Lee

®

brand revenues due to continued



softness in the mid-tier channel in the U.S. International jeanswear revenues decreased by 4% in 2012 due to weak economic conditions in Europe and a 2% ($43.6 million) negative impact from
foreign currency translation. This decrease was partially offset by revenue increases in Asia, reflecting strong wholesale growth.

Operating margin improved 270 basis points in 2013 over 2012, primarily driven by lower product costs and improvement in international performance.

Operating margin improved 160 basis points in 2012 over 2011, primarily driven by lower product costs. Operating margin in 2011 included
a 40 basis point gain on a facility closure.

Imagewear:

The Imagewear Coalition consists of VF’s Image business (occupational apparel
and uniforms, including the

Red Kap

®

and

Bulwark

®

brand businesses) and
Licensed Sports business (athletic apparel and fanwear, which includes the

Majestic

®

brand business).

Coalition revenues decreased 1% in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to a long-standing Image business customer that shipped
throughout 2012, but did not have significant shipments in 2013 until late in the third quarter. Revenues from the Licensed Sports business were slightly down in 2013 compared with 2012, as declines in the Major League Baseball and Harley Davidson
businesses were partially offset by increases in the National Football League, Collegiate and National Hockey League businesses.

The increase in coalition revenues for 2012 was primarily attributable to a 6% increase in the Image business, due to growth in the government and public safety and industrial uniform businesses. Revenues
in the Licensed Sports business increased 3% in 2012 due to expansion in the Harley Davidson, Collegiate and National Basketball Association businesses.

The 80 basis point improvement in operating margin in 2013 compared with 2012 was driven by improved gross margin due to lower product costs.

The decline in operating margin in 2012 compared with 2011 was primarily due to higher product costs that negatively impacted the
business during the first three quarters of 2012.

Sportswear:

The Sportswear Coalition consists of the

Nautica

®

and

Kipling

®

brand businesses in North America (the

Kipling

®

brand outside of North America is managed by the Outdoor & Action Sports Coalition).



Coalition revenues increased 8% in 2013 over 2012 primarily due to an
increase in unit volume. Revenues increased in the

Nautica

®

and

Kipling

®

brands by 5% and 29%, respectively, driven primarily by the direct-to-consumer businesses. New store openings, comp store growth and higher e-commerce revenues contributed to a 19% increase in the coalition’s direct-to consumer business.

Coalition revenues rose 6% in 2012 compared with 2011, reflecting 5% and 17% growth in the

Nautica

®

and

Kipling

®

brands, respectively. These revenue increases are primarily
attributable to double-digit growth in the direct-to-consumer businesses of both brands.

Operating margin improved 150 basis
points in 2013 over 2012 due to a continuing shift in the business mix toward higher margin direct-to-consumer businesses, improvements in the profitability of the wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses, as well as the leverage of operating
expenses on higher revenues.

Operating margin increased in 2012 compared with 2011 due to improved performance in both the
wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses.

Contemporary Brands:

The Contemporary Brands Coalition consists of the

7 For All Mankind

®

brand of premium denim jeanswear and related apparel and the

Splendid

®

and

Ella
Moss

®

apparel brands. The

John Varvatos

®

luxury apparel collection for men was
in this coalition until it was sold on April 30, 2012.

Excluding the impact of the sale of the John
Varvatos brand in 2012, coalition revenues decreased 2% in 2013 compared with 2012 due to unit volume decreases in the wholesale business, partially offset by higher direct-to-consumer revenues from new stores and e-commerce. Revenues for the

For All Mankind

®

brand in the U.S. decreased 6% due to contraction in demand for premium denim in the
wholesale business, partially offset by higher direct-to-consumer revenues. Revenues for the

7 For All
Mankind

®

brand in Europe increased 10%, with balanced growth in the wholesale and direct-to-consumer
businesses.

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

brand revenues in the U.S., on a combined basis, declined 1% in 2013 compared with 2012, as declines in wholesale were partially offset by an increase in the
direct-to-consumer business.

Adjusting for the sale of John Varvatos, coalition revenues increased 5% in
2012 compared with 2011. The revenue increase was driven by growth in the

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

brands, on a combined basis, of 18%. U.S. revenues for the

7 For All Mankind

®

brand increased 4% in 2012. Revenues for the

7 For All Mankind

®

brand in Europe decreased 6% (net of an 8% negative impact from foreign currency translation). This 2% net increase is due to growth in the direct-to-consumer
businesses. Revenues from the direct-to-consumer businesses in this coalition, adjusted for the sale of John Varvatos, expanded by 15% in 2012 due to new stores, comp store revenue growth and higher e-commerce revenues.

Operating margin decreased in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily due to lower cost absorption resulting from a decline in sales volume,
as well as increased investments in marketing and the direct-to-consumer businesses.

Operating margin
increased in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily due to a reduction in the sales of excess inventories, which are lower in profitability, for the

7 For All Mankind

®

brand and a greater percentage of revenues from the higher margin direct-to-consumer businesses.



Other:

VF Outlet

®

stores in the U.S. sell VF, as well as other branded products, at prices that are generally higher than what could be realized through external wholesale channels.
Revenues and profits of VF products sold in these stores are reported as part of the operating results of the applicable coalition, while revenues and profits of non-VF products are reported in the “other” category.

Reconciliation of Coalition Profit to Consolidated Income Before Income Taxes:

There are two types of costs necessary to reconcile total coalition profit to consolidated income before income taxes. These costs are
(i) interest expense, net, which is excluded from coalition profit because substantially all financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are not under the control of coalition management and (ii) corporate and other expenses
which are excluded from coalition profit to the extent they are not allocated to the operating coalitions. These expenses are summarized as follows:

Information Systems and Shared Services

These costs include management information systems and the centralized finance, supply chain, human resources, direct-to-consumer and customer management functions that support worldwide operations.
Operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the coalitions based on utilization of those services. Costs to develop new computer applications are generally not allocated to the coalitions. The increase in information
systems and shared services costs in 2013 and 2012 resulted from the overall growth of the businesses and costs associated with expanded software implementations and upgrades. Information systems and shared services costs in 2012 also included
increased information systems spending related to the integration of Timberland.

Corporate Headquarters’ Costs

Headquarters’ costs include compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff, legal and professional fees and general
and administrative expenses that have not been allocated to the coalitions. The increase in corporate headquarters’ costs in 2013 over 2012 was primarily due to an increase in charitable contributions. The increase in corporate
headquarters’ costs in 2012 over 2011 was driven by increases in compensation, incremental costs related to the integration of Timberland and investments in strategy and innovation.



Other

This category includes (i) costs of corporate programs or corporate-managed decisions that are not allocated to the coalitions, (ii) costs of registering, maintaining and enforcing certain of
VF’s trademarks and (iii) miscellaneous consolidated costs, the most significant of which is related to the expense of VF’s centrally-managed U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The current year service cost component of pension
expense is allocated to the coalitions, while the remaining cost components totaling $60.9 million for 2013, $67.2 million for 2012 and $33.8 million for 2011, are reported in corporate and other expenses. The increase in other expenses in 2013
compared with 2012 was driven by the $42.0 million gain on the sale of John Varvatos, which was recorded as an offset to other expenses in 2012. In addition, an increase in deferred compensation expense in 2013 was partially offset by lower pension
expense.

The decrease in other expenses in 2012 compared with 2011 is due to the $42.0 million gain on the sale of John
Varvatos, and a decrease in deferred compensation expense, partially offset by higher pension expense. Other expenses in 2011 were reduced by $8.0 million from an inventory accounting change from LIFO to FIFO.

Analysis of Financial Condition

Balance Sheets

The following discussion refers to significant changes in
balances at December 2013 compared with December 2012:

•

Increase in accounts receivable

— resulting from an increase in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2013.

•

Increase in property, plant and equipment

— related to capital projects that support VF’s continued experience and expectations for
revenue growth, including a European headquarters, additional distribution facilities, new retail stores and technology upgrades.

•

Increase in other assets

— driven by an increase in assets held for deferred compensation plans and deferred software costs related to
system implementations.

•

Decrease in current portion of long-term debt

— due to the repayment of the $400.0 million two-year notes issued to finance the acquisition
of Timberland.

•

Increase in accounts payable

— driven by the timing and level of inventory purchases and payments to vendors.

•

Increase in accrued liabilities

— primarily due to an increase in accrued income taxes, unrealized hedging losses related to derivative
financial instruments and marketing accruals.

•

Decrease in other liabilities

— due to a decrease in the underfunded status of the defined benefit pension plans at the end of 2013, as
discussed below, partially offset by higher deferred income taxes and liabilities related to deferred compensation plans.

The funded status of the defined benefit pension plans is reflected in the balance sheet as the excess (or deficiency) of pension plan assets compared with projected benefit obligations payable to plan
participants. The underfunded status of the defined benefit pension plans was $221.2 million at the end of 2013, compared with $482.9 million at the end of 2012. The improvement in the funded status as of December 2013 was due to an increase in the
discount rates used to value the projected benefit obligations and a $100.0 million discretionary contribution. See the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section below and Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional discussion of the defined benefit pension plans.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities

VF’s primary source of liquidity is the strong cash flow provided by operating activities, which is dependent on the level of net income and changes in working capital. Cash provided by operating
activities was $1.5 billion in 2013, $1.3 billion in 2012 and $1.1 billion in 2011. The improvement in 2013 is due to increased net income and higher levels of non-cash adjustments related to (i) pension and deferred compensation obligations, (ii)
depreciation and amortization, reflecting the elevated levels of capital expenditures in recent years and (iii) the 2012 gain on the sale of John Varatos. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was essentially the same in 2013 and 2012,
reflecting a slightly improved use of working capital considering the growth in the business.

The improvement in cash
provided by operations in 2012 is due to the increase in net income, and changes in operating assets and liabilities which resulted in $34.8 million of net cash used in 2012 compared with $165.1 million of net cash used in 2011. The net cash used in
2012 was primarily driven by the decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 2012, related to the timing of inventory and income tax payments, and the payment of a $100.0 million discretionary pension plan contribution in
December 2012.

Cash Used by Investing Activities

Cash used by investing activities was $350.3 million in 2013, $220.3 million in 2012 and $2,460.0 in 2011. VF’s investing activities related primarily to capital expenditures of $271.2 million and
software purchases of $54.0 million, which increased a combined $42.3 million in 2013 compared with 2012. The higher levels of spending were related to a number of infrastructure projects that support VF’s continued experience and expectations
for revenue growth including (i) a European headquarters, (ii) additional distribution facilities, (iii) new retail stores and (iv) system implementations. VF expects capital spending to approximate $270.0 million in 2014 to
support continued growth. This spending is expected to be funded by cash flow from operations.

Capital expenditures were
$251.9 million in 2012 and included (i) a European headquarters, (ii) a U.S. headquarters for the Outdoor & Action Sports businesses, (iii) additional distribution facilities and (iv) new retail stores. In addition, cash
used by investing activities in 2012 was reduced by $68.5 million in proceeds from the sale of John Varatos. Capital expenditures were $170.9 in 2011, primarily relating to new retail stores, distribution network and information systems costs.

Cash used by investing activities in 2011 included $2.2 billion of cash paid related to the Timberland acquisition.

Cash Provided (Used) by Financing Activities

Cash used by financing activities was $983.8 million and $802.5 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively, and cash provided by financing activities was $912.2 million in 2011. The increase in cash used by
financing



activities in 2013 was primarily due to the repayment of $400.0 million of debt and a $68.9 million increase in cash dividends paid. The change from cash used by financing activities in 2012 as
compared with cash provided by financing activities in 2011 was primarily due to $900.0 million in proceeds from long-term debt in order to finance the Timberland acquisition in 2011 as well as $300.0 million in open market purchases of Common Stock
in 2012. In addition, short-term borrowings used to fund the Timberland acquisition in 2011 were repaid in 2012.

During 2013,
2012 and 2011, VF purchased 6.8 million, 8.0 million and 0.3 million shares, respectively, of its Common Stock in open market transactions. The respective cost was $282.1 million, $299.7 million and $7.4 million with an average price
of $41.19 in 2013, $37.13 in 2012 and $24.95 in 2011. Fewer shares were repurchased in 2011 due to the funding of the Timberland acquisition.

In December 2013, VF’s Board of Directors authorized an additional 50.0 million shares of Common Stock for its stock repurchase program, which, when combined with remaining shares from a prior
authorization, brought the total authorization to 52.8 million shares. VF will continue to evaluate future share repurchases considering funding required for business acquisitions, VF’s Common Stock price and levels of stock option
exercises.

VF relies on continued strong cash generation to finance its ongoing operations. In addition, VF has significant
liquidity from its available cash balances and credit facilities. VF maintains a $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit (the “Global Credit Facility”), which supports its $1.25 billion U.S. commercial paper program for
short-term seasonal working capital requirements. The Global Credit Facility expires in December 2016. As of December 2013, there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding and the entire amount of the Global Credit Facility was available for
borrowing, except for $17.4 million of standby letters of credit issued on behalf of VF.

VF’s favorable credit agency
ratings allow for access to additional capital at competitive rates. At the end of 2013, VF’s long-term debt ratings were ‘A minus’ by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and ‘A3’ by Moody’s Investors
Service, and commercial paper ratings were ‘A-2’ and ‘Prime-2’, respectively. None of VF’s long-term debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings. However, if there were
a change in control of VF and, as a result of the change in control, the 2017, 2021 and 2037 notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies, VF would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal
amount of notes repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

Cash dividends totaled $0.9150 per common share in 2013,
compared with $0.7575 in 2012 and $0.6525 in 2011. The dividend payout rate was 33.8% of diluted earnings per share in 2013, 31.2% in 2012 and 32.7% in 2011. The current indicated annual dividend rate for 2014 is $1.05 per share.

As of December 2013, approximately $275.7 million of cash and short-term investments was held by international subsidiaries whose
undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested. VF’s intent is to reinvest these funds in international operations. If management decides at a later date to repatriate these funds to the U.S., VF would be required to provide taxes
on these amounts based on applicable U.S. tax rates, net of foreign taxes already paid.



Following is a summary of VF’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at
the end of 2013 that will require the use of funds:

(1)

Long-term debt consists of required principal payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations.

(2)

Other recorded liabilities represent payments due for long-term liabilities in VF’s Consolidated Balance Sheet related to deferred compensation
and other employee-related benefits, product warranty claims and other liabilities. These amounts are based on historical and forecasted cash outflows. Amounts exclude liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits and deferred income taxes.

(3)

Interest payment obligations represent required interest payments on long-term debt and the interest portion of payments on capital leases. Amounts
exclude amortization of debt discounts and acquisition costs that would be included in interest expense in the consolidated financial statements.

(4)

Operating leases represent required minimum lease payments. Most real estate leases also require payment of related operating expenses such as taxes,
insurance, utilities and maintenance. These costs are not included above and were approximately 22% of rent expense in 2013. Total lease commitments exclude $4.3 million of payments to be received under noncancelable subleases.

(5)

Minimum royalty payments represent obligations under license agreements to use trademarks owned by third parties and include required minimum
advertising commitments.

(6)

Inventory obligations represent binding commitments to purchase finished goods, raw materials and sewing labor that are payable upon delivery of the
inventory to VF. This obligation excludes the amount included in accounts payable at December 2013 related to inventory purchases.

(7)

Other obligations represent other binding commitments for the expenditure of funds, including (i) amounts related to contracts not involving the
purchase of inventories, such as the noncancelable portion of service or maintenance agreements for management information systems, and (ii) capital expenditures for approved projects.

VF had other financial commitments at the end of 2013 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under
certain circumstances:

•

Funding contributions to the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan are not included in the table because it is uncertain whether or when further
contributions will be required.

•

$88.5 million of surety bonds, standby letters of credit and international bank guarantees are not included in the above table because they represent
contingent guarantees of performance under self-insurance and other programs and would only be drawn upon if VF were to fail to meet its other obligations.

•

Purchase orders for goods or services in the ordinary course of business are not included in the above table because they represent authorizations to
purchase rather than binding commitments.



Management believes that VF’s cash balances and funds provided by operating activities,
as well as unused bank credit lines, additional borrowing capacity and access to capital markets, taken as a whole, provide (i) adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and long-term obligations when due, (ii) adequate liquidity to
fund capital expenditures and to maintain the dividend payout policy and (iii) flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise.

VF does not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes.

Risk Management

VF is
exposed to risks in the ordinary course of business. Management regularly assesses and manages exposures to these risks through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, by (i) taking advantage of natural hedges within VF,
(ii) purchasing insurance from commercial carriers or (iii) using derivative financial instruments. Some potential risks are discussed below:

Insured risks

VF self-insures a substantial portion of employee group
medical, worker’s compensation, vehicle, property, director and officer, and general liability exposures and purchases insurance from highly-rated commercial carriers for losses in excess of retained exposures.

Cash and equivalents risks

VF had $776.4 million of cash and equivalents at the end of 2013, which includes demand deposits, money market funds and short-term time deposits. Management continually monitors the credit ratings of the
financial institutions with whom VF conducts business. Similarly, management monitors the credit quality of cash equivalents.

Defined
benefit pension plan risks

VF has defined benefit pension plans that have risk associated with their investment
portfolios. At the end of 2013, VF’s pension plans were underfunded by $221.2 million, which is recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. VF has made significant cash contributions in recent years to improve the funded status
of the plans, including discretionary contributions of $100.0 million in both 2012 and 2013. VF will continue to evaluate the funded status and future funding requirements of these plans, which depends in part on the future performance of the
plans’ investment portfolios. Management believes that VF has sufficient liquidity to make any required contributions to the pension plans in future years.

VF’s reported earnings are subject to risks due to the volatility of its pension expense. Pension expense has ranged from $56.6 million to $92.7 million over the last three years, with the
fluctuations primarily due to varying amounts of actuarial gains and losses that are deferred and amortized to future years’ expense. The assumptions that impact actuarial gains and losses include the rate of return on investments held by the
pension plans, the discount rate used to value participant liabilities and demographic characteristics of the participants.

VF has taken several steps to reduce the risk and volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements. Beginning
in 2005, VF’s U.S. defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants, which did not affect the benefits of existing plan participants at that date or their accrual of future benefits. In March 2012, the investment strategy of the U.S. defined
benefit plan was modified to more closely align characteristics of the plan’s assets relative to plan liabilities, and to implement dynamic asset allocation targets dependent upon changes in the plan’s funded ratio, capital market
expectations, and risk tolerance. Management will continue to evaluate actions that may help to reduce VF’s risks related to its defined benefit plans.



Interest rate risks

VF limits the risk of interest rate fluctuations by managing the mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt. In addition, VF may use derivative financial instruments to manage risk. Since a significant
portion of VF’s long-term debt has fixed interest rates, the exposure primarily relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate short-term borrowings (which averaged $184.0 million during 2013) and the $400.0 million of floating rate
notes repaid during 2013, which together averaged $446.0 million outstanding during 2013. However, any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on VF’s cash equivalents. Based on the average amount of variable rate
borrowings and cash equivalents during 2013, the effect on reported net income of a hypothetical 1.0% change in interest rates is approximately $2.7 million.

Foreign currency exchange rate risks

VF is a global enterprise subject to
the risk of foreign currency fluctuations. Approximately 38% of VF’s revenues in 2013 were generated in international markets. Most of VF’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar
strengthened relative to the euro or other foreign currencies where VF has operations, there would be a negative impact on VF’s operating results upon translation of those foreign operating results into the U.S. dollar. VF does not hedge the
translation of foreign currency operating results into the U.S. dollar; however, management does hedge foreign currency transactions as discussed later in this section.

The reported values of assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For net advances to and investments in VF’s foreign
businesses that are considered to be long-term, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on those long-term advances are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. The U.S.
dollar value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with changes in the underlying functional currencies. VF generally does not hedge this balance sheet translation exposure.

VF monitors net foreign currency market exposures and enters into derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of exchange
rate fluctuations for a significant portion of forecasted foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions (relating to cross-border inventory purchases, production costs, product sales and intercompany royalty payments).
VF’s practice is to buy or sell primarily U.S. dollar contracts up to 80% of foreign currency exposures for periods of up to 24 months. Currently, VF uses only forward exchange contracts but may use options or collars in the future. This use of
financial instruments allows management to reduce the overall exposure to risks from exchange rate fluctuations on VF’s cash flows and earnings, since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the cash flows or
transactions being hedged.

For cash flow hedging contracts outstanding at the end of 2013, if there were a hypothetical
change in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% compared with rates at the end of 2013, it would result in a change in fair value of those contracts of approximately $156.4 million. However, any change in the fair value of the hedging contracts
would be offset by a change in the fair value of the underlying hedged exposure impacted by the currency rate changes.

Counterparty risks

VF is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative hedging instruments.
To manage this risk, we have established counterparty credit guidelines and only enter into derivative transactions with financial institutions with ‘A minus/A3’ investment grade credit ratings or better. VF continually monitors the credit
rating of, and limits the amount hedged with, each counterparty. Additionally, management utilizes a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize exposure to potential counterparty defaults and will adjust positions if necessary. VF also monitors
counterparty risk for derivative contracts within the defined benefit pension plans.



Commodity price risks

VF is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton, leather, rubber, wool and other materials, which we either purchase directly or in a converted form such as fabric or shoe soles. To manage risks
of commodity price changes, management negotiates prices in advance when possible. VF has not historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments.

Deferred compensation and related investment security risks

VF has
nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities to the plans’ participants are based on the market values of hypothetical portfolios of investment funds, including VF Common Stock, selected by the participants. VF invests in a
portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the participants’ investment selections. Except for investments in VF Common Stock, the increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are substantially offset by corresponding
increases and decreases in the market value of VF’s investments, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to operating results and financial position. The VF Common Stock is treated as treasury shares for financial reporting purposes, so any
gains or losses on shares held by the plans result in exposure to operating results and financial position as a result of the change in participant liabilities.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

VF has chosen accounting
policies that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report VF’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. VF applies these accounting policies in a
consistent manner. Significant accounting policies are summarized in Note A to the consolidated financial statements.

The
application of these accounting policies requires that VF make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, contingent assets and liabilities, and
related disclosures. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an
ongoing basis. Because VF’s business cycle is relatively short (i.e., from the date that an order is placed to manufacture or purchase inventory until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected), actual results related to most
estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date. In addition, VF may retain outside specialists to assist in valuations of business acquisitions, impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets, equity compensation, pension
benefits and self-insured liabilities. If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known.

VF believes the following accounting policies involve the most significant management estimates, assumptions and judgments used in
preparation of the consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors. The application of these critical accounting policies and estimates is discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Inventories

VF’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost includes all material, labor and overhead costs incurred to
manufacture or purchase the finished goods. Overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies. Market value is based on a
detailed review at each business unit, at least quarterly, of all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual style-size-color stock-keeping units (“SKUs”) to identify slow moving or excess products, discontinued and
to-be-discontinued products, and off-quality merchandise. This review matches inventory on hand, plus current production and purchase



commitments, with current and expected future sales orders. For those units in inventory that are identified as slow-moving, excess or off-quality, VF estimates their market value based on
historical experience and current realization trends. This evaluation, performed using a systematic and consistent methodology, requires forecasts of future demand, market conditions and selling prices. If the forecasted market value, on an
individual style or SKU basis, is less than cost, VF provides an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory. This methodology recognizes inventory exposures, on an individual style or SKU basis, at the time such losses are evident rather
than at the time goods are actually sold. Historically, these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to VF’s timely identification and rapid disposal of these reduced value
inventories.

Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis. VF provides for estimated inventory losses that have
likely occurred since the last physical inventory date. Historically, physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant. VF also conducts cycle counts at many locations throughout the year.

Long-lived Assets

VF
allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. VF evaluates fair value using three valuation
techniques — the replacement cost, market and income methods — and weights the valuation methods based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances. The process of assigning fair values, particularly to acquired intangible assets, is
highly subjective.

VF’s depreciation policies for property, plant and equipment reflect judgments on their estimated
economic lives and residual value, if any. VF’s amortization policies for intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets. In evaluating expected benefits
to be received for customer-related intangible assets, management considers historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers. For license-related intangible assets, management considers historical trends and anticipated license renewal
periods based on experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements, regardless of whether there are explicit renewal provisions.

VF’s policy is to review property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with identified useful lives for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. VF tests for possible impairment at the asset or asset group level, which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent. VF measures
recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group by comparison with estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset are not expected to be
adequate to recover the asset’s carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value.

VF’s policy is to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. VF first assesses qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing. If VF determines that it is not more likely
than not that the fair value of an asset or reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then no further testing is required. Otherwise, the assets must be quantitatively tested for impairment.

An indefinite-lived intangible asset is quantitatively tested for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset
with its carrying value. Fair value of an indefinite-lived trademark or trade name intangible asset is based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. Under this method, forecasted global revenues for products sold with the
trademark or trade name are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark or trade name (in lieu of ownership) from an independent party, and fair value is the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by owning
the trademark or trade name. If the



estimated fair value of the trademark or trade name intangible asset exceeds its carrying value, there is no impairment charge. If the estimated fair value of the trademark or trade name is less
than its carrying value, an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference.

Goodwill is quantitatively evaluated
for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a business unit with its carrying value. Reporting units are either coalitions or business units, if discrete financial information is available and reviewed by coalition management.
Two or more reporting units may be aggregated for impairment testing if they have similar economic characteristics. In the first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test, VF compares the carrying value of a reporting unit, including its
recorded goodwill, to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. VF estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using both income-based and market-based valuation methods. The principal method used is an income-based method in which the
reporting unit’s forecasted future cash flows are discounted to their present value. In the market-based valuation method, the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using multiples of revenues and of earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) for (i) a group of comparable public companies and (ii) recent transactions, if any, involving comparable companies. Based on the range of estimated fair values developed from the
income and market-based methods, VF determines the estimated fair value for the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required. However, if
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, VF performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the impairment charge, if any. The second step involves a hypothetical allocation of the
estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its net tangible and intangible assets (excluding goodwill) as if the reporting unit were newly acquired, which results in an implied fair value of the goodwill. The amount of the impairment charge is
the excess of the recorded goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill.

The income-based fair value methodology
requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which VF operates and conditions in the capital markets, many of which are outside of management’s control. At the reporting unit level, fair
value estimation requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific reporting unit, along with assessment of the reporting unit’s strategies and forecasts of future cash
flows. Forecasts of individual reporting unit cash flows involve management’s estimates and assumptions regarding:

•

Annual cash flows arising from future revenues and profitability, changes in working capital, capital spending and income taxes for at least a 10-year
forecast period. The forecast assumes that the business has matured and long-term growth levels have been reached by the end of this period.

•

A terminal growth rate for years beyond the initial forecast period. The terminal growth rate is generally comparable to historical growth rates for
overall consumer spending and, more specifically, for apparel spending.

•

A discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in realizing the forecasted cash flows. A discount rate considers the risk-free rate of return on
long-term Treasury securities, the risk premium associated with investing in equity securities of comparably-sized companies, the beta obtained from comparable companies and the cost of debt for investment grade issuers. In addition, the discount
rate considers any company specific risk in achieving the prospective financial information.

Under the
market-based fair value methodology, judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions. Management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market
participants performing similar valuations of VF’s reporting units.

In its fourth quarter 2013
intangible asset impairment testing, VF elected to perform a qualitative assessment for goodwill at all reporting units except for the

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

reporting unit and for trademark intangible assets at all reporting units except for the

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

and

7 For All Mankind

®

reporting units. Management did not elect to perform a qualitative analysis for the

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

and

7 For All Mankind

®

reporting units based on the results of previous impairment testing.



VF management performed a quantitative impairment analysis of the
goodwill and trademark intangible asset for the

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

reporting unit and concluded that the goodwill and trademark intangible assets for the

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

reporting unit are not impaired. For goodwill, the estimated fair value exceeded the reporting unit’s carrying value by approximately 50% in 2013 and 2012. The
estimated fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeded its carrying value by a significant amount in 2013 and 2012.

Additionally, VF performed a fair value assessment of the trademark intangible asset at the

7 For All Mankind

®

reporting unit, and determined that the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 20% or more in 2013 and 2012. The financial results for this business have reflected softness in the premium denim market in recent years,
which has been considered in our forecast. A portion of the original value of this intangible asset was impaired as part of the 2010 impairment analysis, and was written down from a carrying value of $311.8 million to an estimated fair value of
$305.2 million at that time. All goodwill related to the

7 For All Mankind

®

reporting unit was written off as part of the 2010 impairment analysis.

Key assumptions developed by VF management and used in our quantitative analysis of the

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

and

7 For All Mankind

®

reporting units include:

•

Projected revenue in excess of 2013 growth rates in all channels and geographies, particularly the direct-to-consumer businesses in the U.S.

•

Additional retail store openings in the U.S. based on updated market strategies

•

Market-based discount rates

•

Gross margin expansion (

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

reporting unit only)

•

Increased leverage of selling, general and administrative expenses on higher revenues (

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

reporting unit only)

•

Royalty rates based on license agreements currently in place

Actual results for the

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

and

7 For All Mankind

®

reporting units may vary. Accordingly, management performed sensitivity analysis on the impairment models and concluded that the reporting units and intangible assets
were not impaired, even with changes made to key assumptions. For example, a 50% decrease in the forecasted cumulative average revenue growth rate used in the intangible asset impairment models for the

7 For All Mankind

®

and

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

reporting units did not result in an impairment. Similarly for goodwill, a 50% decrease in forecasted segment profit did not impair the

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

reporting unit. Separately, a 100 basis point increase in the
discount rate did not indicate impairment in the

Splendid

®

and

Ella Moss

®

reporting unit, or the

7 For All Mankind

®

intangible asset.

For all other reporting units, VF elected to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the goodwill and trademark intangible assets in those reporting units
were impaired. In this qualitative assessment, VF considered relevant events and circumstances for each reporting unit, including: (i) overall financial performance including management’s five year forecast, current and prior year balance
sheets and actual to budgeted performance, (ii) industry and market conditions in which the reporting unit operates, (iii) macroeconomic conditions, including any deterioration of general conditions and (iv) changes in products or
services offered by the reporting unit. We also compared the carrying values of these assets against the fair value results from the most recent testing, noting that the fair value significantly exceeded carrying value in each case. Based on the
results of the qualitative assessment, VF concluded that it was not more likely than not that the carrying values of the goodwill and trademark intangible assets were greater than the fair values, and that further quantitative testing was not
necessary.

It is possible that VF’s conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or intangible assets
in any reporting unit could change in future periods. There can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing performed as of the fourth quarter of



2013 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future, if, for example, (i) the businesses do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in 2014 or future years vary
from current assumptions (including changes in discount rates), (iii) business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions, (iv) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in
the marketplace or (v) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and EBITDA.

A future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on VF’s consolidated financial position
and results of operations.

Stock Options

VF uses a lattice option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the Board of Directors. VF believes that a lattice model provides a
refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can incorporate (i) historical option exercise patterns and multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders and (ii) inputs
that vary over time, such as assumptions for interest rates and volatility. Management performs an annual review of all assumptions employed in the valuation of option grants and believes they are reflective of the outstanding options and underlying
Common Stock and of groups of option participants. The lattice valuation is based on the assumptions listed in Note O to the consolidated financial statements.

One of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before they are exercised. For each option grant, VF estimated the expected average life
based on evaluations of the historical and expected option exercise patterns for each of the groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns. These evaluations included (i) voluntary stock option
exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of VF Common Stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and (ii) involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover, retirement and mortality.

Volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment. Management based its estimates of future volatility on a
combination of implied and historical volatility. Implied volatility was based on short-term (6 to 9 months) publicly traded near-the-money options on VF Common Stock. VF measures historical volatility over a ten year period,
corresponding to the contractual term of the options, using daily stock prices. Management’s assumption for valuation purposes was that expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical
volatility over the remainder of the ten year option term.

Pension Obligations

VF sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most full-time U.S. employees hired before 2005 and an unfunded supplemental
defined benefit plan that provides benefits in excess of the limitations imposed by income tax regulations. VF also sponsors defined benefit plans covering selected international employees. The selection of actuarial assumptions for determining the
projected pension benefit liabilities and annual pension expense is significant due to amounts involved and the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid.

Management reviews annually the principal economic actuarial assumptions, summarized in Note M to the consolidated financial statements, and modifies them based on current rates and trends. VF also
periodically reviews and modifies, as necessary, other plan assumptions such as rates of compensation increases, retirement, termination, disability and mortality. VF believes the assumptions appropriately reflect the participants’ demographics
and projected benefit obligations of the plans and result in the best estimate of the plans’ future experience. Actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used.

One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate. (This discussion of discount rate, and the discussion
of return on assets in the next paragraph, relate specifically to the U.S. pension plans,



which comprise approximately 92% of plan assets and projected benefit obligations of the combined U.S. and international plans.) The discount rate is used to estimate the present value of future
cash outflows necessary to meet projected benefit obligations for the specific plan. It is the estimated interest rate that VF could use to settle its projected benefit obligations at the valuation date. The discount rate assumption is based on
current market interest rates. VF selects a discount rate by matching high quality corporate bond yields to the timing of projected benefit payments to participants in the specific U.S. pension plans. VF uses the population of U.S. corporate bonds
rated ‘Aa’ by Moody’s Investors Service or, if a Moody’s rating is not available, bonds rated ‘Aa’ by two other recognized rating services. From this population of approximately 500 such bonds having at least $50.0
million outstanding that are noncallable/nonputable unless with make-whole provisions, VF excluded the highest and lowest yielding bonds. Each plan’s projected benefit payments are matched to current market interest rates over the expected
payment period, and a present value is developed that produces a single discount rate that recognizes each plan’s distinct liability characteristics. VF believes that those ‘Aa’ rated issues meet the “high quality” intent of
the applicable accounting standards and that the 2013 discount rate of 5.00% for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and 4.90% for the unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan appropriately reflects current market conditions and the
long-term nature of projected benefit payments to participants in the aggregated U.S. pension plans. This higher discount rate, compared with the rate of 4.05% at the end of 2012, reflects the general increase in yields of U.S. government
obligations and high quality corporate bonds during 2013. The discount rate for the plans may differ from the rates used by other companies because of longer expected duration of benefit payments reflecting (i) the higher percentage of female
participants who generally have a longer life expectancy than males and (ii) the higher percentage of inactive participants who will not begin receiving vested benefits for many years.

Another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected long-term rate of return on investments. VF’s investment
objective is to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets with an acceptable level of risk to maximize the long-term return while minimizing volatility of the value of plan assets relative to value of plan liabilities. These risks include market,
interest rate, credit, liquidity and foreign securities risks. Investment assets consist of domestic and international equity, corporate and governmental fixed income and alternative assets. VF develops a projected rate of return for each of the
investment asset classes based on many factors, including recent and historical returns, the estimated inflation rate, the premium to be earned in excess of a risk-free return, the premium for equity risk and the premium for longer duration fixed
income securities. The weighted average projected long-term rates of return of the various assets held by the qualified plan provide the basis for the expected long-term rate of return actuarial assumption. VF’s rate of return assumption was
7.00% in 2013, 7.50% in 2012 and 7.75% in 2011. In recent years, VF has altered the investment mix to improve investment performance by (i) increasing the allocation to fixed income investments and reducing the allocation to equity investments,
(ii) increasing the allocation in equities to more international investments and (iii) adding alternative assets as an asset class. The changes in asset allocation are anticipated, over time, to reduce the year-to-year variability of the
domestic plan’s funded status and resulting pension expense. Based on an evaluation of market conditions and projected market returns, VF will be using a rate of return assumption of 6.50% for the U.S. plan for 2014. Management monitors the
plan’s asset allocation to balance anticipated investment returns with risk.

Differences between actual results and
the respective actuarially determined assumed results (e.g., investment performance, discount rates and other assumptions) in a given year do not affect that year’s pension expense but instead are deferred as unrecognized actuarial
gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At the end of 2013, there were $422.9 million of accumulated pretax deferred actuarial losses, plus $27.6 million of deferred prior service costs,
resulting in an after tax amount of $277.5 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the 2013 Consolidated Balance Sheet. These deferred losses will be amortized as a component of future years’ pension expense.

Pension expense recognized in the financial statements was $89.5 million in 2013, $92.7 million in 2012 and $56.6 million in
2011. This compares with the cost of pension benefits actually earned by covered active employees (commonly called “service cost”) of $25.4 million in 2013, $23.2 million in 2012 and $20.9 million in 2011. Pension expense for the last
three years was significantly higher than the annual service cost because those



years included the cost of amortizing prior years’ unrecognized actuarial losses (as discussed in the preceding paragraph). Looking forward, VF expects 2014 pension expense to decrease to
approximately $58.0 million primarily due to discretionary funding in 2013 and a decrease in amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses due primarily to an increase in the discount rate.

The sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on 2013 pension expense and on projected benefit obligations related to the U.S.
defined benefit pension plan at the end of 2013, all other factors being equal, is illustrated by the following:

As discussed in the “Risk Management” section above, VF has taken several steps to reduce
volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements. On a longer-term basis, VF believes the year-to-year variability of the retirement benefit expense should decrease.

Income Taxes

As a
global company, VF is subject to income taxes and files income tax returns in over 100 domestic and foreign jurisdictions each year. Almost every jurisdiction in which VF operates has a lower effective income tax rate than the U.S. As discussed
in Note P, VF has been granted a lower effective income tax rate on taxable earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions. We do not currently believe there is substantial risk to our ability to maintain a low foreign effective tax rate based
on the economic conditions of the jurisdictions in which we operate. However, VF makes an ongoing assessment to identify any significant exposure related to increases in tax rates in these foreign jurisdictions, and will supplement future
disclosures as applicable.

The calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax
laws and regulations, which are subject to legal interpretation and significant management judgment. VF’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and those audits may result in proposed
adjustments. VF has reviewed all issues raised upon examination, as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations. VF has evaluated these potential issues under the “more-likely-than-not” standard of the
accounting literature. A tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. Such judgments and estimates may change based on audit
settlements, court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent VF prevails in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which a liability
for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances has been established, or to the extent VF is required to pay amounts greater than the established liability for unrecognized tax benefits. VF does not currently anticipate any material impact on
earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties. There are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses.

VF has $123.7 million of gross deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards, and $101.9 million of
valuation allowances against those assets. Realization of deferred tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions, the amount and timing of which are uncertain, and
on possible changes in tax laws. If management believes that VF will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the



carryforward periods, VF records valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized. In addition, VF has $5.6 million of valuation allowances
against deferred income tax assets unrelated to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards. If in a future period management determines that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount, VF would record an
adjustment to income tax expense in that future period.

VF has not provided U.S. income taxes on a portion of the foreign
subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings because these earnings are permanently reinvested in the respective foreign jurisdictions. VF has not determined the deferred tax liabilities associated with these undistributed earnings, as such
determination is not practicable. If VF decided to remit those earnings to the U.S. in a future period, the provision for income taxes could increase in that period.

Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements

From time to time, VF
may make oral or written statements, including statements in this Annual Report that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These include statements concerning plans, objectives,
projections and expectations relating to VF’s operations or economic performance, and assumptions related thereto.

Forward-looking statements are made based on VF’s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting VF and therefore
involve a number of risks and uncertainties. VF cautions that forward-looking statements are not guarantees and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.

Known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results of operations or financial condition of VF to
differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements are summarized in Item 1A. of this Annual Report.

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, VF conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of VF’s “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) as of December 28, 2013. These require
that VF ensure that information required to be disclosed by VF in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time



periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to VF’s management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on VF’s evaluation, the principal executive officer
and the principal financial officer concluded that VF’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

VF’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). VF’s management conducted an assessment of VF’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework described in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework (1992),

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of VF Corporation (“VF”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). VF’s management conducted an assessment of VF’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework described in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (1992),

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, VF’s management has determined that VF’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 28,
2013.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of VF Corporation

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)1 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of VF Corporation
and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) at December 28, 2013 and December 29, 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2013 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information
set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2013,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial
statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of
internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 2013

Note A — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

VF Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively known as “VF”) is a global apparel and footwear company based in the United States. VF designs and manufactures or sources from independent
contractors a variety of products for consumers of all ages, including jeanswear, outerwear, footwear, packs, luggage, sportswear, and occupational and performance apparel. Products are marketed primarily under VF-owned brand names.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements and related disclosures are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”) in the U.S. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of VF and its majority-owned subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances. For consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly
owned, the noncontrolling interests in net income, comprehensive income and stockholders’ equity are separately presented in the consolidated financial statements. Investments in entities that VF does not control but has the ability to exercise
significant influence (generally 20-50% owned companies) are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Equity method investments are recorded initially at cost in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Those amounts are adjusted
to recognize VF’s proportional share of the investee’s earnings and dividends after the date of investment.

On
October 16, 2013, VF’s Board of Directors approved a four-for-one stock split of VF’s Common Stock payable in the form of a stock dividend. The stock dividend was distributed on December 20, 2013 to stockholders of record as of
December 10, 2013. Each stockholder of record as of the close of business on the record date received three additional shares of common stock for each share held. VF’s Common Stock began trading at the split-adjusted stock price on
December 23, 2013. Additionally, the Board of Directors amended VF’s Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock from 300 million to 1.2 billion and reduce the stated value applicable to the
Common Stock from $1.00 per share to $0.25 per share. All share and per share data presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the stock split and
the increase in authorized shares.

Fiscal Year

VF operates and reports using a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to December 31 of each year. All references to “2013”, “2012” and “2011” relate to
the 52 week fiscal years ended December 28, 2013, December 29, 2012, and December 31, 2011, respectively. Certain foreign subsidiaries report using a December 31 year-end due to local statutory requirements.

Use of Estimates

In
preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those
estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation

The financial statements of most foreign subsidiaries are measured using the foreign currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S.
dollars using

F-10


VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. Resulting translation gains and losses, and transaction
gains and losses on long-term advances to foreign subsidiaries, are reported in other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”). For a foreign subsidiary that uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency, the effects of remeasuring assets and
liabilities from the foreign currency into U.S. dollars are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Consolidated Statements of Income include net transaction gains of $9.1 million, $18.6 million, and $27.3 million in 2013, 2012 and
2011, respectively, arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of a particular entity.

Cash
and Equivalents

Cash and equivalents are demand deposits, receivables from third party credit card processors, and highly
liquid investments that have maturities within three months of their purchase dates. Cash equivalents totaling $474.0 million and $198.7 million at December 2013 and 2012, respectively, consist of money market funds and short-term time deposits.

Accounts Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts, less estimated allowances for trade terms, sales incentive programs, markdowns, chargebacks, and returns as discussed below in

Revenue
Recognition

. Royalty receivables are recorded at amounts earned based on the licensees’ sales of licensed products, subject in some cases to contractual minimum annual amounts from individual licensees. VF maintains an allowance for
doubtful accounts for estimated losses that will result from the inability of customers and licensees to make required payments. All accounts are subject to ongoing review of ultimate collectibility. The allowance is determined based on review of
specific customer accounts where collection is doubtful, as well as assessment of the collectability of total receivables considering the aging of balances, historical and anticipated trends and economic conditions. Receivables are written off
against the allowance when it is probable the amounts will not be recovered.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method and is net
of discounts or rebates received from vendors.

Long-lived Assets

Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill are initially recorded at cost. Improvements to property, plant and
equipment that substantially extend the useful life of the asset, and interest cost incurred during construction of major assets, are capitalized. Assets under capital lease are recorded at the present value of minimum lease payments. Repair and
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Cost for acquired intangible assets is fair value based generally on the present
value of expected cash flows. These expected cash flows consider the stated terms of the rights or contracts acquired and expected renewal periods if applicable. The number of renewal periods considered is based on management’s experience in
renewing or extending similar arrangements, regardless of whether the acquired rights have explicit renewal or extension provisions. Trademark intangible assets represent individual acquired trademarks, some of which are registered in over 100
countries. License intangible assets relate to numerous licensing contracts, with VF as either the licensor or licensee.

F-11


VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of
net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is assigned at the business unit level, which at VF is typically one level below a reportable segment.

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
ranging from 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment and up to 40 years for buildings. Amortization expense for leasehold improvements and assets under capital leases is recognized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease
terms, and is included in depreciation expense.

Intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives, consisting of major
trademarks and trade names, are not amortized. Other intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, contracts to license trademarks to third parties and contracts to license trademarks from third parties, are amortized over their estimated
useful lives ranging from three to 30 years. Amortization of intangible assets is computed using straight-line or accelerated methods consistent with the expected benefits to be received.

Depreciation and amortization expense related to producing or otherwise obtaining finished goods inventories is included in cost of goods
sold, and other depreciation and amortization expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

VF’s
policy is to review property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with identified useful lives for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be
recoverable. If forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset are not expected to be adequate to recover the asset’s carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its
estimated fair value.

VF’s policy is to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment
at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. VF first assesses qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it
is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing. If VF determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an asset or reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then no further testing is required. Otherwise, the
assets must be quantitatively tested for impairment.

An indefinite-lived intangible asset is quantitatively evaluated for
possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset with its carrying value. An impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. Goodwill is quantitatively evaluated for possible
impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a business unit with its carrying value, including the goodwill assigned to that business unit. An impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair
value.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized as assets and liabilities, respectively, and classified as
current or noncurrent based on the derivatives’ maturity dates. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments (i.e., gains and losses) depends on whether a derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a
hedging relationship and on the nature of the hedging relationship. The criteria used to determine if a derivative instrument qualifies for hedge accounting treatment are (i) whether an appropriate hedging instrument has been identified and
designated to reduce a specific exposure and (ii) whether there is a high correlation between changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the identified exposure based on the nature of the hedging

F-12


VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

relationship. VF’s hedging practices are described in Note U. VF does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Hedging cash flows are classified in the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same category as the items being hedged.

VF formally documents hedging
instruments and hedging relationships at the inception of each contract. Further, VF assesses, both at the inception of a contract and on an ongoing basis, whether the hedging instruments are effective in offsetting the risk of the hedged
transactions. Occasionally, a portion of a derivative instrument will be considered ineffective in hedging the originally identified exposure due to a decline in amount or a change in timing of the hedged exposure. In that case, hedge accounting
treatment is discontinued for the ineffective portion of that hedging instrument, and any change in fair value for the ineffective portion is recognized in net income.

The counterparties to the derivative contracts are financial institutions having at least A-rated investment grade credit ratings. To manage its credit risk, VF continually monitors the credit risks of
its counterparties, limits its exposure in the aggregate and to any single counterparty, and adjusts its hedging positions as appropriate. The impact of VF’s credit risk and the credit risk of its counterparties, as well as the ability of each
party to fulfill its obligations under the contracts, is considered in determining the fair value of the derivative contracts. Credit risk has not had a significant effect on the fair value of VF’s derivative contracts. VF does not have any
credit risk-related contingent features or collateral requirements with its derivative contracts.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when (i) there is a contract or other arrangement of sale, (ii) the sales price is fixed or determinable,
(iii) title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer and (iv) collection of the receivable is reasonably assured. Net sales to wholesale customers and e-commerce sales are generally recognized when the product has
been received by the customer. Net sales at VF-operated retail stores are recognized at the time products are purchased by consumers. Revenue from the sale of gift cards is deferred until the gift card is redeemed by the customer or the Company
determines that the likelihood of redemption is remote and that it does not have a legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift card to any jurisdiction under unclaimed property regulations.

Net sales are reduced by estimated allowances for trade terms, sales incentive programs, markdowns, chargebacks, and returns. These
allowances are estimated based on evaluations of specific product and customer circumstances, retail sales performance, historical and anticipated trends, and current economic conditions.

Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected from customers and
remitted directly to governmental authorities are excluded from net sales.

Royalty income is recognized as earned based on
the greater of the licensees’ sales of licensed products at rates specified in the licensing contracts or contractual minimum royalty levels.

Cost of Goods Sold

Cost of goods sold for VF-manufactured goods includes
all materials, labor and overhead costs incurred in the production process. Cost of goods sold for purchased finished goods includes the purchase costs and related overhead. In both cases, overhead includes all costs related to manufacturing or
purchasing finished goods, including costs of planning, purchasing, quality control, depreciation, freight, duties, royalties paid to third parties and shrinkage. For product lines having a warranty, a provision for estimated future repair or
replacement costs, based on historical and anticipated trends, is recorded when these products are sold.

F-13


VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses includes costs of product development, selling, marketing and advertising, VF-operated retail
stores, warehousing, distribution, shipping and handling, licensing and administration. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $671.3 million in 2013, $585.2 million in 2012 and $539.9 million in 2011. Advertising costs include
cooperative advertising payments made to VF’s customers as reimbursement for their costs of advertising VF’s products, and totaled $58.6 million in 2013, $51.7 million in 2012 and $48.5 million in 2011. Shipping and handling costs for
delivery of products to customers totaled $298.5 million in 2013, $269.1 million in 2012 and $242.5 million in 2011. Expenses related to royalty income, including amortization of licensed intangible assets, were $13.4 million in 2013, $12.6
million in 2012 and $9.1 million in 2011.

Rent Expense

VF enters into noncancelable operating leases for retail stores, office space, distribution facilities and equipment. Leases for real estate have initial terms ranging from 3 to 15 years, generally with
renewal options. Leases for equipment typically have initial terms ranging from 2 to 5 years. Most leases have fixed rentals, with many of the real estate leases requiring additional payments for real estate taxes and occupancy-related costs.
Contingent rent expense, owed when sales at individual retail store locations exceed a stated base amount, is recognized when the liability is probable. Rent expense for leases having rent holidays, landlord incentives or scheduled rent increases is
recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term beginning with the lease commencement date, or when VF has possession or control of the leased premises, whichever is sooner. Differences between straight-line rent expense and actual rent
payments are recorded in other assets or other liabilities as an adjustment to rent expense over the lease term.

Self-insurance

VF is self-insured for a substantial portion of its employee medical, workers’ compensation, vehicle, property and
general liability exposures. Liabilities for self-insured exposures are accrued at the present value of amounts expected to be paid based on historical claims experience and actuarial data for forecasted settlements of claims filed and for incurred
but not yet reported claims. Accruals for self-insured exposures are included in current and noncurrent liabilities based on the expected periods of payment. Excess liability insurance has been purchased to cover claims in excess of self-insured
amounts.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are provided on pretax income for financial reporting purposes. Income taxes are based on amounts of taxes payable or refundable in the current year and on expected future tax consequences of
events that are recognized in the consolidated financial statements in different periods than they are recognized in tax returns. As a result of timing of recognition and measurement differences between financial accounting standards and income tax
laws, temporary differences arise between amounts of pretax financial statement income and taxable income, and between reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax
assets and liabilities reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect the estimated future tax impact of these temporary differences and net operating loss and net capital loss carryforwards, based on tax rates currently enacted for the years
in which the differences are expected to be settled or realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions. Valuation allowances are used to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts considered
likely to be realized. U.S. deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries where such earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. Accrued income taxes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets

F-14


VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

include unrecognized income tax benefits, along with related interest and penalties, appropriately classified as current or noncurrent. The provision for income taxes also includes estimated
interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to VF Corporation by the weighted average number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share assumes conversion of potentially dilutive securities such as stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units.

Concentration of Risks

VF markets products to a broad customer base throughout the world. Products are sold at a range of price points through multiple channels
of distribution, including specialty stores, department stores, national chains, mass merchants, VF-operated stores and e-commerce sites. VF’s ten largest customers, all U.S.-based retailers, accounted for 21% of 2013 total revenues, and sales
to VF’s largest customer accounted for 8% of 2013 total revenues. Sales are generally made on an unsecured basis under customary terms that may vary by product, channel of distribution or geographic region. VF continuously monitors the
creditworthiness of its customers and has established internal policies regarding customer credit limits. The breadth of product offerings, combined with the large number and geographic diversity of its customers, limits VF’s concentration of
risks.

Legal and Other Contingencies

Management periodically assesses liabilities and contingencies in connection with legal proceedings and other claims that may arise from time to time. When it is probable that a loss has been or will be
incurred, an estimate of the loss is recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Estimates of losses are adjusted in the period in which additional information becomes available or circumstances change. A contingent liability is disclosed
when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss may have been incurred. Management believes that the outcome of any outstanding or pending matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on
the consolidated financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In December 2011 and January 2013, the FASB issued updates to their accounting guidance regarding disclosures about an entity’s right
of offset associated with its financial instruments and derivative financial instruments. The guidance became effective during the first quarter of 2013 and has been reflected in the notes to VF’s consolidated financial statements.

In February 2013, the FASB issued guidance requiring an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated
other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) by component. In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of AOCI by the respective line items of
net income, but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period. For amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to
cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts. The guidance became effective during the first quarter of 2013 and has been reflected in the notes to VF’s consolidated financial statements.

F-15


VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

In July 2013, the FASB issued an update to their accounting guidance which requires
unrecognized tax benefits to be netted with net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards in the Consolidated Balance Sheets if specific criteria are met. The guidance is effective January 2014 for interim and annual periods. The adoption of this
accounting guidance is not expected to have an impact on VF’s consolidated financial statements.

Note B — Acquisitions and Dispositions

Disposition in prior year

On April 30, 2012, VF sold its 80% ownership in John Varvatos Enterprises, Inc. (“John Varvatos”). VF recorded a $42.0 million gain on the sale which is included in other income (expense),
net.

Acquisitions in prior years

On September 13, 2011, VF acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of The Timberland Company (“Timberland”) for $2.3 billion in cash. The purchase price was funded by the issuance of $900.0
million of term debt, together with available cash on hand and short-term borrowings.

Timberland is a
global footwear and apparel company based in New Hampshire whose primary brands are

Timberland

®

and

SmartWool

®

. The results of Timberland have been included in VF’s consolidated financial statements
since the date of acquisition and are reported as part of the Outdoor & Action Sports Coalition. Timberland contributed $712.9 million of revenues and $49.2 million of pretax income in 2011.

This acquisition strengthens VF’s position within the outdoor apparel and footwear industry by adding two strong, global and
authentic brands with significant growth opportunities. Factors that contributed to recognition of goodwill for the acquisition included (i) expected growth rates and profitability of Timberland, (ii) the opportunity to leverage VF’s
skills to achieve higher growth in sales, income and cash flows of the business and (iii) expected synergies with existing VF business units. Goodwill resulting from this transaction is not tax deductible and has been assigned to the
Outdoor & Action Sports Coalition.

The

Timberland

®

and

®

trademarks and trade names, which management believes have indefinite lives, have been valued at $1,274.1 million. Amortizable intangible assets have been assigned
values of $174.4 million for customer relationships, $5.8 million for distributor agreements and $4.5 million for license agreements. Customer relationships are being amortized using an accelerated method over 20 years. Distributor agreements and
license agreements are being amortized on a straight-line basis over ten and five years, respectively.

Brands Private Ltd. (a joint venture in India) for $52.4 million. These acquisitions were accounted for as equity transactions since VF maintained control of these subsidiaries prior to the
acquisitions. Therefore, VF recorded a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $50.2 million in 2011 related to these transactions. The changes in VF’s ownership interests in these subsidiaries impacted consolidated equity during 2011 as
follows:

Note C — Accounts Receivable

VF has an agreement with a financial institution to sell selected trade accounts receivable on a
recurring, nonrecourse basis. Under the agreement, up to $237.5 million of accounts receivable may be sold to the financial institution and remain outstanding at any point in time. After the sale, VF does not retain any interests in the accounts
receivable and removes them from the Consolidated Balance Sheets, but continues to service and collect outstanding accounts receivable on behalf of the financial institution. At December 2013 and 2012, accounts receivable had been reduced by $136.4
million and $127.4 million, respectively, related to this program. During the years 2013 and 2012, VF sold a total of $1,259.7 million and $1,278.0 million, respectively, of accounts receivable at their stated amounts, less a funding fee charged by
the financial institution. The funding fee is recorded in other income (expense), net, and totaled $1.8 million in 2013, $2.0 million in 2012, and $2.0 million in 2011. Net proceeds of this program are classified in operating activities in the

Note I — Short-term Borrowings

International lending arrangements totaled $18.8 million and $12.6 million at December 2013 and 2012, respectively.
These arrangements primarily include short-term notes that had a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and 7.3% at December 2013 and 2012, respectively, and accepted letters of credit that are non-interest bearing to VF.

VF maintains a $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit (the “Global Credit Facility”) which supports the $1.25
billion U.S. commercial paper programs described below. The Global Credit Facility has a $750.0 million sublimit to borrow readily available non-U.S. dollar currencies and a $100.0 million letter of credit sublimit. The Global Credit Facility
expires in December 2016 and VF may request two extensions of one year each, subject to stated terms and conditions. Borrowings under the Global Credit Facility are priced at a credit spread of 90 basis points over the appropriate LIBOR benchmark
for each currency. VF is also required to pay a facility fee to the lenders, currently equal to 10 basis points of the committed amount of the facility. The credit spread and facility fee are subject to adjustment based on VF’s credit ratings.

The Global Credit Facility contains certain restrictive covenants, which include maintenance of a consolidated indebtedness
to consolidated capitalization ratio, as defined therein, equal to or below 60%. If VF fails in the performance of any covenants, the lenders may terminate their obligation to make advances and declare any outstanding obligations to be immediately
due and payable. At the end of 2013, VF was in compliance with all covenants, and the entire amount of the Global Credit Facility was available for borrowing, except for $17.4 million of standby letters of credit issued on behalf of VF.

VF has commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to $1.25 billion to the extent that it has borrowing capacity under the
Global Credit Facility. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 2013 and 2012.

Note K — Long-term Debt

Interest payments are due semi-annually on all fixed rate notes. The floating rate notes accrued interest
at the three-month LIBOR rate plus .75%, and were repaid during the third quarter of 2013.

All notes, along with any amounts
outstanding under the Global Credit Facility (Note I), rank equally as senior unsecured obligations of VF. All notes contain customary covenants and events of default, including limitations on liens and sale-leaseback transactions and a
cross-acceleration event of default. The cross-acceleration provision of the 2033 notes is triggered if more than $50.0 million of other debt is in default and has been accelerated by the lenders. For the other notes, the cross-acceleration trigger
is $100.0 million. If VF fails in the performance of any covenant under the indentures that govern the respective notes, the trustee or lenders may declare the principal due and payable immediately. At the end of 2013, VF was in compliance with all
covenants. None of the long-term debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings. However, if there were a change in control of VF and, as a result of the change in control, the 2017, 2021 and 2037
notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies, then VF would be obligated to repurchase those notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount plus any accrued interest.

VF may redeem its fixed rate notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount, plus
accrued interest to the redemption date, or (ii) the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted to the redemption date at an adjusted treasury rate, as defined, plus 20 basis points for the
2017 and 2021 notes and 25 basis points for the 2037 notes, plus accrued interest to the redemption date. In addition, the 2021 notes can be redeemed at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest to the redemption date within the three
months prior to maturity.

The 2021 notes have a principal balance of $500.0 million and are recorded net of unamortized
original issue discount. Interest expense on these notes is recorded at an effective annual interest rate of 4.69%, including amortization of a deferred loss on an interest rate hedging contract (Note U), original issue discount and debt issuance
costs.

The 2033 notes have a principal balance of $300.0 million and are recorded net of unamortized original issue discount.
Interest expense on these notes is recorded at an effective annual interest rate of 6.19%, including amortization of a deferred gain on an interest rate hedging contract (Note U), original issue discount and debt issuance costs.

Note M — Retirement and Savings Benefit Plans

VF has several retirement and savings benefit plans covering eligible employees. VF retains the right to curtail or
discontinue any of the plans, subject to local regulations.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Defined benefit plans provide pension benefits based on participant compensation and years of service. VF sponsors a noncontributory
qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most full-time domestic employees employed before 2005 (the “domestic qualified plan”) and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits in excess of
limitations imposed by income tax regulations (together, the “domestic plans”). The domestic plans comprise 92% of VF’s total defined benefit plan assets and projected benefit obligations at December 2013, and the remainder relates to
defined benefit plans covering selected international employees.

The components of pension cost for VF’s defined benefit
plans were as follows:

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The following provides a reconciliation of the changes in fair value of VF’s
defined benefit plan assets and projected benefit obligations for each year, and the funded status at the end of each year:

Pension benefits are reported in the balance sheet as a net asset or liability based on the overfunded or
underfunded status of the defined benefit plans, assessed on a plan-by-plan basis.

F-25


VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Accumulated benefit obligations at any measurement date are the present value of vested
and unvested pension benefits earned, without projection to future periods. Projected benefit obligations are the present value of vested and unvested pension benefits earned, considering projected future compensation increases.

Deferred actuarial losses are changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the value of plan assets resulting from
differences between expected amounts for a year using actuarial assumptions and the actual results for that year. These amounts are deferred as a component of accumulated OCI and amortized to pension expense in future years as follows: amounts in
excess of 20% of projected benefit obligations at the beginning of the year are amortized over five years; amounts between (i) 10% of the greater of projected benefit obligations or plan assets and (ii) 20% of projected benefit obligations
are amortized over the expected average remaining years of service of active participants; and amounts less than the greater of 10% of projected benefit obligations or plan assets are not amortized. Deferred prior service costs related to plan
amendments are also recorded in accumulated OCI and amortized to pension expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining years of service for active employees. The estimated amounts of accumulated OCI to be amortized to pension expense
in 2014 are $37.5 million of deferred actuarial losses and $5.4 million of deferred prior service costs.

Management’s
investment objectives are to invest plan assets in a diversified portfolio of securities to provide long-term growth, minimize the volatility of the value of plan assets relative to plan liabilities, and to ensure plan assets are sufficient to pay
the benefit payment obligations. Investment strategies focus on diversification among multiple asset classes, a balance of long-term investment return at an acceptable level of risk, and liquidity to meet benefit payments. The primary objective of
the investment strategies is to more closely align plan assets with plan liabilities by utilizing dynamic asset allocation targets dependent upon changes in the plan’s funded ratio, capital market expectations, and risk tolerance.

Plan assets are primarily composed of common collective trust funds that invest in liquid securities diversified across equity, fixed
income, real estate and other asset classes. Fund assets are allocated among independent investment managers who have full discretion to manage their portion of the fund’s assets, subject to strategy and risk guidelines established with each
manager. The overall strategy, the resulting allocations of plan assets and the performance of funds and individual investment managers are continually monitored. Derivative financial instruments may be used by investment managers for hedging
purposes to gain exposure to alternative asset classes through the futures markets. There are no investments in VF debt or equity securities and no significant concentrations of security risk.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was based on an evaluation of the weighted-average of the expected returns for the
major asset classes in which the plans have invested. Expected returns by asset class were developed through analysis of historical market returns, current market conditions, inflation expectations, and equity and credit risks. Inputs from various
investment advisors on long-term capital market returns and other variables were also considered where appropriate.

The fair
value of investments held by VF’s defined benefit plans at December 2013 and 2012, by asset class, is summarized below. See Note T for a description of the three levels of the fair value measurement hierarchy. Level 2 securities generally
represent institutional funds measured at their daily net asset value derived from quoted prices of the underlying investments. Level 3 securities represent alternative investments primarily in funds of hedge funds (“FoHFs”), which are
comprised of different and independent hedge funds with various investment strategies. The administrators of the FoHFs utilize unobservable inputs to calculate the net asset value of the FoHFs on a monthly basis.

VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

There were no transfers into or out of the Level 3 category during the year.

VF makes contributions to its defined benefit plans sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable laws, plus
discretionary amounts as considered prudent. VF made a $100 million discretionary contribution to the domestic qualified plan during both 2013 and 2012. VF does not currently plan to make any additional contributions to the domestic qualified plan
during 2014, but will continue to evaluate whether discretionary contributions would be appropriate. VF intends to make contributions totaling approximately $16.7 million to its other defined benefit plans during 2014. The estimated future benefit
payments for all of VF’s defined benefit plans are approximately $79.2 million in 2014, $81.8 million in 2015, $85.5 million in 2016, $89.0 million in 2017, $92.8 million in 2018 and $518.6 million for the years 2019 through 2023.

Other Retirement and Savings Plans

VF sponsors a nonqualified retirement savings plan for employees whose contributions to a 401(k) plan would be limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan allows participants to defer a
portion of their compensation and to receive matching contributions for a portion of the deferred amounts. Participants earn a return on their deferred compensation based on their selection of a hypothetical portfolio of publicly traded mutual
funds, a separately managed fixed income fund and VF Common Stock. Changes in the fair value of the participants’ hypothetical investments are recorded as an adjustment to deferred compensation liabilities and compensation expense. Expense
under this plan was $5.4 million in 2013, $4.7 million in 2012, and $4.3 million in 2011. Deferred compensation, including accumulated earnings, is distributable in cash at participant-specified dates or upon retirement, death, disability or
termination of employment. Similarly, under a separate nonqualified plan, nonemployee members of the Board of Directors may defer their Board compensation and invest it in hypothetical shares of VF Common Stock. VF also has remaining obligations
under deferred compensation plans of acquired companies. At December 2013, VF’s liability to participants under all deferred compensation plans was $276.2 million, of which $31.6 million was recorded in accrued liabilities (Note J) and $244.6
million was recorded in other liabilities (Note L).

VF has purchased (i) publicly traded mutual funds, a separately
managed fixed income fund and VF Common Stock in the same amounts as most of the participant-directed hypothetical investments underlying the deferred compensation liabilities and (ii) variable life insurance contracts that invest in
institutional funds that are substantially the same as the participant-directed hypothetical investments. These investment securities and earnings thereon (other than VF Common Stock) are intended to provide a source of funds to meet the deferred
compensation obligations, and serve as an economic hedge of the financial impact of changes in deferred compensation liabilities. They are held in an irrevocable trust but are subject to claims of creditors in the event of VF’s insolvency. VF
also has assets related to deferred compensation plans of acquired companies, which are primarily invested in life insurance contracts. At December 2013, the fair value of investments held for all deferred compensation plans was $247.7 million, of
which $30.0 million was recorded in other current assets and $217.7 million was recorded in other assets (Note H). The VF Common Stock purchased to match participant-directed hypothetical investments is treated as treasury stock for financial
reporting purposes (Note N), which is the primary reason for the difference in carrying value of the investment securities and the recorded deferred compensation liabilities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these investments (other than
VF Common Stock) are recorded in compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income and substantially offset losses and gains resulting from changes in deferred compensation liabilities to participants. VF sponsors 401(k) plans as well as
other domestic and foreign retirement and savings plans. Expense for these plans totaled $22.0 million in 2013, $18.7 million in 2012 and $16.9 million in 2011.

Note N — Capital and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Common Stock

Common Stock outstanding is net of shares held in treasury which are, in substance, retired. During 2013 and 2012, VF restored 17,016,484 and 76,000,000 treasury shares, respectively, to an unissued
status. There were no shares held in treasury at the end of 2013, 10,121,604 shares held in treasury at the end of 2012 and 77,158,760 shares held in treasury at the end of 2011. The excess of the cost of treasury shares acquired over the $0.25 per
share stated value of Common Stock is deducted from retained earnings.

In addition, VF Common Stock is held by the
Company’s deferred compensation plans (Note M) and is treated as treasury shares for financial reporting purposes, as follows:

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income consists of net income and specified components of other comprehensive income (“OCI”). OCI consists of
changes in assets and liabilities that are not included in net income under GAAP but are instead deferred and accumulated within a separate component of stockholders’ equity in the balance sheet. VF’s comprehensive income is presented in
the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The deferred components of other comprehensive income (loss) are reported, net of related income taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity, as follows:

The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of related taxes, are as follows:

Note O — Stock-based Compensation

VF is authorized to grant nonqualified stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock to
officers, key employees and nonemployee members of VF’s Board of Directors under the amended and restated 1996 Stock Compensation Plan approved by stockholders. Substantially all stock-based compensation awards are classified as equity awards,
which are accounted for in stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On a limited basis, cash-settled stock appreciation rights are granted to employees and accounted for as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Liability-classified awards are remeasured to fair value each reporting period until the award is settled. Compensation cost for all awards expected to vest is recognized over the shorter of the requisite service period or the vesting
period. Awards that do not vest are forfeited. VF has elected to compute income tax benefits associated with stock option awards under the short cut method as allowed by the applicable accounting literature.

Total stock-based compensation cost and the associated income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements recognized in
the Consolidated Statements of Income, and stock-based compensation costs included in inventory in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are as follows:

At the end of 2013, there was $47.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to all
stock-based compensation arrangements that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.1 years.

VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

At the end of 2013, there were 30,501,071 shares available for future grants of stock
options and stock awards under the 1996 Stock Compensation Plan. Shares for option exercises are issued from VF’s authorized but unissued Common Stock. VF has a practice of repurchasing shares of Common Stock in the open market to offset, on a
long-term basis, dilution caused by awards under equity compensation plans.

Stock Options

Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of VF Common Stock on the date of grant. Employee stock
options vest in equal annual installments over three years, and compensation cost is recognized ratably over the shorter of the requisite service period or the vesting period. Stock options granted to members of the Board of Directors become
exercisable one year from the date of grant. All options have ten year terms. The grant date fair value of each option award is calculated using a lattice option-pricing valuation model, which incorporates a range of assumptions for inputs as
follows:

Expected volatility over the contractual term of an option was based on a combination of the implied
volatility from publicly traded options on VF Common Stock and the historical volatility of VF Common Stock. The expected term represents the period of time over which options that vest are expected to be outstanding before exercise. VF used
historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and to estimate the number of options that would vest. Groups of employees that have historically exhibited similar option exercise behaviors were considered separately in estimating the expected
term for each employee group. Dividend yield represents expected dividends on VF Common Stock for the contractual life of the options. Risk-free interest rates for the periods during the contractual life of the option were the implied yields at the
date of grant from the U.S. Treasury zero coupon yield curve.

Stock option activity for 2013 is summarized as follows:

F-31


VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The total fair value of stock options that vested during 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $23.4
million, $20.4 million and $20.6 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $127.3 million, $112.9 million and $113.5 million, respectively.

Restricted Stock Units

VF grants performance-based RSUs to key employees as a long-term incentive. These RSUs enable the recipients to receive shares of VF
Common Stock at the end of a three year period. Each RSU has a potential final value ranging from zero to two shares of VF Common Stock. The number of shares earned by participants, if any, is based on achievement of a three year baseline
profitability goal and annually established performance goals set by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Beginning with grants made in 2012, the actual number of shares earned may also be adjusted upward or downward by 25% of the
target award, based on how VF’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) over the three year period compares to the TSR for companies included in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index. Shares are issued to participants in the year
following the conclusion of each three year performance period.

VF also grants nonperformance-based RSUs to a smaller group
of key employees and members of the Board of Directors. Each RSU entitles the holder to one share of VF Common Stock. The employee RSUs generally vest four years after the date of grant. The RSUs granted to members of the Board of Directors vest
upon grant and will be settled in shares of VF Common Stock one year from the date of grant.

Dividend equivalents on the
RSUs, payable in additional shares of VF Common Stock, accrue without compounding and are subject to the same risks of forfeiture as the RSUs.

RSU activity for 2013 is summarized as follows:

The weighted average fair value of performance-based RSUs granted during 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $40.64,
$36.37 and $23.94 per share, respectively, which was equal to the fair market value of the underlying VF Common Stock on the grant date. The total fair market value of awards outstanding at the end of 2013 was $141.8 million. Awards earned and
vested for the three year performance period ended in 2013 and distributable in early 2014 totaled 1,457,159 shares of VF Common Stock having a value of $85.8 million, as approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Similarly,
2,160,868 shares of VF Common Stock with a value of $82.1 million were earned for the performance period ended in 2012, and 2,104,656 shares of VF Common Stock with a value of $74.6 million were earned for the performance period ended in 2011.

The weighted average fair value of nonperformance-based RSUs granted during 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $39.21, $35.52 and $28.58
per share, respectively, which was equal to the fair market value of the underlying VF Common Stock on the grant date. The total market value of awards outstanding at the end of 2013 was $37.8 million.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Restricted Stock

VF grants restricted shares of VF Common Stock to certain members of management. The fair value of the restricted shares, equal to the fair market value of VF Common Stock at the grant date, is recognized
ratably over the vesting period. Restricted shares are issued in the name of the employee but generally do not vest until four years after the date of grant. Dividends are payable in additional restricted shares when the restricted stock vests and
are subject to the same risk of forfeiture as the restricted stock.

Restricted stock activity for 2013 is summarized below:

Nonvested shares of restricted stock had a market value of $51.7 million at the end of 2013. The market
value of the shares vested was $9.7 million, $2.5 million and $3.7 million during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

The differences between income taxes computed by applying the statutory federal income
tax rate and income tax expense in the consolidated financial statements are as follows:

Foreign rate differences include tax benefits of $6.9 million, $14.8 million and $1.8 million in 2013,
2012 and 2011, respectively, from the favorable audit outcomes on certain tax matters and from expiration of statutes of limitations.

VF has been granted a lower effective income tax rate on taxable earnings for years 2010 through 2014 in a foreign jurisdiction based on investment and employment level requirements. This lower rate, when
compared with the country’s statutory rate, resulted in an income tax reduction of $10.4 million ($0.02 per diluted share) in 2013, $6.3 million ($0.01 per diluted share) in 2012, and $6.2 million ($0.01 per diluted share) in 2011. In addition,
VF has been granted a lower effective income tax rate on taxable earnings in another foreign jurisdiction for the years 2010 through 2019. This lower rate, when compared with the country’s statutory rate, resulted in an income tax reduction of
$3.3 million ($0.01 per diluted share) in 2013, $8.1 million ($0.02 per diluted share) in 2012, and $5.5 million ($0.01 per diluted share) in 2011.

VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following:

As of the end of 2013, VF has not provided deferred taxes on $2,532.8 million of undistributed earnings
from international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. VF’s intent is to continue to reinvest these earnings to support the strategic priority for growth in international markets. If management decides
at a later date to repatriate these funds to the U.S., VF would be required to provide taxes on these amounts based on applicable U.S. tax rates, net of foreign taxes already paid. VF has not determined the deferred tax liability associated with
these undistributed earnings, as such determination is not practicable.

VF has potential tax benefits totaling $99.7 million
for foreign operating loss carryforwards, of which $93.3 million have an unlimited carryforward life. In addition, there are $4.8 million of potential tax benefits for federal operating loss carryforwards that expire between 2017 and 2027,
$18.4 million of benefits for state operating loss and credit carryforwards that expire between 2014 and 2029 and $0.8 million of benefits for federal capital loss carryforwards that expire in 2014. Some of the foreign and substantially all of
the federal and state operating loss carryforward amounts relate to acquired companies for periods prior to their acquisition by VF. A valuation allowance has been provided where it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets related to
those operating loss carryforwards will not be realized.

Valuation allowances totaled $90.2 million for available foreign
operating loss carryforwards, $10.9 million for available state operating loss and credit carryforwards, $0.8 million for federal capital loss carryforwards and $5.6 million for other foreign deferred income tax assets. During 2013, VF had a net
increase in valuation allowances of $3.8 million related to foreign operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets, an increase

VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

of $5.8 million related to state operating loss and credit carryforwards, a decrease of $1.9 million related to federal capital loss carryforwards, and an increase of $0.1 million related to
foreign currency translation effects. Of the $7.8 million increase in valuation allowances, $3.4 million relates to decreases in valuation allowances where management believes it is more likely than not that the underlying deferred tax assets
are realizable, $11.1 million relates to an increase in valuation allowances in state and foreign jurisdictions where the underlying deferred tax assets are not realizable, and $0.1 million relates to an increase for foreign currency effects.

A reconciliation of the change in the accrual for unrecognized income tax benefits is as follows:

VF files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as
separate and combined income tax returns in numerous state and foreign jurisdictions. In the U.S., the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) examination for tax years 2007, 2008 and 2009 was completed in 2012. VF has appealed the results of the
2007 to 2009 examination to the IRS Appeals office. Tax years prior to 2007 have been effectively settled with the IRS. The IRS commenced its examination of VF’s 2010 and 2011 tax returns during the fourth quarter of 2013 and Timberland’s
2010 and 2011 tax years during 2012. The IRS audit of Timberland’s 2008 and 2009 tax years was settled during 2012. In addition, VF is currently subject to examination by various state and international tax authorities. Management regularly
assesses the potential outcomes of both ongoing and future examinations for the current and prior years to ensure VF’s provision for income taxes is sufficient. The outcome of any one examination is not expected to have a material impact on
VF’s consolidated financial statements. Management believes that some of these audits and negotiations will conclude during the next 12 months. Management also believes that it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized income tax
benefits may decrease by $50.2 million within the next 12 months due to settlement of audits and expiration of statutes of limitations, $42.8 million of which would reduce income tax expense.

Note Q — Business Segment Information

VF’s businesses are grouped into product categories, and by brands within those product categories, for internal
financial reporting used by management. These groupings of businesses within VF are referred to as “coalitions” and are the basis for VF’s reportable business segments, as described below:

Management at each of the coalitions has direct control over and responsibility for its revenues,
operating income and assets, hereinafter termed “coalition revenues,” “coalition profit” and “coalition assets,” respectively. VF management evaluates operating performance and makes investment and other decisions based
on coalition revenues and coalition profit. Accounting policies used for internal management reporting at the individual coalitions are consistent with those in Note A, except as stated below. Common costs such as information systems processing,
retirement benefits and insurance are allocated to the coalitions based on appropriate metrics such as usage or employment.

Corporate costs (other than allocated costs directly related to the coalitions), impairment charges and net interest expense are not
controlled by coalition management and therefore are excluded from the measurement of coalition profit. Corporate and other expenses consists of corporate headquarters expenses that are not allocated to the coalitions (including compensation and
benefits of corporate management and staff, certain legal and professional fees, and administrative and general) and other expenses related to but not allocated to the coalitions for internal management reporting (including a portion of defined
benefit pension costs, development costs for

management information systems, costs of registering, maintaining and enforcing certain of VF’s trademarks, and miscellaneous consolidated costs). Defined benefit pension plans in the U.S.
are centrally managed. The current year service cost component of pension cost is allocated to the coalitions, while other pension cost components are reported in corporate and other expenses.

Coalition assets, for internal management purposes, are those used directly in or resulting from the operations of each business unit,
such as accounts receivable, inventories and property, plant and equipment. Corporate assets primarily include corporate facilities, investments held in trust for deferred compensation plans and information systems.

Financial information for VF’s reportable segments is as follows:

(a)

Includes operating results of The Timberland Company since its acquisition date of September 13, 2011.

(b)

Excludes operating results of John Varvatos Enterprises, Inc. since its disposition date of April 30, 2012.

Note R — Commitments

VF is obligated under noncancelable operating leases related primarily to retail stores, office space, distribution
facilities and equipment. Rent expense included in the Consolidated Statements of Income was as follows:

Future minimum lease payments are $313.6 million, $259.0 million, $210.7 million, $164.0 million and
$122.9 million for the years 2014 through 2018, respectively, and $298.8 million thereafter. In addition, VF will receive total payments of $4.3 million related to noncancelable subleases through 2016.

VF has entered into licensing agreements that provide VF rights to market products under trademarks owned by other parties. Royalties
under these agreements are recognized in cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Certain of these agreements contain minimum royalty and minimum advertising requirements. Future minimum royalty payments, including any required
advertising payments, are $65.0 million, $35.3 million, $34.3 million, $32.7 million and $1.6 million for the years 2014 through 2018, respectively, and none thereafter.

In the ordinary course of business, VF has entered into purchase commitments for raw materials, contract production and finished products. These agreements, typically ranging from 2 to 6 months in
duration, require total payments of $1.3 billion in 2014 and $8.8 million in 2015. In addition, VF has a remaining commitment to purchase $22.5 million of finished product in connection with the sale of a business in a prior year, with $15.0 million
and $7.5 million due in 2014 and 2015, respectively.

VF has entered into commitments for (i) service and maintenance agreements related
to its management information systems, (ii) capital spending and (iii) advertising. Future payments under these agreements are $65.5 million, $56.1 million, $28.2 million, $12.6 million and $0.1 million for the years 2014 through 2018,
respectively, and $0.6 million thereafter.

Surety bonds, standby letters of credit and international bank guarantees
representing contingent guarantees of performance under self-insurance and other programs totaled $88.5 million as of December 2013. These commitments would only be drawn upon if VF were to fail to meet its claims or other obligations.

Note S — Earnings Per Share

Outstanding options to purchase 0.9 million shares, 2.6 million shares and 1.9 million
shares of Common Stock were excluded from the computations of diluted earnings per share in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, because the effect of their inclusion would have been antidilutive. In addition, 1.3 million restricted stock units
in 2013, 1.5 million restricted stock units in 2012 and 1.8 million restricted stock units in 2011 were excluded from the computations of diluted earnings per share because these units have not yet been earned in accordance with the
vesting conditions of the plan.

Note T — Fair Value Measurements

Financial assets and financial liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified in a three level
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation process. A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The
hierarchy is based on the observability and objectivity of the pricing inputs, as follows:

•

Level 1

— Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

F-41


VF CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

•

Level 2

— Significant directly observable data (other than Level 1 quoted prices) or significant indirectly observable data
through corroboration with observable market data. Inputs would normally be (i) quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, (ii) quoted prices in inactive markets for identical or similar assets or liabilities or
(iii) information derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

•

Level 3

— Prices or valuation techniques that require significant unobservable data inputs. Inputs would normally be VF’s
own data and judgments about assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

Recurring
Fair Value Measurements

The following table summarizes financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured and
recorded in the consolidated financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis:

(a)

There were no transfers among the levels within the fair value hierarchy during 2013 or 2012.

The Company’s cash equivalents include money market funds and short-term time deposits that approximate fair value based on Level 1
measurements. The fair value of derivative financial instruments, which consist of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, is determined based on observable market inputs,

including spot and forward exchange rates for foreign currencies, and considers the credit risk of the Company and its counterparties. Investment securities are held in VF’s deferred
compensation plans as an economic hedge of the related deferred compensation liabilities (Note M). These investments are classified as trading securities and primarily include mutual funds (Level 1) that are valued based on quoted prices in active
markets and a separately managed fixed income fund (Level 2) that is valued based on the net asset values of the underlying assets. Liabilities related to the Company’s deferred compensation plans are recorded at amounts due to participants,
based on the fair value of the participants’ selection of hypothetical investments. Other marketable securities consist of common stock investments classified as available-for-sale, the fair value of which is based on quoted prices in active
markets.

All other financial assets and financial liabilities are recorded in the consolidated financial statements at cost,
except life insurance contracts which are recorded at cash surrender value. These other financial assets and financial liabilities include cash held as demand deposits, accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities. At December 2013 and 2012, their carrying values approximated their fair values. Additionally, at December 2013 and 2012, the carrying value of VF’s long-term debt, including the current portion, was $1,432.0 million and $1,832.0
million, respectively, compared with fair value of $1,568.4 million and $2,111.4 million at those dates. Fair value for long-term debt is a Level 2 estimate based on quoted market prices or values of comparable borrowings.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements

Certain non-financial assets, primarily goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are reported at carrying
value. However, these assets are required to be assessed for impairment on a periodic basis, and at least annually for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be
fully recoverable. In the event an impairment is required, the asset is recorded at fair value, using market-based assumptions. No impairment charges were required for goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2013, 2012 or 2011. In
addition, there were no material impairment charges related to property, plant and equipment or other intangible assets in 2013, 2012 or 2011.

Note U — Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

Summary of Derivative Financial Instruments

All of VF’s outstanding derivative financial instruments are forward foreign currency exchange contracts. Although derivatives meet the criteria for hedge accounting at the inception of the hedging
relationship, a limited number of derivative contracts intended to hedge assets and liabilities are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. The notional amounts of outstanding derivative contracts at December 2013 and December 2012 were
$1.9 billion, consisting primarily of contracts hedging exposures to the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, Japanese yen and Polish zloty. Derivative contracts have maturities up to 24 months.

Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross basis, even though they are subject to master netting agreements. However, if VF were to offset and record the asset and liability balances of all of its forward foreign currency exchange contracts on a net
basis in accordance with the terms of its master netting agreements, the amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 2013 and December 2012 would be adjusted from the current gross presentation as detailed in the following

Derivatives are classified as current or noncurrent based on maturity dates, as follows:

Cash Flow Hedges

VF uses derivative contracts primarily to hedge a portion of the exchange risk for its forecasted sales, purchases, production costs and intercompany royalties. The effects of cash flow hedging included
in VF’s Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income are summarized as follows:

Derivative Contracts Dedesignated as Hedges

Cash flow hedges of some forecasted sales to third parties have historically been dedesignated as hedges when the sales were recognized.
At that time, hedge accounting was discontinued and the amount of unrealized hedging gain or loss was recognized in net sales. These derivatives remained outstanding as an economic hedge of foreign currency exposures associated with the ultimate
collection of the related accounts receivable, during which time changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts were recognized directly in earnings. As discussed below in

Derivative Contracts Not Designated as Hedges

, VF now utilizes
separate derivative contracts to manage foreign currency risk related to the balance sheet exposures. Accordingly, 2013 is the last year during which dedesignations were recognized related to these cash flow hedges. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, VF
recorded net gains (losses) of $1.5 million, ($1.6) million and ($1.7) million, respectively, in other income (expense), net, for derivatives dedesignated as hedging instruments.

Derivative Contracts Not Designated as Hedge

s

VF uses derivative contracts to manage foreign currency exchange risk on intercompany loans as well as intercompany and third party
accounts receivable and payable. These contracts are not designated as hedges, and are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair values of these instruments are recognized directly in earnings. Gains or losses on
these contracts largely offset the net remeasurement gains or losses on the related assets and liabilities. Following is a summary of these derivatives included in VF’s Consolidated Statements of Income:

VF previously designated hedges of certain intercompany borrowings as fair value hedges. This practice
was discontinued effective January 1, 2012. The net impact of these hedging relationships in 2011 was a $2.4 million gain on foreign currency exchange and a $3.3 million loss on the related balance sheet items, both of which were recorded in
other income (expense), net.

Other Derivative Information

There were no significant amounts recognized in earnings for the ineffective portion of any hedging relationships during the years ended December 2013, 2012 and 2011.

At December 2013, accumulated other comprehensive income (“OCI”) included $22.6 million of pretax net deferred losses for
foreign exchange contracts that are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next 12 months. The amounts ultimately reclassified to earnings will depend on exchange rates in effect when outstanding derivative contracts are settled.

VF entered into interest rate swap derivative contracts in 2011 and 2003 to hedge the interest rate risk for issuance of
long-term debt due in 2021 and 2033, respectively. In each case, the contracts were terminated concurrent with the issuance of the debt, and the realized gain or loss was deferred in accumulated OCI. The remaining pretax net deferred loss in
accumulated OCI was $35.6 million at December 2013, which will be reclassified into interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining terms of the associated debt instruments. Of the $35.6 million, approximately $4.1
million is expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next 12 months.
