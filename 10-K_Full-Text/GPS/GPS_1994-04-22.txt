                                   PART I

Item 1 - BUSINESS

General

   The Gap, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the "Company") is a
specialty retailer which operates stores selling casual apparel,
shoes and other accessories for men, women and children under six
trade names: Gap, GapKids, babyGap, GapShoes, Banana Republic and
Old Navy Clothing Co. The Company was incorporated in the State
of California in July 1969 and was reincorporated under the laws
of the State of Delaware in May 1988. On March 28, 1994, the
Company operated 1,383 stores, including 841 Gap, 316 GapKids,
179 Banana Republic and 47 Old Navy Clothing Co. stores (40 of
the Gap and GapKids stores are located in the United Kingdom, 64
are located in Canada and 1 is located in France). 

     All of the Company's merchandise is private label. The Gap
stores offer casual clothing for men and women. GapKids was
introduced in 1986 to provide well-designed, comfortable clothing
for boys and girls ages 2-12. The babyGap line, offering mostly
natural fiber clothing for infants and toddlers, was added in
1990 and is sold in most GapKids stores. Banana Republic, Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary acquired by the Company in 1983, offers
classic, casual fashions for men and women. Old Navy Clothing Co.
was introduced in 1993 under the name Gap Warehouse and offers
basic and fashion casual clothing for men, women and children at
lower price points.

Merchandise Inventory, Replenishment and Distribution

     The retail apparel specialty business fluctuates according
to changes in customer preferences dictated by fashion and
season. These fluctuations especially affect  the inventory owned
by  apparel retailers, since merchandise usually must be ordered
well in advance of the season and sometimes before fashion trends
are evidenced by customer purchases. The Company is vulnerable to
changing fashion trends. In addition, the cyclical nature of the
retail business requires the Company to carry a significant
amount of inventory, especially prior to peak selling seasons
when the Company and other retailers generally build up their
inventory levels. The Company must enter into contracts for the
purchase and manufacture of private label apparel well in advance
of the applicable selling season. As a result, the Company is
vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to errors in
selection and timing of merchandise purchases.

     The Company reviews its inventory levels in order to
identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no
longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes) and may use
markdowns to clear merchandise. Markdowns may be used if
inventory exceeds customer demand for reasons of style, seasonal
adaptation, changes in customer preference or if it is determined
that the inventory in stock will not sell at its currently marked
price. Such markdowns may have an adverse impact on earnings,
depending on their extent and the amount of inventory affected. 

     Because the Company does not carry much replenishment
inventory in its stores, replenishment inventory is maintained in
the Company's distribution centers in California, Kentucky,
Maryland and Canada and in a distribution center owned and
operated by a third party in the United Kingdom, and then shipped
to the stores. 

Store Operations and Expansion

     The Company's stores offer a shopper-friendly environment
with a select assortment of casual clothing and accessories which
emphasize style, quality and good value. The range of apparel
displayed in each store varies significantly depending on the
selling season and the size of the store.

     The Company's stores generally are open seven days per week
(where permitted by law), three to six nights per week and most
holidays. All sales are made for cash, personal checks or on
credit cards issued by others.

     The Company opened 108 new stores and expanded 130 stores
during the 1993 fiscal year; the Company anticipates that it will
open approximately 185 to 200 new stores and expand approximately
90 stores during the 1994 fiscal year. Over the past four years,
the Company has increased the average size of its new stores and
expanded the size of existing stores. For fiscal 1993, the
average size of new and expanded stores was about 8,000 square
feet for The Gap, 4,400 square feet for GapKids, and 7,000 square
feet for Banana Republic. Expanded stores are excluded from
comparable store calculations until they have been open over one
year in their new size.

     The Company's continued success depends, in part, upon its
ability both to increase sales at existing store locations and to
open and operate stores on a profitable basis. There can be no
assurance that this expansion will result in enhanced
profitability or that it will continue at the same rate in future
years. In addition, the Company's strategy of expanding
domestically through new concepts (such as Old Navy Clothing
Co.), and internationally in countries in which the Company has
no, or limited, operating history could result in reduced
profitability if such expansion is not successful. 

     The Company is monitoring proposed federal health care
legislation and anticipates an increase in its operating costs if
such legislation is passed because the Company is a multi-state,
labor-intensive employer. The Company believes that it is too
early to quantify the economic impact of such legislation on the
Company due to uncertainty as to what legislation may ultimately
be adopted.

Suppliers

     The Company purchases merchandise from over 700 suppliers
located domestically and overseas. No supplier accounted for more
than 5% of the Company's fiscal 1993 purchases. All suppliers
manufacture the Company's private-label merchandise according to
the Company's specifications. During fiscal 1993, approximately
40% of all the Company's merchandise was produced domestically
while the remaining 60% was imported from overseas vendors.
Approximately 23% of foreign dollar purchases were from Hong
Kong, or about 15% of the Company's total merchandise, with the
remainder coming from 42 other countries. Any event causing a
sudden disruption of imports from Hong Kong, including the
imposition of additional import restrictions, could have a
materially adverse effect on the Company's operations.
Substantially all of the Company's foreign purchases are
negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars. 

     The Company cannot predict whether any of the foreign
countries in which its products are currently manufactured or any
of the countries in which the Company may manufacture its
products in the future will be subject to future import
restrictions by the U.S. government, including the likelihood,
type or effect of any trade retaliation. For example, currently
the United States government is considering imposing various
restrictions on the importation of goods from China, including
denial of most favored nation (MFN) status. Trade restrictions,
including increased tariffs or quotas, or both, against apparel
items could affect the importation of apparel generally, and, in
that event, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of
apparel available to the Company and adversely affect the
Company's business, financial condition and results of
operations. In addition, the Company's import operations may be
adversely affected by political instability resulting in the
disruption of trade from exporting countries, significant
fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign
currencies and restrictions on the transfer of funds.

Seasonal Business

     The Company's business follows a seasonal pattern, peaking
over a total of about 10 weeks during the late summer (August
through early September) and holiday (Thanksgiving through
Christmas) periods. During fiscal year 1993, these periods
accounted for approximately 30% of the Company's annual sales.

Competition

     The Company's business is highly competitive. The Company's
stores compete with national and local department, specialty and
discount store chains and independent retail stores which handle
similar lines of merchandise. Some competitors have larger sales
and assets than the Company.

     Depth of selection in sizes, colors and styles of
merchandise, merchandise procurement and pricing, ability to
anticipate fashion trends and customer preferences, inventory
control, reputation, quality  of merchandise, store design and
location, advertising and customer service are all important
factors in competing successfully in the retail industry. Given
the large number of companies in the retail industry, the Company
cannot estimate the number of its competitors or its relative
competitive position.

     The performance of the Company in recent years has increased
imitation by other retailers. Such imitation has made and will
continue to make the retail environment more competitive. In
addition, the success of the Company's operations depends upon a
number of factors relating to consumer spending, including 
future economic conditions  affecting disposable consumer income
such as employment, business conditions, interest rates and
taxation. A decline in consumer spending could adversely affect
the Company's net sales and profitability.

Advertising

     The Company's marketing strategy primarily involves
advertising in major metropolitan newspapers and their Sunday
magazines and in The New Yorker, with smaller amounts of print
advertising in lifestyle and fashion magazines, such as Vanity
Fair and Glamour. Other advertising media include various outdoor
venues, such as bus shelters, mass transit posters, billboards,
telephone kiosks and exterior bus panels,including double-decker
London buses. In addition, the Gap Division introduced in 1993 a
new print campaign for its khaki pants featuring celebrities in
the fields of the arts and motion pictures wearing khakis.

Employees

     On January 29, 1994, the Company had a work force of
approximately 44,000 employees. Additionally, the Company hires
temporary employees during the peak late summer and holiday
seasons. The Company considers its employee relations to be good.

Trademarks and Service Marks

     The trademarks and service marks for Gap, GapKids, babyGap,
GapShoes, Banana Republic and Old Navy Clothing Co., and other

Item 2 - PROPERTIES

     During fiscal year 1993, the Company opened 108 stores and
closed 45. The newly-opened stores include 45 Gap stores
(including 1 store in the United Kingdom, 5 stores in Canada and
1 store in France), 44 GapKids stores (including 2 stores in the
United Kingdom and 6 stores in Canada) and 19 Banana Republic
stores.  In addition, during fiscal year 1993, the Company
expanded 130 stores.  The expanded stores include 81 Gap stores
(including 2 stores in the United Kingdom and 6 stores in
Canada), 34 GapKids stores, 14 Banana Republic stores and 1 Old
Navy Clothing Co. store.  The 1,370 stores operating on January
29, 1994 aggregated approximately 7.5 million square feet. The
Company leases virtually all of its store premises for terms
generally ranging from 12 to 15 years. Most leases provide for
additional rent based on a percentage of store sales in addition
to or in lieu of minimum rentals, as well as for the payment of
certain other expenses. Some leases contain cancellation clauses
in favor of the Company if specified sales levels are not
achieved.  In the United States, the Company's stores are located
in all of the 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas.

     During fiscal year 1994, the Company plans to increase store
space by 15% to 20%, after taking into account store closings. 
This increase is expected to include the opening of approximately
185 to 200 stores worldwide and the expansion of approximately 90
of the Company's existing stores.

     The Company leases its headquarters and regional office
buildings, as well as its Eastern (EDC) and Canadian (CDC)
Distribution Centers. The EDC in Erlanger, Kentucky consists of
approximately 1,042,000 square feet. It distributes Gap, GapKids
and Banana Republic merchandise and its lease term runs through
February 28, 2003, with options to extend the lease for an
additional 30 years. The Company leases approximately 112,000
square feet in Brampton, Ontario to serve as its Canadian
distribution facility. The CDC distributes Gap and GapKids
merchandise and its lease term runs through August 23, 2000, with
options to extend the lease for an additional ten years.

     The Company owns its Western Distribution Center (WDC)
located in Ventura, California.  This facility, which is
approximately 334,000 square feet, distributes Gap and GapKids
merchandise.  The Company also owns an adjacent five acre parcel
for possible future expansion.  The Atlantic Distribution Center
(ADC), a facility owned by the Company in Edgewood, Maryland,
covers approximately 745,000 square feet and distributes Gap

     Interest at a rate of 4% to 9% is (was) paid monthly with outstanding
     principal and any unpaid interest due in full at dates ranging from
     September 1993 to August, 1998.

 A portion of loan was a non-interest bearing personal loan. 

 Loan was secured by a deed of trust on debtor's principal residence and

     interest bearing until April 1, 1992, at which time interest at a rate
     of 8% became payable monthly. 

 








 The average amount outstanding during the period is computed 
      by dividing the total of daily  outstanding balances by the number 
      of days in the year.

 The weighted average interest rate during the period is computed by 
      dividing the actual short-term interest expense by the average short-term 
      debt outstanding.


Note:     Refer to Note B of the Consolidated Financial Statements for 
          general terms of short-term borrowings.  Short-term borrowings
