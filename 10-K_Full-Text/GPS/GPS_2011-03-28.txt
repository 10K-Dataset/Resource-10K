THE GAP, INC.

2010 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM

10-K




Part I

Item 1. Business.

General

The Gap, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” and “our”) was incorporated in the State of California in July 1969 and was reincorporated under
the laws of the State of Delaware in May 1988.

We are a global specialty retailer offering apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men,
women, children, and babies under the Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Piperlime, and Athleta brands. Most of the products sold under our brand names are designed by us and manufactured by independent sources. We also sell products that are designed
and manufactured by branded third parties. We have Company-operated stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Japan, and beginning in November 2010, China and Italy. We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated
franchisees to operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in many other countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate or will operate stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names.

Gap.

Gap products are
sold in three channels: full price retail stores, online, and outlet. Founded in 1969, Gap stores offer an extensive selection of classically styled, high quality, casual apparel at moderate price points. Products range from wardrobe basics such as
denim, khakis, and T-shirts to fashion apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men and women. In 1986, we entered the children’s apparel market with the introduction of GapKids, and in 1989, we established babyGap. These stores
offer casual apparel and accessories in the tradition of Gap style and quality for children ages newborn through pre-teen. We also offer maternity apparel. In 1998, we launched GapBody, offering women’s underwear, sleepwear, loungewear, and
sports and active apparel. We operate Gap Outlet stores, which carry similar categories of products at lower price points. In 1997, we introduced Gap Online, an online store found at gap.com. Gap Online offers products comparable to those
carried in Gap, GapKids, babyGap, and GapBody stores, as well as extended sizes not found in stores. Beginning in 2010, customers in Canada can shop online at gapcanada.ca, customers in the United Kingdom and select European countries can shop
online at gap.eu, customers in China can shop online at gap.cn, and customers in select international countries can shop online at gap.com.

Banana Republic.

Banana Republic products are sold in three channels: full price retail
stores, online, and outlet. Acquired in 1983 with two stores, Banana Republic offers sophisticated, fashionable collections of casual and tailored apparel, shoes, accessories, and personal care products for men and women at higher price points
than Gap. We operate Banana Republic Factory Stores, which carry similar categories of products at lower price points. In 1999, we introduced Banana Republic Online, an online store found at bananarepublic.com, which offers products
comparable to those carried in the store collections, as well as extended sizes not found in stores. Beginning in 2010, customers in Canada can shop online at bananarepublic.ca, customers in the United Kingdom and select European countries can shop
online at bananarepublic.eu, and customers in select international countries can shop online at bananarepublic.com.

Old Navy.

Old Navy products are sold in two channels: full price retail stores and online. We launched Old Navy in 1994 to address the
market for value-priced family apparel. Old Navy offers broad selections of apparel, shoes, and accessories for adults, children, and babies, as well as other items, including a maternity line, consumables, and personal care products. In 2000,
we established Old Navy Online, an online store found at oldnavy.com. Old Navy Online offers apparel and accessories comparable to those carried in the store collections, as well as a plus size line not found in stores. Beginning in 2010,
customers in Canada can shop online at oldnavy.ca and customers in select international countries can shop online at oldnavy.com.

Piperlime.

In 2006, we
launched Piperlime, an online-only store found at piperlime.com. Piperlime offers customers an assortment of the leading brands in footwear, handbags, apparel, and jewelry for women and footwear for men and kids, as well as tips, trends, and advice
from leading style authorities. Beginning in 2010, customers in select international countries can shop online at piperlime.com.

Athleta.

Athleta products are sold in two channels: full price retail stores and online. Acquired in September 2008, Athleta offers customers high quality and performance-driven women’s sports and active
apparel and footwear that is stylish and functional for a variety of activities, including golf, running, skiing and snowboarding, tennis, and yoga. In May 2010, we opened a test store in Mill Valley, California, and in January 2011, we opened a
flagship store in San Francisco, California. Customers can purchase Athleta product, as well as an assortment of products from leading brands in women’s active-wear, online at athleta.com, through the catalog, or in our stores. Beginning in
2010, customers in select international countries can shop online at athleta.com.

All sales are tendered for cash, personal checks, debit cards, or
credit cards. We also issue and redeem gift cards through our brands. Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy each have a private label credit card program and a co-branded credit card program through which frequent customers receive benefits. Private
label and co-branded credit cards are provided by a third-party financing company.

Our stores offer a shopper-friendly environment with an assortment of
casual apparel and accessories that emphasize style, quality, and good value. The range of merchandise displayed in each store varies depending on the selling season and the size and location of the store. Stores are generally open seven days per
week (where permitted by law) and most holidays.

We ended fiscal year 2010 with 3,246 Company-operated and franchise store locations. For more
information on the number of stores by brand and region, see the table in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included as Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.

Certain financial information about international operations is set forth under the heading “Segment Information” in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Merchandise Vendors

We purchase private label merchandise from approximately 590 vendors and non-private label merchandise from approximately 430 vendors. Our vendors have facilities
in approximately 50 countries. No vendor accounted for more than 3 percent of the dollar amount of our total fiscal 2010 purchases. Of our merchandise sold during fiscal 2010, approximately 1 percent of all units (representing approximately 2
percent of total cost) were produced domestically, while the remaining 99 percent of all units (representing approximately 98 percent of total cost) were produced outside the United States. Approximately 27 percent of our merchandise units
(representing approximately 30 percent of total cost) were produced in China. Product cost increases or events causing disruption of imports from China or other foreign countries, including the imposition of additional import restrictions or vendors
potentially failing due to political, financial, or regulatory issues, could have an adverse effect on our operations. Substantially all of our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars. Also see the sections
entitled “Risk Factors—Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain” and “Risk Factors—Our Products are subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing, including increased product costs” in
Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Seasonal Business

Our business follows a seasonal pattern, with sales peaking over a total of about eight weeks during the end-of-year holiday period.

Brand Building

Our ability to develop and evolve our existing brands is key to our success. We
believe our distinct brands are among our most important assets. With the exception of Piperlime, virtually all aspects of brand development, from product design and distribution to marketing, merchandising and shopping environments, are controlled
by Gap Inc. employees. With respect to Piperlime, we control all aspects of brand development except for product design related to third-party products. We continue to invest in our brands and enhance the customer experience through the remodeling
of existing stores, the opening of new stores, the closure of under-performing stores, international expansion, the enhancement of our online shopping sites, additional investments in marketing, and continued focus on customer service.



Trademarks and Service Marks

Gap, GapKids, babyGap, GapBody, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Piperlime, and Athleta trademarks and service marks, and certain other trademarks, have been registered, or are the subject of pending trademark
applications, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with the registries of many foreign countries and/or are protected by common law.

Franchising

We have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap and/or Banana
Republic stores in a number of countries, including Australia, Bahrain, Bulgaria, Chile, Croatia, Cyprus, Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Oman, Philippines, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia,
Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Turkey, and United Arab Emirates. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. We continue to increase the number of
countries in which we enter into these types of arrangements as part of our efforts to expand internationally. For additional information on risks related to our franchise business, see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Our efforts to
expand internationally may not be successful and could impair the value of our brands” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Inventory

The cyclical nature of the retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to peak selling seasons when we,
along with other retailers, generally build up inventory levels. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes) and use markdowns to clear
merchandise. As we do not carry much replenishment inventory in our stores, much of our inventory is maintained in distribution centers. Also see the section entitled “Risk Factors—We must successfully gauge fashion trends and changing
consumer preferences to succeed” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Competitors

The global specialty apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We compete with local, national, and global department stores, specialty and discount store
chains, independent retail stores, and online businesses that market similar lines of merchandise. We are also faced with competition in European, Japanese, Chinese, and Canadian markets from established regional and national chains, and our
franchisees face significant competition in the markets in which they operate. Also see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Our business is highly competitive” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Employees

As of January 29, 2011, we had a
work force of approximately 134,000 employees, which includes a combination of part- and full-time employees. We hire seasonal employees primarily during the peak holiday period.

To remain competitive in the apparel retail industry, we must attract, develop, and retain skilled employees, including executives. Competition for such personnel is intense. Our success is dependent to a
significant degree on the continued contributions of key employees. Also see the section entitled “Risk Factors—We must successfully gauge fashion trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed” in Item 1A of this
Form 10-K.

quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish them to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Our past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance because actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the risks
and uncertainties discussed below. In addition, historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.



General economic conditions and the impact on consumer spending patterns could adversely impact our
results of operations.

The Company’s performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending.
Some of the factors influencing consumer spending include fluctuating interest rates and credit availability, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, higher levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels,
reductions in net worth based on market declines, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise,
generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty, and such conditions could adversely impact our results of operations.

Our business is highly competitive.

The global specialty apparel retail industry is highly
competitive. We compete with local, national, and global department stores, specialty and discount store chains, independent retail stores, and online businesses that market similar lines of merchandise. We face a variety of competitive challenges
including:

•

attracting consumer traffic;

•

sourcing merchandise efficiently;

•

competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value;

•

anticipating and quickly responding to changing fashion trends and consumer demands;

•

maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to consumers in several diverse market segments;

•

developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to consumers of varying age groups and tastes; and

•

providing strong and effective marketing support.

In addition, our franchisees face significant competition in the markets in which they operate. If we or our franchisees are not able to compete successfully in the United States or internationally, our results of
operations could be adversely affected.

We must successfully gauge fashion trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed.

Our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the fashion tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer
demand in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our purchases are long, which may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing fashion trends or consumer acceptance of our products. In addition, the competitive
landscape requires that more merchandise be produced through faster pipeline channels. The global specialty retail business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences, dictated in part by fashion and season. To the extent we misjudge
the market for our merchandise or the products suitable for local markets or fail to execute trends and deliver product to market as timely as our competitors, our sales will be adversely affected, and the markdowns required to move the resulting
excess inventory will adversely affect our operating results. Some of our past product offerings have not been well received by our broad and diverse customer base. Merchandise misjudgments could have a material adverse effect on our operating
results.

Our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing fashion trends depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel
in our design, merchandising, marketing, and other functions. Competition for this personnel is intense, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods.

Fluctuations in the global specialty retail business especially affect the inventory owned by apparel retailers, as
merchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the season and frequently before fashion trends are evidenced by customer purchases. In addition, the cyclical nature of the global specialty retail business requires us to carry a significant
amount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we build up our inventory levels. We must enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season. As a
result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. In the past, we have not always predicted our customers’ preferences and acceptance levels of our fashion items with
accuracy. If sales do not meet expectations, too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns, and therefore, lower than planned margins.

Our products are subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing, including increased product costs.

Independent third parties manufacture nearly all of our products for us. As a result, we are directly impacted by increases in the cost of those products

.

For example, cotton prices have risen substantially since the beginning of fiscal 2010, and we expect them to continue to rise in fiscal 2011. The current
increases in commodity prices, specifically cotton, may put pressure on our average unit costs and may impact our gross margins.

If we experience
significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing vendor, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or that any vendor would allocate sufficient
capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, for any new manufacturing source, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors in our methods, products, quality control
standards, and environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be able
to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could result in lower sales and net income.

Because independent vendors manufacture nearly all of our products outside of our principal sales markets, third parties must transport our products over large
geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with transitioning between
vendors, could adversely impact our financial performance. Manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as aircraft, which could adversely affect our gross
margins. In addition, the cost of fuel is a significant component in transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our gross margins.

Our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful and could impair the value of our brands.

Our current strategies include international expansion in a number of countries around the world through a number of channels and brands. For example, we currently
plan to open additional Gap stores in Europe and China, expand Banana Republic in Europe, open additional outlet stores in Canada, Europe, and Asia, and grow online sales internationally. We have limited experience operating in a number of these
countries. In many of these countries, we face major, established competitors. In addition, in many of these countries, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics, and other operating requirements differ dramatically from
those in the places where we have experience. Moreover, consumer tastes and trends may differ in many of these countries, and as a result, the sales of our products may not be successful or result in the margins we anticipate. If our international
expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our operations and financial results could be materially, adversely affected.

We also have entered into franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores in many countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell
apparel and related products under our brand names. However, prior to fiscal 2006, we had no experience operating through these types of third-party arrangements, and we can provide no assurance that these arrangements will be successful. The effect
of these arrangements on our business and results of operations is uncertain and will



depend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in new markets internationally and our ability to successfully identify appropriate third parties to act as franchisees,
distributors, or in a similar capacity. In addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store locations, store openings, and
sales. Other risks that may affect these third parties include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, and political instability. Moreover, while the agreements we have entered
into and plan to enter into in the future provide us with certain termination rights, the value of our brands could be impaired to the extent that these third parties do not operate their stores in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding
our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.

The market for prime real estate is competitive.

Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new stores nationally and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria
for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors, including our ability to negotiate terms that meet our financial targets. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases. In addition,
in recent years, we have been seeking to downsize, consolidate, reposition, or close some of our real estate locations, which in most cases requires a modification of an existing store lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully
modify existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Additionally, the current economic environment may make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of retail real estate properties within the United States and internationally. This could impact the quality of
our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and the quality of our decisions to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate
locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

We experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales and margins.

Our success depends in part on
our ability to improve sales, in particular at our largest brands. A variety of factors affect comparable store sales, including fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, the timing of new merchandise releases and promotional events,
changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs, and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations. Our comparable store sales have
fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual, quarterly, and monthly basis as demonstrated by a decrease of 12 percent in fiscal 2008, a decrease of 3 percent in fiscal 2009, and an increase of 1 percent in fiscal 2010. Over the past five
years, our reported gross margins have ranged from a high of 40 percent in fiscal 2009 to a low of 36 percent in fiscal 2006. In addition, over the past five years, our reported operating margins have ranged from a high of 13 percent in fiscal 2010
to a low of 8 percent in fiscal 2006.

Our ability to deliver strong comparable store sales results and margins depends in large part on accurately
forecasting demand and fashion trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base, managing inventory effectively, using effective pricing strategies, and optimizing
store performance. Failure to meet the expectations of investors, securities analysts, or credit rating agencies in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our common stock and cause our credit ratings to decline.

Changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the capital markets.

Although we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with future cash flow from our operations will be adequate to satisfy our business operations
needs for the foreseeable future, we may require additional cash for unexpected contingencies.

There can be no assurance that our current levels of liquidity will continue or that our ability to access the credit
or capital markets will not be adversely affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy.

Any future reduction in our long-term
senior unsecured credit rating could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets and higher interest costs on future financings.

As of
January 29, 2011, the Company had $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.

For further information on our credit
facilities, see the section entitled “Credit Facilities” in our “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included as Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.

Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain.

Trade
restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of
apparel available to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be
subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. and other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions. In addition, we face the possibility of anti-dumping or countervailing duties lawsuits
from U.S. domestic producers. We are unable to determine the impact of the changes to the quota system or the impact that potential tariff lawsuits could have on our global sourcing operations. Our sourcing operations may be adversely affected by
trade limits or political and financial instability, resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries, significant fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and/or
other trade disruptions.

Updates or changes to our IT systems may disrupt operations.

We continue to evaluate and implement upgrades to our IT systems. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing
systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions, and believe we are taking appropriate
action to mitigate the risks through testing, training, and staging implementation, as well as ensuring appropriate commercial contracts are in place with third-party vendors supplying such replacement technologies. However, there can be no
assurances that we will successfully launch these systems as planned or that they will occur without disruptions to our operations. IT system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, or failure to successfully implement new
or upgraded systems, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our IT services agreement with IBM could cause
disruptions in our operations and have an adverse effect on our financial results.

We have entered into the sixth year of a ten-year non-exclusive
services agreement with International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”) under which IBM operates certain significant aspects of our IT infrastructure. Under the original agreement, this included supporting our mainframe, server,
network and data center, and store operations, as well as help desk, end user support, and some disaster recovery. The agreement was amended effective March 2, 2009 to return to us certain services originally performed by IBM under the
agreement. These returned services include services related to management of our server and data center environment, along with disaster recovery. All other services remain with IBM per the original agreement. Our ability to realize the expected
benefits of this arrangement is subject to various risks, some of which are not within our complete control. These risks include, but are not limited to, disruption in services and the failure to protect the security and integrity of the
Company’s data under the terms of the agreement. We are unable to provide assurances that some or all of these risks will not occur. Failure to effectively mitigate these risks, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our
operations and financial results.



Failure of our vendors to adhere to our code of vendor conduct could harm our business.

We purchase nearly all merchandise from third-party vendors outside of the United States and require those vendors to adhere to a code of vendor conduct and other
environmental, labor, health, and safety standards for the benefit of workers. From time to time, contractors may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable local laws. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and
laws by one or more contractors could have a negative impact on our reputation and an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Changes
in the regulatory or administrative landscape could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Laws and regulations at the
state, federal, and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that may result from changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape. Any
changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts employment and labor, trade, product safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, privacy, or
environmental issues, among others, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

Item 2. Properties.

We have Company-operated stores in the United
States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Japan, China, and Italy. As of January 29, 2011, the Company-operated stores aggregated approximately 38.2 million square feet. Almost all of these stores are leased, with one or more
renewal options after our initial term, or have slightly longer terms with negotiated termination clauses at predetermined sales thresholds. Economic terms vary by type of location.

We own approximately 1.2 million square feet of corporate office space located in San Francisco, San Bruno, and Rocklin, California, of which approximately 184,000 square feet is leased to and occupied by
another company and approximately 264,000 square feet is leased to but not yet surrendered to another company. We lease approximately 1.1 million square feet of corporate office space located in San Francisco, San Bruno, Rocklin, and Petaluma,
California; New York, New York; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Of the 1.1 million square feet of leased office space, approximately 230,000 square feet is under sublease to others and approximately 15,000 square feet is
being marketed for sublease to others. We also lease 13 regional offices in North America and approximately 30 international offices. We own approximately 8.6 million square feet of distribution space located in Fresno, California; Fishkill,
New York; Groveport, Ohio; Gallatin, Tennessee; Brampton, Ontario, Canada; and Rugby, England. We lease approximately 2.4 million square feet of distribution space located in Phoenix, Arizona; Grove City, Ohio; Northern Kentucky; Bolton,
Ontario, Canada; and Stafford, England. Of the 2.4 million square feet of leased distribution space, 100,000 square feet is under sublease to others. Two separate third-party logistics companies provide logistics services to us through a
459,000 square foot distribution warehouse in Chiba, Japan and a 43,000 square foot distribution warehouse in Shanghai, China.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

As a multinational company, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims (“Actions”) arising in the ordinary course of our
business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, intellectual property, customer, employment, data privacy, and securities related
claims, including class action lawsuits. The plaintiffs in some Actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages, and some are covered in part by insurance.

We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of Actions brought against us. Accordingly, adverse developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and negatively
impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement, or resolution. However, we do not believe that the outcome of any current Action would have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations.

Overview

We are a global specialty retailer offering apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, children, and babies under the Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Piperlime, and Athleta brands. We have
Company-operated stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Japan, and beginning in November 2010, China and Italy. We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap and Banana Republic
stores in many other countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate or will operate stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. In addition, our products are available to customers online in over
90 countries. Most of the products sold under our brand names are designed by us and manufactured by independent sources. We also sell products that are designed and manufactured by branded third parties.

We identify our operating segments based on the way we manage and evaluate our business activities. We have two reportable segments: Stores and Direct.

Financial highlights for fiscal 2010 include the following:

•

Net sales for fiscal 2010 increased 3 percent to $14.7 billion compared with $14.2 billion for fiscal 2009, and comparable store sales increased 1 percent
compared with a decrease of 3 percent last year.

•

Direct net sales for fiscal 2010 increased 16 percent to $1.3 billion compared with $1.1 billion for fiscal 2009. Our Direct reportable segment includes sales
for each of our online brands.

•

Net sales for Direct and international as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal 2010 increased 2 percent to 22 percent compared with 20 percent for
fiscal 2009.

•

Operating margin for fiscal 2010 was 13.4 percent compared with 12.8 percent for fiscal 2009. Operating margin is defined as operating income as a percentage of
net sales.

•

Net income for fiscal 2010 increased 9.3 percent to $1.2 billion compared with $1.1 billion for fiscal 2009. Diluted earnings per share increased to $1.88 for
fiscal 2010 compared with $1.58 for fiscal 2009.

•

In fiscal 2010, we generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion compared with free cash flow of $1.6 billion for fiscal 2009. Free cash flow is defined as net
cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. For a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, from a GAAP financial measure, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.

Our business and financial priorities for fiscal 2011 are as follows:

•

grow revenues by consistently delivering product that resonates with our target customers around the world;

•

maintain a focus on cost management and return on invested capital;

•

generate strong free cash flow and return cash to shareholders; and

•

invest in the future while delivering earnings per share growth.

As we focus on growing revenues in our more mature North America market in fiscal 2011, we plan to continue growing revenues internationally through the following:

•

opening additional stores, many of which will be outlets, in Canada, Europe, and Asia;

•

continuing to open franchise stores worldwide; and

•

continuing to offer our online shopping experience to customers in international locations.

Results of Operations

Net Sales

Net sales primarily consist of retail sales, online sales, wholesale and franchise
revenues, and shipping fees received from customers for delivery of merchandise.

See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for net sales by brand, region, and reportable segment.

Comparable Store Sales

The percentage change in comparable store (“Comp”) sales by brand and region and for total Company, as compared with the preceding year,
is as follows:

Only the Company-operated stores are included in the
calculation of Comp sales. The Comp sales calculation excludes sales from our online and catalog businesses and wholesale and franchise businesses. Gap and Banana Republic outlet Comp sales are reflected within the respective results of each
brand.

A store is included in Comp when it has been open for at least 12 months and the selling square footage has not changed by 15 percent or more
within the past year. A store is included in Comp on the first day it has comparable prior year sales. Stores in which the selling square footage has changed by 15 percent or more as a result of a remodel, expansion, or reduction are excluded from
Comp until the first day they have comparable prior year sales. Current year foreign exchange rates are applied to both current year and prior year Comp sales to achieve a consistent basis for comparison.

A store is considered non-comparable (“Non-comp”) when it has been open for less than 12 months or has changed its selling square footage by 15 percent or
more within the past year.

A store is considered “Closed” if it is temporarily closed for three or more full consecutive days or is
permanently closed. When a temporarily closed store reopens, the store will be placed in the Comp/Non-comp status it was in prior to its closure. If a store was in Closed status for three or more days in the prior year, the store will be in Non-comp
status for the same days the following year.

Beginning in fiscal 2011, the Company reports comparable sales including the associated comparable online
sales. Online comparable sales are defined as sales through online channels in regions where we have existing comparable store sales. The Company’s comparable sales including the associated comparable online sales increased 2 percent for fiscal
2010.

Store Count and Square Footage Information

Net sales per average square foot is as follows:

Excludes net sales associated with our online, catalog, wholesale, and franchise businesses.



Store count, openings, closings, and square footage for our stores are as follows:

Gap and Banana Republic outlet stores are reflected in each of
the respective brands. We have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in Asia, Australia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East.

We expect to open about 115 new Company-operated store locations and close about 125 Company-operated store locations in fiscal 2011. As a result of these net store closures and through downsizes, we expect net
square footage for Company-operated stores to decrease about 3 percent for fiscal 2011. We also expect to open about 75 new franchise stores in fiscal 2011.

Net Sales Discussion

Our net sales for fiscal 2010 increased $467 million, or 3 percent, compared
with fiscal 2009 due to an increase in net sales of $286 million related to our Stores reportable segment and an increase in net sales of $181 million related to our Direct reportable segment.

•

For the Stores reportable segment, our net sales for fiscal 2010 increased $286 million, or 2 percent, compared with fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily due
to an increase in net sales at our new international stores, an increase in comparable store sales of 1 percent, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $116 million. The foreign exchange impact is the translation impact if net sales for
fiscal 2009 were translated at fiscal 2010 exchange rates.

•

For the Direct reportable segment, our net sales for fiscal 2010 increased $181 million, or 16 percent, compared with fiscal 2009. The increase was due to the
growth in our online business across all brands, primarily Old Navy, Piperlime, and Athleta, and due to the introduction of international online sales in fiscal 2010.

Our net sales for fiscal 2009 decreased $329 million, or 2 percent, compared with fiscal 2008 due to a decrease in net sales of $417 million related to our Stores reportable segment, partially offset by an increase
in net sales of $88 million related to our Direct reportable segment.

•

For the Stores reportable segment, our net sales for fiscal 2009 decreased $417 million, or 3 percent, compared with fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due
to a decline in net sales at Gap and Banana Republic and the $32 million unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by an increase in net sales at Old Navy. The foreign exchange impact is the translation impact if net sales for fiscal
2008 were translated at fiscal 2009 exchange rates. Comparable store sales for fiscal 2009 decreased 3 percent compared with fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the continued difficult retail environment.

•

For the Direct reportable segment, our net sales for fiscal 2009 increased $88 million, or 9 percent, compared with fiscal 2008. The increase was primarily due
to incremental sales related to Athleta, which was acquired in September 2008.

Cost of Goods Sold and Occupancy Expenses

Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of
net sales increased 0.1 percentage points in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009.

•

Cost of goods sold increased 0.7 percentage points as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. The increase as a percentage of net
sales was primarily driven by lower margins for both regular price and marked down merchandise.

•

Occupancy expenses decreased 0.6 percentage points as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. The decrease in occupancy expenses was
primarily driven by reduced expenses due to store closures and fully depreciated assets, partially offset by higher expenses due to store remodels and international store openings and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $22 million.

Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 2.8 percentage points in fiscal 2009 compared with
fiscal 2008.

•

Cost of goods sold decreased 2.9 percentage points as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily driven by
reduced cost of merchandise from our cost management efforts and a decrease in selling at markdown.

•

Occupancy expenses increased 0.1 percentage points as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The increase as a percentage of net
sales was primarily driven by higher depreciation expense for new information technology systems and applications and incremental expenses related to the integration of Athleta, which was acquired in September 2008.



Operating Expenses

Operating expenses increased $12 million, but decreased 0.8
percentage points as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. The increase in operating expenses was mainly due to higher store payroll, store benefits, and other store-related expenses and higher expenses due to our New
York and San Francisco headquarter office moves, partially offset by a decrease in bonus expense.

Operating expenses increased $10 million, or 0.7
percentage points as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The increase was mainly due to increased marketing expenses primarily for Gap and Old Navy, offset by decreased store payroll and benefits and other
store-related expenses.

Interest Expense

Interest expense (reversal)

Interest expense for fiscal 2010 includes an interest
expense reversal of $15 million from the reduction of interest expense accruals resulting primarily from the filing of a U.S. federal income tax accounting method change application and the resolution of the IRS’s review of the Company’s
federal income tax returns and refund claims for fiscal 2001 through 2006.

Interest expense for fiscal 2008 includes an interest expense reversal of $9
million from the reduction of interest expense accruals resulting primarily from foreign tax audit events occurring in the period.

The decrease in
interest expense, net of interest expense reversal, for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was primarily due to the maturities of our $138 million, 8.80 percent notes repaid in December 2008 and $50 million, 6.25 percent notes repaid in March
2009.

Interest income decreased for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates.

Income Taxes

Although the effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 remained
unchanged from fiscal 2009, there were changes in individual components of the effective tax rate. The tax impact of foreign operations increased primarily due to the recording of valuation allowances related to losses incurred by our China
subsidiaries and incremental tax expense

related to the repatriation of earnings from our Canadian subsidiaries. The increase was primarily offset by the release of unrecognized tax benefits for closed years.

The increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was primarily driven by providing U.S. taxes on certain foreign earnings, the
impact of changes in state tax laws, and a change in the mix of income between domestic and international operations.

We currently expect the fiscal
2011 effective tax rate to be about 39 percent. The actual rate will ultimately depend on several variables, including the mix of income between domestic and international operations, the overall level of income, the potential resolution of
outstanding tax contingencies, and changes in tax laws and rates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our largest source of cash flows is cash collections from the sale of our merchandise. Our primary uses of cash include merchandise inventory purchases, occupancy
costs, personnel-related expenses, purchases of property and equipment, payment of taxes, and share repurchases. In addition to share repurchases, we also continue to return cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends.

We consider the following to be measures of our liquidity and capital resources:

Our working capital and current ratio as of
January 29, 2011 decreased compared with January 30, 2010, primarily due to decreases in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. See Cash Flows discussed below.

As of January 29, 2011, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.7 billion. Our operating cash flow generation and cash position remain strong. We believe that current cash balances and
cash flows from our operations will be sufficient to support our business operations, including growth initiatives and planned capital expenditures, for the next 12 months and beyond. We are also able to supplement near-term liquidity, if
necessary, with our existing $500 million revolving credit facility.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2010 decreased $184 million compared with fiscal 2009, primarily due to the following:

•

an increase in inventory purchases in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009;

•

a higher fiscal 2009 bonus payout in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 compared with the fiscal 2008 bonus payout in the first quarter of fiscal 2009; partially
offset by

•

an increase in net income in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009.

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2009 increased $516 million compared with fiscal 2008, primarily due to the following:

•

an increase in net income in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008; and

•

a lower fiscal 2008 bonus payout in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 compared with the fiscal 2007 bonus payout in the first quarter of fiscal 2008;



We fund inventory expenditures during normal and peak periods through cash flows from operating activities and
available cash. Our business follows a seasonal pattern, with sales peaking over a total of about eight weeks during the end-of-year holiday period. The seasonality of our operations may lead to significant fluctuations in certain asset and
liability accounts between fiscal year-end and subsequent interim periods.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for capital expenditures and purchases of investments, while cash inflows are primarily proceeds from
maturities of investments. Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2010 decreased $108 million compared with fiscal 2009, primarily due to the following:

•

$350 million more net maturities of short-term investments in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009; partially offset by

•

$223 million more purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009; and

•

$17 million less release of restricted cash in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009.

Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2009 increased $139 million compared with fiscal 2008, primarily due to the following:

•

$401 million more net purchases of short-term investments in fiscal 2009 compared with net maturities in fiscal 2008; offset by

•

$142 million, net of cash acquired, used for the acquisition of Athleta in September 2008; and

•

$97 million less purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008.

For fiscal 2011, we expect capital expenditures to be about $575 million.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Our cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily
of the repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments. Cash inflows primarily consist of proceeds from share-based compensation, net of withholding tax payments. Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2010 increased $1.4
billion compared with fiscal 2009, primarily due to the following:

•

$1.4 billion more repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009.

Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2009 decreased $234 million compared with fiscal 2008, primarily due to the following:

•

158 million less repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008; and

•

$88 million less repayments of long-term debt in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008.

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP
financial measure. We believe free cash flow is an important metric because it represents a measure of how much cash a company has available for discretionary and non-discretionary items after the deduction of capital expenditures, as we require
regular capital expenditures to build and maintain stores and purchase new equipment to improve our business. We use this metric internally, as we believe our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an important driver of value
creation. However, this non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to supersede or replace our GAAP results.

The following table reconciles free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, from a GAAP financial measure.

Credit Facilities

Trade letters of credit represent a payment undertaking guaranteed by a bank on our behalf to pay a vendor a given amount of money upon presentation of specific
documents demonstrating that merchandise has shipped. Vendor payables are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the time of merchandise title transfer, although the letters of credit are generally issued prior to this. In September 2010, we
amended and extended one of our $100 million letter of credit agreements and concurrently terminated our second $100 million letter of credit agreement. As of January 29, 2011, we had a $100 million, two-year, unsecured committed letter of
credit agreement with an expiration date of September 2012. As of January 29, 2011, we had $1 million in trade letters of credit issued under this letter of credit agreement.

We also have a $500 million, five-year, unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to expire in August 2012 (the “Facility”). The Facility is available for general corporate purposes including working
capital, trade letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. The facility usage fees and fees related to the Facility fluctuate based on our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio. If we were to draw on the Facility,
interest would be a base rate (typically the London Interbank Offered Rate) plus a margin based on our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio on the unpaid principal amount. To maintain availability of funds under the
Facility, we pay a facility fee on the full facility amount, regardless of usage. As of January 29, 2011, there were no borrowings under the Facility. The net availability of the Facility, reflecting $49 million of outstanding standby
letters of credit, was $451 million as of January 29, 2011.

The Facility and letter of credit agreement contain financial and other covenants,
including but not limited to limitations on liens and subsidiary debt as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios—a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio. Violation of these covenants could result in a default under the
Facility and letter of credit agreement, which would permit the participating banks to terminate our ability to access the Facility for letters of credit and advances, terminate our ability to request letters of credit under the letter of credit
agreement, require the immediate repayment of any outstanding advances under the Facility, and require the immediate posting of cash collateral in support of any outstanding letters of credit under the letter of credit agreement.

In September 2010, we entered into two separate agreements to make unsecured revolving credit facilities available for our operations in China (the
“China Facilities”). The China Facilities are available for borrowings, overdraft borrowings, and issuance of bank guarantees. The 196 million Chinese yuan (approximately $30 million as of January 29, 2011) China Facilities are
scheduled to expire in August 2011. As of January 29, 2011, there were borrowings of $3 million (18 million Chinese yuan) at an interest rate of 5.08 percent. The net availability of the China Facilities, reflecting these borrowings, was
approximately $27 million (178 million Chinese yuan) as of January 29, 2011. The China Facility agreements do not contain any covenants.

Dividend Policy

In determining whether and at
what level to declare a dividend, we consider a number of factors including sustainability, operating performance, liquidity, and market conditions.

We
increased our annual dividend, which had been $0.34 per share for fiscal 2008 and 2009, to $0.40 per share for fiscal 2010. We intend to increase our annual dividend to $0.45 per share for fiscal 2011.



Share Repurchases

In February 2010, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized $1 billion for share repurchases, which was fully utilized by the end of August 2010. In August 2010, we announced that the Board of Directors
authorized an additional $750 million for share repurchases, of which $711 million was utilized through January 29, 2011. In February 2011, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized an additional $2 billion for share repurchases.

During fiscal 2010, we repurchased approximately 96 million shares for $2.0 billion, including commissions, at an average price per share of
$20.44.

Contractual Cash Obligations

We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. The following table provides summary information concerning
our future contractual obligations as of January 29, 2011. These obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet, while others are disclosed as future obligations.

(a)

Represents principal maturities, excluding interest. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

(b)

The table above excludes $66 million of long-term liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, as we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur. The
amount is recorded in lease incentives and other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 29, 2011.

(c)

Maintenance, insurance, taxes, and contingent rent obligations are excluded. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our operating leases.

(d)

Represents estimated open purchase orders to purchase inventory as well as commitments for products and services used in the normal course of business.

Commercial Commitments

We have commercial
commitments, not reflected in the table above, that were incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations, including standby letters of credit of $51 million (of which $49 million was issued under the revolving credit facility
lines), surety bonds of $40 million, and bank guarantees of $11 million outstanding at January 29, 2011.

Amounts Reflected in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet

We have other long-term liabilities reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, including deferred income taxes. The
payment obligations associated with these liabilities are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities. Therefore, the timing of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be paid in fiscal
2011 that are recorded in current liabilities.

Other Cash Obligations Not Reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet (Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements)

The majority of our contractual obligations are made up of operating leases for our stores. Commitments for operating leases represent future
minimum lease payments under non-cancelable leases. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, our operating leases are not recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet; however, the minimum lease
payments related to these leases are disclosed in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Purchase obligations include our non-exclusive
services agreement with IBM to operate certain aspects of our information technology structure. The services agreement expires in March 2016, and we have the right to renew it for up to three additional years. We have various options to terminate
the agreement, and we pay IBM under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on our actual consumption of services. IBM also has certain termination rights in the event of our material breach of the
agreement and failure to cure. Based on the current projection of service needs, we expect to pay approximately $486 million to IBM over the remaining term of the contract.

We have assigned certain store and corporate facility leases to third parties as of January 29, 2011. Under these arrangements, we are secondarily liable and have guaranteed the lease payments of the new
lessees for the remaining portion of our original lease obligation. The maximum potential amount of future lease payments we could be required to make is approximately $21 million as of January 29, 2011. There was no liability
recorded for the guarantees as of January 29, 2011.

We are a party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to
indemnify the other party for certain matters. These contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts, operating leases, trademarks, intellectual property, financial agreements, and various other agreements. Under these contracts, we may
provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties (e.g., ownership of assets, environmental or tax indemnifications) or personal injury matters. The terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be
explicitly defined. Generally, the maximum obligation under such indemnifications is not explicitly stated, and as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made significant payments
for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

As party to a reinsurance pool for workers’ compensation, general liability, and automobile liability, we have guarantees with a maximum exposure of $14 million. We are currently in the process of winding down
our participation in the reinsurance pool.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We
maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large, global corporation. However, even under
optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information.

Our significant accounting policies can be found in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements.
Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, which has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and
estimates in this annual report on Form 10-K.



Merchandise Inventory

We value inventory at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”), with cost determined using the weighted-average cost method. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and
broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes) and use markdowns to clear merchandise. We record an adjustment when future estimated selling price is less than cost. Our LCM adjustment calculation requires management to
make assumptions to estimate the amount of slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments subject to markdowns, which is dependent upon factors such as historical trends with similar merchandise, inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand, and the
promotional environment. In addition, we estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date. Our shortage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage
trends. Historically, actual shortage has not differed materially from our estimates.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will
be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our LCM or inventory shortage adjustments. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or actual physical inventory shortage differs significantly
from our estimate, our operating results could be affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to calculate our LCM or inventory shortage adjustments in the past three fiscal years.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill, and Intangible Assets

We review the carrying value of long-lived assets, including lease rights, key money, and intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include the decision to close a store, corporate facility, or distribution center, or a significant decrease in the operating performance of the long-lived
asset. Long-lived assets are considered impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group are less than the carrying value. For impaired assets, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying
value of the asset or asset group and its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of the asset or asset group is based on discounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group using a discount rate commensurate with the risk. The asset
group is defined as the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available. Our estimate of future cash flows requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses and estimating
useful lives of the assets. These estimates can be affected by factors such as future store results, real estate demand, and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. We have not made any material changes in the methodology to assess and
calculate impairment of long-lived assets in the past three fiscal years. We recorded charges for the impairment of long-lived assets of $8 million, $14 million, and $5 million for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

In connection with the acquisition of Athleta in September 2008, we allocated $99 million of the purchase price to goodwill and $54 million to the trade name. The
carrying values of goodwill and the trade name were $99 million and $54 million, respectively, as of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010 and were allocated to the Direct reportable segment. We review the carrying value of goodwill and
the trade name for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include significant changes in the business climate, declines
in our operating results, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We assess potential impairment by considering present economic conditions as well as future expectations. We have deemed the Direct reportable segment to be
the reporting unit for goodwill acquired through the acquisition of Athleta. The fair value of the Direct reporting unit used to test goodwill for impairment is estimated using the income approach. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we
completed our annual impairment review of goodwill and did not recognize any impairment charges. The fair value of the Direct reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value as of the date of our annual impairment review.

The fair value of the trade name is determined using the relief from royalty method. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we completed our annual impairment
review of the trade name and did not recognize any impairment charges.

These analyses require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales,
expenses, discount rates, and royalty rates, which can be affected by economic conditions and other factors that can be difficult to predict.

We do not
believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment losses of long-lived assets, goodwill, and intangible assets. However, if actual results are not consistent
with our estimates and assumptions used in the calculations, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.

Insurance and
Self-Insurance

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers’
compensation, general liability, and employee related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by our employees. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated based primarily on actuarially-determined amounts and accrued in part by
considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. Any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable
external factors affecting future inflation rates, litigation trends, legal interpretations, benefit level changes, health care costs, and claim settlement patterns. Historically, actual results for estimated losses have not differed materially from
our estimates.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to
calculate our insurance liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.

Revenue Recognition

While revenue recognition for the Company does not involve significant judgment,
it represents an important accounting policy. We recognize revenue and the related cost of goods sold at the time the products are received by the customers. For store sales, revenue is recognized when the customer receives and pays for the
merchandise at the register, primarily with either cash or credit card. For sales from our online and catalog business, revenue is recognized at the time we estimate the customer receives the merchandise. We record an allowance for estimated returns
based on the estimated margin using our historical return patterns and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable.

We do not
believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales return reserve. However, if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly, our operating
results could be adversely affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate future sales returns in the past three fiscal years.

Unredeemed Gift Cards, Gift Certificates, and Credit Vouchers

Upon issuance of a gift card, gift
certificate, or credit voucher, a liability is established for its cash value. The liability is relieved and net sales are recorded upon redemption by the customer. Over time, some portion of these instruments is not redeemed (“breakage”).
We determine breakage income for gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers based on historical redemption patterns. Breakage income is recorded in other income, which is a component of operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of
Income, when we can determine the portion of the liability where redemption is remote. When breakage is recorded, a liability is recognized for any legal obligation to remit the unredeemed portion to relevant jurisdictions. Our gift cards, gift
certificates, and credit vouchers do not have expiration dates.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we completed an analysis of historical
redemption patterns for our gift certificates and credit vouchers. Based on this analysis, additional data led us to conclude that three years after the gift certificate or credit voucher is issued, we can determine the portion of the liability
where redemption is remote. As such, beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we changed our estimate of the elapsed time for recording breakage income associated with unredeemed gift certificates and credit vouchers to three years from our
prior estimate of five years. This change in estimate did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Income for fiscal 2009. For gift cards, we also recognize breakage income after three years.



We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or
assumptions we use to calculate our breakage income. However, if the actual rate of redemption for gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers increases significantly, our operating results could be adversely affected. We have not made any
material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate breakage income in the past three fiscal years other than noted above.

Income Taxes

We record a valuation allowance
against our deferred tax assets arising from certain net operating losses when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such net operating losses will not be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, management is
required to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future income, taxable income, and the mix of income in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may also be
materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of income, changes in the expected outcome of audits, or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance.

At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is
different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our
various tax filing positions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances,
issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits.

We believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. However, if actual
results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

We operate in foreign countries, which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our risk management
policy is to hedge a significant portion of forecasted merchandise purchases denominated primarily in U.S. dollars made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currencies are their local currencies, forecasted intercompany royalty
payments, and intercompany obligations that bear foreign exchange risk using foreign exchange forward contracts. These contracts are entered into with large, reputable financial institutions that are monitored for counterparty risk. The principal
currencies hedged against changes in the U.S. dollar are Euro, British pounds, Japanese yen, and Canadian dollars. Our use of derivative financial instruments represents risk management; we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for
trading purposes. Additional information is presented in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our derivative financial instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets at fair value as of the balance sheet dates. As of January 29, 2011, we had foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to buy the notional amount of $1 billion, 54 million British pounds, and 3 billion Japanese yen.

We may also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the net assets of international subsidiaries to offset the foreign currency translation
and economic exposures related to our investment in the subsidiaries. At January 29, 2011, we had foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to hedge the net assets of our Japanese subsidiary in the notional amount of 3 billion Japanese
yen.

We have performed a sensitivity analysis as of January 29, 2011 based on a model that measures the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent adverse
change in the level of foreign currency exchange rates to U.S. dollars (with all other variables held constant) on our underlying exposure, net of derivative financial instruments. The foreign currency exchange rates used in the model were based on
the spot rates in effect at January 29, 2011. The sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have an unfavorable impact on the underlying cash flow exposure, net of
our foreign exchange derivative financial instruments, of $47 million at January 29, 2011.

We invest in fixed and variable income investments
classified as cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are placed primarily in money market funds, domestic commercial paper, U.S. treasury bills, and bank deposits, and are
classified as held-to-maturity based on our positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. These investments are stated at amortized cost, which approximates market value due to the short maturities. An increase in interest
rates of 10 percent would not have a material impact on the value of these investments. However, changes in interest rates would impact the interest income derived from our investments. We earned interest income of $6 million in fiscal
2010.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Gap, Inc.:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Gap, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 29, 2011. We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and
principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject
to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Gap, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 29, 2011 and
January 30, 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 29, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

. Organization and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

Organization

The Gap, Inc., a Delaware Corporation, is a global specialty retailer offering apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, children, and babies under the Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic,
Piperlime, and Athleta brands. We have Company-operated stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, and Japan, and beginning in November 2010, China and Italy. We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated
franchisees to operate stores in Asia, Australia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East under the Gap and Banana Republic brand names. Customers in the U.S. can shop online at gap.com, oldnavy.com, bananarepublic.com, piperlime.com, and
athleta.com. Beginning in fiscal 2010, customers in Canada can shop online at gapcanada.ca, oldnavy.ca, and bananarepublic.ca, customers in the United Kingdom and select European countries can shop online at gap.eu and bananarepublic.eu, customers
in China can shop online at gap.cn, and customers in select international countries can shop online at gap.com, oldnavy.com, bananarepublic.com, piperlime.com, and athleta.com.

Principles of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of The Gap,
Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company,” “we,” and “our”). All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Fiscal Year and Presentation

Our fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday
closest to January 31. Fiscal years ended January 29, 2011 (fiscal 2010), January 30, 2010 (fiscal 2009), and January 31, 2009 (fiscal 2008) consisted of 52 weeks.

Issuance of common stock and reissuance of treasury stock pursuant to stock option and other stock award plans, net of shares withheld for employee taxes have been combined for fiscal 2009 and 2008 in the
Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity to conform to fiscal 2010 presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

Amounts in transit from banks for customer credit card and debit card transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash. The banks process
the majority of these amounts within one to two business days.

All highly liquid investments with maturities of 91 days or less at the date of purchase
are classified as cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than 91 days and less than one year from the balance sheet date are classified as short-term investments. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments are
placed primarily in money market funds, domestic commercial paper, U.S. treasury bills, and bank deposits, and are classified as held-to-maturity based on our positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. These investments are
stated at amortized cost, which approximates market value due to their short maturities. Income related to these securities is recorded in interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists
primarily of cash that serves as collateral for our insurance obligations. Any cash that is legally restricted from use is classified as restricted cash. If the purpose of restricted cash relates to acquiring a

long-term asset, liquidating a long-term liability, or is otherwise unavailable for a period longer than one year from the balance sheet date, the restricted cash is included in long-term assets.
Otherwise, restricted cash is included in current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Merchandise Inventory

We value inventory at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using the weighted-average cost method. We record an adjustment when future estimated
selling price is less than cost. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes) and use markdowns to clear merchandise. In addition, we
estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as other current assets, other long-term assets,
accrued expenses and other current liabilities, or lease incentives and other long-term liabilities.

For derivative financial instruments that are
designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative financial instruments is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and is recognized in income in the period when
the underlying transaction occurs. For derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative financial instruments is reported as a component of OCI and
reclassified into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged subsidiary is either sold or liquidated (or substantially liquidated). Gains and losses on the derivative financial instruments representing either hedge ineffectiveness
or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, if any, are recognized in current income.

For derivative financial instruments
not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss on the derivative financial instruments is recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Cash flows from derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Property and Equipment

Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Estimated useful lives are as follows:

The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts, with any resulting gain or loss recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Costs of maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.

Lease Rights and Key Money

Lease rights are costs
incurred to acquire the right to lease a specific property. A majority of our lease rights are related to premiums paid to landlords. Key money is the amount of funds paid to a landlord or tenant to acquire the rights of tenancy under a commercial
property lease for a property located in France. These rights can be subsequently sold by us to a new tenant or the amount of key money paid can potentially be recovered from the landlord should the landlord refuse to allow the automatic right of
renewal to be exercised. Lease rights and key



money are recorded at cost and are amortized over the corresponding lease term. Lease rights and key money are recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of
related amortization.

Insurance and Self-Insurance

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risk management activities including workers’ compensation, general liability, and employee related health care benefits, a portion of which
is paid by our employees. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated based primarily on actuarially-determined amounts and accrued in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other
actuarial assumptions.

Asset Retirement Obligations

An asset retirement obligation represents a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that is incurred upon the acquisition, construction, development, or normal operation of
that long-lived asset. The Company’s asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which at the end of a lease we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. We
recognize asset retirement obligations at the inception of a lease with such conditions if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The asset retirement obligation is recorded in lease incentives and other long-term liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets and is subsequently adjusted for changes in estimated disposal costs. The associated estimated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset and depreciated over its useful
life.

Treasury Stock

We account for
treasury stock under the cost method, using the first-in, first-out flow assumption, and include treasury stock as a component of stockholders’ equity.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue and the related cost of goods sold at the time the products
are received by the customers. Revenue is recognized for store sales when the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register. For sales from our online and catalog business, we estimate and defer revenue and the related product costs
for shipments that are in-transit to the customer. Revenue is recognized at the time we estimate the customer receives the product, which is typically within a few days of shipment. Deferred revenue related to online and catalog sales was $6 million
and $5 million as of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively. Amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to customers are recorded in net sales, and the related costs are recorded in cost of goods sold and
occupancy expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Revenues are presented net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.

Allowances for estimated returns are recorded based on estimated margin using our historical return patterns.

We sell
merchandise to franchisees under multi-year franchise agreements. We recognize revenue from sales to franchisees at the time merchandise ownership is transferred to the franchisee. These sales are recorded in net sales, and the related
cost of goods sold is recorded in cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We also receive royalties from these franchisees based on a percentage of the total merchandise purchased by the franchisee,
net of any refunds or credits due them. Royalty revenue is recognized when merchandise ownership is transferred to the franchisee and is recorded in net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Classification of Expenses

Cost of
goods sold and occupancy expenses include:

•

the cost of merchandise;

•

inventory shortage and valuation adjustments;

•

freight charges;

•

shipping and handling costs;

•

costs associated with our sourcing operations, including payroll and related benefits;

•

production costs;

•

insurance costs related to merchandise; and

•

rent, occupancy, depreciation, and amortization related to our store operations, distribution centers, and certain corporate functions.

Operating expenses include:

•

payroll and related benefits (for our store operations, field management, distribution centers, and corporate functions);

•

marketing;

•

general and administrative expenses;

•

costs to design and develop our products;

•

merchandise handling and receiving in distribution centers;

•

distribution center general and administrative expenses;

•

rent, occupancy, depreciation, and amortization for corporate facilities; and

•

other expense (income).

The classification of
expenses varies across the apparel retail industry. Accordingly, our cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses and operating expenses may not be comparable to those of other companies. Merchandise handling and receiving expenses and distribution
center general and administrative expenses recorded in operating expenses were $226 million, $237 million, and $253 million in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Rent Expense

Minimum rent expense is recognized over the term of the lease. We recognize minimum
rent starting when possession of the property is taken from the landlord, which normally includes a construction period prior to store opening. When a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent, we recognize the related rent
expense on a straight-line basis and record the difference between the recognized rent expense and the amounts payable under the lease as a short-term or long-term deferred rent liability. We also receive tenant allowances upon entering into certain
store leases, which are recorded as a short-term or long-term tenant allowance liability and amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease. A co-tenancy failure by our landlord during the lease term may result in a reduction of
future cash payments and is recorded as a reduction to rent expense. Future payments for common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, and other occupancy costs to which the Company is obligated are excluded from minimum lease payments.

Certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception. These contingent rents are primarily based on a percentage of sales
that are in excess of a predetermined level and/or rent increase based on a change in the consumer price index or fair market value. These amounts are excluded from minimum rent and are included in the determination of rent expense when it is
probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.



Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We review the carrying value of long-lived assets, including lease rights, key money, and intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include the decision to close a store, corporate facility, or distribution center, or a significant decrease in the operating performance of the long-lived
asset. Long-lived assets are considered impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group are less than the carrying value. For impaired assets, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying
value of the asset or asset group and its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of the asset or asset group is based on discounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group using a discount rate commensurate with the risk. The asset
group is defined as the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available. Our estimate of future cash flows requires assumptions and judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses and estimating useful lives of the assets.

Goodwill and Trade Name

In connection
with the acquisition of Athleta in September 2008, we allocated $99 million of the purchase price to goodwill and $54 million to the trade name. Goodwill and the trade name have indefinite useful lives, and accordingly, are not amortized. Instead,
we review the carrying value of goodwill and the trade name for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include
significant changes in the business climate, declines in our operating results, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We assess potential impairment by considering present economic conditions as well as future
expectations.

The impairment review of goodwill involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the
carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step is required to measure the goodwill impairment loss. The second step includes hypothetically valuing all the tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit as if the
reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Then, the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds
the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying amount. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for
which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. We have deemed our reporting unit of goodwill to be our Direct operating segment, which is the level at which segment management regularly reviews
operating results and makes resource allocation decisions. The fair value of the reporting unit used to test goodwill for impairment is estimated using the income approach. This approach requires assumptions and judgment, including forecasting
future sales and expenses.

Effective February 1, 2009, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. (“SFAS”) 141(R), “Business Combinations” (currently FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805). The adoption of SFAS 141(R) did not have a material impact on our reporting
unit determination.

The trade name is considered impaired if the estimated fair value of the trade name is less than the carrying value. If the
trade name is considered impaired, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the trade name. The fair value of the trade name is determined using the relief from royalty method, which
requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales, expenses, discount rates, and royalty rates.

Goodwill
and the trade name are recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Lease Losses

The decision to close a store, corporate facility, or distribution center can result in accelerated depreciation and amortization over the revised remaining useful
lives of the associated long-lived assets. In addition, upon exiting

leased premises, we record a charge and corresponding lease loss reserve equal to the incremental amount of the present value of the net future obligation greater than the remaining rent-related
deferred balances. The net future obligation is determined as the remaining contractual rent obligations less the amount for which we are able to or expect to be able to sublease the properties. We estimate the amount for which we expect to be able
to sublease the properties based on the status of our efforts to sublease vacant office space and stores, a review of real estate market conditions, our projections for sublease income, and our assumptions regarding sublease commencement.

Pre-Opening Costs

Pre-opening and
start-up activity costs, which include rent and occupancy, supplies, advertising, and payroll expenses incurred prior to the opening of a new store, are expensed in the period in which they occur.

Advertising

Costs associated with the production
of advertising, such as writing, copy, printing, and other costs, are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with communicating advertising that has been produced, such as television and magazine costs, are expensed when the advertising event takes
place. Advertising expense was $516 million, $513 million, and $435 million in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, and is recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Prepaid catalog expense consists of the cost to prepare, print, and distribute catalogs. Such costs are amortized over their expected period of future benefit,
which is approximately one to five months.

Share-Based Compensation

Share-based compensation expense for stock options and other stock awards is determined based on the grant-date fair value. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock
options which requires the input of subjective assumptions regarding expected term, expected volatility, dividend yield, and risk-free interest rate. For units granted whereby one share of common stock is issued for each unit as the unit vests
(“Stock Units”), the fair value is determined based on the Company’s stock price on the date of grant less future expected dividends during the vesting period. For stock options and Stock Units, we recognize share-based compensation
cost net of estimated forfeitures and revise the estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as expected future behavior. The expense is
recorded primarily in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for stock options and Stock Units. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Unredeemed Gift Cards, Gift Certificates, and Credit Vouchers

Upon issuance of a gift card, gift certificate, or credit voucher, a liability is established for its cash value. The liability is relieved and net sales are recorded upon redemption by the customer. Over time,
some portion of these instruments is not redeemed (“breakage”). We determine breakage income for gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers based on historical redemption patterns. Breakage income is recorded in other income, which
is a component of operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, when we can determine the portion of the liability where redemption is remote. Based on our historical information, three years after the gift card, gift certificate, or
credit voucher is issued, we can determine the portion of the liability where redemption is remote. When breakage is recorded, a liability is recognized for any legal obligation to remit the unredeemed portion to relevant jurisdictions. Our gift
cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers do not have expiration dates. Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we changed our estimate of the elapsed time for recording breakage income associated with unredeemed gift certificates and
credit vouchers to three years from our prior estimate of five years. This change in estimate did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Income for fiscal 2009.



Credit Cards

We have credit card agreements (the “Agreements”) with third parties to provide our customers with private label credit cards and/or co-branded credit cards (collectively, the “Credit
Cards”). Each private label credit card bears the logo of one of our brands and can be used at any of our U.S. or Canadian store locations and online. The co-branded credit card is a VISA credit card bearing the logo of one of our
brands and can be used everywhere VISA credit cards are accepted. A third-party financing company is the sole owner of the accounts issued under the Credit Card programs, and this third party absorbs the losses associated with non-payment by
the cardholder and a portion of any fraudulent usage of the accounts. We receive cash from the third-party financing company in accordance with the Agreements and based on usage of the Credit Cards. We also receive cash from Visa U.S.A. Inc. in
accordance with the Agreements and based on specified transactional fees. We recognize income for such cash receipts when the amounts are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured, which is generally the time at which the
actual usage of the Credit Cards or specified transaction occurs. The income is recorded in other income, which is a component of operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

The Credit Card programs offer incentives to cardholders in the form of reward certificates upon the cumulative purchase of an established amount. The cost
associated with reward certificates is accrued as the rewards are earned by the cardholder and is recorded in cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share are
computed as net income divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share are computed as net income divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period plus
common stock equivalents. Common stock equivalents consist of shares subject to share-based awards with exercise prices less than the average market price of our common stock for the period, to the extent their inclusion would be dilutive. Stock
options and other stock awards that contain performance conditions are not included in the calculation of common stock equivalents until performance conditions have been achieved.

Foreign Currency Translation

Our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the
functional currency and translate their assets and liabilities at the current rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses from their operations are translated using the monthly average exchange rates in effect for the
period in which the transactions occur. The resulting gains and losses from translation are recorded in accumulated OCI in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate
fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the local functional currency are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The amounts of net foreign exchange gains and losses included in the Consolidated Statements of
Income were as follows:

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income is comprised of net income and other gains and losses affecting equity that are excluded from net income. The components of OCI consist of foreign currency translation gains and losses, net of
tax, changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments, net of tax, and reclassification adjustments for realized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments, net of tax.

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of
assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not
be realized.

Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. At any
point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such
differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made.

The Company recognizes interest related to
unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2010,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standards update to amend and clarify existing guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures. This guidance adds new requirements for disclosures related to transfers
into and out of level 1 and level 2 and requires separate disclosure of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements related to level 3 measurements. It also clarifies guidance around disaggregation and disclosures of inputs and valuation techniques
used to measure fair value. We adopted the provisions of this accounting standards update effective January 31, 2010, except for the requirement to disclose purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements related to level 3 measurements, which we
will adopt in the first quarter of fiscal 2011.

. Acquisition,
Goodwill, and Intangible Assets

On September 28, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Athleta Inc., a women’s
sports and active apparel company based in Petaluma, California, for an aggregate purchase price of $148 million in cash, including transaction costs. The acquisition allows us to enhance our presence in the growing women’s active apparel
sector. The results of operations for Athleta are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income beginning September 29, 2008. The impact of the acquisition on the Company’s results of operations, as if the acquisition had been
completed as of the beginning of the periods presented, is not significant.

The purchase price was allocated as follows as of September 28, 2008:

All of the assets above have been allocated to the Direct reportable segment. None of the goodwill acquired is deductible for tax
purposes.

During fiscal 2010 and 2009, there were no changes in the carrying amount of goodwill or the trade name. Intangible assets subject to
amortization, consisting primarily of customer relationships, are being amortized over a weighted-average amortization period of four years and are as follows:

Amortization expense for intangible assets subject to amortization was $4 million, $6 million, and $2 million for
fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, and is recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

As of January 29, 2011,
future amortization expense for intangible assets subject to amortization is $2 million and $1 million for fiscal 2011 and 2012, respectively. Subsequent to fiscal 2012, there will be no amortization expense for existing intangible assets subject to
amortization.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we completed our annual impairment testing of our goodwill and the trade name and did not
recognize any impairment charges.

Note


. Credit Facilities

Trade letters of
credit represent a payment undertaking guaranteed by a bank on our behalf to pay a vendor upon presentation of specific documents demonstrating that merchandise has shipped. Vendor payables are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the time
of merchandise title transfer, although the letters of credit are generally issued prior to this. In September 2010, we amended and extended one of our $100 million letter of credit agreements and concurrently terminated our second $100 million
letter of credit agreement. As of January 29, 2011, we had a $100 million, two-year, unsecured committed letter of credit agreement with an expiration date of September 2012. As of January 29, 2011, we had $1 million in trade letters
of credit issued under this letter of credit agreement.

We also have a $500 million, five-year, unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to expire
in August 2012 (the “Facility”). The Facility is available for general corporate purposes including working capital, trade letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. The facility usage fees and fees related to the Facility fluctuate
based on our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio. If we were to draw on the Facility, interest would be a base rate (typically the London Interbank Offered Rate) plus a margin based on our long-term senior unsecured
credit ratings and our leverage ratio on the unpaid principal amount. To maintain availability of funds under the Facility, we pay a facility fee on the full facility amount, regardless of usage. As of January 29, 2011, there were no borrowings
under the Facility. The net availability of the Facility, reflecting $49 million of outstanding standby letters of credit, was $451 million as of January 29, 2011.

The Facility and letter of credit agreement contain financial and other covenants, including but not limited to limitations on liens and subsidiary debt as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios—a
fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio. Violation of these covenants could result in a default under the Facility and letter of credit agreement, which would permit the participating banks to terminate our ability to access the Facility
for letters of credit and advances, terminate our ability to request letters of credit under the letter of credit agreement, require the immediate repayment of any outstanding advances under the Facility, and require the immediate posting of cash
collateral in support of any outstanding letters of credit under the letter of credit agreement.

In September 2010, we entered into two separate
agreements to make unsecured revolving credit facilities available for our operations in China (the “China Facilities”). The China Facilities are available for borrowings, overdraft borrowings, and issuance of bank guarantees. The
196 million Chinese yuan (approximately $30 million as of January 29, 2011) China Facilities are scheduled to expire in August 2011. As of January 29, 2011, there were borrowings of $3 million (18 million Chinese yuan) at an interest
rate of 5.08 percent. The net availability of the China Facilities, reflecting these borrowings, was approximately $27 million (178 million Chinese yuan) as of January 29, 2011. The China Facility agreements do not contain any covenants.



Note


. Fair Value Measurements

Effective
January 31, 2010, we adopted enhanced disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. There were no transfers into or out of level 1 and level 2 for fiscal 2010.

Financial Assets and Liabilities

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis and cash equivalents and short-term investments held at amortized cost are as follows:

Derivative financial instruments primarily include foreign exchange forward contracts. The principal currencies hedged against changes
in the U.S. dollar are Euro, British pounds, Japanese yen, and Canadian dollars. The fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments is determined using pricing models based on current market rates. Derivative financial
instruments in an asset position are recorded in other current assets or other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivative financial instruments in a liability position are recorded in accrued expenses and other current
liabilities or lease incentives and other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We maintain a deferred compensation plan that allows
eligible employees to defer compensation up to a maximum amount. Plan investments are recorded at market value and are designated for the deferred compensation plan. The fair value of the Company’s deferred compensation plan assets is
determined based on quoted market prices, and the assets are recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In addition, we have
highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents and short-term investments. These investments are classified as held-to-maturity based on our positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. We value these investments at
their original purchase prices plus interest that has accrued at the stated rate. The January 30, 2010 fair value table has been updated to include cash equivalents and short term investments in level 2.

Nonfinancial Assets

As discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we recorded a charge for the impairment of long-lived assets of $8 million and $14 million for fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively, which was
recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The impairment charge reduced the then carrying amount of the applicable long-lived assets of $12 million and $16 million to their fair value of $4 million and $2 million during
fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. The fair value of the long-lived assets was determined using level 3 inputs and the valuation techniques discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, there were no impairment charges recorded for goodwill or the trade name for fiscal 2010 and
2009.

Note


. Derivative Financial
Instruments

Effective February 1, 2009, we adopted enhanced disclosure requirements for derivative financial instruments and hedging
activities.

We operate in foreign countries, which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our risk
management policy is to hedge a significant portion of forecasted merchandise purchases for foreign operations, forecasted intercompany royalty payments, and intercompany obligations that bear foreign exchange risk using foreign exchange forward
contracts. The principal currencies hedged against changes in the U.S. dollar are Euro, British pounds, Japanese yen, and Canadian dollars. Until March 2009, we also used a cross-currency interest rate swap to swap the interest and principal payable
of the $50 million debt of our Japanese subsidiary, Gap (Japan) KK. In connection with the maturity of the debt, the swap was settled in March 2009. We do not enter into derivative financial contracts for trading purposes.

Cash Flow Hedges

We designate the following
foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedges: forward contracts used to hedge forecasted merchandise purchases denominated primarily in U.S. dollars made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currencies are their local
currencies; and forward contracts used to hedge forecasted intercompany royalty payments denominated in Japanese yen and Canadian dollars received by entities whose functional currencies are U.S. dollars. We make merchandise purchases on a monthly
basis, and we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge forecasted merchandise purchases generally occurring in 12 to 18 months. We make intercompany royalty payments on a quarterly basis, and we enter into foreign exchange forward
contracts to hedge intercompany royalty payments generally occurring in 12 to 15 months.

There were no material amounts recorded in income for fiscal
2010, 2009, or 2008 as a result of hedge ineffectiveness, hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, or the discontinuance of cash flow hedges because the forecasted transactions were no longer probable.

Net Investment Hedges

We also use foreign
exchange forward contracts to hedge the net assets of international subsidiaries to offset the foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our investment in the subsidiaries.

There were no amounts recorded in income for fiscal 2010, 2009, or 2008 as a result of hedge ineffectiveness, hedge components excluded from the assessment of
effectiveness, or the discontinuance of net investment hedges.

Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

In addition, we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our market risk exposure associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for certain
intercompany balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity with the intercompany balance. The gain or loss on the derivative financial instruments, as well as the remeasurement of the underlying intercompany
balances, is recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same period and generally offset.



We generate intercompany activity each month, and as such, we generally enter into foreign exchange forward contracts
on a monthly basis to hedge intercompany balances that bear foreign exchange risk. These foreign exchange forward contracts generally settle in less than 12 months.

Outstanding Notional Amounts

As of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, we had foreign

. Common Stock

Common and Preferred Stock

The Company is authorized to issue 60 million shares of Class B
common stock, which is convertible into shares of common stock on a share-for-share basis. Transfer of the shares is restricted. In addition, the holders of the Class B common stock have six votes per share on most matters and are entitled to a
lower cash dividend. No Class B shares have been issued as of January 29, 2011.

The Company is authorized to issue 30 million shares of
one or more series of preferred stock, which has a par value of $0.05 per share, and to establish at the time of issuance the issue price, dividend rate, redemption price, liquidation value, conversion features, and such other terms and conditions
of each series (including voting rights) as the Board of Directors deems appropriate, without further action on the part of the stockholders. No preferred shares have been issued as of January 29, 2011.

Share Repurchases

Share repurchase activity is as
follows:



In February 2008, our Board of Directors authorized $1 billion for share repurchases, which was fully utilized by the
end of fiscal 2009. In November 2009, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $500 million for share repurchases, which was fully utilized by the end of March 2010. In connection with these authorizations, we entered into purchase agreements
with individual members of the Fisher family (related party transactions). The Fisher family shares were purchased at the same weighted-average market price that we paid for share repurchases in the open market. During fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008,
approximately 0.5 million, 1.9 million, and 7.2 million shares, respectively, were repurchased for $10 million, $40 million, and $117 million, respectively, from the Fisher family subject to these agreements.

In February 2010, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized $1 billion for share repurchases, which was fully utilized by the end of August 2010. In
August 2010, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized an additional $750 million for share repurchases, of which $711 million was utilized through January 29, 2011. In February 2011, we announced that the Board of Directors
authorized an additional $2 billion for share repurchases. We have not entered into purchase agreements with members of the Fisher family in connection with these authorizations.

All of the share repurchases were paid for as of January 29, 2011. As of January 30, 2010, all of the share repurchases were paid for except $3 million that was payable to Fisher family members.

Note


. Share-Based Compensation

Share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income, primarily in operating expenses, is as follows:

No material share-based compensation expense was capitalized in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008.

Other than the stock option modification noted below, there were no other material modifications made to our outstanding stock options and other stock awards in
fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008.

General Description of Stock Option and Other Stock Award Plans

The 1996 Stock Option and Award Plan (the “1996 Plan”) was established on March 26, 1996 and amended and restated on January 28, 2003. The 1996
Plan was further amended and restated on January 24, 2006 and renamed the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”). The 2006 Plan was further amended and restated on August 20, 2008. Under the 2006 Plan, nonqualified stock
options and other stock awards are granted to officers, directors, eligible employees, and consultants at exercise prices or with initial values equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant or as determined
by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”). There were 123,341,342 shares authorized for issuance under the 1996 Plan.

The 2002 Stock Option Plan (the “2002 Plan”) was established on January 1, 1999. On May 9, 2006, the 2002 Plan was discontinued, and only those awards then outstanding continue to be subject to
the terms of the 2002 Plan under which they were granted. The 2002 Plan empowered the Committee to award nonqualified stock options to non-officer employees. There were 78,500,000 shares authorized for issuance under the 2002 Plan. Upon
discontinuation of the 2002 Plan, 40,225,653 shares were rolled over to the 2006 Plan. As a number of outstanding awards from the 2002 Plan have since expired or been forfeited, as of January 29, 2011, there were 13,188,507 shares available under
the 2002 Plan.

Stock options generally expire 10 years from the grant date, three months after employee termination, or one year
after the date of an employee’s retirement or death, if earlier. Stock options generally vest over a four year period, with shares becoming exercisable in equal annual installments of 25 percent. Stock Units generally vest over a period of
three to four years in equal annual installments.

Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, all shares related to stock options and other stock
awards are issued from treasury stock.

Stock Option and Other Stock Award Modification

In February 2007, the Committee approved the modification of certain stock options and other stock awards held by designated employees such that at the time of an
involuntary termination without cause, any outstanding, unvested time-based options or other stock awards scheduled to vest within a defined time frame would be accelerated. No material amounts were recognized in fiscal 2009 or 2008 as a result of
the modification. The modification clause expired in February 2009.

Stock Units

Under the 2006 Plan, Stock Units are granted to employees and members of the Board of Directors. Vesting generally occurs over a period of three to four years of
continued service by the employee in equal annual installments. Vesting is immediate in the case of members of the Board of Directors. In some cases, vesting is subject to the attainment of a pre-determined financial target (“Performance
Shares”). Performance Shares generally vest over a period of three to four years.

At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the probability
that the Performance Shares will vest. We record share-based compensation expense on an accelerated basis based on the grant-date fair value and the probability that the pre-determined financial target will be achieved.

A summary of Stock Unit activity under the 2006 Plan for fiscal 2010 is as follows:

A summary of additional information about Stock Units is as follows:

The aggregate intrinsic value of unvested Stock Units at
January 29, 2011 was $211 million.

At January 29, 2011, there was $59 million (before any related tax benefit) of unrecognized share-based
compensation, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, related to unvested Stock Units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.25 years. Total unrecognized share-based compensation may be adjusted for future changes in
estimated forfeitures.

Stock Units Based on Performance Metrics

Under the 2006 Plan, some Stock Units are granted to certain employees only after the achievement of pre-determined performance metrics. Once the Stock Unit is granted, vesting is then subject to continued service
by the employee, and expense is recognized over a period of three years on an accelerated basis.



At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the probability that Stock Units will be granted. We record
share-based compensation expense based on the probability that the performance metrics will be achieved, with an offsetting increase to current liabilities. We revalue the liability at the end of each reporting period and record an adjustment to
share-based compensation expense as required, based on the probability that the performance metrics will be achieved. Upon achievement of the performance metrics, a Stock Unit is granted. At that time, the associated liability is reclassified to
stockholders’ equity.

Out of 3,431,422, 4,992,213, and 4,048,873 Stock Units granted in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, 930,081,
703,146, and 600,544 Stock Units, respectively, were granted based on satisfaction of performance metrics.

At January 29, 2011 and January 30,
2010, the liability related to potential Stock Units based on performance metrics was $1 million and $6 million, respectively, which is recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Stock Options

We have stock options outstanding
under the 2006 Plan and 2002 Plan. Vesting is generally based on four years of continued service by the employee, with 25 percent vesting on each of the four anniversary dates.

The fair value of stock options issued during fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008 was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:

A summary of stock option activity under the 2006 Plan and 2002
Plan for fiscal 2010 is as follows:

Information about stock options outstanding, vested or expected to vest, and exercisable at January 29, 2011, is
as follows:

The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding, options vested or expected to vest, and options exercisable at
January 29, 2011 was $44 million, $37 million, and $25 million, respectively. Stock options exercisable at January 29, 2011 had a weighted-average remaining contractual life of four years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Under our Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), eligible U.S. employees are able to purchase our common stock at 85 percent of the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on the last day of the three-month purchase period. Accordingly, compensation
expense is recognized for an amount equal to the 15 percent discount. Employees pay for their stock purchases through payroll deductions at a rate equal to any whole percentage from 1 percent to 15 percent. There were 1,301,167, 1,574,464, and
1,543,827 shares issued under the ESPP during fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. At January 29, 2011, there were 7,383,659 shares reserved for future issuances under the ESPP.

Note


. Leases

We lease most of our store premises and some of our corporate facilities and distribution centers. These operating leases expire at various dates through 2031. Most store leases are for a five year base period and
include options that allow us to extend the lease term beyond the initial base period, subject to terms agreed upon at lease inception. Some leases also include early termination options, which can be exercised under specific conditions.

We also lease certain equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2014.

The aggregate minimum non-cancelable annual lease payments under leases in effect on January 29, 2011, are as follows:

The total minimum lease commitment amount above does not include minimum sublease rent income of $50 million receivable in the
future under non-cancelable sublease agreements.



Rent expense related to our store premises, corporate facilities, and distribution centers under operating leases is
as follows:

In addition to rent expense related to our store premises, corporate facilities, and distribution centers as noted above, we had rent
expense related to equipment under operating leases of $3 million, $4 million, and $5 million for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

We had
lease loss reserves of $10 million and $13 million as of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, respectively. Lease losses are recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income and were $3 million, $6 million,
and $8 million for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Remaining lease payments associated with our lease loss reserve are expected to be paid over the various remaining lease terms through 2021. Based on our current assumptions as of
January 29, 2011, we expect our lease payments, net of sublease income, to result in a total net cash outlay of approximately $20 million for the remaining lease terms.

Note


. Income Taxes

For financial reporting purposes, components of income before income taxes are as follows:

The provision for income taxes consists of the following:

The foreign component of pre-tax income before elimination of intercompany transactions in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $296
million, $305 million, and $375 million, respectively. Except where required by U.S. tax law, no provision has been made for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries when we intend to utilize those earnings in
foreign operations for an indefinite period of time. Such undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010 were approximately $1.3 billion and $1.1

billion, respectively. If we had not intended to utilize the undistributed earnings in our foreign operations for an indefinite period of time, the deferred tax liability as of January 29,
2011 and January 30, 2010 would have been approximately $194 million and $148 million, respectively. During fiscal 2010, we assessed the forecasted cash needs and overall financial position of our foreign subsidiaries. As a result, we
determined that approximately $100 million was in excess of the amount we expect to utilize in our foreign operations for an indefinite period of time, and accordingly, recorded the related tax expense of $7 million in fiscal 2010.

The difference between the effective income tax rate and the U.S. federal income tax rate is as follows:

Deferred tax assets (liabilities) consist of the following:

At January 29, 2011 we had approximately $60 million state and $121 million foreign NOL carryovers in multiple taxing
jurisdictions that could be utilized to reduce the tax liabilities of future years. The tax effected NOL was approximately $4 million for state and $31 million for foreign as of January 29, 2011. We provided a valuation allowance of
approximately $1 million and $31 million against the deferred tax asset related to the state and foreign NOLs, respectively. The state losses expire between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, approximately $111 million of the foreign losses expire
between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2018, and $10 million of the foreign losses do not expire.



The activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Of the $67 million, $132 million, and $131 million of total unrecognized tax benefits at January 29, 2011,
January 30, 2010, and January 31, 2009, respectively, approximately $5 million, $15 million, and $33 million (net of the federal benefit on state issues), respectively, represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if
recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods. During fiscal 2010, an interest expense reversal of $15 million was recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. During fiscal 2009, interest expense of $2
million was recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. During fiscal 2008, an interest expense reversal of $9 million was recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. As of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, the
Company had total accrued interest related to the unrecognized tax benefits of $21 million and $20 million, respectively. There were no accrued penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits as of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010.

The Company conducts business globally, and as a result, files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign
jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as the United States, Canada, France, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United Kingdom. We are no
longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for fiscal years before 2007, and with few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. state, local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations for fiscal years before 2001.

The Company engages in continual discussions with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in the various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. As of January 29,
2011, the Company does not anticipate any significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits within the subsequent 12 months.

As of January 30, 2010,
the Company anticipated it was reasonably possible that we would recognize a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of up to $50 million within the subsequent 12 months, primarily due to the filing of a U.S. federal income tax accounting method
change application and the resolution of the Internal Revenue Service’s (“IRS”) review of the Company’s federal income tax returns and refund claims for fiscal 2001 through 2004. During fiscal 2010, total gross unrecognized tax
benefits decreased by $65 million.

Note


. Employee Benefit Plans

We have a
qualified defined contribution retirement plan called GapShare, which is available to employees who meet certain age and service requirements. This plan permits employees to make contributions up to the maximum limits allowable under the
Internal Revenue Code. Under the plan, we match, in cash, all or a portion of employees’ contributions under a predetermined formula. Our contributions vest immediately. Our contributions to GapShare were $36 million, $35 million, and $34
million in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

We maintain a deferred compensation plan that allows eligible employees to defer compensation up
to a maximum amount. Plan investments are recorded at market value and are designated for the deferred compensation plan. The fair value of the Company’s deferred compensation plan assets is determined based on quoted market
prices. As of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, the assets related to the deferred compensation plan were $27 million and $21 million, respectively, and were recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated

Balance Sheets. As of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, the corresponding liabilities relating to the deferred compensation plan were $27 million and $22 million, respectively, and
were recorded in lease incentives and other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We match all or a portion of employees’ contributions under a predetermined formula. Plan investments are elected by the participants,
and investment returns are not guaranteed by the Company. Our contributions to the deferred compensation plan in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008 were not material.

Note


. Earnings per Share

Weighted-average number of shares used for earnings per share is as follows:

The above computations of weighted-average number of shares—diluted exclude 11 million, 25 million, and 31 million
shares related to stock options and other stock awards for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect on earnings per share.

Note


. Commitments and Contingencies

In January 2006, we entered into a non-exclusive services agreement with IBM to operate certain aspects of our information technology infrastructure. The services
agreement expires in March 2016, and we have the right to renew it for up to three additional years. We have various options to terminate the agreement, and we pay IBM under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges
fluctuating based on our actual consumption of services. IBM also has certain termination rights in the event of our material breach of the agreement and failure to cure. We paid $118 million, $120 million, and $134 million to IBM for
fixed charges during fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Based on the current projection of service needs, we expect to pay approximately $486 million to IBM over the remaining term of the contract.

We have assigned certain store and corporate facility leases to third parties as of January 29, 2011. Under these arrangements, we are secondarily liable
and have guaranteed the lease payments of the new lessees for the remaining portion of our original lease obligations at various dates through 2019. The maximum potential amount of future lease payments we could be required to make is
approximately $21 million as of January 29, 2011. We recognize a liability for such guarantees when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the loss is probable and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. There was no
liability recorded for the guarantees as of January 29, 2011. As of January 30, 2010, the carrying amount of the liability related to the guarantees was approximately $2 million.

We are a party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters. These contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts, operating
leases, trademarks, intellectual property, financial agreements, and various other agreements. Under these contracts, we may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties (e.g., ownership of assets,
environmental or tax indemnifications), or personal injury matters. The terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined. Generally, the maximum obligation under such indemnifications is not explicitly stated, and
as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would
not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

As party to a reinsurance pool for workers’ compensation, general
liability, and automobile liability, we have guarantees with a maximum exposure of $14 million as of January 29, 2011. We are currently in the process of winding down our participation in the reinsurance pool.



As a multinational company, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims
(“Actions”) arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. As of January 29, 2011, actions filed against us included commercial, intellectual
property, customer, employment, data privacy, and securities related claims, including class action lawsuits. The plaintiffs in some Actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages, and some
are covered in part by insurance. As of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010, we recorded a liability for the estimated loss if the outcome of an Action is expected to result in a loss that is considered probable and reasonably estimable. The
amount of liability as of January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010 was not material for any individual Action or in total. Subsequent to January 29, 2011, no information has become available that indicates our estimate is materially misstated.

We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of Actions brought against us. Accordingly, adverse developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and
negatively impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement, or resolution. However, we do not believe that the outcome of any current Action would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial
position taken as a whole.

Segment Information

We identify our operating segments according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated. All of our
operating segments sell a group of similar products – apparel, accessories, and personal care products. We have two reportable segments:

•

Stores – The Stores reportable segment includes the results of the retail stores for Gap, Old Navy, and Banana Republic. We have aggregated the
results of all Stores operating segments into one reportable segment because we believe the operating segments have similar economic characteristics.

•

Direct – The Direct operating segment includes the results for our online brands, both domestic and international. Due to the different distribution method
associated with the Direct operating segment, Direct is considered a reportable segment.

The accounting policies for each of our
operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Financial Information for Reportable Segments

Operating income is the primary measure of profit we
use to make decisions on allocating resources to our operating segments and to assess the performance of each operating segment. It is defined as income before interest expense, interest income, and income taxes. Corporate expenses are
allocated to each operating segment and recorded in operating income on a rational and systematic basis.

Reportable segment assets presented below
include those assets that are directly used in, or allocable to, that segment’s operations. Total assets for the Stores reportable segment primarily consist of merchandise inventory, the net book value of store assets, and prepaid expenses and
receivables related to store operations. Total assets for the Direct reportable segment primarily consist of merchandise inventory, the net book value of information technology and distribution center assets, and the net book value of goodwill and
intangible assets as a result of the acquisition of Athleta. We do not allocate corporate assets to our operating segments. Unallocated corporate assets primarily include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, the net book value of
corporate property and equipment, and tax-related assets. Reportable segment capital expenditures are direct purchases of property and equipment by that segment. Unallocated capital expenditures primarily consist of corporate purchases of
property and equipment.



Selected financial information by reportable segment and reconciliations to our consolidated totals are as follows:

(1)

Included in Direct’s operating income is $46 million, $47 million, and $40 million of net allocated corporate expenses for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management conducted an assessment of our
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

. Based on the assessment, management concluded that as of January 29, 2011, our internal control over financial reporting is effective. The Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of January 29, 2011 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.
