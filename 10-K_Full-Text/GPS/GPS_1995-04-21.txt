Item 1 - BUSINESS

General

        The Gap, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the "Company") is an
international specialty retailer which operates stores selling
casual apparel, shoes and other accessories for men, women and
children under a number of trade names, including: Gap, GapKids,
babyGap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy Clothing Co.  The Company
was incorporated in the State of California in July 1969 and was
reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in May 1988. 
On March 27, 1995, the Company operated 1,525 stores, including 810
Gap, 330 GapKids, 192 Banana Republic, and 65 Old Navy Clothing Co.
stores (49 of the Gap and GapKids stores are located in the United
Kingdom, 73 are located in Canada and 3 are located in France; 3 of
the Banana Republic stores are located in Canada).  

        All of the Company's merchandise is private label.  The Gap
stores offer casual clothing for men and women.  GapKids was
introduced in 1986 to provide well-designed, comfortable clothing
for boys and girls ages 2-12.  The babyGap line, offering mostly
natural fiber clothing for infants and toddlers, was added in 1990
and is sold in most GapKids stores.  Banana Republic offers
classic, casual fashions for men and women.  Old Navy Clothing Co.
was introduced in 1993 under the name Gap Warehouse and offers
basic and fashion casual clothing for men, women and children at
lower price points.  

Recent Developments

        1994, the Company's twenty-fifth anniversary year, was one of 
record sales and earnings.  However, performance in 1994 was stronger 
in the first half than in the second half, when compared to the prior 
year, and the Company ended fiscal 1994 with comparable store sales 
growth of only 1%.  The Company is continuing to experience difficult 
competitive conditions in 1995; for the first two months of fiscal 1995, 
the Company's comparable store sales declined 5%.  In addition, over the 
past two years the Company has operated at near record levels of 
merchandise margin when compared to the same periods of previous years, 
making current and future comparisons more challenging.  This is especially
true in the first half of fiscal 1995.

Merchandise Inventory, Replenishment and Distribution

        The retail apparel specialty business fluctuates according to
changes in customer preferences dictated by fashion and season. 
These fluctuations especially affect the inventory owned by apparel
retailers, since merchandise usually must be ordered well in
advance of the season and sometimes before fashion trends are
evidenced by customer purchases.  The Company is vulnerable to
changing fashion trends, particularly when it emphasizes fashion
items versus basics, as it did to some extent in fiscal year 1994. 
In addition, the cyclical nature of the retail business requires
the Company to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially
prior to peak selling seasons when the Company and other retailers
generally build up their inventory levels.  The Company must enter
into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of private label
apparel well in advance of the applicable selling season.  As a
result, the Company is vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and
to errors in selection and timing of merchandise purchases.

        The Company reviews its inventory levels in order to identify
slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in
stock in a sufficient range of sizes) and may use markdowns to
clear merchandise.  Markdowns may be used if inventory exceeds
customer demand for reasons of style, seasonal adaptation, changes
in customer preference, lack of consumer acceptance of fashion
items, or if it is determined that the inventory in stock will not
sell at its currently marked price.  Such markdowns may have an
adverse impact on earnings, depending on their extent and the
amount of inventory affected.  

        Because the Company does not carry much replenishment
inventory in its stores, replenishment inventory is maintained in
the Company's distribution centers in California, Kentucky,
Maryland and Canada and in a distribution center owned and operated
by a third party in the United Kingdom, and then shipped to the
stores.  

Store Operations and Expansion

        The Company's stores offer a shopper-friendly environment with
a select assortment of casual clothing and accessories which
emphasize style, quality and good value. The range of apparel
displayed in each store varies significantly depending on the
selling season and the size of the store.

        The Company's stores generally are open seven days per week
(where permitted by law), three to six nights per week and most
holidays.  All sales are made for cash or personal checks or on
credit cards issued by others.

        The Company opened 172 new stores and expanded 82 stores
during the 1994 fiscal year; the Company anticipates that it will
open approximately 175 to 200 new stores and expand approximately
50 to 70 stores during the 1995 fiscal year.  Over the past five
years, the Company has increased the average size of its new stores
and expanded the size of existing stores.  For fiscal year 1994,
the average size of new stores was about 7,200 square feet for Gap,
4,700 square feet for GapKids, 6,200 square feet for Banana
Republic, and 15,400 square feet for Old Navy Clothing Co. 
Expanded stores are excluded from comparable store calculations
until they have been open over one year in their new size.

        The Company's continued success depends, in part, upon its
ability to increase sales at existing store locations, to open new
stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis.  There can be
no assurance that the Company's growth will result in enhanced
profitability or that it will continue at the same rate in future
years.    In addition, the Company's strategy of expanding
domestically through new concepts (such as Old Navy Clothing Co.)
and new product lines (such as personal care items), and
internationally in countries in which the Company has no, or
limited, operating history could result in reduced profitability if
such expansion is not successful.  Currently, the Company is
planning to open 3-6 Gap and GapKids stores in Japan during fiscal
1995.

Suppliers

        The Company purchases merchandise from over 1,000 suppliers
located domestically and overseas.  No supplier accounted for more
than 5% of the Company's fiscal 1994 purchases.  Suppliers are
required to manufacture the Company's private-label merchandise
according to the Company's specifications.  During fiscal 1994,
approximately 30% of the Company's merchandise was produced
domestically while the remaining 70% was imported from overseas
vendors.  Approximately 18% of foreign dollar purchases were from Hong 
Kong, or about 14% of the Company's total merchandise, with the remainder
coming from 46 other countries.  Any event causing a sudden disruption
of imports from Hong Kong, including the imposition of additional
import restrictions, could have a materially adverse effect on the
Company's operations. Substantially all of the Company's foreign
purchases are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars.  

        The Company cannot predict whether any of the foreign
countries in which its products are currently  manufactured or any
of the countries in which the Company may manufacture its products
in the future will be subject to future import restrictions by the
U.S. government, including the likelihood, type or effect of any
trade retaliation.  For example, recently the United States
government considered imposing various restrictions on the
importation of goods from China.  Trade restrictions, including
increased tariffs or quotas, or both, against apparel items could
affect the importation of apparel generally, and, in that event,
could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available
to the Company and adversely affect the Company's business,
financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, the
Company's import operations may be adversely affected by political
instability resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting
countries, significant fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar
against foreign currencies and restrictions on the transfer of
funds.

Seasonal Business

        The Company's business follows a seasonal pattern, peaking
over a total of about 10 weeks during the late summer (August
through early September) and holiday (Thanksgiving through
Christmas) periods.  During fiscal year 1994, these periods
accounted for approximately 30% of the Company's annual sales.


Competition

        The Company's business is highly competitive.  The Company's
stores compete with national and local department, specialty and
discount store chains and independent retail stores which handle
similar lines of merchandise.  Some competitors have larger sales
and assets than the Company.

        Depth of selection in sizes, colors and styles of merchandise,
merchandise procurement and pricing, ability to anticipate fashion
trends and customer preferences, inventory control, reputation,
quality of merchandise, store design and location, advertising and
customer service are all important factors in competing
successfully in the retail industry.  Given the large number of
companies in the retail industry, the Company cannot estimate the
number of its competitors or its relative competitive position.

        The performance of the Company in recent years has increased
imitation by other retailers.  Such imitation has made and will
continue to make the retail environment in which the Company
operates more competitive.  In addition, the success of the
Company's operations depends upon a number of factors relating to
consumer spending, including future economic conditions affecting
disposable consumer income such as employment, business conditions,
interest rates and taxation.  A decline in consumer spending could
adversely affect the Company's net sales and profitability. 

Advertising

        The Company's marketing strategy primarily involves
advertising in major metropolitan newspapers and their Sunday
magazines and in major news weeklies, with smaller amounts of print
advertising in lifestyle and fashion magazines.  Other advertising
media include various outdoor venues, such as bus shelters, mass
transit posters, billboards, telephone kiosks and exterior bus
panels, including double-decker London buses.  

Employees

        On January 28, 1995, the Company had a work force of
approximately 55,000 employees. Additionally, the Company hires
temporary employees during the peak late summer and holiday
seasons.  The Company considers its employee relations to be good. 


Trademarks and Service Marks

        The trademarks and service marks for Gap, GapKids, babyGap,
Banana Republic and Old Navy Clothing Co., and other trademarks
either have been registered, or have trademark applications
pending, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and
with the registries of many foreign countries.

Item 2 - PROPERTIES

        During fiscal year 1994, the Company opened 172 stores and
closed 34.  The newly-opened stores include 54 Gap stores
(including 5 stores in the United Kingdom, 8 stores in Canada and
1 store in France), 60 GapKids stores (including 6 stores in the
United Kingdom, 5 stores in Canada and 1 store in France), 12
Banana Republic stores, and 46 Old Navy Clothing Co. stores.  In
addition, during fiscal year 1994, the Company expanded 82 stores. 
The expanded stores include 48 Gap stores (including 2 stores in
the United Kingdom and 2 stores in Canada), 22 GapKids stores
(including 1 in the United Kingdom and 1 in Canada), 11 Banana
Republic stores and 1 Old Navy Clothing Co. store.  The 1,508
stores operating on January 28, 1995 aggregated approximately 9.2
million square feet.  The Company leases virtually all of its store
premises for terms generally ranging from 12 to 15 years.  Most
leases provide for additional rent based on a percentage of store
sales in addition to or in lieu of minimum rentals, as well as for
the payment of certain other expenses.  Some leases contain
cancellation clauses in favor of the Company if specified sales
levels are not achieved.  In the United States, the Company's
stores are located in all of the 50 largest metropolitan
statistical areas.

        During fiscal year 1995, the Company plans to increase store
space by approximately 20%, after taking into account store
closings.  This increase is expected to include the opening of
approximately 175 to 200 new stores worldwide and the expansion of
approximately 50 to 70 of the Company's existing stores.

        The Company leases its headquarters and regional office
buildings, as well as its Eastern Distribution Center (EDC).  The
EDC in Erlanger, Kentucky consists of approximately 1,220,000
square feet.  It distributes Gap, GapKids and Banana Republic
merchandise and its lease term runs through February 28, 2003, with
options to extend the lease for an additional 30 years.  

        The Company owns its Canadian Distribution Center located in
Brampton, Ontario.  It consists of approximately 150,000 square
feet and distributes Gap and GapKids merchandise.  The Company also
owns its Western Distribution Center (WDC) located in Ventura,
California.  This facility, which is approximately 344,000 square
feet, distributes Gap and GapKids merchandise.  The Company also
owns an adjacent five acre parcel for possible future expansion. 
The Atlantic Distribution Center (ADC), a facility owned by the
Company in Edgewood, Maryland, covers approximately 745,000 square
feet and distributes Gap merchandise.  The Company also owns 156
additional acres, portions of which could be used for potential
expansion of the ADC.

        The Company has entered into negotiations to acquire land in
Gallatin, Tennessee for the purpose of constructing a distribution
center at an estimated total cost of approximately $45-55 million. 
If the negotiations are successful, the Company expects the
facility to be in operation by the holiday season of 1996.

        The Company also owns and operates a data center located on
seven acres of land in Rocklin, California; it covers approximately
40,000 square feet and serves as a corporate computer processing
