Special Note on
Forward-looking Statements

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the “safe harbor” provisions of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than those that are purely historical are forward-looking statements. Words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,”
“intend,” “plan,” “project,” and similar expressions also identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: (i) our plans to expand
internationally through a number of channels and brands, including additional Gap stores in Europe and our first Gap stores in China, additional Banana Republic stores in Europe, additional outlet stores in Canada, Europe, and Asia, online sales
internationally, and additional franchising and similar arrangements; (ii) our plans to downsize, consolidate, reposition, or close some of our stores; (iii) cash and cash flows being sufficient for the foreseeable future; (iv) the
outcome of proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims; (v) improving our sales trend while delivering healthy margins; (vi) maintaining a focus on cost management and return on invested capital; (vii) generating strong free
cash flow; (viii) investing in the future while delivering earnings growth; (ix) current cash balances and cash flows being adequate to support our business operations, capital expenditures, and the payment of dividends and share
repurchases; (x) being able to supplement near-term liquidity with our existing credit facility; (xi) capital expenditures in fiscal 2010; (xii) the number of new store openings and store closings in fiscal 2010; (xiii) net
square footage change in fiscal 2010; (xiv) our plan to increase our dividend in fiscal 2010; (xv) future share repurchases; (xvi) the expected payments and the expected benefits, including cost savings, resulting from our services
agreement with IBM; (xvii) the maximum potential amount of future lease payments; (xviii) the impact of losses due to indemnification obligations; (xix) the maximum exposure and cash collateralized balance for the reinsurance pool in
future periods; (xx) the estimates and assumptions we use in our accounting policies, including those used to calculate our lower of cost or market and inventory shortage reserves, our impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill, and
intangible assets, our insurance liabilities, our future sales returns, our breakage income, and our settlement of foreign and domestic tax audits; (xxi) future lease payments related to the closure of Forth & Towne; (xxii) the
assumptions used to value share-based compensation expense; (xxiii) future lease payments and related net cash outlay; (xxiv) our intent to use earnings in foreign operations for an indefinite period or repatriate them only when
tax-effective to do so; (xxv) total gross unrecognized tax benefits; and (xxvi) the impact of recent tax return and refund claim audits.

Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without
limitation, the following: the risk that the adoption of new accounting pronouncements will impact future results; the risk that we will be unsuccessful in gauging fashion trends and changing consumer preferences; the risk that changes in general
economic conditions or consumer spending patterns will have a negative impact on our financial performance or strategies; the highly competitive nature of our business in the United States and internationally and our dependence on consumer spending
patterns, which are influenced by numerous other factors; the risk that we will be unsuccessful in identifying and negotiating new store locations and renewing or modifying leases for existing store locations effectively; the risk that comparable
store sales and margins will experience fluctuations; the risk that we will be unsuccessful in implementing our strategic, operating and people initiatives; the risk that adverse changes in our credit ratings may have a negative impact on our
financing costs, structure and access to capital in future periods; the risk that changes to our information technology (“IT”) systems may disrupt our operations; the risk that trade matters, events causing disruptions in product shipments
from China and other foreign countries, or an inability to secure sufficient manufacturing capacity may disrupt our supply chain or operations; the risk that our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful and could impair the value of
our brands; the risk that acts or omissions by our third party vendors, including a failure to comply with our code of vendor conduct, could have a negative impact on our reputation or operations; the risk that changes in the regulatory or
administrative landscape could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations; the risk that we do not repurchase some or all of the shares we anticipate purchasing pursuant to our repurchase program; and the risk that we will
not be successful in defending various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, claims, and audits; any of which could impact net sales, expenses, and/or planned strategies. Additional information regarding factors that could cause results to differ can be
found in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Future economic and industry trends
that could potentially impact net sales and profitability are difficult to predict. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of March 26, 2010 and we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking
statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized.

THE GAP, INC.

2009 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM

10-K




Part
I

Item 1. Business.

General

The Gap, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” and “our”) was
incorporated in the State of California in July 1969 and was reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in May 1988.

We are a global
specialty retailer offering clothing, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, children, and babies under the Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Piperlime, and Athleta brands. We operate stores in the United States, Canada, the United
Kingdom, France, Ireland, and Japan. We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in many other countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate or will operate
stores that sell apparel, purchased from us, under our brand names.

We design most of our products, which are manufactured by independent sources, and
sell them under our brands:

Gap.

Founded in 1969, Gap stores offer an extensive selection of classically styled, high quality, casual apparel at moderate price points. Products range from wardrobe basics such as denim, khakis, and T-shirts to fashion apparel,
accessories, and personal care products for men and women. We entered the children’s apparel market with the introduction of GapKids in 1986 and babyGap in 1989. These stores offer casual apparel and accessories in the tradition of Gap style
and quality for children ages newborn through pre-teen. We also offer maternity apparel. We launched GapBody in 1998 offering women’s underwear, sleepwear, loungewear, and sports and active apparel. We also operate Gap Outlet stores, which
carry similar categories of products at lower price points.

Old
Navy.

We launched Old Navy in 1994 to address the market for value-priced family apparel. Old Navy offers broad selections of apparel, shoes, and accessories for adults, children, and
infants, as well as other items, including a maternity line, consumables, and personal care products.

Banana Republic.

Acquired in 1983 with two stores, Banana Republic offers sophisticated, fashionable collections of casual and tailored
apparel, shoes, accessories, and personal care products for men and women at higher price points than Gap. We also operate Banana Republic Factory Stores, which carry similar categories of products at lower price points.

As of January 30, 2010, we operated a total of 3,095 store locations. For more information on the number of stores by brand and region, see the table in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included as Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.

In 1997, we introduced Gap Online, a web-based store located at gap.com. Gap Online offers products comparable to those carried in Gap, GapKids, babyGap, and GapBody stores, as well as extended sizes not found in stores. We introduced
Banana Republic Online, a web-based store located at bananarepublic.com, in 1999, which offers products comparable to those carried in the store collections, as well as extended sizes not found in stores. In 2000, we established Old Navy
Online, a web-based store located at oldnavy.com. Old Navy Online offers apparel and accessories comparable to those carried in the store collections, as well as a plus size line not found in stores.

We have two additional brands: Piperlime, an online-only store located at piperlime.com, and Athleta, an online and catalog store located at athleta.com.

Piperlime.

We launched
Piperlime in October 2006. Piperlime offers customers an assortment of the leading brands in footwear, handbags, apparel, and jewelry for women and footwear for men and kids, as well as tips, trends, and advice from leading style authorities.

Athleta.

Acquired in September 2008, Athleta offers customers high quality and performance-driven women’s sports and active apparel
and footwear that is stylish and functional for a variety of activities, including golf, running, skiing and snowboarding, tennis, and yoga. Customers can purchase Athleta product, as well as an assortment of products from leading brands in
women’s active wear, online or through the catalog.

Certain financial information about international operations is set forth under the heading
“Segment Information” in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Our stores
offer a shopper-friendly environment with an assortment of casual apparel and accessories that emphasize style, quality, and good value. The range of merchandise displayed in each store varies depending on the selling season and the size and
location of the store.

Our stores generally are open seven days per week (where permitted by law) and most holidays. All sales are tendered for cash,
personal checks, debit cards, or credit cards. We also issue and redeem gift cards through our brands. Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy each has a private label credit card program and a co-branded credit card program through which frequent
customers receive benefits. Private label and co-branded credit cards are underwritten by a third-party financing company.

Merchandise
Vendors

We purchase private label merchandise from approximately 650 vendors and non-private label merchandise from approximately 350 vendors. Our
vendors have facilities in approximately 60 countries. No vendor accounted for more than 3 percent of the dollar amount of our total fiscal 2009 purchases. Of our merchandise sold during fiscal 2009, approximately 1 percent of all units
(representing approximately 2 percent of total cost) were produced domestically while the remaining 99 percent of all units (representing approximately 98 percent of total cost) were produced outside the United States. Approximately 27 percent of
our merchandise units (representing approximately 31 percent of total cost) were produced in China. Events causing disruption of imports from China or other foreign countries, including the imposition of additional import restrictions or vendors
potentially failing due to political, financial, or regulatory issues, could have an adverse effect on our operations. Substantially all of our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars. Also see the section
entitled “Risk Factors—Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Seasonal
Business

Our business follows a seasonal pattern, with sales peaking over a total of about eight weeks during the holiday period (November through
December).

Brand Building

Our ability
to develop and evolve our existing brands is a key to our success. We believe our distinct brands are among our most important assets. With the exception of Piperlime, virtually all aspects of brand development, from product design and distribution
to marketing, merchandising and shopping environments, are controlled by us. With respect to Piperlime, we control all aspects of brand development except for product design. We continue to invest in our brands and enhance the customer experience
through the remodeling of existing stores, the opening of new stores, the closure of under-performing stores, the enhancement of our online shopping sites, additional investments in marketing, and a focus on customer service.

Trademarks and Service Marks

Gap, GapKids, babyGap,
GapBody, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Piperlime, and Athleta trademarks and service marks, and certain other trademarks, have been registered, or are the subject of pending trademark applications, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and
with the registries of many foreign countries and/or are protected by common law.



Franchising

We have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap and/or Banana Republic stores in Australia, Bahrain, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Egypt,
Greece, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Oman, Philippines, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Turkey, and United Arab Emirates. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will
operate, stores that sell apparel purchased from us under our brand names. While we expect this will be a small part of our business in the near future, we plan over time to continue increasing the number of countries in which we enter into these
types of arrangements as part of our efforts to expand internationally. For additional information on risks related to our franchise business, see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Our efforts to expand internationally may not be
successful and could impair the value of our brands” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Inventory

The cyclical nature of the retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to peak selling seasons when we and other retailers
generally build up our inventory levels. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes) and use markdowns to clear merchandise. Because we
do not carry much replenishment inventory in our stores, much of our inventory is maintained in distribution centers. Also see the section entitled “Risk Factors—We must successfully gauge fashion trends and changing consumer preferences
to succeed” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Competitors

The global specialty apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We compete with local, national, and global department stores, specialty and discount store chains, independent retail stores, and online
businesses that market similar lines of merchandise. We are also faced with competition in European, Japanese, and Canadian markets from established regional and national chains, and our franchisees face significant competition in the markets in
which they operate. Also see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Our business is highly competitive and depends on consumer spending patterns” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Employees

As of January 30, 2010, we had a work
force of approximately 135,000 employees, which includes a combination of part- and full-time employees. We hire seasonal employees primarily during the peak holiday period.

To remain competitive in the apparel retail industry, we must attract, develop, and retain skilled employees, including executives. Competition for such personnel is intense. Our success is dependent to a
significant degree on the continued contributions of key employees. Also see the section entitled “Risk Factors—We must successfully gauge fashion trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed” in Item 1A of this
Form 10-K.

Available Information

We make available on our website, gapinc.com, under “Investors, Financials, SEC Filings,” free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those
reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish them to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Our past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance because actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties discussed
below. In addition, historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.

General economic conditions
and the impact on consumer spending patterns could adversely impact our results of operations.

The Company’s performance is subject to general
economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending. Consumer spending has declined recently and could remain depressed for an extended period. Some of



the factors influencing consumer spending include fluctuating interest rates and credit availability, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, higher levels of
unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Consumer purchases of
discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty, and such conditions could adversely impact our results of operations.

Our business is highly competitive.

The global
specialty apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We compete with local, national, and global department stores, specialty and discount store chains, independent retail stores, and online businesses that market similar lines of merchandise.
We face a variety of competitive challenges including:

•

attracting consumer traffic;

•

sourcing merchandise efficiently;

•

competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value;

•

anticipating and quickly responding to changing fashion trends and consumer demands;

•

maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to consumers in several diverse market segments;

•

developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to consumers of varying age groups and tastes; and

•

providing strong and effective marketing support.

In addition, our franchisees face significant competition in the markets in which they operate. If we or our franchisees are not able to compete successfully in the United States or internationally, our results of operations could be
adversely affected.

The market for prime real estate is competitive.

Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new stores nationally and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease
economics, demographics, and other factors, including our ability to negotiate terms that meet our financial targets. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases. In addition, we recently have been seeking to downsize,
consolidate, reposition, or close some of our real estate locations, which in some cases requires a modification of an existing store lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify existing locations, or failure to
effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Additionally,
the current economic environment may make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of retail real estate properties within the United States and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at
previously negotiated rents and the quality of our decisions to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet annual targets
or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

We must successfully gauge fashion trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed.

Our success is largely dependent upon our
ability to gauge the fashion tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner. The global specialty retail business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences, dictated in part by
fashion and season. To the extent we misjudge the market for our merchandise or the products suitable for local markets, our sales will be adversely affected, and

the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely affect our operating results. Some of our past product offerings have not been well received by our broad and diverse
customer base. Merchandise misjudgments could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

Our ability to anticipate and effectively respond
to changing fashion trends depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in our design, merchandising, marketing, and other functions. Competition for this personnel is intense, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to
attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods.

Fluctuations in the global specialty retail business especially affect
the inventory owned by apparel retailers, as merchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the season and frequently before fashion trends are evidenced by customer purchases. In addition, the cyclical nature of the global specialty retail
business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we build up our inventory levels. We must enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise well in advance
of the applicable selling season. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. In the past, we have not always predicted our customers’ preferences and acceptance
levels of our fashion items with accuracy. In addition, lead times for many of our purchases are long, which may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing fashion trends or consumer acceptance of our products. If sales do
not meet expectations, too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns, and therefore, lower than planned margins.

We experience
fluctuations in our comparable store sales and margins.

Our success depends in part on our ability to improve sales, in particular at our largest
brands. A variety of factors affect comparable store sales, including fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, the timing of new merchandise releases and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing
programs, and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations. Our comparable store sales have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual, quarterly,
and monthly basis. More recently, over the past three years, our comparable store sales figures have been negative year over year as demonstrated by a decrease of 4 percent in fiscal 2007, a decrease of 12 percent in fiscal 2008, and a decrease of 3
percent in fiscal 2009. Over the past five years, our reported gross margins have ranged from a high of 40 percent in fiscal 2009 to a low of 36 percent in fiscal 2006. In addition, over the past five years, our reported operating margins have
ranged from a high of 13 percent in fiscal 2009 to a low of 8 percent in fiscal 2006.

Our ability to deliver strong comparable store sales results and
margins depends in large part on accurately forecasting demand and fashion trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base, managing inventory effectively, using
effective pricing strategies, and optimizing store performance. Failure to meet the expectations of investors, securities analysts, or credit rating agencies in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our common stock and cause
our credit ratings to decline.

Changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the
capital markets.

Although we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with future cash flow from our operations will be adequate
to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future, we may require additional cash for unexpected contingencies.

There can be no assurance that our
current levels of liquidity will continue or that our ability to access the credit or capital markets will not be adversely affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy.

Due to our long-term credit ratings, we do not have meaningful access to the commercial paper market. Any future reduction in our long-term senior unsecured
credit rating could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets and higher interest costs on future financings.



As of January 30, 2010, the Company
had no debt outstanding and $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.

For further information on our credit facilities, see
the section entitled “Credit Facilities” in our “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included as Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.

Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain.

Trade
restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of
apparel available to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be
subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. and other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions. In addition, we face the possibility of anti-dumping or countervailing duties lawsuits
from U.S. domestic producers. We are unable to determine the impact of the changes to the quota system or the impact that potential tariff lawsuits could have on our global sourcing operations. Our sourcing operations may be adversely affected by
trade limits or political and financial instability, resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries, significant fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and/or
other trade disruptions.

Updates or changes to our IT systems may disrupt operations.

We continue to evaluate and implement upgrades to our IT systems. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing
systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions, and believe we are taking appropriate
action to mitigate the risks through testing, training, and staging implementation, as well as ensuring appropriate commercial contracts are in place with third-party vendors supplying such replacement technologies. However, there can be no
assurances that we will successfully launch these systems as planned or that they will occur without disruptions to our operations. IT system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, or failure to successfully implement new
or upgraded systems, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our IT services agreement with IBM could cause
disruptions in our operations and have an adverse effect on our financial results.

We have entered into the fifth year of a ten-year non-exclusive
services agreement with International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”) under which IBM operates certain significant aspects of our IT infrastructure. Under the original agreement, this included supporting our mainframe, server,
network and data center, and store operations, as well as help desk, end user support, and some disaster recovery. The agreement was amended effective March 2, 2009 to return to us certain services originally performed by IBM under the
agreement. These returned services include services related to management of our server and data center environment, along with disaster recovery. All other services remain with IBM per the original agreement. Our ability to realize the expected
benefits of this arrangement is subject to various risks, some of which are not within our complete control. These risks include, but are not limited to, disruption in services and the failure to protect the security and integrity of the
Company’s data under the terms of the agreement. We are unable to provide assurances that some or all of these risks will not occur. Failure to effectively mitigate these risks, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our
operations and financial results.

Our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful and could impair the value of our brands.

Our current strategies include international expansion in a number of countries around the world through a number of channels and brands. For
example, we currently plan to open additional Gap stores in Europe and our first Gap stores in China, expand Banana Republic in Europe, open additional outlet stores in Canada, Europe, and

Asia, and begin offering online sales internationally, including in Canada and a number of European countries. We do not have any experience operating in a number of these countries, and we have
no experience offering online sales internationally. In many of these countries, we face major, established competitors. In addition, in many of these countries, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics, and other
operating requirements differ dramatically from those in the places where we have experience. Moreover, consumer tastes and trends may differ in many of these countries, and as a result, the sales of our products may not be successful or result in
the margins we anticipate. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our operations and financial results could be materially, adversely affected.

We also have entered into franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores in many countries around the world. Under these agreements, third
parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel purchased from us under our brand names. Prior to fiscal 2006, we had no experience operating through these types of third-party arrangements, and we can provide no assurance that these
arrangements will be successful. While we expect this will continue to be a small part of our business in the near future, we plan over time to continue increasing these types of arrangements as part of our efforts to expand internationally. The
effect of these arrangements on our business and results of operations is uncertain and will depend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in new markets internationally and our ability to successfully identify appropriate third
parties to act as franchisees, distributors, or in a similar capacity. In addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store
locations, store openings, and sales. Other risks that may affect these third parties include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, and political instability. Moreover, while the
agreements we have entered into and plan to enter into in the future provide us with certain termination rights, the value of our brands could be impaired to the extent that these third parties do not operate their stores in a manner consistent with
our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our
reputation.

Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing.

The current unfavorable economic conditions, including reduced ability to access credit, is having an adverse impact on businesses around the world, and its impact on
our vendors cannot be predicted. Vendors’ reduced ability to access sources of capital could lead to their failure to deliver merchandise and could reduce the supply of apparel available to us, which could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Independent third parties manufacture nearly all of our products for us. If we experience significant
increases in demand or need to replace an existing vendor, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any vendor would allocate sufficient
capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors in
our methods, products, quality control standards, and environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our
products, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could have an adverse
effect on our ability to meet consumer demand for our products and result in lower sales and net income.

Because independent vendors manufacture nearly
all of our products outside of our principal sales markets, third parties must transport our products over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port
strikes, infrastructure congestion, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with transitioning between vendors, could adversely impact our financial performance. Manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to
use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as aircraft, which could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, the cost of fuel is a significant component in transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum
products can adversely affect our gross margins.



Failure of our vendors to
adhere to our code of vendor conduct could harm our business.

We purchase nearly all merchandise from third-party vendors outside of the United
States and require those vendors to adhere to a code of vendor conduct and other environmental, labor, health, and safety standards for the benefit of workers. From time to time, contractors may not be in compliance with these standards or
applicable local laws. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could have a negative impact on our reputation and an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Laws and regulations at the state, federal, and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. In addition,
we cannot predict the impact that may result from changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts
employment and labor, trade, product safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, privacy, or environmental issues, among others, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.

Item 2. Properties.

We operate stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, and Japan. The stores in operation as of January 30, 2010 aggregated
approximately 38.8 million square feet. Almost all of our stores are leased with one or more renewal options after our initial term, or have slightly longer terms with negotiated sales termination clauses at predetermined sales thresholds.
Economic terms vary by type of location.

We own approximately 1.2 million square feet of corporate office space located in San Francisco, San
Bruno, and Rocklin, California, of which approximately 184,000 square feet is leased to another company. We lease approximately 1.2 million square feet of corporate office space located in San Francisco, San Bruno, Rocklin, and Petaluma,
California; New York, New York; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Of the 1.2 million square feet of leased office space, approximately 150,000 square feet is under sublease to others and approximately 36,000 square feet is
being marketed for sublease to others. We also lease 15 regional offices in North America and 31 international offices. We own approximately 8.6 million square feet of distribution space located in Fresno, California; Fishkill, New York;
Groveport, Ohio; Gallatin, Tennessee; Brampton, Ontario, Canada; and Rugby, England. We lease approximately 1.6 million square feet of distribution space located in Grove City, Ohio, and in Northern Kentucky. A third-party logistics company
provides logistics services to us through a 444,000 square foot distribution warehouse in Chiba, Japan.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

As a multinational company, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits,
disputes, and claims (“Actions”) arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against us from time to time include commercial,
intellectual property, customer, employment, data privacy, and securities related claims, including class action lawsuits in which plaintiffs allege that we violated federal and state wage and hour and other laws. The plaintiffs in some Actions seek
unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages, and some are covered in part by insurance.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Overview

We are a global specialty retailer offering clothing, accessories, and personal care
products for men, women, children, and babies under the Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Piperlime, and Athleta brands. We operate stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, and Japan. We also have franchise agreements
with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in many other countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel purchased from us under our brand names. In
addition, our U.S. customers can shop online at gap.com, oldnavy.com, bananarepublic.com, piperlime.com, and athleta.com. Most of the products sold under our brand names are designed by us and manufactured by independent sources. We also sell
products that are designed and manufactured by branded third parties.

We identify our operating segments based on the way we manage and evaluate our
business activities. We have two reportable segments: Stores and Direct.

Financial highlights for fiscal 2009 include the following:

•

Net sales for fiscal 2009 were $14.2 billion compared with $14.5 billion for fiscal 2008, and comparable store sales decreased 3 percent compared with a decrease
of 12 percent last year.

•

Gross margin for fiscal 2009 was 40.3 percent compared with 37.5 percent for fiscal 2008.

•

Operating margin for fiscal 2009 was 12.8 percent compared with 10.7 percent for fiscal 2008.

•

Net income for fiscal 2009 increased 14.0 percent to $1.1 billion, or $1.58 per share on a diluted basis, compared with $967 million, or $1.34 per share on a
diluted basis, for fiscal 2008.

•

In fiscal 2009, we generated free cash flow of $1.6 billion compared with free cash flow of $981 million in fiscal 2008. Free cash flow is defined as net
cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. For a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, from a GAAP financial measure, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.

•

As of January 30, 2010, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $2.6 billion, with no debt outstanding. We believe our cash balances
and cash flows from operations will be sufficient for the foreseeable future.

Our business and financial priorities for fiscal
2010 are as follows:

•

consistently delivering product that aligns with our target customers, with an overall objective of improving our sales trend while delivering healthy margins;

•

maintaining a focus on cost management and return on invested capital;

•

generating strong free cash flow and returning excess cash to shareholders; and

•

investing in the future while delivering earnings growth.

As we continue to focus on regaining market share in North America in fiscal 2010, we also plan to expand internationally through the following:

•

opening our first Gap stores in China and Italy;

•

expanding Banana Republic in Europe;

•

opening additional outlet stores in Canada, Europe, and Asia; and

•

introducing our online shopping experience to customers in Canada and Europe.

Results of Operations

Net Sales

Net Sales by
Brand, Region, and Reportable Segment

Net sales primarily consist of retail sales, online sales, wholesale and franchise revenues, and shipping fees
received from customers for delivery of merchandise. Gap and Banana Republic outlet retail sales are reflected within the respective results of each brand.

We identify our operating segments based on the way we manage and evaluate our business activities. We have two reportable segments: Stores and Direct.

See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for net sales by brand, region, and reportable segment.

Comparable Store Sales

The percentage change in comparable store sales by brand and region and for
total Company, as compared with the preceding year, is as follows:

Only the Company owned stores are included in the
calculation of comparable store sales. The comparable store sales calculation excludes sales from our Direct reportable segment and our wholesale and franchise businesses. Gap and Banana Republic outlet comparable store sales are reflected within
the respective results of each brand.

A store is included in comparable store sales (“Comp”) when it has been open for at least 12 months and
the selling square footage has not changed by 15 percent or more within the past year. A store is included in Comp on the first day it has comparable prior year sales. Stores in which the selling square footage has changed by 15 percent or more as a
result of a remodel, expansion, or reduction are excluded from Comp until the first day they have comparable prior year sales. Current year foreign exchange rates are applied to both current year and prior year Comp store sales to achieve a
consistent basis for comparison.

A store is considered non-comparable (“Non-comp”) when it has been open for less than 12 months or has
changed its selling square footage by 15 percent or more within the past year.

A store is considered “Closed” if it is temporarily closed for
three or more full consecutive days or is permanently closed. When a temporarily closed store reopens, the store will be placed in the Comp/Non-comp status it was in prior to its closure. If a store was in Closed status for three or more days in the
prior year, the store will be in Non-comp status for the same days the following year.

stores open as of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, respectively.

Net Sales Discussion

Our fiscal 2009 net sales decreased $329 million, or 2 percent, compared with fiscal 2008, primarily due to a decrease in net sales of $417 million related to our
Stores reportable segment, offset by an increase in net sales of $88 million related to our Direct reportable segment.

•

For the Stores reportable segment, our fiscal 2009 net sales decreased $417 million, or 3 percent, compared with fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a
decline in net sales at Gap and Banana Republic as well as the $32 million unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, offset by an increase in net sales at Old Navy. The foreign exchange impact is the translation impact if fiscal 2008 sales were
translated at fiscal 2009 exchange rates. Comparable store sales for fiscal 2009 decreased 3 percent compared with fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the continued difficult retail environment.

•

For the Direct reportable segment, our fiscal 2009 net sales increased $88 million, or 9 percent, compared with fiscal 2008. The increase was primarily due to
incremental sales related to Athleta, which was acquired in September 2008.

Our fiscal 2008 net sales decreased $1.2
billion, or 8 percent, compared with fiscal 2007, primarily due to a decrease in net sales of $1.4 billion related to our Stores reportable segment, offset by an increase in net sales of $127 million related to our Direct reportable segment.

•

For the Stores reportable segment, our fiscal 2008 net sales decreased $1.4 billion, or 9 percent, compared with fiscal 2007. The decrease was primarily due to a
decline in net sales at all of our brands due to the weakening retail environment and declines in traffic, offset by an increase in net sales from our franchise business and the $19 million favorable impact of foreign exchange. The foreign exchange
impact is the translation impact if fiscal 2007 sales were translated at fiscal 2008 exchange rates.

•

For the Direct reportable segment, our fiscal 2008 net sales increased $127 million, or 14 percent, compared with fiscal 2007 due to the growth in our online
business across all brands and the acquisition of Athleta in September 2008.

Cost of Goods Sold and Occupancy Expenses

Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses include the following:

•

the cost of merchandise;

•

inventory shortage and valuation adjustments;

•

freight charges;

•

costs associated with our sourcing operations, including payroll and related benefits;

•

production costs;

•

insurance costs related to merchandise; and

•

rent, occupancy, depreciation, and amortization related to our store operations, distribution centers, and certain corporate functions.

The classification of these expenses varies across the apparel retail industry. Accordingly, our cost of goods sold and occupancy
expenses may not be comparable to that of other companies.

As a general business practice, we review our inventory levels in order to identify
slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes) and use markdowns to clear the majority of this merchandise.

Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of
net sales decreased 2.8 percentage points in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Cost of goods sold decreased 2.9 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Occupancy expenses increased 0.1 percentage
points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008.

•

For the Stores reportable segment, cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 2.7 percentage points in fiscal 2009 compared
with fiscal 2008. Cost of goods sold decreased 2.9 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced cost of merchandise from our cost management efforts and a
decrease in selling at markdown. Occupancy expenses increased 0.2 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008, primarily driven by lower sales related to comparable stores.



•

For the Direct reportable segment, cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 3.5 percentage points in fiscal 2009 compared
with fiscal 2008. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales decreased 4.1 percentage points in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced cost of merchandise from our cost management efforts and a
decrease in selling at markdown. Occupancy expenses, consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization expense, increased 0.6 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008, primarily driven by
higher depreciation expense for new information technology systems and applications and incremental expenses related to the integration of Athleta, which was acquired in September 2008.

Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 1.4 percentage points in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Cost of goods sold
decreased 3.1 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Occupancy expenses increased 1.7 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007.

•

For the Stores reportable segment, cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 1.4 percentage points in fiscal 2008 compared
with fiscal 2007. Cost of goods sold decreased 3.3 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. The decrease was driven by higher margins achieved for both regular price and marked down merchandise,
primarily as a result of reduced cost of merchandise from our cost management efforts. Occupancy expenses increased 1.9 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007, primarily driven by lower net sales in
fiscal 2008, and to a lesser extent, an increase in certain occupancy expenses.

•

For the Direct reportable segment, cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 0.9 percentage points in fiscal 2008 compared
with fiscal 2007. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was relatively flat in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Occupancy expenses, consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization expense, increased 0.7 percentage points as a
percentage of net sales in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007, primarily driven by higher depreciation expense for new information technology systems and applications.

Operating expenses include the
following:

•

payroll and related benefits (for our store operations, field management, distribution centers, and corporate functions);

•

The classification of these expenses
varies across the apparel retail industry. Accordingly, our operating expenses may not be comparable to that of other companies.

Operating expenses increased $10 million, or 0.7 percentage
points as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The increase was mainly due to $78 million in increased marketing expenses primarily for Gap and Old Navy, offset by $68 million in decreased store payroll and benefits
and other store-related expenses.

Operating expenses decreased $478 million, or 1.0 percent as a percentage of net sales, in fiscal 2008 compared with
fiscal 2007 primarily due to the following:

•

$195 million in decreased corporate and divisional overhead expenses, primarily related to bonus, payroll, and employee benefits;

•

$141 million in decreased store payroll and benefits;

•

$88 million in decreased store-related expenses associated with fewer remodels, fewer fixture rollouts, and less packaging and supplies; and

•

$41 million in decreased marketing expenses, primarily for Gap and Old Navy.

Interest Expense

($ in millions)




Interest expense

Interest expense for fiscal 2008 includes an interest expense
reversal of $9 million from the reduction of interest expense accruals resulting primarily from foreign tax audit events occurring in the period. Excluding this reversal, interest expense for fiscal 2008 was $10 million on overall borrowings and
obligations.

The decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008, net of interest expense reversal, was primarily due to the
maturities of our $138 million, 8.80 percent notes repaid in December 2008 and $50 million, 6.25 percent notes repaid in March 2009.

The decrease in
interest expense for fiscal 2008, excluding the reversal of interest expense, compared with fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the maturity of our $326 million, 6.90 percent notes repaid in September 2007.

Interest income is earned on our cash and cash equivalents
and short-term investments. The decrease in interest income for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was primarily due to lower interest rates.

Interest income decreased for fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 primarily due to lower interest rates and lower average balances of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.



Income Taxes

The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 from
fiscal 2008 was primarily driven by the determination during fiscal 2009 that we no longer intend to utilize certain amounts of the undistributed earnings of our Canadian and Japanese subsidiaries in foreign operations indefinitely, the impact of
changes in state tax laws, and a change in the mix of income between domestic and international operations.

The increase in the effective tax rate in
fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was primarily driven by a change in the mix of income, with a higher relative percentage of fiscal 2008 income occurring in jurisdictions that impose higher relative tax rates.

We currently expect the fiscal 2010 effective tax rate to be about 39 percent. The actual rate will ultimately depend on several variables, including the mix of income
between domestic and international operations, the overall level of income, and the potential resolution of outstanding tax contingencies.

Loss from Discontinued Operation, Net of Income Tax Benefit

Loss from discontinued operation relates to the Forth & Towne
brand, whose stores were closed by the end of June 2007. Loss from the discontinued operation of Forth & Towne, net of income tax benefit, was $34 million for fiscal 2007.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our largest source of cash flows is cash collections from the sale
of our merchandise. Our primary uses of cash include merchandise inventory purchases, occupancy costs, personnel related expenses, purchases of property and equipment, and payment of taxes. In addition, we continue to return excess cash to our
shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.

We consider the following to be measures of our liquidity and capital resources:

(a)

Our working capital and current ratio calculations include restricted cash.

Our working capital and current ratio as of January 30, 2010 increased compared with January 31, 2009, primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. See Cash Flows from Operating Activities
below.

As of January 30, 2010, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $2.6 billion. Our cash flow generation remains healthy,
and our cash position remains strong. We believe that current cash balances and cash flows from our operations will be adequate to support our business operations, capital expenditures, and payments related to dividends and share repurchase
activities for the foreseeable future. We are also able to supplement the near-term liquidity, if necessary, with our existing $500 million revolving credit facility.

a lower fiscal 2008 bonus payout in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 compared with the fiscal 2007 bonus payout in the first quarter of fiscal 2008;

For fiscal 2008, net cash provided by operating activities decreased $669 million compared with fiscal 2007, primarily due to the
following:

•

an increased balance in accounts payable in fiscal 2007 due to the change in vendor payment terms;

•

a higher payout during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 related to the fiscal 2007 bonus compared with the prior year comparable period;

•

a decrease in the gift card, gift certificate, and credit voucher liability due to more redemptions than issuances in fiscal 2008, compared with more issuances
than redemptions in fiscal 2007;

•

decreases in accrued liabilities and other current liabilities related to information technology projects and advertising expenses; offset by

•

higher net income in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007.

Inventory management remains an area of focus. Inventory per square foot at January 30, 2010 was relatively flat compared with inventory per square foot at January 31, 2009.

We fund inventory expenditures during normal and peak periods through cash flows from operating activities and available cash. Our business follows a seasonal pattern,
with sales peaking over a total of about eight weeks during the holiday period. The seasonality of our operations may lead to significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts between fiscal year-end and subsequent interim periods.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for capital expenditures and purchases of short-term investments, while cash inflows are primarily the result of proceeds from maturities of short-term investments. Net cash used for
investing activities for fiscal 2009 increased $139 million compared with fiscal 2008, primarily due to the following:

•

$401 million due to net purchases of short-term investments in fiscal 2009 compared with net maturities in fiscal 2008; offset by

•

$142 million, net of cash acquired, used for the acquisition of Athleta in September 2008; and

•

$97 million less purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008.

Net cash used for investing activities for fiscal 2008 increased $124 million compared with fiscal 2007, primarily due to the following:

•

$217 million less net maturities of short-term investments in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007;

•

$142 million, net of cash acquired, used for the acquisition of Athleta in September 2008; offset by

•

$251 million less purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007.



For fiscal 2010, we expect capital
expenditures to be about $575 million. We expect to open about 65 new store locations and close about 110 store locations. As a result, we expect net square footage to decrease about 3 percent for fiscal 2010.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Our cash
outflows from financing activities consist primarily of the repurchases of our common stock, dividend payments, and the repayment of debt. Cash inflows typically consist of proceeds from share-based compensation, net of withholding tax
payments. Net cash used for financing activities for fiscal 2009 decreased $234 million compared with fiscal 2008, primarily due to the following:

•

$158 million less repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008; and

•

$88 million less repayments of long-term debt in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008.

Net cash used for financing activities for fiscal 2008 decreased $1.1 billion compared with fiscal 2007, primarily due to the following:

•

$995 million less repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007;

•

$188 million less repayments of long-term debt in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007; offset by

•

$50 million less cash inflows from share-based compensation in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007.

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP
financial measure. We believe free cash flow is an important metric because it represents a measure of how much cash a company has available for discretionary and non-discretionary items after the deduction of capital expenditures, as we require
regular capital expenditures to build and maintain stores and purchase new equipment to improve our business. We use this metric internally, as we believe our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an important driver of value
creation. However, this non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to supersede or replace our GAAP results.

The following table reconciles
free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, from a GAAP financial measure.

Credit Facilities

Trade letters of credit represent a payment undertaking guaranteed by a bank on our behalf to pay a vendor a given amount of money upon presentation of specific documents demonstrating that merchandise has shipped. Vendor payables are
recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the time of merchandise title transfer, although the letters of credit are generally issued prior to this. Most of our merchandise vendors are now on open account payment terms. As of January 30,
2010, our letter of credit agreements consist of two separate $100 million, three-year, unsecured committed letter of credit agreements, with two separate banks, for a total aggregate availability of $200 million with an expiration date of May 2011.
As of January 30, 2010, we had $24 million in trade letters of credit issued under these letter of credit agreements.

We also have a $500 million,
five-year, unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to expire in August 2012 (the “Facility”). The Facility is available for general corporate purposes including working capital, trade letters of credit, and standby letters of credit.
The facility usage fees and fees related to the Facility fluctuate based on our long- term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio. If we were to draw on the Facility, interest would be a

base rate (typically the London Interbank Offered Rate) plus a margin based on our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio on the unpaid principal amount. To maintain
availability of funds under the Facility, we pay a facility fee on the full facility amount, regardless of usage. As of January 30, 2010, there were no borrowings under the Facility. The net availability of the Facility, reflecting
$56 million of outstanding standby letters of credit, was $444 million as of January 30, 2010.

The Facility and letter of credit agreements
contain financial and other covenants, including but not limited to limitations on liens and subsidiary debt as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios—a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio. Violation of these covenants
could result in a default under the Facility and letter of credit agreements, which would permit the participating banks to terminate our ability to access the Facility for letters of credit and advances, terminate our ability to request letters of
credit under the letter of credit agreements, require the immediate repayment of any outstanding advances under the Facility, and require the immediate posting of cash collateral in support of any outstanding letters of credit under the letter
of credit agreements.

Dividend Policy

In determining whether and at what level to declare a dividend, we consider a number of factors including sustainability, operating performance, liquidity, and market conditions.

We increased our annual dividend, which had been $0.32 per share for fiscal 2007, to $0.34 per share for fiscal 2008 and 2009. We intend to increase our annual dividend to $0.40 per share for fiscal 2010.

Share Repurchase Program

Since the
beginning of fiscal 2004, the Company has repurchased approximately 364 million shares for $7.0 billion. In fiscal 2006 and 2007, the Board of Directors authorized share repurchases of $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, which were
both fully utilized by the end of fiscal 2007. In February 2008, the Board of Directors authorized $1 billion for additional share repurchases, which was fully utilized by the end of fiscal 2009. In November 2009, the Board of Directors authorized
an additional $500 million share repurchase program, of which $255 million was utilized through January 30, 2010. This authorization was fully utilized in March 2010. In connection with the fiscal 2007, 2008, and 2009 authorizations, we entered
into purchase agreements with individual members of the Fisher family (related party transactions). The Fisher family shares were purchased at the same weighted-average market price that we paid for share repurchases in the open market. The purchase
agreements were terminable upon 15 business days notice by the Company or individual Fisher family members.

During fiscal 2009, we repurchased
approximately 24 million shares for $510 million, including commissions, at an average price per share of $21.30. Approximately 2 million of these shares were repurchased for $40 million from the Fisher family. All of the share repurchases
were paid for as of January 30, 2010 except $3 million that was payable to Fisher family members. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased approximately 46 million shares for $745 million, including commissions, at an average price per share of
$16.36, and approximately 7 million of these shares were repurchased for $117 million from the Fisher family. In fiscal 2007, we repurchased approximately 89 million shares for $1.7 billion, including commissions, at an average price per
share of $19.05, and approximately 13 million of these shares were repurchased for $249 million from the Fisher family.

In February 2010, we
announced that our Board of Directors authorized $1 billion for additional share repurchases. We have not entered into purchase agreements with members of the Fisher family in connection with this authorization.



Contractual Cash Obligations

We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. The following table provides summary
information concerning our future contractual obligations as of January 30, 2010. These obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, while others are disclosed as future obligations.

(a)

The table above excludes $131 million of long-term liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, as we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur. The
amount is recorded in lease incentives and other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 30, 2010.

(b)

Maintenance, insurance, taxes, and contingent rent obligations are excluded. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our operating leases.

(c)

Represents estimated open purchase orders to purchase inventory as well as commitments for products and services used in the normal course of business.

Commercial Commitments

We have commercial
commitments, not reflected in the table above, that were incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations, including standby letters of credit of $58 million (of which $56 million was issued under the revolving credit facility
lines), surety bonds of $40 million, and bank guarantees of $7 million outstanding at January 30, 2010.

Amounts Reflected in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet

We have other long-term liabilities reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, including deferred income taxes. The
payment obligations associated with these liabilities are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities. Therefore, the timing of these payments cannot be determined, except for amounts estimated to be paid in fiscal
2010 that are recorded in current liabilities.

Other Cash Obligations Not Reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet (Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements)

The majority of our contractual obligations are made up of operating leases for our stores. Commitments for operating leases represent
future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable leases. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, our operating leases are not recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet; however, the minimum
lease payments related to these leases are disclosed in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Purchase obligations include our
non-exclusive services agreement with IBM to operate certain aspects of our information technology structure. The agreement was amended March 2, 2009. The services agreement expires in March 2016, and we have the right to renew it for up to
three additional years. We have various options to terminate the agreement, and we pay IBM under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on our actual consumption of services. IBM also has certain
termination rights in the event of our material breach of the agreement and failure to cure. Based on the current projection of service needs, we expect to pay approximately $623 million to IBM over the remaining term of the contract.

We have assigned certain store and
corporate facility leases to third parties as of January 30, 2010. Under these arrangements, we are secondarily liable and have guaranteed the lease payments of the new lessees for the remaining portion of our original lease
obligation. The maximum potential amount of future lease payments we could be required to make is approximately $31 million as of January 30, 2010. The carrying amount of the liability related to the guarantees was approximately $2
million as of January 30, 2010.

We are a party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party
for certain matters. These contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts, operating leases, trademarks, intellectual property, financial agreements, and various other agreements. Under these contracts, we may provide certain routine
indemnifications relating to representations and warranties (e.g., ownership of assets, environmental or tax indemnifications) or personal injury matters. The terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined.
Generally, the maximum obligation under such indemnifications is not explicitly stated, and as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made significant payments for these
indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

As party to a reinsurance pool for workers’ compensation, general liability, and automobile liability, we have guarantees with a maximum exposure of $14 million, of which $0.2 million has been cash
collateralized. We are currently in the process of winding down our participation in the reinsurance pool. Our maximum exposure and cash collateralized balance are expected to decrease in the future as our participation in the reinsurance
pool diminishes.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant
judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application
of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large, global corporation. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require
adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information.

Our significant accounting policies can be found
in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either judgmental or involve
the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit and Finance
Committee of our Board of Directors, which has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Merchandise Inventory

We value inventory at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”), with cost
determined using the weighted-average cost method. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes) and use markdowns to clear merchandise.
We record a reserve when future estimated selling price is less than cost. Our LCM reserve calculation requires management to make assumptions to estimate the amount of slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments subject to markdowns, which is
dependent upon factors such as historical trends with similar merchandise, inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand, and the promotional environment. In addition, we estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count and
the balance sheet date. Our shortage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends. Historically, actual shortage has not differed materially from our estimates.



We do not believe there is a reasonable
likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our LCM or inventory shortage reserves. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or actual physical inventory shortage
differs significantly from our estimate, our operating results could be affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to calculate our LCM or inventory shortage reserves in the past three fiscal years.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill, and Intangible Assets

We review the carrying value of long-lived assets, including lease rights, key money, and intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include the decision to close a store, corporate facility, or distribution center, or a significant decrease in the operating performance of the long-lived
asset. For long-lived assets that are identified as potentially being impaired, if the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group are less than the carrying value, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying
value of the asset group and its fair value. The fair value of the asset group is estimated based on discounted future cash flows of the asset group using a discount rate commensurate with the risk. The asset group is defined as the lowest level for
which identifiable cash flows are available. Our estimate of future cash flows requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses and estimating useful lives of the assets. These estimates
can be affected by factors such as future store results, real estate demand, and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. We have not made any material changes in the methodology to assess and calculate impairment of long-lived assets
in the past three fiscal years. We recorded charges for the impairment of long-lived assets of $14 million, $5 million, and $42 million for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The impairment charge in fiscal 2007 included $29
million related to the discontinued operation of Forth & Towne.

In connection with the acquisition of Athleta in September 2008, we
allocated $99 million of the purchase price to goodwill and $54 million to the trade name. The carrying values of goodwill and the trade name were $99 million and $54 million, respectively, as of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009 and
were allocated to the Direct reportable segment. We review the carrying value of goodwill and the trade name for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events that
result in an impairment review include significant changes in the business climate, declines in our operating results, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We assess potential impairment by considering present economic
conditions as well as future expectations. We have deemed the Direct reportable segment to be the reporting unit for goodwill acquired through the acquisition of Athleta. The fair value of the Direct reporting unit used to test goodwill for
impairment is estimated using the income approach. The fair value of the trade name is determined using the relief from royalty method. These analyses require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales,
expenses, discount rates, and royalty rates, which can be affected by economic conditions and other factors that can be difficult to predict.

During the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we completed our annual impairment review of our goodwill and the trade name and did not recognize any impairment charges. The fair value of the Direct reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value as of the
date of our annual impairment review.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or
assumptions we use to calculate impairment losses of long-lived assets, goodwill, and intangible assets. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in the calculations, we may be exposed to losses that
could be material.

Insurance and Self-Insurance

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers’ compensation, general liability, and employee related health care benefits, a portion of
which is paid by our employees. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated based primarily on actuarially-determined amounts and accrued in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other
actuarial assumptions. Any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. Among the

causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates, litigation trends, legal interpretations, benefit level changes, health care costs, and claim
settlement patterns. Historically, actual results for estimated losses have not differed materially from our estimates.

We do not believe there is a
reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our insurance liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or
gains that could be material.

Revenue Recognition

While revenue recognition for the Company does not involve significant judgment, it represents an important accounting policy. We recognize revenue and the related cost of goods sold at the time the products are
received by the customers. For store sales, revenue is recognized when the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register, primarily with either cash or credit card. For sales from our online and catalog business, revenue is
recognized at the time we estimate the customer receives the merchandise. We record an allowance for estimated returns based on the estimated margin using our historical return patterns and various other assumptions that management believes to be
reasonable.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to
calculate our sales return reserve. However, if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly, our operating results could be adversely affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate future
sales returns in the past three fiscal years.

Unredeemed Gift Cards, Gift Certificates, and Credit Vouchers

Upon issuance of a gift card, gift certificate, or credit voucher, a liability is established for its cash value. The liability is relieved and net sales are recorded
upon redemption by the customer. Over time, some portion of these instruments is not redeemed (“breakage”). We determine breakage income for gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers based on historical redemption patterns.
Breakage income is recorded in other income, which is a component of operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, when we can determine the portion of the liability where redemption is remote. Based on our historical information, the
likelihood of gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers remaining unredeemed can be determined three years after issuance. When breakage is recorded, a liability is recognized for any legal obligation to remit the unredeemed portion to
relevant jurisdictions. Our gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers do not have expiration dates.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we
completed an analysis of historical redemption patterns for our gift certificates and credit vouchers. Based on this analysis, additional data led us to conclude that three years after the gift certificate or credit voucher is issued, we can
determine the portion of the liability where redemption is remote. As such, beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we changed our estimate of the elapsed time for recording breakage income associated with unredeemed gift certificates and
credit vouchers to three years from our prior estimate of five years. This change in estimate did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Income for fiscal 2009. For gift cards, we also recognize breakage income after three
years.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to
calculate our breakage income. However, if the actual rate of redemption for gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers increases significantly, our operating results could be adversely affected.

Income Taxes

We record a valuation allowance against
our deferred tax assets arising from certain net operating losses when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such net operating losses will not be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, management is required
to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future income, taxable income, and the mix of income in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may also be materially
impacted by changes in the mix and level of income, changes in the expected outcome of audits, or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance.



At any point in time, many tax years are
subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income
tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Determining the income tax expense for these
potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits.

We believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be
exposed to losses or gains that could be material.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

We operate in foreign countries,
which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our risk management policy is to hedge a significant portion of forecasted merchandise purchases for foreign operations and forecasted royalty payments
using foreign exchange forward contracts. We also use forward contracts to hedge our market risk exposure associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for certain intercompany balances denominated in currencies other than the
functional currency of the entity holding the intercompany balance. These contracts are entered into with large, reputable financial institutions that are monitored for counterparty risk. The principal currencies hedged against changes in the U.S.
dollar during fiscal 2009 were Euro, British pounds, Japanese yen, and Canadian dollars. Our use of derivative financial instruments represents risk management; we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Additional
information is presented in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The derivative financial instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value as
of the balance sheet dates. As of January 30, 2010, we had foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to buy the notional amount of $695 million, 23 million British pounds, and 3 billion Japanese yen.

We may also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the net assets of international subsidiaries to offset the foreign currency translation and economic
exposures related to our investment in the subsidiaries. At January 30, 2010, we had foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to hedge the net assets of our Japanese subsidiary and Canadian subsidiaries in the notional amount of 2 billion
Japanese yen and 81 million Canadian dollars, respectively.

We have performed a sensitivity analysis as of January 30, 2010 based on a model
that measures the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the level of foreign currency exchange rates to U.S. dollars (with all other variables held constant) on our underlying exposure, net of derivative financial instruments. The
foreign currency exchange rates used in the model were based on the spot rates in effect at January 30, 2010. The sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have an
unfavorable impact on the underlying cash flow exposure, net of our foreign exchange derivative financial instruments, of $30 million at January 30, 2010.

We invest in fixed and variable income investments classified as cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are placed primarily in money market funds, domestic
commercial paper, U.S. treasury bills, and bank deposits, and are classified as held-to-maturity based on our positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. These investments are stated at amortized cost, which approximates market
value due to the short maturities of these instruments. An increase in interest rates of 10 percent would not have a material impact on the value of these investments. However, changes in interest rates would impact the interest income
derived from our investments. We earned interest income of $7 million in fiscal 2009.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Gap,
Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Gap, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 30,
2010 and January 31, 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 30, 2010. We also have audited the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal
control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Gap, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 30, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2010, based on the criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

For the Fiscal Years Ended January 30, 2010,
January 31, 2009, and February 2, 2008

Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization

The Gap, Inc., a Delaware
Corporation, is a global specialty retailer offering clothing, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, children, and babies under the Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Piperlime, and Athleta brands. We operate stores in the United
States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, and Japan, and we also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores in Asia, Australia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East under the Gap and Banana
Republic brand names. Our U.S. customers can shop online at gap.com, oldnavy.com, bananarepublic.com, piperlime.com, and athleta.com.

Principles of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of The Gap, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the
“Company,” “we,” and “our”). All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Fiscal Year

Our fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. Fiscal years ended January 30, 2010 (fiscal
2009), January 31, 2009 (fiscal 2008) and February 2, 2008 (fiscal 2007) consisted of 52 weeks.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments, and Restricted Cash

Amounts in-transit from banks for customer credit card and debit card transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash
equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The banks process the majority of these amounts within one to two business days.

All highly liquid
investments with maturities of 91 days or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than 91 days and less than one year from the balance sheet date are classified as
short-term investments. Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are placed primarily in money market funds, domestic commercial paper, U.S. treasury bills, and bank deposits, and are classified as held-to-maturity based on our
positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. These investments are stated at amortized cost, which approximates market value due to their short maturities. Income related to these securities is recorded in interest income in the
Consolidated Statements of Income.

Any cash that is legally restricted from use is recorded in restricted cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
If the purpose of restricted cash relates to acquiring a long-term asset, liquidating a long-term liability or is otherwise unavailable for a period longer than one year from the balance sheet date, the restricted cash is classified as a long-term
asset. Otherwise, restricted cash is classified as a current asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Merchandise Inventory

We value inventory at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using the weighted-average cost method. We record a reserve when future
estimated selling price is less than cost. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes)

and use markdowns to clear merchandise. In addition, we estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivative
financial instruments are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as other current assets, other long-term assets, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, or lease incentives and other long-term liabilities.

For derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative financial
instruments is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and is recognized in income in the period which approximates the time when the underlying transaction occurs. For derivative financial instruments that are
designated and qualify as net investment hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative financial instruments is reported as a component of OCI and reclassified into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged
subsidiary is either sold or liquidated (or substantially liquidated). Gains and losses on the derivative financial instruments representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, if any, are
recognized in current income.

For derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss on the derivative
financial instruments is recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Property and Equipment

Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Estimated useful lives are as follows:

The cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts, with any resulting gain or loss recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Costs of maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.

Lease Rights and Key Money

Lease rights are costs
incurred to acquire the right to lease a specific property. A majority of our lease rights are related to premiums paid to landlords. Key money is the amount of funds paid to a landlord or tenant to acquire the rights of tenancy under a commercial
property lease for a property located in France. These rights can be subsequently sold by us to a new tenant or the amount of key money paid can potentially be recovered from the landlord should the landlord refuse to allow the automatic right of
renewal to be exercised. Lease rights and key money are recorded at cost and are amortized over the corresponding lease term. Lease rights and key money and related amortization are recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

Insurance and Self-Insurance

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risk management activities including workers’ compensation, general liability, and employee related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by our employees.
Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated based primarily on actuarially-determined amounts and accrued in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions.



Asset Retirement Obligations

An asset retirement obligation represents a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that is incurred upon the
acquisition, construction, development, or normal operation of that long-lived asset. The Company’s asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which at the end of a lease we are contractually obligated to
remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. We recognize asset retirement obligations at the inception of a lease with such conditions if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The asset retirement obligation is recorded in lease
incentives and other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is subsequently adjusted for changes in estimated disposal costs. The associated estimated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset and depreciated over its useful life.

Treasury Stock

We account for treasury stock under the cost method, using the first-in, first-out flow assumption, and include treasury stock as a component of stockholders’ equity.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue and the
related cost of goods sold at the time the products are received by the customers. Revenue is recognized for store sales when the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register. For sales from our online and catalog business, we
estimate and defer revenue and the related product costs for shipments that are in-transit to the customer. Revenue is recognized at the time we estimate the customer receives the product, which is typically within a few days of shipment. Deferred
revenue was $5 and $4 million as of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, respectively. Amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to customers are recorded in net sales, and the related costs are recorded in cost of
goods sold and occupancy expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Revenues are presented net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.

Allowances for estimated returns are recorded based on estimated margin using our historical return patterns.

We sell
merchandise to franchisees under multi-year franchise agreements. We recognize revenue from sales to franchisees at the time merchandise ownership is transferred to the franchisee. These sales are recorded in net sales, and the related
cost of goods sold is recorded in cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We also receive royalties from these franchisees based on a percentage of the total merchandise purchased by the franchisee,
net of any refunds or credits due them. Royalty revenue is recognized when merchandise ownership is transferred to the franchisee and is recorded in net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Classification of Expenses

Cost of goods
sold and occupancy expenses include:

•

the cost of merchandise;

•

inventory shortage and valuation adjustments;

•

freight charges;

•

costs associated with our sourcing operations, including payroll and related benefits;

•

production costs;

•

insurance costs related to merchandise; and

•

rent, occupancy, depreciation, and amortization related to our store operations, distribution centers, and certain corporate functions.

Operating expenses include:

•

payroll and related benefits (for our store operations, field management, distribution centers, and corporate functions);

•

marketing;

•

general and administrative expenses;

•

costs to design and develop our products;

•

merchandise handling and receiving in distribution centers and stores;

•

distribution center general and administrative expenses;

•

rent, occupancy, depreciation, and amortization for corporate facilities; and

•

other expense (income).

The classification of
these expenses varies across the apparel retail industry. Accordingly, our cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses and operating expenses may not be comparable to those of other companies.

Rent Expense

Minimum rent expense is recognized over
the term of the lease. We recognize minimum rent starting when possession of the property is taken from the landlord, which normally includes a construction period prior to store opening. When a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the
minimum rent, we recognize the related rent expense on a straight-line basis and record the difference between the recognized rent expense and the amounts payable under the lease as a short-term or long-term deferred rent liability. We also receive
tenant allowances upon entering into certain store leases, which are recorded as a short-term or long-term tenant allowance liability and amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease. A co-tenancy failure by our landlord
during the lease term may result in a reduction of future cash payments and is recorded as a reduction to rent expense. Future payments for common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, and other occupancy costs to which the Company is
obligated are excluded from minimum lease payments.

Certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception. These contingent
rents are primarily based on a percentage of sales that are in excess of a predetermined level and/or rent increase based on a change in the consumer price index or fair market value. These amounts are excluded from minimum rent and are included in
the determination of rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We review the carrying value of long-lived assets, including lease rights, key money, and intangible
assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include the decision to close a store,
corporate facility, or distribution center, or a significant decrease in the operating performance of the long-lived asset. Long-lived assets are considered impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group are
less than the carrying value. For impaired assets, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its estimated fair value. The fair value of the asset group is based on discounted future cash flows of
the asset group using a discount rate commensurate with the risk. The asset group is defined as the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available. Our estimate of future cash flows requires assumptions and judgment, including
forecasting future sales and expenses and estimating useful lives of the assets.



Goodwill and Trade Name

In connection with the acquisition of Athleta in September 2008, we allocated $99 million of the purchase price to goodwill and $54 million to the trade
name. Goodwill and the trade name have indefinite useful lives, and accordingly, are not amortized. Instead, we review the carrying value of goodwill and the trade name for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include significant changes in the business climate, declines in our operating results, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We
assess potential impairment by considering present economic conditions as well as future expectations.

The impairment review of goodwill involves
comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step is required to measure the goodwill impairment loss. The second step includes
hypothetically valuing all the tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Then, the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying
amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying amount. A reporting
unit is an operating segment or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. We have deemed our reporting unit of goodwill acquired through
the acquisition of Athleta to be an operating segment, Direct, which is the level at which segment management regularly reviews operating results and makes resource allocation decisions. The fair value of the reporting unit used to test goodwill for
impairment is estimated using the income approach. This approach requires assumptions and judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses.

Effective February 1, 2009, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. (“SFAS”) 141(R), “Business Combinations” (currently FASB Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805). The adoption of SFAS 141(R) did not have a material impact on our reporting unit determination.

The
trade name is considered impaired if the estimated fair value of the trade name is less than the carrying value. If the trade name is considered impaired, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair
value of the trade name. The fair value of the trade name is determined using the relief from royalty method, which requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and royalty rates.

Goodwill and the trade name are recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Lease Losses

The decision to close a store, corporate facility, or distribution center can result in
accelerated depreciation and amortization over the revised remaining useful lives of the associated long-lived assets. In addition, we record a charge and corresponding lease loss reserve equal to the incremental amount of the present value of the
net future obligation greater than the remaining rent-related deferred balances. The net future obligation is determined as the remaining contractual rent obligations less the amount for which we are able to or expect to be able to sublease the
properties. We estimate the amount for which we expect to be able to sublease the properties based on the status of our efforts to sublease vacant office space and stores, a review of real estate market conditions, our projections for sublease
income, and our assumptions regarding sublease commencement.

Advertising

Costs associated with the production of advertising, such as writing, copy, printing, and other costs, are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with communicating advertising that has been produced, such as
television and magazine costs, are expensed when the advertising event takes place. Advertising expense was $513 million, $435 million, and $476 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, and is recorded in operating expenses in
the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Prepaid catalog expense consists of the
cost to prepare, print, and distribute catalogs. Such costs are amortized over their expected period of future benefit, which is approximately five to seven months.

Share-Based Compensation

Share-based compensation expense for all share-based compensation awards is
determined based on the grant-date fair value. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options which requires the input of subjective assumptions regarding expected term, expected volatility,
dividend yield, and risk-free interest rate. For units granted whereby one share of common stock is issued for each unit as the unit vests (“Stock Units”), the fair value is determined based on the Company’s stock price on the date of
grant less future expected dividends during the vesting period. For stock options and other stock awards, we recognize share-based compensation cost net of estimated forfeitures and revise the estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures
differ from the estimates. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as expected future behavior. The expense is recorded primarily in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the period during
which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for stock options or stock awards. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Unredeemed Gift Cards, Gift Certificates, and Credit Vouchers

Upon issuance of a gift card, gift
certificate, or credit voucher, a liability is established for its cash value. The liability is relieved and net sales are recorded upon redemption by the customer. Over time, some portion of these instruments is not redeemed (“breakage”).
We determine breakage income for gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers based on historical redemption patterns. Breakage income is recorded in other income, which is a component of operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of
Income, when we can determine the portion of the liability where redemption is remote. Based on our historical information, the likelihood of gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers remaining unredeemed can be determined three years after
issuance. When breakage is recorded, a liability is recognized for any legal obligation to remit the unredeemed portion to relevant jurisdictions. Our gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers do not have expiration dates. Beginning in the
third quarter of fiscal 2009, we changed our estimate of the elapsed time for recording breakage income associated with unredeemed gift certificates and credit vouchers to three years from our prior estimate of five years. This change in estimate
did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Income for fiscal 2009.

Credit Cards

We have credit card agreements (the “Agreements”) with third parties to provide our customers with private label credit cards and/or co-branded credit cards
(collectively, the “Credit Cards”). Each private label credit card bears the logo of one of our brands and can be used at any of our U.S. or Canadian store locations and online. The co-branded credit card is a VISA credit card
bearing the logo of one of our brands and can be used everywhere VISA credit cards are accepted. A third-party financing company is the sole owner of the accounts issued under the Credit Card programs, and this third party absorbs the losses
associated with non-payment by the cardholder and a portion of any fraudulent usage of the accounts. We receive cash from the third-party financing company in accordance with the Agreements and based on usage of the Credit Cards. We also
receive cash from Visa U.S.A. Inc. in accordance with the Agreements and based on specified transactional fees. We recognize income for such cash receipts when the amounts are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured,
which is generally the time at which the actual usage of the Credit Cards or specified transaction occurs. The income is recorded in other income, which is a component of operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

The Credit Card programs offer incentives to cardholders in the form of reward certificates upon the cumulative purchase of an established amount. The cost
associated with reward certificates is accrued as the rewards are earned by the cardholder and is recorded in cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.



Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share are computed as net income divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted
earnings per share are computed as net income divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period plus common stock equivalents. Common stock equivalents consist of shares subject to stock options and other stock
awards with exercise prices less than the average market price of common stock for the period, to the extent their inclusion would be dilutive.

Foreign Currency Translation

Our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the functional currency and translate
their assets and liabilities at the current rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses from their operations are translated using the monthly average exchange rates in effect for the period in which the transactions
occur. The resulting gains and losses from translation are recorded in accumulated OCI in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated
in a currency other than the local functional currency are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The amounts of gains and losses included in the Consolidated Statements of Income were a loss of $6 million, a loss of $13 million, and a
gain of $4 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, and included a loss of $4 million, a gain of $51 million, and a gain of $25 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, for changes in the fair value and the settlements of
certain derivative financial instruments.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income is comprised of net income and other gains and losses affecting equity that are excluded from net income. The components of OCI consist of foreign currency translation gains and losses and
changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments, net of tax.

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial
Statements. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being
audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which
such determinations are made.

On February 4, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 48,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (currently FASB ASC 740). The cumulative effects of the adoption of FIN 48 have been recorded as a decrease of $4 million to opening
retained earnings, an increase of $85 million to short-term and long-term income tax assets, and an increase of $89 million to short-term and long-term income tax liabilities as of February 4, 2007. The Company recognizes interest related
to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2010,
the FASB issued an accounting standards update to amend and clarify existing guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures. This guidance adds new requirements for disclosures related to transfers into and out of level 1 and level
2 and requires separate disclosure of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements related to level 3 measurements. It also clarifies guidance around disaggregation and disclosures of inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The
update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the requirement to disclose purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements related to level 3 measurements, which will be effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010. We will adopt the disclosure requirements in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.

Note 2. Additional Financial
Statement Information

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments consist of the following:

We did not record any impairment charges on our cash equivalents and short-term
investments in fiscal 2009, 2008, or 2007.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists primarily of cash that serves as collateral for our insurance obligations. Restricted cash of $41 million as of January 31, 2009 also included collateral from our cross-currency
interest rate swap, which was reclassified to cash and cash equivalents in connection with the settlement in fiscal 2009.

Other Current
Assets

Other current assets consist of the following:

No other individual items accounted for greater than five percent of total
current assets as of January 30, 2010 or January 31, 2009.



Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and consist of the following:

Depreciation expense for property and equipment was $643 million, $643 million, and $625 million for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007,
respectively.

No interest related to assets under construction was capitalized in fiscal 2009. Interest of $8 million and $10 million related to assets
under construction was capitalized in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively.

We recorded a charge for the impairment of long-lived assets, primarily
related to our Stores reportable segment, of $14 million, $5 million, and $13 million for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, which is recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 3 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for the impairment charge related to the closure of Forth & Towne.

The balance of leasehold improvements as
of January 31, 2009 has been corrected to exclude $77 million that is now classified as land, buildings, and building improvements to appropriately reflect the cost of improvements made to our owned buildings. This reclassification did not
have any impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal 2008 and 2007.

Other Long-Term Assets

Other long-term assets consist of the following:

See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for goodwill, the trade
name, and intangible assets subject to amortization.

Both the cost and accumulated amortization of lease rights and key money are impacted by
fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Amortization expense associated with lease rights and key money was $6 million, $8 million, and $10 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Sales Return Allowance

A summary of activity in the sales return allowance account is as follows:

Note 3. Discontinued Operation of Forth & Towne

In February 2007, we announced our decision to close our Forth & Towne store locations. The decision resulted from a thorough analysis of the concept, which
revealed it was not demonstrating enough potential to deliver an acceptable long-term return on investment. All of the 19 Forth & Towne stores were closed by the end of June 2007, and we reduced our workforce by approximately 550
employees in fiscal 2007. The results of Forth & Towne, net of income tax benefit, are presented as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented and are as follows:

For fiscal 2007, the loss from the discontinued operation of Forth & Towne included the following charges on a pre-tax basis:
$29 million related to the impairment of long-lived assets, $6 million of lease settlement charges, $5 million of employee severance, $4 million of administrative and other costs, and $2 million of net lease losses.

Future cash payments for Forth & Towne primarily relate to obligations associated with certain leases, and these payments will be made over the various
remaining lease terms through 2017. Based on our current assumptions as of January 30, 2010, we expect our lease payments, net of sublease income, to be immaterial.

Note 4. Acquisition, Goodwill, and Intangible Assets

On September 28, 2008, we acquired all of
the outstanding capital stock of Athleta Inc., a women’s sports and active apparel company based in Petaluma, California, for an aggregate purchase price of $148 million in cash, including transaction costs. The acquisition allows us to enhance
our presence in the growing women’s active apparel sector in the United States. The results of operations for Athleta are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income beginning September 29, 2008. The impact of the acquisition on
the Company’s results of operations, as if the acquisition had been completed as of the beginning of the periods presented, is not significant.

The
purchase price was allocated as follows as of September 28, 2008:

All of the assets above have been allocated to the Direct reportable segment. None of the goodwill acquired is deductible for tax
purposes.

Amortization expense for intangible assets subject to amortization for fiscal 2009 and 2008 was $6 million and $2 million,
respectively, and is recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

As of January 30, 2010, future amortization expense
associated with intangible assets subject to amortization for each of the five succeeding fiscal years is as follows:

During the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2009, we completed our annual impairment testing of our goodwill and the trade name and did not recognize any impairment charges.

Note 5. Debt

In September 2007, we paid $326 million related to the maturity of our 6.90 percent notes payable. In December 2008, we
paid $138 million related to the maturity of our 8.80 percent notes payable. The remaining $50 million notes payable of our Japanese subsidiary, Gap (Japan) KK, with a fixed interest rate of 6.25 percent per annum, was repaid in March 2009. As of
January 30, 2010, the Company had no debt outstanding.

Note 6. Credit Facilities

Trade letters of credit represent a payment undertaking guaranteed by a bank on our behalf to pay a vendor a given amount of money upon presentation of specific
documents demonstrating that merchandise has shipped. Vendor payables are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the time of merchandise title transfer, although the letters of credit are generally issued prior to this. Most of our
merchandise vendors are now on open account payment terms. As of January 30, 2010, our letter of credit agreements consist of two separate $100 million, three-year, unsecured committed letter of credit agreements with two separate banks,
for a total aggregate availability of $200 million with an expiration date of May 2011. As of January 30, 2010, we had $24 million in trade letters of credit issued under these letter of credit agreements.

As of January 30, 2010, our credit facility consisted of a $500 million, five-year, unsecured revolving credit facility with an expiration date of August 2012
(the “Facility”). The Facility is available for general corporate purposes, including working capital, trade letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. The facility usage fees and fees related to the Facility fluctuate based on our
long-term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio. If we were to draw on the Facility, interest would be a base rate (typically the London Interbank Offered Rate) plus a margin based on our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings
and our leverage ratio on the unpaid principal amount. To maintain availability of funds under the Facility, we pay a facility fee on the full facility amount, regardless of usage. As of January 30, 2010, there were no borrowings under the
Facility. The net availability of the Facility, reflecting $56 million of outstanding standby letters of credit, was $444 million as of January 30, 2010.



The Facility and letter of credit
agreements contain financial and other covenants, including but not limited to limitations on liens and subsidiary debt as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios—a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio. Violation of these
covenants could result in a default under the Facility and letter of credit agreements, which would permit the participating banks to terminate our ability to access the Facility for letters of credit and advances, terminate our ability to request
letters of credit under the letter of credit agreements, require the immediate repayment of any outstanding advances under the Facility, and require the immediate posting of cash collateral in support of any outstanding letters of credit under the

Note 7. Fair Value Measurements

Financial Assets and Liabilities

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis are as follows:

Derivative financial instruments primarily include foreign exchange forward
contracts. The principal currencies hedged against changes in the U.S. Dollar are Euro, British pounds, Japanese yen, and Canadian dollars. The fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments is determined using pricing models
based on current market rates. Derivative financial instruments in an asset position are recorded in other current assets or other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivative financial instruments in a liability position are
recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or lease incentives and other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We
maintain deferred compensation plans which allow eligible employees and non-employee members of the Board of Directors to defer compensation up to a maximum amount. Plan investments are recorded at market value and are designated for the deferred
compensation plans. The fair value of the Company’s deferred compensation plan assets is determined based on quoted market prices, and the assets are recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In addition, as of January 30, 2010
and January 31, 2009, we had highly liquid investments classified as cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments measured using level 1 inputs. These investments are placed primarily in money market funds, domestic commercial paper,
U.S. treasury bills, and bank deposits, and are classified as held-to-maturity based on our positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. These investments are stated at amortized cost, which approximates market value due to their
short maturities.

Nonfinancial Assets

Effective February 1, 2009, we adopted enhanced disclosure requirements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.

As discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we recorded a charge for the impairment of long-lived assets of $14 million for fiscal 2009, which was recorded in operating expenses in the
Consolidated Statement of Income. The impairment charge reduced the carrying amount of the applicable long-lived assets of $16 million to their fair value of $2 million as of January 30, 2010. The fair value of the long-lived assets was
determined using level 3 inputs and the valuation techniques discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Note 8.
Derivative Financial Instruments

Effective February 1, 2009, we adopted enhanced disclosure requirements for derivative financial instruments
and hedging activities.

We operate in foreign countries, which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
Our risk management policy is to hedge a significant portion of forecasted merchandise purchases for foreign operations, forecasted intercompany royalty payments, and intercompany obligations that bear foreign exchange risk using foreign exchange
forward contracts. The principal currencies hedged against changes in the U.S. dollar are Euro, British pounds, Japanese yen, and Canadian dollars. Until March 2009, we also used a cross-currency interest rate swap to swap the interest and principal
payable of the $50 million debt of our Japanese subsidiary, Gap (Japan) KK. In connection with the maturity of the debt, the swap was settled in March 2009. We do not enter into derivative financial contracts for trading purposes. Our
derivative financial instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value determined using pricing models based on current market rates. Cash flows from derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flows from
operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Cash Flow Hedges

We designate the following foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedges: forward contracts used to hedge forecasted merchandise purchases denominated
primarily in U.S. dollars made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currencies are their local currencies and forward contracts used to hedge forecasted intercompany royalty payments denominated in Japanese yen and Canadian dollars
received by entities whose functional currencies are U.S. dollars.

There were no material amounts recorded in income for fiscal 2009, 2008, or 2007 as a
result of hedge ineffectiveness, hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, or the discontinuance of cash flow hedges because the forecasted transactions were no longer probable.

We make merchandise purchases on a monthly basis, and we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge forecasted merchandise purchases generally occurring in
12 to 18 months. We make intercompany royalty payments on a quarterly basis, and we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge intercompany royalty payments generally occurring in 12 to 15 months.

At January 30, 2010, we had foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to buy the notional amount of $671 million and 21 million British pounds and
to sell various currencies related to our forecasted merchandise purchases and forecasted intercompany royalty payments.



Net Investment Hedges

We also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the net assets of international subsidiaries to offset the foreign currency translation and
economic exposures related to our investment in the subsidiaries.

There were no amounts recorded in income for fiscal 2009, 2008, or 2007 as a result of
hedge ineffectiveness, hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, or the discontinuance of net investment hedges.

At
January 30, 2010, we had foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to hedge the net assets of our Japanese subsidiary and Canadian subsidiaries in the notional amount of 2 billion Japanese yen and 81 million Canadian dollars,
respectively.

Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

In addition, we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our market risk exposure associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for certain intercompany balances denominated in currencies other
than the functional currency of the entity with the intercompany balance. The gain or loss on the derivative financial instruments, as well as the remeasurement of the underlying intercompany balances, is recorded in operating expenses in the
Consolidated Statements of Income in the same period and generally offset.

We generate intercompany activity each month, and as such, we generally enter
into foreign exchange forward contracts on a monthly basis to hedge intercompany balances that bear foreign exchange risk. These foreign exchange forward contracts generally settle in less than 12 months. At January 30, 2010, we had foreign
exchange forward contracts outstanding to buy $24 million, 2 million British pounds, and 3 billion Japanese yen related to our intercompany balances that bear foreign exchange risk.

Contingent Features

We had no derivative financial instruments with credit-risk-related contingent
features underlying the agreements as of January 30, 2010.

Quantitative Disclosures
about Derivative Financial Instruments

The fair values of asset and liability derivative financial instruments are as follows:

Substantially all of the unrealized gains and losses from designated cash flow hedges as of January 30, 2010 will be recognized in
income within the next 12 months at the then current values, which may differ from the fair values as of January 30, 2010 shown above.

See Note 7
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures on the fair value measurements of our derivative financial instruments.



The effects of derivative financial
instruments on OCI and the Consolidated Statements of Income, on a pre-tax basis for fiscal 2009, are as follows:

(1)

Includes gain of $17 million recorded in cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses related to foreign exchange forward contracts used to hedge forecasted merchandise purchases
and loss of $3 million recorded in operating expenses related to foreign exchange forward contracts used to hedge forecasted intercompany royalty payments. The gain of $1 million related to the cross-currency interest rate swap was recorded in
operating expenses.

(2)

Recorded in operating expenses.

Note 9. Common Stock

Common and Preferred Stock

The
Board of Directors is authorized to issue 60 million shares of Class B common stock, which is convertible into shares of common stock on a share-for-share basis. Transfer of the shares is restricted. In addition, the holders of the Class B
common stock have six votes per share on most matters and are entitled to a lower cash dividend. No Class B shares have been issued as of January 30, 2010.

The Board of Directors is authorized to issue 30 million shares of one or more series of preferred stock, which has a par value of $0.05 per share, and to establish at the time of issuance the issue price,
dividend rate, redemption price, liquidation value, conversion features, and such other terms and conditions of each series (including voting rights) as the Board of Directors deems appropriate, without further action on the part of the
stockholders. No preferred shares have been issued as of January 30, 2010.

Share Repurchases

Share repurchases are as follows:

In fiscal 2006 and 2007, the Board of Directors authorized
share repurchases of $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, which were both fully utilized by the end of fiscal 2007. In February 2008, the Board of Directors

authorized $1 billion for additional share repurchases, which was fully utilized by the end of fiscal 2009. In November 2009, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $500 million share
repurchase program, of which $255 million was utilized through January 30, 2010. This authorization was fully utilized in March 2010. In connection with the fiscal 2007, 2008, and 2009 authorizations, we entered into purchase agreements with
individual members of the Fisher family (related party transactions). The Fisher family shares were purchased at the same weighted-average market price that we paid for share repurchases in the open market. The purchase agreements were terminable
upon 15 business days notice by the Company or individual Fisher family members. During fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, approximately 2 million, 7 million, and 13 million shares, respectively, were repurchased for $40 million, $117
million, and $249 million, respectively, from the Fisher family subject to these agreements.

All of the share repurchases were paid for as of
January 30, 2010 except $3 million that was payable to Fisher family members. As of January 31, 2009, all except $40 million of total share repurchases were paid for, of which $21 million was payable to Fisher family members.

In February 2010, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized $1 billion for additional share repurchases. We have not entered into purchase
agreements with members of the Fisher family in connection with this authorization.

Note 10. Share-Based Compensation

Total share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income, primarily in operating expenses, is as follows:

No material share-based compensation expense was capitalized in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007.

Other than the stock option modification noted below, there were no other material modifications made to our outstanding stock options and other stock awards in fiscal
2009, 2008, and 2007.

General Description of Stock Option and Other Stock Award Plans

The 1996 Stock Option and Award Plan (the “1996 Plan”) was established on March 26, 1996 and amended and restated on January 28, 2003. The 1996
Plan was further amended and restated on January 24, 2006 and renamed the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”). The 2006 Plan was further amended and restated on August 20, 2008. Under the 2006 Plan, nonqualified stock
options and other stock awards are granted to officers, directors, eligible employees, and consultants at exercise prices or with initial values equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant or as determined
by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”).

The 2002 Stock Option Plan (the
“2002 Plan”) was established on January 1, 1999. On May 9, 2006, the 2002 Plan was discontinued, and only those awards then outstanding continue to be subject to the terms of the 2002 Plan under which they were granted. The 2002
Plan empowered the Committee to award nonqualified stock options to non-officer employees.

As of January 30, 2010, we had 115,567,431 shares
of our common stock available for future issuance for our stock option and other stock award plans. Stock options generally expire 10 years from the grant date, three months



after employee termination, or one year after the date of an employee’s retirement or death, if earlier. In addition, stock options generally vest over a four year period, with shares
becoming exercisable in equal annual installments of 25 percent. Other stock awards generally vest over a four year period in equal annual installments of 25 percent.

Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, all shares related to stock options and other stock awards are issued from treasury stock.

Stock Option and Other Stock Award Modification

In February 2007, the Committee approved the
modification of certain stock options and other stock awards held by designated employees such that at the time of an involuntary termination without cause, any outstanding, unvested time-based options or other stock awards scheduled to vest within
a defined time frame would be accelerated. No material amounts were recognized in fiscal 2009, 2008, or 2007 as a result of the modification. The modification clause expired in February 2009.

Stock Units

Under the 2006 Plan, Stock Units are
granted to employees and members of the Board of Directors. Vesting is based on continued service by the employee and is immediate in the case of members of the Board of Directors. In some cases, vesting is subject to the attainment of a
pre-determined financial target (“Performance Shares”).

At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the probability that the Performance
Shares will vest. We record share-based compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value and the probability that the pre-determined financial target will be achieved.

A summary of Stock Unit activity under the 2006 Plan for fiscal 2009 is as follows:

A summary of additional information about Stock Units is as follows:

The aggregate intrinsic value of unvested Stock Units at
January 30, 2010 was $218 million, with a weighted-average remaining contractual term of 1.60 years.

At January 30, 2010, there was $57
million (before any related tax benefit) of unrecognized share-based compensation, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, related to unvested Stock Units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.43 years. Total
unrecognized share-based compensation may be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures.

Stock Units Based on Performance
Metrics

Under the 2006 Plan, some Stock Units are granted to certain employees only after the achievement of pre-determined performance metrics.
Once the Stock Unit is granted, vesting is then subject to continued service by the employee, and expense is recognized on an accelerated basis.

At the end of each reporting period, we
evaluate the probability that Stock Units will be granted. We record share-based compensation expense based on the probability that the performance metrics will be achieved, with an offsetting increase to current liabilities. We revalue the
liability at the end of each reporting period and record an adjustment to share-based compensation expense as required, based on the probability that the performance metrics will be achieved. Upon achievement of the performance metrics, a Stock Unit
is granted. At that time, the associated liability is reclassified to stockholders’ equity.

Out of 4,992,213, 4,048,873, and 6,048,873 Stock Units
granted in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, 703,146, 600,544, and 119,102 Stock Units, respectively, were granted based on satisfaction of performance metrics.

At January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, the liability related to potential Stock Units based on performance metrics was $6 million and $2 million, respectively, which is recorded in accrued expenses and
other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Stock Options

The fair value of options issued during fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007 was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:

A summary of stock option activity under the 2006
Plan and 2002 Plan for fiscal 2009 is as follows:

A summary of additional information about stock options is as follows:



Information about stock options
outstanding, vested or expected to vest, and exercisable at January 30, 2010, is as follows:

The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding, options vested or expected to vest, and options exercisable at
January 30, 2010 was $52 million, $39 million, and $25 million, respectively. Options exercisable at January 30, 2010 had a weighted-average remaining contractual life of 3.74 years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Under our Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), eligible U.S. employees are able to purchase our common stock at 85 percent of the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on the last day of the three-month purchase period. Accordingly, compensation
expense is recognized for an amount equal to the 15 percent discount. Employees pay for their stock purchases through payroll deductions at a rate equal to any whole percentage from 1 percent to 15 percent. There were 1,574,464, 1,543,827, and
1,485,699 shares issued under the ESPP during fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. At January 30, 2010, there were 8,684,826 shares reserved for future issuances.

Note 11. Leases

We lease most of our store premises and some of our corporate facilities and
distribution centers. These operating leases expire at various dates through 2033. Most store leases are for a five year base period and include options that allow us to extend the lease term beyond the initial base period, subject to terms agreed
upon at lease inception. Some leases also include early termination options, which can be exercised under specific conditions.

We also lease certain
equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2012.

The aggregate minimum non-cancelable annual lease payments under leases in
effect on January 30, 2010, are as follows:

The total minimum lease commitment amount above does not include minimum sublease
rent income of $17 million receivable in the future under non-cancelable sublease agreements.

Rent expense related to our store
premises, corporate facilities, and distribution centers under operating leases is as follows:

In addition to the amounts disclosed in the rent expense table above, we had rent expense related to equipment under operating leases
of $4 million, $5 million, and $6 million for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

We had lease loss reserves of $13 million and $10 million as of
January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, respectively. Lease losses are recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income and were $6 million, $8 million, and $5 million for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007,
respectively. Remaining cash expenditures associated with our lease loss reserve are expected to be paid over the various remaining lease terms through 2017. Based on our current assumptions as of January 30, 2010, we expect a total net cash
outlay of approximately $18 million for future rent.

Note 12. Income Taxes

For financial reporting purposes, components of income from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows:

The provision for income taxes consists of the following:

During fiscal 2009, we assessed the anticipated cash needs and overall financial position of our Canadian and Japanese subsidiaries. As
a result, we determined that we no longer intend to utilize approximately $117 million and $83 million of the undistributed earnings of our Canadian and Japanese subsidiaries, respectively, in foreign operations indefinitely. Accordingly, we have
established a deferred tax liability for U.S. income taxes with respect to such earnings as of January 30, 2010 and have recorded related tax expense of $9 million.



The foreign component of pre-tax income
before elimination of intercompany transactions in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $305 million, $375 million, and $333 million, respectively. Except as noted above and where required by U.S. tax law, no provision was made for U.S. income taxes on
the undistributed earnings of the foreign subsidiaries, as we intend to utilize those earnings in the foreign operations for an indefinite period of time or repatriate such earnings only when tax-effective to do so. That portion of accumulated
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009 was approximately $1.1 billion for both years. If the undistributed earnings were repatriated, the unrecorded deferred tax liability as of
January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009 would have been approximately $148 million and $147 million, respectively.

The difference between
the effective income tax rate and the U.S. federal income tax rate is as follows:

Deferred tax assets (liabilities) consist of the following:

At January 30, 2010 we had approximately $65 million state and $103 million foreign gross net operating loss (“NOL”)
carryovers in multiple taxing jurisdictions that could be utilized to reduce the tax liabilities of future years. The tax effected NOL was approximately $4 million for state and $27 million for foreign as of January 30, 2010. We provided a
valuation allowance of approximately $1 million and $22 million against the deferred tax asset related to the state and foreign NOLs, respectively. The state losses expire between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, approximately $74 million of the
foreign losses expire between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2018, and $29 million of the foreign losses do not expire.

The activity related to our unrecognized
tax benefits is as follows:

Of the $132 million, $131 million, and $123 million of total unrecognized tax benefits at January 30, 2010,
January 31, 2009, and February 2, 2008, respectively, approximately $15 million, $33 million, and $51 million (net of the federal benefit on state issues), respectively, represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if
recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods. During each of fiscal 2009 and 2007, interest expense of $2 million was recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. During fiscal 2008, an interest expense
reversal of $9 million was recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. As of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, the Company had total accrued interest related to the unrecognized tax benefits of $20 million and $18 million,
respectively. There were no accrued penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits as of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009.

The
Company conducts business globally, and as a result, files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities
throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as the United States, Canada, France, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United Kingdom. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations
for fiscal years before 1999.

The Company engages in continual discussions with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in the various U.S. and foreign
jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that we will recognize a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months of up to $50 million, primarily due to the filing of a U.S. federal income tax accounting method change application and
the resolution of the Internal Revenue Service’s (“IRS”) review of the Company’s federal income tax returns and refund claims for fiscal 2001 through 2004. In late fiscal 2008, the IRS commenced an audit of the Company’s
federal income tax returns and refund claims for fiscal 2001 through 2004. In February 2010, the Company received notification that the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation had completed its consideration of the IRS’ report pertaining to
those income tax returns and refund requests and had taken no exception to the conclusions reached by the IRS. In March 2010, we received refund payments, including interest, from the IRS in the amount of approximately $71 million. We do not expect
these matters to have a material impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

As of January 31, 2009, the Company did not anticipate recording
any significant increases or decreases in total gross unrecognized tax benefits within the subsequent 12 months. During fiscal 2009, total gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $1 million.

Note 13. Employee Benefit Plans

We have a qualified
defined contribution retirement plan called GapShare, which is available to employees who meet certain age and service requirements. This plan permits employees to make contributions up to the maximum limits allowable under the Internal Revenue
Code. Under the plan, we match, in cash, all or a portion of employees’ contributions under a predetermined formula. Our contributions vest immediately. Our contributions to GapShare were $35 million, $34 million, and $36 million in fiscal
2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.



We also have a deferred compensation plan
that allows eligible employees and non-employee members of the Board of Directors to defer compensation up to a maximum amount. Plan investments are recorded at fair market value and are designated for the deferred compensation plan. The
Company’s deferred compensation plan assets are determined based on quoted market prices. As of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, the assets related to the deferred compensation plan were $21 million and $18 million,
respectively, and were recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, the corresponding liabilities relating to the deferred compensation plan were $22 million and $18
million, respectively, and were recorded in lease incentives and other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We match all or a portion of employees’ contributions under a predetermined formula. Plan investments are
elected by the participants, and investment returns are not guaranteed by the Company. Our contributions to the deferred compensation plan in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007 were not material. We do not match non-employee members of the Board of
Directors contributions under the deferred compensation plan.

Note 14. Earnings per Share

Weighted-average number of shares used for earnings per share is as follows:

The above computations of weighted-average number of shares—diluted exclude
25 million, 31 million, and 33 million shares related to stock options and other stock awards for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect on earnings per share.

Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies

In January
2006, we entered into a non-exclusive services agreement with IBM to operate certain aspects of our information technology infrastructure. The agreement was amended effective March 2, 2009. The services agreement expires in March 2016, and we
have the right to renew it for up to three additional years. We have various options to terminate the agreement, and we pay IBM under a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on our actual consumption
of services. IBM also has certain termination rights in the event of our material breach of the agreement and failure to cure. We paid $120 million, $134 million, and $146 million to IBM for fixed charges during fiscal 2009, 2008, and
2007, respectively. Based on the current projection of service needs, we expect to pay approximately $623 million to IBM over the remaining term of the contract.

We have assigned certain store and corporate facility leases to third parties as of January 30, 2010. Under these arrangements, we are secondarily liable and have guaranteed the lease payments of the new lessees for the remaining
portion of our original lease obligations through 2019. The maximum potential amount of future lease payments we could be required to make is approximately $31 million as of January 30, 2010. We recognize a liability for such
guarantees when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the loss is probable and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. The carrying amount of the liability related to the guarantees was $2 million as of January 30, 2010
and January 31, 2009.

We are a party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for
certain matters. These contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts, operating leases, trademarks, intellectual property, financial agreements, and various other agreements. Under these contracts, we may provide certain routine
indemnifications relating to representations and warranties (e.g., ownership of assets, environmental or tax indemnifications) or personal injury matters. The terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined.
Generally, the maximum obligation under such indemnifications is not explicitly stated, and as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated.

Historically, we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on
our financial condition or results of operations.

As party to a reinsurance pool for workers’ compensation, general liability, and automobile
liability, we have guarantees with a maximum exposure of $14 million as of January 30, 2010, of which $0.2 million has been cash collateralized. We are currently in the process of winding down our participation in the reinsurance pool. Our
maximum exposure and cash collateralized balance are expected to decrease in the future as our participation in the reinsurance pool diminishes.

As a
multinational company, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims (“Actions”) arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to
uncertainties. Actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, intellectual property, customer, employment, data privacy, and securities related claims, including class action lawsuits in which plaintiffs allege that we violated
federal and state wage and hour and other laws. The plaintiffs in some Actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages, and some are covered in part by insurance. If the outcome of an action
is expected to result in a loss that is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we will record a liability for the estimated loss.

We cannot
predict with assurance the outcome of Actions brought against us. Accordingly, adverse developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and negatively impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement, or resolution. However, we do not
believe that the outcome of any current Action would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position taken as a whole.

Note 16. Segment Information

We identify our operating segments according to how our business
activities are managed and evaluated. All of our operating segments sell a group of similar products – clothing, accessories, and personal care products. We have two reportable segments:

•

Stores – The Stores reportable segment includes the results of the retail stores for each of our brands: Gap, Old Navy, and Banana Republic. We have
aggregated the results of all Stores operating segments into one reportable segment because we believe the operating segments have similar economic characteristics.

•

Direct – The Direct operating segment includes the results of the online business for each of our web-based brands: gap.com, oldnavy.com,
bananarepublic.com, piperlime.com, and beginning in September 2008, athleta.com. The Direct operating segment also includes Athleta’s catalog business. Based on the different distribution method associated with the Direct operating segment,
Direct is considered a reportable segment.

The accounting policies for each of our operating segments are the same as those described
in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net sales by brand, region, and reportable segment are as follows:



(1)

U.S. includes the United States and Puerto Rico.

(2)

U.S. only. Direct includes Athleta beginning September 2008.

(3)

Other includes our wholesale business, franchise business, Piperlime, and beginning September 2008, Athleta.

Financial Information for Reportable Segments

Operating income is the measure of profit we use to make decisions on allocating resources to our operating segments and to assess the operating performance of each operating segment. It is defined as income before interest expense,
interest income, and income taxes. Corporate expenses are allocated to each operating segment and recorded in operating income on a rational and systematic basis.

Reportable segment assets presented below include those assets that are directly used in, or allocable to, that segment’s operations. Total assets for the Stores reportable segment primarily consist of
merchandise inventory, the net book value of store assets, and prepaid expenses and receivables related to store operations. Total assets for the Direct reportable segment primarily consist of merchandise inventory, the net book value of information
technology and distribution center assets, and the net book value of goodwill and intangible assets as a result of the acquisition of Athleta. We do not allocate corporate assets to our operating segments. Unallocated corporate assets primarily
include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash, the net book value of corporate property and equipment, and tax-related assets. Reportable segment capital expenditures are direct purchases of property and equipment by
that segment. Unallocated capital expenditures primarily consist of corporate purchases of property and equipment.
