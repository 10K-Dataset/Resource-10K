Certain financial information about international operations is set forth under the heading "Segment Information" in

Note 17

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in

Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

, of this Form 10-K.


Product Development

We design, develop, market, and sell a wide range of apparel, footwear and accessories products reflecting a mix of basics and fashion items based on widely accepted fashion trends, striving to bring product to market quickly and provide unrivaled value to customers. Our product teams research, test and iterate each season to deliver the latest styles in fabrics and silhouettes that are made to last. We leverage feedback and purchasing data from our customer database, along with market trend insight, to guide our product and merchandising decision-making.

Marketing and Advertising

We use a variety of marketing and advertising mediums to drive brand health, customer acquisition, and engagement. We leverage our growing customer database and respond to shopping behaviors and needs with personalized content across email, site, and digital media to drive relevance and urgency. Our diversified media mix spans traditional to digital to social media. We focus on productivity of marketing investment to drive increased effectiveness.

Merchandise Vendors

We purchase private label and non-private label merchandise from about 800 vendors. Our vendors have factories in about 30 countries. Our two largest vendors accounted for about 7 and 6 percent of the dollar amount of our total

fiscal 2019

purchases. Of our merchandise purchased during

fiscal 2019

, substantially all purchases, by dollar value, were from factories outside the United States. Approximately 32 percent of our

fiscal 2019

purchases, by dollar value, were from factories in Vietnam. Approximately 16 percent of our

fiscal 2019

purchases, by dollar value, were from factories in China. Product cost increases or events causing disruption of imports from Vietnam, China, or other foreign countries, including the imposition of additional import restrictions or taxes, or vendors potentially failing due to political, financial, public health crises or regulatory issues, could have an adverse effect on our operations. Substantially all of our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars. Also see the sections entitled “Risk Factors—Our business is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing," "Risk Factors—Risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries, including failure of our vendors to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct, could harm our business,” “Risk Factors—Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain” and "Risk Factors—Our results could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, negative global climate patterns, or other catastrophic events" in

Item 1A, Risk Factors

, of this Form 10-K.

Seasonal Business

Our business follows a seasonal pattern, with sales peaking during the end-of-year holiday period.

Brand Building

Our ability to develop and evolve our existing brands is a key to our success. We believe our distinct brands are among our most important assets. With the exception of Intermix, virtually all aspects of brand development, from product design and distribution to marketing, merchandising and shopping environments, are controlled by Gap Inc. employees. With respect to Intermix, we control all aspects of brand development except for product design related to third-party products. We continue to invest in our business and enhance the customer experience through significant investments in our supply chain and digital capabilities, investments in marketing, enhancement of our omni-channel shopping experience, remodeling of existing stores, and international expansion.

Trademarks and Service Marks

Old Navy, Gap, GapKids, babyGap, GapMaternity, GapBody, GapFit, Banana Republic, Athleta, Intermix, Janie and Jack, and Hill City trademarks and service marks, and certain other trademarks and service marks, have been registered, or are the subject of pending trademark applications, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with the registries of many foreign countries and/or are protected by common law.


Franchising

We have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Old Navy, Gap, and Banana Republic stores in a number of countries throughout Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. For additional information on risks related to our franchise business, see the sections entitled “Risk Factors—Our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful” and “Risk Factors—Our franchise business is subject to certain risks not directly within our control that could impair the value of our brands” in

Item 1A, Risk Factors

, of this Form 10-K.

Inventory

The nature of the retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we, along with other retailers, generally build up inventory levels. We maintain a large part of our inventory in distribution centers. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes or colors) and we primarily use promotions and markdowns to clear merchandise. Also see the sections entitled “Risk Factors—We must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed,” "Risk Factors—If we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our gross margins could be adversely affected," and "Risk Factors—Our results could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, negative global climate patterns, or other catastrophic events" in

Item 1A, Risk Factors

, of this Form 10-K.

Competitors

The global apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We compete with local, national, and global apparel retailers. Also see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Our business is highly competitive” in

Item 1A, Risk Factors

, of this Form 10-K.

Employees

As of

February 1, 2020

, we had a workforce of approximately 129,000 employees, which includes a combination of part-time and full-time employees. We also hire seasonal employees, primarily during the peak holiday selling season.

To remain competitive in the retail apparel industry, we must attract, develop, and retain skilled employees in our design, merchandising, supply chain, marketing, information technology, and other functions, as well as in our stores and distribution centers. Competition for such personnel is intense. Our success is dependent to a significant degree on the continued contributions of key employees. Also see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Our failure to manage key executive succession and retention and to continue to attract qualified personnel could have an adverse impact on our results of operations” in

Item 1A, Risk Factors

, of this Form 10-K.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Our past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance because actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties discussed below. In addition, historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.

We must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed.

Our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our design and purchasing decisions may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing apparel trends or consumer acceptance of our products. The global apparel retail business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences, dictated in part by apparel trends and season. To the extent we misjudge the market for our merchandise or the products suitable for local markets, or fail to execute trends and deliver products to the market as timely as our competitors, our sales will be adversely affected, and the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely affect our operating results.

Our business is highly competitive.

The global apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We and our franchisees compete with local, national, and global department stores, specialty and discount store chains, independent retail stores, and online businesses that market similar lines of merchandise. We face a variety of competitive challenges in an increasingly complex and fast-paced environment, including:

•

anticipating and quickly responding to changing apparel trends and customer demands;

•

attracting customer traffic both in stores and online;

•

competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value;

•

maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to customers in several diverse market segments and geographic locations;

•

anticipating and responding to changing customer shopping preferences and practices, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement, social media communication, and online shopping;

•

developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to customers of varying age groups and tastes;

•

purchasing and stocking merchandise to match seasonal weather patterns, and our ability to react to shifts in weather that impact consumer demand;

•

sourcing and allocating merchandise efficiently; and

•

improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our processes in order to deliver cost savings to fund growth.

If we or our franchisees are not able to compete successfully in the United States or internationally, our results of operations would be adversely affected.

Global economic conditions and any related impact on consumer spending patterns could adversely impact our results of operations.

Our performance is subject to global economic conditions, as well as their impact on levels of consumer spending worldwide. Some of the factors that may influence consumer spending include high levels of unemployment, pandemics (such as the impact of the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, including reduced store traffic and widespread temporary store closures), higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, fluctuating interest and foreign currency rates and credit availability, government austerity measures, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty.


Adverse economic changes in any of the regions in which we and our franchisees sell our products could reduce consumer confidence, and thereby could negatively affect earnings and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In challenging and uncertain economic environments, we cannot predict whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen, or what impact, if any, such circumstances could have on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.

We may engage in or seek to engage in strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and dispositions, that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which could disrupt or adversely affect our businesses.

We may engage in or seek to engage in strategic transactions, such as acquisitions or dispositions, which we may not be able to complete on anticipated terms or time frames, or at all, or which may not generate some or all of the strategic, financial, operational or other benefits we expect to realize from such transactions on such anticipated time frames or at all.  In addition, these transactions may be complex in nature, and unanticipated developments or changes, including changes in law, the macroeconomic environment, market conditions, the retail industry or political conditions may affect our ability to complete such transactions.  In addition, the process of completing these transactions may be time-consuming and involve significant costs and expenses, which may be significantly higher than what we anticipate and may not yield a benefit if the transactions are not completed successfully, and executing these transactions may require significant time and attention from our senior management and employees, which could disrupt our ongoing business and adversely affect the financial results and results of operations.  We may also experience increased difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating employees and/or attracting and retaining customers during the pendency or following the completion of any of these transactions, which could harm our businesses.

In particular, on January 16, 2020, we announced that we would no longer pursue our previously announced plan to separate into two independent publicly traded companies.  We incurred significant costs and expenses in connection with our planned separation, which required significant attention from our senior management and employees, and we expect that the process of unwinding the separation-related work will be time-consuming, will involve additional costs and expenses, and may result in difficulties attracting, retaining and motivating employees, which could harm our business and adversely affect the financial results and results of operations.

Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or the price of our common stock.

We must maintain our reputation and brand image.

Our brands have wide recognition, and our success has been due in large part to our ability to maintain, enhance and protect our brand image and reputation and our customers’ connection to our brands. Our continued success depends in part on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. Even if we react appropriately to negative posts or comments about us and/or our brands on social media and online, our customers’ perception of our brand image and our reputation could be negatively impacted. In addition, customer sentiment could be shaped by our sustainability policies and related design, sourcing and operations decisions. Failure to maintain, enhance and protect our brand image could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our failure to manage key executive succession and retention and to continue to attract qualified personnel could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.

Our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing apparel trends depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in our design, merchandising, sourcing, marketing, and other functions. In addition, several of our strategic initiatives, including our technology initiatives and supply chain initiatives, require that we hire and/or develop employees with appropriate experience. We must also attract, develop, and retain a sufficient number of qualified field and distribution center personnel. Competition for talent is intense

and the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, and overtime regulations. If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate talented employees with the appropriate skill sets, or if changes to our organizational structure, operating results, or business model adversely affect morale or


retention, we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor to a key role could have a material adverse effect on our business. Since the beginning of fiscal 2019, there have been significant changes to our executive leadership team, including the departures of our Chief Executive Officer and our President and Chief Executive Officer of Gap brand and the upcoming departure of our Chief Financial Officer, and the appointment of a new Chief People Officer. In March 2020, we promoted Sonia Syngal to Chief Executive Officer and Katrina O'Connell to Chief Financial Officer. The effectiveness of our leaders, including our new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and any further transition, could have a significant impact on our results of operations.

Our investments in customer, digital, and omni-channel shopping initiatives may not deliver the results we anticipate.

One of our strategic priorities is to further develop an omni-channel shopping experience for our customers through the integration of our store and digital shopping channels. Our omni-channel initiatives include cross-channel logistics optimization and exploring additional ways to develop an omni-channel shopping experience, including further digital integration and customer personalization. These initiatives involve significant investments in IT systems and significant operational changes. In addition, our competitors are also investing in omni-channel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives. If the implementation of our customer, digital, and omni-channel initiatives is not successful, or we do not realize the return on our investments in these initiatives that we anticipate, our operating results would be adversely affected.

If we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our gross margins could be adversely affected.

Fluctuations in the global apparel retail markets impact the levels of inventory owned by apparel retailers. The nature of the global apparel retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we build up our inventory levels.

Merchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the season and frequently before apparel trends are confirmed by customer purchases. We must enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. In the past, we have not always predicted our customers’ preferences and acceptance levels of our trend items with accuracy. If sales do not meet expectations (for example, because of unexpected effects on inventory supply and consumer demand caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic), too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower-than-planned margins.

We have key strategic initiatives designed to optimize our inventory levels and increase the efficiency and responsiveness of our supply chain, including vendor fabric platforming, product demand testing, and in-season rapid response to demand. We are also developing additional capabilities to analyze customer behavior and demand, which we believe will allow us to better localize assortment and improve store-level allocations, such as size allocation, to further tailor our assortments to customer needs and increase sell-through. Further, we intend to leverage technology and data science to digitize product creation, integrate with our consolidated vendor base, and further optimize our product-to-market processes and supply chain to enhance our in-season responsiveness and reduce our exposure to fashion volatility. These initiatives and additional capabilities involve significant changes

to our inventory management systems and processes. If we are unable to implement these initiatives and integrate these additional capabilities successfully, we may not realize the return on our investments that we anticipate, and our operating results could be adversely affected.

Our business is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing.

Independent third parties manufacture all of our products for us. As a result, we are directly impacted by increases in the cost of those products

.

If we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing vendor, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or that any vendor would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, for any new manufacturing source, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors in our methods, products, quality control standards, and environmental, labor, health,


and safety standards. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could result in lower sales and net income. In addition, certain countries represent a larger portion of our global sourcing. For example, in fiscal 2019, approximately 32 percent and 16 percent of our merchandise, by dollar value, is purchased from factories in Vietnam and China, respectively. Accordingly, any delays in production and added costs in Vietnam or China could have a more significant impact on our results of operations.

Because independent vendors manufacture virtually all of our products outside of our principal sales markets, third parties must transport our products over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion, public health emergencies, social unrest, changes in local economic conditions, political upheavals, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with transitioning between vendors, could adversely impact our financial performance. Operating or manufacturing delays, transportation delays, or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as aircraft, which could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, the cost of fuel is a significant component of transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our gross margins.

If our vendors, or any raw material vendors on which our vendors rely, suffer prolonged manufacturing or transportation disruptions due to public health conditions, such as the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, or other unforeseen events, our ability to source product could be adversely impacted which would adversely affect our results of operations.

We are subject to data and security risks, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and consumer confidence in our security measures.

As part of our normal operations, we receive and maintain confidential, proprietary, and personally identifiable information, including credit card information, and information about our customers, our employees, job applicants, and other third parties. Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of this information. However, despite our safeguards and security processes and protections, security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. The retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. We may not have the resources to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our vendors or customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. In addition, even if we take appropriate measures to safeguard our information security and privacy environment from security breaches, we could still expose our customers and our business to risk. Actual or anticipated attacks may disrupt or impair our technology capabilities, and may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. Measures we implement to protect against cyber attacks may also have the potential to impact our customers’ shopping experience or decrease activity on our websites by making them more difficult to use. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. In addition, the global regulatory environment surrounding information security, cybersecurity, and privacy is increasingly demanding, with new laws, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which give customers the right to control how their personal information is collected, used and retained. Violating these rights, or failing to secure personal information, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of consumer confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.


Failures of, or updates or changes to, our IT systems may disrupt operations.

We maintain a complex technology platform consisting of both legacy and modern systems. These systems require continual maintenance, upgrades and changes, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with maintaining and replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and addressing system disruptions and believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks through testing, training, and staging implementation, as well as ensuring appropriate commercial contracts are in place with third-party vendors supplying or supporting our IT initiatives. However, there can be no assurances that we will successfully maintain or launch these systems as planned or that they will be implemented without disruptions to our operations. IT system disruptions or failures, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, or failure to successfully implement new or upgraded systems, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful.

Our current strategies include pursuing selective international expansion in a number of countries around the world through a number of channels. This includes our franchisees opening additional stores internationally. We have limited experience operating or franchising in some of these locations. In many of these locations, we face major, established competitors. In addition, in many of these locations, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics, regulatory, and other operating requirements differ dramatically from those in the places where we have more experience. Consumer tastes and trends may differ in many of these locations and, as a result, the sales of our products may not be successful or result in the margins we anticipate. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our operations and financial results could be materially, adversely affected.

The market for real estate is competitive.

Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices nationally and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases. In addition, we may seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition, relocate, or close some of our real estate locations, which in most cases requires a modification of an existing store lease. For example, on February 28, 2019, we announced plans to restructure our fleet of specialty stores and revitalize the Gap brand, including closing about 230 specialty stores during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. Failure to secure adequate new locations

,

successfully modify or exit existing locations, or effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Additionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties within the United States and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and the quality of our decisions to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, or cause impairments of our lease right of use assets as market values decline, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

.

Risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries, including failure of our vendors to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct, could harm our business.

We purchase nearly all merchandise from third-party vendors in many different countries, and we require those vendors to adhere to a Code of Vendor Conduct, which includes environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. From time to time, contractors or their subcontractors may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable local laws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to facilitate our compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise into various countries, there can be no assurance that suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards


and laws by one or more vendors could have a negative impact on our reputation, could subject us to liability, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our franchise business is subject to certain risks not directly within our control that could impair the value of our brands.

We enter into franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores and, in limited circumstances, websites, in many countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores and websites that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. The effect of these arrangements on our business and results of operations is uncertain and will depend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in new markets internationally and our ability to successfully identify appropriate third parties to act as franchisees, distributors, or in a similar capacity. In addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as franchisee financial stability and the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store locations, store openings, and sales. Other risks that may affect these third parties include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, foreign exchange rates, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and political instability. Moreover, while the agreements we have entered into and plan to enter into in the future provide us with certain termination rights, the value of our brands could be impaired to the extent that these third parties do not operate their stores in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.

Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain.

Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States or other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions. For example, the current political landscape and recent tariffs imposed by the U.S. and other countries in response has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to future tax and trade regulations. In addition, we face the possibility of anti-dumping or countervailing duties lawsuits from U.S. domestic producers. We are unable to determine the impact of the changes to the quota system or the impact that potential tariff lawsuits could have on our global sourcing operations. Our sourcing operations may be adversely affected by trade limits or political and financial instability, resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries, significant fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, restrictions on the transfer of funds, or other trade disruptions. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Our business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and our hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks.

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, operating expenses, profits, assets, and liabilities generated or incurred in foreign currencies as well as inventory purchases in U.S. dollars for our foreign subsidiaries. Although we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in fully offsetting the negative impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally only delay the impact of adverse foreign currency rate movements on our business and financial results.

We experience fluctuations in our comparable sales and margins.

Our success depends in part on our ability to grow sales and improve margins, in particular at our largest brands. A variety of factors affect comparable sales or margins, including but not limited to apparel trends, competition, current economic conditions, the timing of new merchandise releases and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs, foreign currency fluctuations, industry traffic trends, and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable sales results and margins to differ materially from


prior periods and from expectations. Our comparable sales, including the associated comparable online sales, have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual and quarterly basis. Over the past fiscal year, our reported quarterly comparable sales have ranged from a high of negative 1 percent in the fourth quarter of

fiscal 2019

to a low of negative 4 percent in the first, second and third quarters of

fiscal 2019

. Over the past five years, our reported gross margins have ranged from a high of 38.3 percent in fiscal 2017 to a low of 36.2 percent in fiscal 2015. In addition, over the past five years, our reported operating margins have ranged from a high of 9.6 percent in fiscal 2015 to a low of 3.5 percent in fiscal 2019.

Our ability to deliver strong comparable sales results and margins depends in large part on accurately forecasting demand and apparel trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base, managing inventory effectively, using effective pricing strategies, and optimizing store performance. Failure to meet the expectations of investors, securities analysts, or credit rating agencies in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our common stock, cause our credit ratings to decline, and impact liquidity.

Changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the capital markets and adversely impact our financial position or our business initiatives.

In April 2011, we issued $

1.25 billion

aggregate principal amount of

5.95

percent notes due

April 2021

. As a result, we have additional costs that include interest payable semi-annually on the notes.

Our cash flows from operations are the primary source of funds for these debt service payments. In this regard, we have generated annual cash flow from operating activities in excess of $1 billion per year for well over a decade and ended

fiscal 2019

with

$1.4 billion

of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. We are also able to supplement near-term liquidity, if necessary, with our $

500 million

revolving credit facility. We continue to target a cash balance between $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion, which provides not only for our working capital needs, but also a reserve for unexpected business downturns. However, if our cash flows from operating activities decline significantly, including any such decline related to reduced store traffic and widespread temporary store closures as a result of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, we may be required to reprioritize our business initiatives to ensure that we can continue to service or refinance our debt with favorable rates and terms. In addition, any future reduction in our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets, and higher interest costs and potentially increased lease or hedging costs. Reduction in our credit ratings could also negatively impact our ability to extinguish our Notes and enter into a new long-term debt arrangement.

In November 2019, Standard and Poor’s Ratings Service downgraded their credit rating of us from BB+ stable outlook to BB negative outlook. This downgrade, and any future reduction in our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings, could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets, more restrictive covenants in future financial documents and higher interest costs, and potentially increased lease or hedging costs.

For further information on our debt and credit facilities, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,

Note 5

and

Note 6

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

Changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Laws and regulations at the local, state, federal, and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that may result from changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape.

Any changes in laws or regulations, the imposition of additional laws or regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts employment and labor, trade, product safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, cybersecurity, privacy, operations, or environmental issues, among others, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.


Our results could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, negative global climate patterns, or other catastrophic events.

Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, and other adverse weather conditions; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics (including, for example, the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic); political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, labor unrest, and other political instability; negative global climate patterns, especially in water stressed regions; or other catastrophic events, such as fires or other disasters occurring at our distribution centers or our vendors' manufacturing facilities, whether occurring in the United States or internationally, could disrupt our operations, including the operations of our franchisees or the operations of one or more of our vendors. In particular, these types of events could impact our supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability or the ability of our franchisees or other third parties to operate our stores or websites. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to significantly impact our supply chain if the factories that manufacture our products are temporarily closed or experience worker shortages. In addition, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or, depending upon the severity, globally. For example, if customers’ concerns over potential exposure to COVID-19 or social distancing measures imposed by governments cause customers to avoid shopping centers and other retail locations, our store revenue could be adversely impacted. Disasters occurring at our vendors

’

manufacturing facilities could impact our reputation and our customers

’

perception of our brands. To the extent any of these events occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.

Reductions in income and cash flow from our credit card arrangement related to our private label and co-branded credit cards could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.

A third-party, Synchrony Financial ("Synchrony"), owns and services our private label credit card and co-branded programs for our Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta brands. Our agreement with Synchrony provides for certain payments to be made by Synchrony to us, including a share of revenues from the performance of the credit card portfolios. The income and cash flow that we receive from Synchrony is dependent upon a number of factors, including the level of sales on private label and co-branded accounts, the level of balances carried on the accounts, payment rates on the accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on the accounts, the level of credit losses for the accounts, Synchrony’s ability to extend credit to our customers

,

as well as the cost of customer rewards programs. All of these factors can vary based on changes in federal and state credit card, banking, and commercial protection laws. The factors affecting the income and cash flow that we receive from Synchrony can also vary based on a variety of economic, legal, social, and other factors that we cannot control. If the income and cash flow that we receive from the consumer credit card program agreement with Synchrony decreases significantly, our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.

We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims from time to time, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

As a multinational company, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims (“Actions”) arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, intellectual property, customer, employment, and data privacy claims, including class action lawsuits. The plaintiffs in some Actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages and some are covered in part by insurance. We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of Actions brought against us. Accordingly, developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement, or resolution. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Overview

We are a global retailer offering apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, and children under the Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, Athleta, Intermix, Janie and Jack, and Hill City brands. We have Company-operated stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Japan, Italy, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico. We have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy stores throughout Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. Our products are also available to customers online through Company-owned websites and through the use of third parties that provide logistics and fulfillment services. In addition to operating in the specialty, outlet, online, and franchise channels, we also use our omni-channel capabilities to bridge the digital world and physical stores to further enhance our shopping experience for our customers. Our omni-channel services, including buy online pick-up in store, order-in-store, find-in-store, and ship-from-store, as well as enhanced mobile experiences, are tailored uniquely across our portfolio of brands. Most of the products sold under our brand names are designed by us and manufactured by independent sources. We also sell products that are designed and manufactured by branded third parties, primarily at our Intermix brand.

We identify our operating segments according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated. As of February 1, 2020, our operating segments included Old Navy Global, Gap Global, Banana Republic Global, Athleta, and Intermix. We have determined that each of our operating segments share similar economic and other qualitative characteristics, and, therefore, the results of our operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment.

On February 28, 2019, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Company into two independently publicly-traded companies. On January 16, 2020, the Company announced it no longer intends to separate as the cost and complexity of splitting into two companies, combined with softer business performance, limited our ability to create appropriate value from separation. The work done to prepare for the separation shone a bright light on potential operational inefficiencies and areas for improvement. As a result, the Company intends to operate in a more rigorous and transformational manner that empowers our growth brands, Old Navy and Athleta, and appropriately focuses on the performance of Banana Republic Global and Gap Global. As part of this transformation, the Company announced that Sonia Syngal, the current president and chief executive officer of Old Navy Global, will become the Company’s president and chief executive officer, effective March 23, 2020.

For the fifty-two weeks ended February 1, 2020, we incurred separation-related costs of $301 million, substantially all of which was recorded in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income. See below for details regarding the nature of the costs incurred:

__________

(1)

Includes approximately $61 million related to loss on disposal of property and equipment for capital assets with no alternative future use.


In addition, on February 28, 2019, the Company announced plans to restructure the specialty fleet and revitalize the Gap brand, including closing about 230 Gap specialty stores during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. The Company believes these actions will drive a healthier specialty fleet and will serve as a more appropriate foundation for brand revitalization. During the two-year period, the Company estimates pre-tax costs associated with these closure actions to be about $250 million to $300 million, with the majority expected to be cash expenditures for lease-related costs. The remaining charges are expected to primarily include employee-related costs and the net impact of write-offs related to long-term assets and liabilities. The Company estimates an annualized sales loss of approximately $625 million as a result of these store closures, with resulting annualized pre-tax savings of about $90 million. For the fifty-two weeks ended February 1, 2020, we incurred specialty fleet restructuring costs of $61 million, which primarily include lease and employee-related costs and were recorded in costs of goods sold and occupancy expenses and operating expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Our discussions and negotiations with landlords around store closures continue to be difficult, and our ability to execute on our strategy quickly and decisively is challenging. As a result, we expect that the majority of store closures and expenses related to restructuring will occur in fiscal 2020. We continue to focus on rationalizing stores that do not generate sufficient returns to warrant the investments necessary to provide our customers with a differentiated experience.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard, accounting standards update ("ASU") No. 2016-02 and related amendments (collectively "ASC 842"), using the optional transition method and recorded a decrease to opening retained earnings of $86 million, net of tax. The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the recording of operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities of $5.7 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively, as of February 3, 2019. The adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material impact to our Consolidated Statement of Income or Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

On November 7, 2019, Art Peck stepped down as president and chief executive officer and resigned his position as a director of the Company. Robert J. Fisher, the Company's current chairman of the board of directors, began serving as the Company's president and chief executive officer on an interim basis. On March 5, 2020, the Company announced that Sonia Syngal, the current president and chief executive officer of Old Navy Global, will become the Company’s president and chief executive officer, effective March 23, 2020. On March 12, 2020, the Company announced that Katrina O’Connell will become the Company’s executive vice president and chief financial officer ("CFO"), effective March 23, 2020. The current CFO, Teri List-Stoll, will be stepping down and departing the Company after a transition period.

As part of our transformation and specialty fleet rationalization efforts in fiscal 2019, we reassessed our strategy for flagship stores including an evaluation of whether to exit or sublease certain flagship store locations. For the fifty-two weeks ended February 1, 2020, we recorded impairment charges of store assets and operating lease assets related to our flagship stores of

$73 million

and

$223 million

, respectively, which was recorded in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The impairment charges are primarily related to the New York specialty flagship stores for Gap and Old Navy in Times Square, after a formal decision was made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 to pursue exiting those locations.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company purchased a building for $343 million. In addition, as part of a related tax exchange, during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company sold a building for $220 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain on sale of $191 million.

On March 4, 2019, the Company acquired select assets of Gymboree Group, Inc. related to Janie and Jack, a premium children's clothing brand, through a bankruptcy auction. We purchased intellectual property, and property and equipment at the Janie and Jack store locations. We assumed the leases for the majority of Janie and Jack stores and entered into a separate transaction to purchase Janie and Jack inventory. The purchase price for the net assets acquired was $69 million.

We are facing a period of uncertainty regarding the potential impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on both our projected customer demand and supply chain. At this time, many of our Company-owned and franchise stores globally have been temporarily closed or are operating with reduced store hours due to COVID-19 mitigation efforts. We expect material impacts from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, including further spread in other regions, meaningful deterioration from current trends, and potential disruption from any supply chain impacts. During this challenging economic environment we are focused on the following priorities:

•

offering product that is consistently brand-appropriate and on-trend with high customer acceptance and appropriate value perception;

•

restructuring the Gap brand, with emphasis on the specialty fleet globally, to create a healthier, more profitable business;

•

attracting and retaining strong talent in our businesses and functions;

•

increasing the focus on improving operational discipline and efficiency by streamlining operations and processes throughout the organization and leveraging our scale;

•

managing inventory to support a healthy merchandise margin; and

•

Continuing to integrate social and environmental sustainability into business practices to support long term growth.

As of February 1, 2020 cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $1.7 billion. As we manage through the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in fiscal 2020, we have access to a significant portion of existing cash, as well as our available credit facilities to meet short-term liquidity needs.

Results of Operations

Fiscal 2019 and 2018 consisted of 52 weeks versus 53 weeks in fiscal 2017. Net sales and operating results, as well as other metrics derived from the Consolidated Statement of Income, include the impact of the additional week; however, the comparable sales calculation excludes the 53rd week.

Net Sales

See

Note 17

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K for net sales by brand and region.


Comparable Sales ("Comp Sales")

Comp Sales include the results of Company-operated stores and sales through online channels. The calculation of Gap Inc. Comp Sales includes the results of Hill City and Intermix, but excludes the results of the franchise business and Janie and Jack.

The percentage change in Comp Sales by global brand and for The Gap, Inc., as compared with the preceding year, is as follows:

A store is included in the Comp Sales calculations when it has been open and operated by the Company for at least one year and the selling square footage has not changed by 15 percent or more within the past year. A store is included in the Comp Sales calculations on the first day it has comparable prior year sales. Stores in which the selling square footage has changed by 15 percent or more as a result of a remodel, expansion, or reduction are excluded from the Comp Sales calculations until the first day they have comparable prior year sales.

A store is considered non-comparable (“Non-comp”) when it has been open and operated by the Company for less than one year or has changed its selling square footage by 15 percent or more within the past year.

A store is considered “Closed” if it is temporarily closed for three or more full consecutive days or it is permanently closed. When a temporarily closed store reopens, the store will be placed in the Comp/Non-comp status it was in prior to its closure. If a store was in Closed status for three or more days in the prior year, the store will be in Non-comp status for the same days the following year.

Current year foreign exchange rates are applied to both current year and prior year Comp Sales to achieve a consistent basis for comparison.

Store Count and Square Footage Information

Net sales per average square foot is as follows:

__________

(1)

Excludes net sales associated with our online and franchise businesses. Online sales include sales through our online channels including ship-from-store sales, buy online pick-up in store, and order-in-store.

(2)

Reflects the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in fiscal 2018. Prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to be reported under accounting standards in effect for those periods.

(3)

Fiscal 2017 includes incremental sales attributable to the 53rd week.


Store count, openings, closings, and square footage for our stores are as follows:

__________

(1)

We intend to close our Old Navy stores in China by early 2020.

(2)

On March 4, 2019, we acquired select assets of Gymboree Group, Inc. related to Janie and Jack. The 140 stores acquired were not included as store openings for fiscal 2019; however, they are included in the ending number of store locations as of February 1, 2020, net of one closure that occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.

(3)

Store closures for fiscal 2019 include closures related to our specialty fleet rationalization efforts. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K for information about store closing and other operating cost.

Gap and Banana Republic outlet and factory stores are reflected respectively within each brand.

The Company expects to close about 90 company-operated stores, net of openings and repositions in

fiscal 2020

. This guidance includes about 170 Gap brand store closures globally, the majority of which are expected to close in the fourth quarter of

fiscal 2020

. The Company continues to expect store openings to be focused on Old Navy and Athleta.


Net Sales Discussion

Our net sales for

fiscal 2019

decreased

$197 million

, or

1 percent

, compared with

fiscal 2018

. The decrease was primarily driven by negative Gap, Inc. Comp Sales and net store closures at Gap Global, partially offset by the addition of Janie and Jack, new store openings at Old Navy Global, and an increase in net sales at Athleta in part due to new stores. The translation of net sales in foreign currencies to U.S. dollars had an unfavorable impact of about $61 million for fiscal 2019 and is calculated by translating net sales for fiscal 2018 at exchange rates applicable during fiscal 2019.

Our net sales for

fiscal 2018

increased $725 million, or 5 percent, compared with

fiscal 2017

primarily driven by the impact of significant presentation changes of $619 million resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, and an increase in net sales for Old Navy Global and Athleta; partially offset by a decrease in net sales for Gap Global. The translation of net sales in foreign currencies to U.S. dollars had a favorable impact of about $17 million for fiscal 2018 and is calculated by translating net sales for

fiscal 2017

at exchange rates applicable during

fiscal 2018

.

Cost of Goods Sold and Occupancy Expenses

Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses increased 0.7 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in

fiscal 2019

compared with

fiscal 2018

.

•

Cost of goods sold increased 0.6 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in

fiscal 2019

compared with

fiscal 2018

, primarily driven by higher promotional activity at Old Navy Global.

•

Occupancy expenses increased 0.1 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in

fiscal 2019

compared with

fiscal 2018

, primarily driven by a decrease in net sales without a corresponding decrease in occupancy expenses.

Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses increased 0.2 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in

fiscal 2018

compared with

fiscal 2017

, which includes $176 million of presentation changes resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.

•

Cost of goods sold increased 0.7 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017, primarily driven by lower product margin at Gap Global and higher online shipping costs. This was partially offset by a favorable impact from presentation changes resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.

•

Occupancy expenses decreased 0.5 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017, primarily driven by presentation changes resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.

In fiscal 2020, we do not expect significant year-over-year impacts on gross margins due to fluctuations in foreign currencies.


Operating Expenses and Operating Margin

Operating expenses increased

$599 million

or

4.0

percentage points as a percentage of net sales in

fiscal 2019

compared with

fiscal 2018

primarily due to the following:

•

an increase due to separation-related costs of $300 million, global flagship impairment charges of $296 million, operating expenses related to Janie and Jack, and specialty fleet restructuring costs of $39 million, incurred in fiscal 2019 and not present in fiscal 2018;

•

an increase in expenses related to information technology;

•

an increase in bonus expense compared with a lower fiscal 2018 bonus expense;

•

an increase in advertising expenses due to increased spending at Old Navy Global and Athleta;

partially offset by

•

a gain on the sale of a building that occurred during fiscal 2019 of $191 million.

Operating expenses increased $373 million

or

1.0 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 primarily due to the following:

•

an increase of $443 million related to the presentation changes resulting from the adoption of new revenue recognition standard; and

•

a gain from insurance proceeds of $64 million during fiscal 2017 related to the fire that occurred at the Fishkill, New York Company-owned distribution center;

partially offset by

•

a decrease in expenses related to payroll and benefits, primarily driven by a decrease in bonus expense.

Interest Expense

Interest expense for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 is primarily comprised of interest on our

$1.25 billion

long-term debt.

Income Taxes

The increase in the effective tax rate for

fiscal 2019

compared with

fiscal 2018

was primarily due to an adjustment recorded in the current year to increase our fiscal 2017 tax liability for additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department regarding the TCJA and an adjustment recorded in fiscal 2018 to reduce our fiscal 2017 provisional estimated net charge related to the TCJA transition tax.


The decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, enacted as part of the TCJA, and measurement period adjustments to reduce our fiscal 2017 estimated net charge for the effects of the TCJA, offset by increases in unrecognized tax benefits recorded in connection with examinations by taxing authorities.

During fiscal 2017, we calculated and recorded a $57 million net charge for our best estimate of the impact of the TCJA one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign income and the impact of TCJA on deferred tax assets and liabilities.

During fiscal 2018, we recorded a $33 million measurement period adjustment to reduce our fiscal 2017 provisional estimated net charge related to the transition tax and recorded certain other immaterial measurement period adjustments to reduce our fiscal 2017 provisional estimated impact of the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the TCJA rate reduction.

During fiscal 2019, we recorded a $30 million adjustment to increase our fiscal 2017 tax liability for additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department regarding the TCJA.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our largest source of cash flows is cash collections from the sale of our merchandise. Our primary uses of cash include merchandise inventory purchases, occupancy costs, personnel-related expenses, purchases of property and equipment, and payment of taxes. In addition, we may have dividend payments, debt repayments, and share repurchases.

We consider the following to be measures of our liquidity and capital resources:

__________

(1)

Current liabilities for fiscal 2019 reflect the adoption of the new lease accounting standard. Prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to be reported under accounting standards in effect for those periods.

As of

February 1, 2020

, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held in the United States and are generally accessible without any limitations. As of

February 2, 2019

,

there was restricted cash of

$320 million

held by a third party in connection with the purchase of a building that was completed in fiscal 2019 recorded in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In April 2011, the Company entered into a $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.95 percent notes (the "Notes"), which are due April 2021. Prior to maturity and subject to market conditions, we intend to extinguish our Notes and also intend to enter into a new long-term debt arrangement.

We are also able to supplement near-term liquidity, if necessary, with our

$500 million

unsecured revolving credit facility or other available market instruments. We intend to enter into a new secured revolving credit facility.

We believe that cash flows from operations, along with current cash balances, and the instruments mentioned above will be sufficient to support our near-term liquidity; extensive temporary store closures may require access to additional credit.


Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $30 million during

fiscal 2019

compared with

fiscal 2018

, primarily due to the following significant changes:

Net income

•

a decrease in net income.

Non-cash items

•

an increase of $239 million due to non-cash impairment charges of operating lease assets in fiscal 2019; partially offset by

•

$191 million decrease due to gain on the sale of a building during fiscal 2019.

Changes in operating assets and liabilities

•

an increase of $306 million related to accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily due to a significant decrease in bonus accrual in fiscal 2018 combined with an increase in accruals in fiscal 2019 due to separation-related costs;

•

an increase of $158 million related to merchandise inventory primarily due to flat inventory during fiscal 2019 compared with an increase in inventory during fiscal 2018; and

•

an increase of $144 million related to timing of payments for accounts payable.

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2018 was flat compared with fiscal 2017, which was comprised of the following significant changes:

Net income

•

an increase in net income.

Changes in operating assets and liabilities

•

an increase of $165 million related to income taxes payable, net of prepaid and other tax-related items, driven primarily by the timing of payments; offset by

•

a decrease of $230 million related to accrued expenses and other current liabilities, driven primarily by a decrease in bonus accrual for fiscal 2018 compared with an increase for fiscal 2017; and

•

a decrease of $51 million related to other current assets and long-term assets driven in part by the receipt of insurance claims receivable related to the Fishkill fire during fiscal 2017.

We fund inventory expenditures during normal and peak periods through cash flows from operating activities and available cash. Our business follows a seasonal pattern, with sales peaking during the end-of-year holiday period. The seasonality of our operations may lead to significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts between fiscal year-end and subsequent interim periods.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Net cash used for investing activities during

fiscal 2019

decreased $107 million compared with

fiscal 2018

, primarily due to the following:

•

$287 million fewer net purchases of available-for-sale debt securities during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018; and

•

$220 million of proceeds received for the sale of a building during fiscal 2019; partially offset by

•

$343 million purchase of a building during fiscal 2019; and

•

$69 million purchase of Janie and Jack during fiscal 2019.

In

fiscal 2019

, cash used for purchases of property and equipment was $

702 million

primarily related to store investments.

Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2018 increased $335 million compared with fiscal 2017, primarily due to the following:

•

$287 million of net purchases of available-for-sale securities during fiscal 2018; and

•

$66 million of insurance proceeds allocated to the loss on property and equipment during fiscal 2017.

In

fiscal 2018

, cash used for purchases of property and equipment was $

705 million

primarily related to information technology and supply chain to support our omni and digital strategies, and store investments.


Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Net cash used for financing activities during

fiscal 2019

decreased $189 million compared with

fiscal 2018

, primarily due to fewer repurchases of common stock.

Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2018 increased $18 million compared with fiscal 2017, primarily due to the following:

•

$83 million higher repurchases of common stock during fiscal 2018; offset by

•

$67 million cash outflow related to the final repayment of the Japan term loan during fiscal 2017.

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe free cash flow is an important metric because it represents a measure of how much cash a company has available for discretionary and non-discretionary items after the deduction of capital expenditures, net of insurance proceeds related to loss on property and equipment, as we require regular capital expenditures to build and maintain stores and purchase new equipment to improve our business and infrastructure. We use this metric internally, as we believe our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an important driver of value creation. However, this non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to supersede or replace our GAAP result. Free cash flow for fiscal 2017 is adjusted for insurance proceeds allocated to loss on property and equipment, as our cash used for purchases of property and equipment for fiscal 2017 includes certain capital expenditures related to the rebuilding of the Company-owned distribution center which was impacted by the Fishkill fire.

The following table reconciles free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, from net cash provided by operating activities, a GAAP financial measure.

__________

(1)

Excludes purchase of building in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.

Debt and Credit Facilities

Certain financial information about the Company's debt and credit facilities is set forth under the headings "Debt" and "Credit Facilities" in Notes 5 and 6, respectively, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K.

Dividend Policy

In determining whether and at what level to declare a dividend, we consider a number of factors including sustainability, operating performance, liquidity, and market conditions.

We paid an annual dividend of $0.97 per share in

fiscal 2019

and

fiscal 2018

. We plan to pay a dividend of $0.2425 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.

Share Repurchases

Certain financial information about the Company's share repurchases is set forth under the heading "Share Repurchases" in

Note 9

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K.


Contractual Cash Obligations

We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. The following table provides summary information concerning our future contractual obligations as of

February 1, 2020

. These obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain of these contractual obligations are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

February 1, 2020

, while others are disclosed as future obligations.

__________

(1)

Represents principal maturities, excluding interest. See

Note 5

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in

Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

for discussion on debt.

(2)

Excludes contingent rent obligations and variable maintenance, insurance, taxes and, other occupancies. See

Note 12

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in

Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

for discussion of our operating leases.

(3)

Represents estimated open purchase orders to purchase inventory as well as commitments for products and services used in the normal course of business. The amounts included in the table above also include the remaining federal income tax payable for the TCJA one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign income.

There were $172 million of long-term liabilities recorded in lease incentives and other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

February 1, 2020

that are excluded from the table above as the amount relates to uncertain tax positions and deferred compensation, and we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which the liabilities will increase or decrease over time.

There were $28 million of estimated costs related to contracts and commitments that were accrued as a result of the separation being canceled recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

February 1, 2020

and expected to be paid in fiscal 2020.

Commercial Commitments

We have commercial commitments, not reflected in the table above, that were incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations, including standby letters of credit of

$21 million

, surety bonds of

$48 million

, and bank guarantees of

$28 million

outstanding (of which

$18 million

was issued under the unsecured revolving credit facilities for our operations in foreign locations) as of

February 1, 2020

.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large, global corporation. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information.


Our significant accounting policies can be found under the heading "Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in

Note 1

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K. The policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, which has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Merchandise Inventory

We value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value (“LCNRV”), with cost determined using the weighted-average cost method. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes or colors), and we primarily use promotions and markdowns to clear merchandise. We record an adjustment to inventory when future estimated selling price is less than cost. Our LCNRV adjustment calculation requires management to make assumptions to estimate the selling price and amount of slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments subject to markdowns, which is dependent upon factors such as historical trends with similar merchandise, inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand, and the promotional environment. In addition, we estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date. Our shortage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends. Historically, actual shortage has not differed materially from our estimates.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our LCNRV or inventory shortage adjustments. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or actual physical inventory shortage differs significantly from our estimate, our operating results could be affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to calculate our LCNRV or inventory shortage adjustments in the past three fiscal years.

Leases

We determine if a long-term contractual obligation is a lease at inception. The majority of our operating leases relate to retail stores. We also lease some of our corporate facilities and distribution centers. Most store leases have a five-year base period and include options that allow us to extend the lease term beyond the initial base period, subject to terms agreed upon at lease inception. Some leases also include early termination options, which can be exercised under specific conditions. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

We record our lease liabilities at the present value of the lease payments not yet paid, discounted at the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term. As the Company's leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We have elected the practical expedient to combine lease and nonlease components for our operating leases. This information is dependent upon our credit rating, market information for credit spreads, and adjustments for the impact of collateral. The incremental borrowing rate is also adjusted for each lease’s respective geography.

We recognize operating lease cost over the estimated term of the lease, which includes options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised, starting when possession of the property is taken from the landlord, which normally includes a construction period prior to the store opening. When a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the fixed rent, we recognize the related operating lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In addition, certain of our lease agreements include variable lease payments, such as payments based on a percentage of sales that are in excess of a predetermined level and/or increases based on a change in the consumer price index or fair market value. These variable lease payments are excluded from minimum lease payments and are included in the determination of net lease cost when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If an operating lease asset is impaired, the remaining operating lease asset will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term.

Note 12

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K for related disclosures.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill, and Intangible Assets

We review the carrying amount of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include a significant decrease in the operating performance of the long-lived asset, or the decision to close a store, corporate facility, or distribution center. Long-lived assets are considered impaired if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group over the estimated remaining lease term. For impaired assets, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or asset group and its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of the asset or asset group is based on estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group using a discount rate commensurate with the related risk. The asset group is defined as the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available and largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. The asset group is comprised of both property and equipment and operating lease assets. The asset group for our retail stores is reviewed for impairment at the store level. Our estimate of future cash flows requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and gross profits and estimating useful lives of the assets. For operating lease assets, the Company determines the fair value of the assets by comparing the discounted contractual rent payments to estimated market rental rates. These estimates can be affected by factors such as future store results, real estate demand, store closure plans, and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict.

See

Note 7

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K for additional information and disclosures about impairment of long-lived assets.

We also review the carrying amount of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include significant changes in the business climate, declines in our operating results, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If goodwill is considered impaired, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit.

In connection with the acquisitions of Athleta in September 2008 and Intermix in December 2012, we recorded goodwill that is reviewed for impairment using the applicable reporting unit, which is an operating segment or a business unit one level below that operating segment for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. We have deemed Athleta and Intermix to be the reporting units at which goodwill is tested for Athleta and Intermix, respectively.

A trade name is considered impaired if the carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. If a trade name is considered impaired, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the trade name. The fair value of the trade names is determined using the relief from royalty method.

These analyses require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses, and selecting appropriate discount rates and royalty rates, which can be affected by economic conditions and other factors that can be difficult to predict.

See

Note 4

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K for additional information and disclosures about impairment of goodwill and trade names.

If actual store and online results and brand performance, real estate market conditions, and economic conditions including interest rates are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in our calculations, we may be exposed to additional impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill, or intangible assets that could be material.


Income Taxes

We record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future income, taxable income, and the geographic mix of income or losses in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may also be materially impacted by changes in the geographic mix and level of income or losses, changes in the expected outcome of audits, changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance, guidance related to the enactment of the TCJA that is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or new tax legislation and guidance.

At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits.

We believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.

All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase are classified as cash and cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents are placed primarily in time deposits, money market funds, and commercial paper. We generally value these investments at their original purchase prices plus interest that has accrued at the stated rate. We also have highly liquid investments with original maturities of greater than three months and less than two years that are classified as short-term investments. These securities are recorded at fair value using market prices.

Changes in interest rates impact the fair value of our investments that are considered available-for-sale. As of

February 1, 2020

and February 2, 2019, the Company held

$290 million

and $

288 million

, respectively, of available-for-sale debt securities with original maturity dates greater than three months and less than two years within short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, as of

THE GAP, INC.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Gap, Inc.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Gap, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of February 1, 2020 and February 2,2019 the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the fiscal years  ended February 1, 2020, February 2, 2019, and February 3, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended February 1, 2020, February 2, 2019 and February 3, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

Change in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, effective February 3, 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (“ASC 842”) using the optional transition method. Leases-incremental borrowing rate used in adoption of ASC 842 is also communicated as a critical audit matter below.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,


accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - Refer to Notes 1,2 and 7 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company performs an analysis of the carrying value of all long-lived store assets for impairment at an individual store level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of individual store assets may not be recoverable. The Company’s impairment analysis determines whether projected undiscounted future cash flows from operations are sufficient to recover the carrying value of these store assets. Impairment may result when the carrying value of the store assets exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life. Events that result in an impairment review include a significant decrease in the operating performance of the long-lived asset, or the decision to close a store, corporate facility, or distribution center. Impairment charges recorded related to store assets, and operating lease assets for the year ended February 1, 2020 were $98 million and $239 million, respectively. The Company’s impairment analysis consists of (1) identifying stores with indicators of impairment, (2) testing the identified store assets for recoverability and (3) measuring the impairment loss.

We identified long-lived store asset impairment as a critical audit matter because the determination of the estimated growth rates used to project future sales and gross profit at individual stores and the determination of estimated market rent used in the fair value estimate of the Company’s operating lease assets included within the respective store asset group requires significant management judgment. Changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on whether long lived store assets should be further evaluated for impairment and could have a significant impact on the resulting impairment charge.

This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the Company’s judgments used in these estimates.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to management’s judgments regarding the forecasts of future sales and gross profit growth assumptions included the following, among others:

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s long-lived store asset impairment evaluation, including those over future sales and gross profit projections

•

We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future sales and gross profit growth by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts


•

We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s sales and gross profit growth forecasts by comparing the forecasts to:

◦

Historical revenue and operating margins

◦

Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors

Our audit procedures related to management’s judgments regarding the estimation of the fair value of market rent used in the calculation of operating lease assets included the following, among others:

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls over the estimation of the market rent utilized in the estimate of the fair value of operating lease assets

•

With the assistance of our fair value specialists, evaluated that the methods used by management to develop the estimated market rent utilized in the fair value of the operating lease assets

Leases - Incremental Borrowing Rate Used in Adoption of ASC 842 - Refer to Notes 1 and 12 to the financial statements (also see ASC 842 adoption explanatory paragraph above)

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2016-02,

Leases

, (“ASC 842”) as of February 3, 2019. Accordingly, the Company recorded operating lease liabilities for the present value of its leases and operating lease assets of approximately $6.6 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, upon adoption.

We identified the incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”) used in the determination of the present value of the Company’s future minimum lease payments as a critical audit matter because the determination of the appropriate credit rating, credit spread and adjustments for the impacts of collateralization used to determine the rate require significant management judgment.  Changes in these inputs to the IBR determination can have a significant effect on the recorded operating lease assets and related lease liabilities.

Given the significant judgments made by management in determining the IBR, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the methods and assumptions related to credit rating, credit spreads and adjustments for the impact of collateral involved a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the IBRs used in the adoption of ASC 842 included the following, among others:

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls over the calculation of the IBRs, including those over credit ratings, credit spreads and adjustments for the impact of collateral

•

With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we:

◦

Evaluated that the methods used by management were based on the definitions and guidance in ASC 842

◦

Assessed the reasonableness of the credit rating, base rate, spreads and adjustments for the effects of collateral applied in determining the IBR by comparing to Company specific benchmarks, comparable companies and other market information

◦

Assessed the reasonableness of the models and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation used to estimate the IBR

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization

The Gap, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a global omni-channel retailer offering apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, and children under the Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, Athleta, Intermix, Janie and Jack, and Hill City brands. We have Company-operated stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Japan, Italy, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico. We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Old Navy, Gap, and Banana Republic stores in over 30 other countries around the world. In addition, our products are available to customers online through Company-owned websites and through the use of third parties that provide logistics and fulfillment services.

Principles of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of The Gap, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Fiscal Year and Presentation

Our fiscal year is a 52-week or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. The fiscal years ended

February 1, 2020

(

fiscal 2019

), and

February 2, 2019

(

fiscal 2018

) consisted of 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended

February 3, 2018

(

fiscal 2017

) consisted of 53 weeks.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

Cash includes funds deposited in banks and amounts in transit from banks for customer credit card and debit card transactions that process in less than seven days.

All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents are placed primarily in time deposits and money market funds. With the exception of our available-for-sale investments noted below, we value these investments at their original purchase prices plus interest that has accrued at the stated rate. Income related to these securities is recorded in interest income on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Highly liquid investments with original maturities of greater than three months and less than two years are classified as short-term investments. These investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value using market prices.

Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale investments impact net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Income related to these investments is recorded in interest income on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

See

Note 7

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to fair value measurements.


Restricted Cash

As of February 1, 2020 and February 3, 2018, restricted cash primarily includes consideration that serves as collateral for our insurance obligations. As of February 2, 2019, restricted cash primarily includes consideration held by a third party in connection with the purchase of a building, as well as consideration that serves as collateral for our insurance obligations.

The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets to the total shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:

__________

(1)

Fiscal 2018 included

$


million

of consideration held by a third party in connection with the purchase of a building that was completed in fiscal 2019.

Merchandise Inventory

We value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined using the weighted-average cost method. We record an adjustment when future estimated selling price is less than cost. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes or colors) and use promotions and markdowns to clear merchandise. In addition, we estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as other current assets, other long-term assets, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, or lease incentives and other long-term liabilities.

For derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative financial instruments is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and is recognized in income in the period in which the underlying transaction impacts the income statement. For derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative financial instruments is reported as a component of OCI and is reclassified into income in the period or periods during which the hedged subsidiary is either sold or liquidated (or substantially liquidated). Gains and losses on the derivative financial instruments representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, if any, are recognized in current income. For derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss on the derivative financial instruments is recorded in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Cash flows from derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flows from operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

See

Note 8

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for related disclosures.


Property and Equipment

Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Estimated useful lives are as follows:

When assets are sold or retired, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, with any resulting gain or loss recorded in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Costs of maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.

Leases

We determine if a long-term contractual obligation is a lease at inception. The majority of our operating leases relate to retail stores. We also lease some of our corporate facilities and distribution centers. These operating leases expire at various dates through fiscal


. Most store leases have a five-year base period and include options that allow us to extend the lease term beyond the initial base period, subject to terms agreed upon at lease inception. Some leases also include early termination options, which can be exercised under specific conditions. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

We record our lease liabilities at the present value of the lease payments not yet paid, discounted at the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term. As the Company's leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We have elected the practical expedient to combine lease and nonlease components for our operating leases. We recognize operating lease cost over the estimated term of the lease, which includes options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised, starting when possession of the property is taken from the landlord, which normally includes a construction period prior to the store opening. When a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the fixed rent, we recognize the related operating lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In addition, certain of our lease agreements include variable lease payments, such as payments based on a percentage of sales that are in excess of a predetermined level and/or increases based on a change in the consumer price index or fair market value. These variable lease payments are excluded from minimum lease payments and are included in the determination of net lease cost when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If an operating lease asset is impaired, the remaining operating lease asset will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term.

See

Note 12

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for related disclosures.

Revenue Recognition

The Company’s revenues include merchandise sales at stores, online, and through franchise agreements. We also receive revenue sharing from our credit card agreement for private label and co-branded credit cards, and breakage revenue related to our gift cards, credit vouchers, and outstanding loyalty points, which are realized based upon historical redemption patterns. For online sales and catalog sales, the Company has elected to treat shipping and handling as fulfillment activities and not a separate performance obligation. Accordingly, we recognize revenue for our single performance obligation related to online sales and catalog sales at the time control of the merchandise passes to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment. We also record an allowance for estimated merchandise returns based on our historical return patterns and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, which is presented on a gross basis on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Revenues are presented net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.


We have credit card agreements with third parties to provide our customers with private label credit cards and co-branded credit cards (collectively, the “Credit Card programs"). Each private label credit card bears the logo of Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, or Athleta and can be used at any of our U.S. or Canadian store locations and online. The co-branded credit card is a VISA credit card bearing the logo of Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, or Athleta and can be used everywhere VISA credit cards are accepted. The Credit Card programs offer incentives to cardholders in the form of reward certificates upon the cumulative purchase of an established amount.

Synchrony Financial ("Synchrony"), a third-party financing company, is the sole owner of the accounts and underwrites the credit issued under the Credit Card programs. Our agreement with Synchrony provides for certain payments to be made to us, including a share of revenue from the performance of the credit card portfolios and reimbursements of loyalty program discounts. We have identified separate performance obligations related to our credit card agreement that includes both providing a license and an obligation to redeem loyalty points issued under the loyalty rewards program. Our obligation to provide a license is satisfied when the subsequent sale or usage occurs and our obligation to redeem loyalty points is deferred until those loyalty points are redeemed.

Prior to fiscal 2018, income received related to our Credit Card programs was recorded within operating expenses and cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses. With the adoption of new revenue recognition standard, income related to our Credit Card programs is now classified within net sales on our Consolidated Statements of Income.

We defer revenue when cash payments are received in advance of performance for unsatisfied obligations related to our gift cards, credit vouchers, outstanding loyalty points, and reimbursements of loyalty program discounts associated with our credit card agreement.

We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy stores in a number of countries throughout Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. We have identified separate performance obligations related to our franchise agreements that include both providing our franchise partners with a license and an obligation to supply franchise partners with our merchandise. Our obligation to provide a license is satisfied when the subsequent sale or usage occurs and our obligation to supply franchise partners with our merchandise is satisfied when control transfers.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We review the carrying amount of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include a significant decrease in the operating performance of the long-lived asset, or the decision to close a store, corporate facility, or distribution center. Long-lived assets are considered impaired if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group over the estimated remaining lease term. The asset group is defined as the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available and largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets, which for our retail stores is at the store level. The asset group is comprised of both property and equipment and operating lease assets. For impaired assets, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or asset group and its estimated fair value, which is recorded in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The estimated fair value of the asset or asset group is based on discounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group using a discount rate commensurate with the related risk. For operating lease assets, the Company determines the fair value of the assets by discounting the estimated market rental rates over the remaining term of the lease. These estimates can be affected by factors such as future store results, real estate demand, store closure plans, property specific discount rate and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict.

See

Note 7

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for related disclosures.


Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets

We review the carrying amount of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include significant changes in the business climate, declines in our operating results, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We assess potential impairment by considering present economic conditions as well as future expectations. If goodwill is considered impaired, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit.

A trade name is considered impaired if the carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. If a trade name is considered impaired, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the trade name. The fair value of a trade name is determined using the relief from royalty method, which requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses, and selecting appropriate discount rates and royalty rates.

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, including the trade names, are recorded in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

See

Note 4

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for related disclosures.

Advertising

Costs associated with the production of advertising, such as writing, copy, printing, and other costs, are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with communicating advertising that has been produced, such as television and magazine costs, are expensed when the advertising event takes place. Advertising expense was

$


million

,

$


million

, and

$


million

in

fiscal 2019

,


, and


, respectively, and is recorded in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Share-Based Compensation

Share-based compensation expense for stock options and other stock awards is determined based on the grant-date fair value. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, which requires the input of subjective assumptions regarding the expected term, expected volatility, dividend yield, and risk-free interest rate. For units granted whereby one share of common stock is issued for each unit as the unit vests (“Stock Units”), the fair value is determined based on the Company’s stock price on the date of grant less future expected dividends during the vesting period. For stock options and Stock Units, we recognize share-based compensation cost over the vesting period. We account for forfeitures as they occur. Share-based compensation expense is recorded primarily in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for stock options and Stock Units.

See

Note 11

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for related disclosures

.


Foreign Currency

Our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as their functional currency and translate their assets and liabilities at the current rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses from their operations are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period in which the transactions occur. The resulting gains and losses from translation are recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and in accumulated OCI on the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. Transaction gains and losses resulting from intercompany balances of a long-term investment nature are also classified as accumulated OCI. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the local functional currency are recorded in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The aggregate transaction gains and losses recorded in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income are as follows:

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts on the Consolidated Financial Statements. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made.

The Company recognizes interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The Company has made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due on the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) of foreign subsidiaries as a current period expense.

See

Note 13

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included for additional information on the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on income taxes.

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed as net income divided by basic weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed as net income divided by diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period including common stock equivalents. Common stock equivalents consist of shares subject to share-based awards with exercise prices less than the average market price of our common stock for the period, to the extent their inclusion would be dilutive. Stock options and other stock awards that contain performance conditions are not included in the calculation of common stock equivalents until such performance conditions have been achieved.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Except as noted below, the Company has considered all recent accounting pronouncements and has concluded that there are no recent accounting pronouncements that may have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements, based on current information.

Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted

Leases

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize a lease liability and an operating lease asset at the commencement date. We adopted ASC 842 on February 3, 2019 using the optional transition method, which allows for the prospective application of the standard. As of the effective date, we recorded a decrease to opening retained earnings of

$


million

, net of tax, which consisted primarily of impairment charges for certain store and operating lease assets. In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the standard, which allowed us to carry forward our historical lease classification, to not reassess prior conclusions related to initial direct costs, and to not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases. The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the recording of operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities of

$

5.7

billion

and

$

6.6

billion

, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of February 3, 2019.

See

Note 12

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for related disclosures.

Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. The amendments are intended to better align an entity's risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. In addition, this guidance amends and expands disclosure requirements. We adopted this ASU on a prospective basis on February 3, 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

See

Note 8

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for related disclosures.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to clarify the principles of recognizing revenue and create common revenue recognition guidance between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.

On February 4, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09 and related amendments (collectively “ASC 606”) using the modified retrospective transition method and recorded an increase to opening retained earnings of

$


million

, net of tax, related primarily to breakage revenue for gift cards and credit vouchers, outstanding loyalty points, and reimbursements of loyalty program discounts. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.

For fiscal 2018, the impact of applying ASC 606 primarily resulted in an increase in net sales driven by a reclassification of

$


million

for revenue sharing associated with our credit card programs and breakage revenue for gift cards and credit vouchers, which were previously recorded as a reduction to operating expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income. Net sales for fiscal 2018 also increased by

$


million

due to the reclassification of reimbursements of loyalty program discounts associated with our Credit Card programs, which were previously recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no other material impacts to the Consolidated Statements of Income resulting from the application of ASC 606 during fiscal 2018.

See

Note 3

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for related disclosures.


Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

ASU No. 2018-15, Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. The ASU is intended to align the requirements for capitalization of implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract with the existing guidance for internal-use software. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2019. The guidance provides flexibility in adoption, allowing for either retrospective adjustment or prospective adjustment for all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. We do not expect that the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASU No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The ASU is intended to enhance and simplify aspects of the income tax accounting guidance in ASC 740 as part of the FASB's simplification initiative. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2020 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue

The Company’s revenues include merchandise sales at stores, online, and through franchise agreements. We also receive revenue sharing from our credit card agreement for private label and co-branded credit cards, and breakage revenue related to our gift cards, credit vouchers, and outstanding loyalty points. Breakage revenue is recognized based upon historical redemption patterns. For online sales and catalog sales, the Company has elected to treat shipping and handling as fulfillment activities and not as a separate performance obligation. Accordingly, we recognize revenue for our single performance obligation related to online sales and catalog sales at the time control of the merchandise passes to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment. We also record an allowance for estimated merchandise returns based on our historical return patterns and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. Revenues are presented net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.

Our credit card agreement provides for certain payments to be made to us, including a share of revenue from the performance of the credit card portfolios and reimbursements of loyalty program discounts. We have identified separate performance obligations related to our credit card agreement that include both providing a license and an obligation to redeem loyalty points issued under the loyalty rewards program. Our obligation to provide a license is satisfied when the subsequent sale or usage occurs and our obligation to redeem loyalty points is deferred until those loyalty points are redeemed. Income related to our credit card agreement is classified within net sales on our Consolidated Statements of Income.

We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy stores in a number of countries throughout Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. We have identified separate performance obligations related to our franchise agreements that include both providing our franchise partners with a license and an obligation to supply franchise partners with our merchandise. Our obligation to provide a license is satisfied when the subsequent sale or usage occurs and our obligation to supply franchise partners with our merchandise is satisfied when control of the merchandise transfers. As of

February 1, 2020

and

February 2, 2019

, there were

no

material contract liabilities related to our franchise agreements.

We defer revenue when cash payments are received in advance of performance for unsatisfied obligations related to our gift cards, credit vouchers, outstanding loyalty points, and reimbursements of loyalty program discounts associated with our credit card agreement. For fiscal 2019, the opening balance of deferred revenue for these obligations was

$


million

, of which

$


million

was recognized as revenue during the period. The closing balance of deferred revenue related to gift cards, credit vouchers, outstanding loyalty points, and reimbursements of loyalty program discounts was

$


million

as of

February 1, 2020

. For fiscal 2018, the opening balance of deferred revenue for these obligations was

$


million

, of which

$


million

was recognized as revenue during the period. The closing balance of deferred revenue related to gift cards, credit vouchers, outstanding loyalty points, and reimbursements of loyalty program discounts was

We expect that the majority of our revenue deferrals as of

February 1, 2020

will be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months as our performance obligations are satisfied.

Credit Facilities

We have a

May 2023

. As of

February 1, 2020

, there were

no

borrowings and

no

material outstanding standby letters of credit under the Facility.

We maintain multiple agreements with third parties that make unsecured revolving credit facilities available for our operations in foreign locations (the “Foreign Facilities”). These Foreign Facilities are uncommitted and are generally available for borrowings, overdraft borrowings, and the issuance of bank guarantees. The total capacity of the Foreign Facilities was

$


million

as of

February 1, 2020

. As of

February 1, 2020

, there were

no

borrowings under the Foreign Facilities. There were

$


million

in bank guarantees issued and outstanding primarily related to store leases under the Foreign Facilities as of

February 1, 2020

.

We have bilateral unsecured standby letter of credit agreements that are uncommitted and do not have expiration dates. As of

February 1, 2020

, we had

$


million

in standby letters of credit issued under these agreements.

The Facility contains financial and other covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on liens and subsidiary debt, as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios—a minimum annual fixed charge coverage ratio of

2.00

and a maximum annual leverage ratio of

2.25

. As of

February 1, 2020

, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Violation of these covenants could result in a default under the Facility, which would permit the participating banks to terminate our ability to access the Facility for letters of credit and advances and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding advances.

Fair Value Measurements

The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives and available-for-sale debt securities. The Company categorizes financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value based upon a three-level hierarchy that considers the related valuation techniques.

There were

no

material purchases, sales, issuances, or settlements related to recurring level 3 measurements during

fiscal 2019

or


. There were

no

transfers of financial assets or liabilities into or out of level 1, level 2, and level 3 during

fiscal 2019

or


.

Financial Assets and Liabilities

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and cash equivalents held at amortized cost are as follows:


We have highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents, which are placed primarily in time deposits, money market funds, and commercial paper. With the exception of our available-for-sale investments noted below, we value these investments at their original purchase prices plus interest that has accrued at the stated rate.

Our available-for-sale securities are comprised of investments in debt securities. These securities are recorded at fair value using market prices. As of

February 1, 2020

and

February 2, 2019

, the Company held

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, of available-for-sale debt securities with maturity dates greater than three months and less than two years within short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, as of

February 1, 2020

and

February 2, 2019

, the Company held

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, of available-for-sale debt securities with maturities of less than three months at the time of purchase within cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale debt securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income were immaterial as of

February 1, 2020

and

February 2, 2019

.

The Company regularly reviews its available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment. The Company did not consider any of its securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired and, accordingly, did not recognize any impairment loss during the fiscal years ended

February 1, 2020

or

February 2, 2019

.

Derivative financial instruments primarily include foreign exchange forward contracts. See

Note 8

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding currencies hedged against the U.S. dollar.

We maintain the Gap, Inc., Deferred Compensation Plan (“DCP”), which allows eligible employees to defer base compensation and bonus up to a maximum percentage, and non-employee directors to defer receipt of a portion of their Board fees. Plan investments are directed by participants and are recorded at market value and designated for the DCP. The fair value of the Company’s DCP assets is determined based on quoted market prices, and the assets are recorded in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding employee benefit plans.

Nonfinancial Assets

Long-lived assets, which for us primarily consist of store assets and operating lease assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The asset group is defined as the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available and largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets, which for our retail stores, is at the store level.

For impaired assets, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or asset group and its estimated fair value, which is recorded in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

For operating lease assets, the Company determines the fair value of the assets by discounting the estimated market rental rates over the remaining term of the lease. These estimates can be affected by factors such as future store results, real estate demand, store closure plans, property specific discount rate and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict.

These fair value measurements qualify as level 3 measurements in the fair value hierarchy.

See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the impairment of long-lived assets.


For our specialty flagship stores, we have historically assessed for impairment at the company-wide level. We historically treated flagships in this manner because we believed in their strategic importance to the brands and the store fleet by providing broad visibility and increased brand awareness both regionally and globally. In fiscal 2019, as a result of our work around specialty fleet rationalization, we reassessed our operating strategy for flagship stores including an evaluation of whether to exit or sublease certain flagship store locations. Due to this shift in strategy, the Company determined that, for flagship stores, the individual store represents the lowest level of independent identifiable cash flows. As a result, during

fiscal 2019

we recorded an impairment charge of store assets and operating lease assets related to our flagship stores that indicated impairment of

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, which was recorded in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The impairment change is primarily related to our New York specialty flagship store locations in Times Square for Old Navy Global and Gap Global after a formal decision was made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 to pursue exiting those locations.

In total and inclusive of the above, we recorded the following long-lived asset impairment charges included in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income:

__________

(1)

The impairment charge of operating lease assets reduced the then carrying amount of the applicable operating lease assets of

$


million

to their fair value of

$


million

during

fiscal 2019

.

(2)

The impairment charge reduced the then carrying amount of the applicable store assets of

$


million

,

$

, and

$


million

during

fiscal 2019

,


, and


, respectively.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We operate in foreign countries, which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and do not enter into derivative financial contracts for trading purposes. Consistent with our risk management guidelines, we hedge a portion of our transactions related to merchandise purchases for foreign operations and certain intercompany transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts. These contracts are entered into with large, reputable financial institutions that are monitored for counterparty risk. The currencies hedged against changes in the U.S. dollar are Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound, Mexican peso, Euro, Chinese yuan, and Taiwan dollar.


Cash Flow Hedges

We designate the following foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedges: (1) forward contracts used to hedge forecasted merchandise purchases and related costs denominated in U.S. dollars made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currencies are their local currencies; (2) forward contracts used to hedge forecasted intercompany royalty payments denominated in foreign currencies received by entities whose functional currencies are U.S. dollars; and (3) forward contracts used to hedge forecasted intercompany revenue transactions related to merchandise sold from our regional purchasing entity, whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, to certain international subsidiaries in their local currencies. The foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to hedge forecasted merchandise purchases and related costs, intercompany royalty payments, and intercompany revenue transactions generally have terms of up to 24 months.

Net Investment Hedges

We may also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the net assets of international subsidiaries to offset the foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our investment in these subsidiaries.

Other Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

We use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our market risk exposure associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for certain intercompany balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity with the intercompany balance. The gain or loss on the derivative financial instruments that represent economic hedges, as well as the remeasurement of the underlying intercompany balances, is recorded in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same period and generally offset each other.

Outstanding Notional Amounts

As of

February 1, 2020

and

February 2, 2019

, we had foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding in the following notional amounts:


Quantitative Disclosures about Derivative Financial Instruments

The fair values of foreign exchange forward contracts are as follows:

All of the unrealized gains and losses from designated cash flow hedges as of

February 1, 2020

will be recognized in income within the next 12 months at the then-current values, which may differ from the fair values as of

February 1, 2020

shown above.

Our foreign exchange forward contracts are subject to master netting arrangements with each of our counterparties and such arrangements are enforceable in the event of default or early termination of the contract. We do not elect to offset the fair values of our derivative financial instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and as such the fair values shown above represent gross amounts. The amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements are not material as of

February 1, 2020

and

February 2, 2019

.

See

Note 7

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures on the fair value measurements of our derivative financial instruments.

The effective portion of gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts designated in a cash flow hedging relationship and net investment hedging relationships recorded in OCI, on a pre-tax basis, are as follows:


The pre-tax amounts recognized in income related to derivative instruments are as follows:

For

fiscal 2019

General Description of Stock Option and Other Stock Award Plans

The 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2016 Plan") was amended and restated as of February 22, 2017 and further amended and restated in May 2019. Under the 2016 Plan, nonqualified stock options and other stock awards are granted to officers, directors, eligible employees, and consultants at exercise prices or initial values equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant or as determined by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors.

As of

February 1, 2020

, there were

251,586,781

shares that have been authorized for issuance under the 2016 Plan.

Stock Units

Under the 2016 Plan, Stock Units are granted to employees and members of the Board of Directors. Vesting generally occurs over a period of

three

to

four

years of continued service by the employee in equal annual installments. Vesting is immediate in the case of members of the Board of Directors.

In some cases, Stock Unit vesting is also subject to the attainment of pre-determined performance metrics ("Performance Shares"). At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the probability that the Performance Shares will vest. We record share-based compensation expense on an accelerated basis over a period of

two

to

three

years once granted, based on the grant-date fair value and the probability that the pre-determined performance metrics will be achieved.

A summary of Stock Unit activity under the 2016 Plan for

fiscal 2019

is as follows:


A summary of additional information about Stock Units is as follows:

The aggregate intrinsic value of unvested Stock Units as of

February 1, 2020

was

$


million

.

As of

February 1, 2020

, there was

$


million

(before any related tax benefit) of unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested Stock Units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

2.1

years. Total unrecognized share-based compensation expense may be adjusted for future forfeitures as they occur.

Stock Units Granted Based on Performance Metrics

Under the 2016 Plan, some Stock Units are granted to employees only after the achievement of pre-determined performance metrics.

At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the probability that Stock Units will be granted. We record share-based compensation expense based on the probability that the performance metrics will be achieved, with an offsetting increase to current liabilities. We revalue the liability at the end of each reporting period and record an adjustment to share-based compensation expense as required based on the probability that the performance metrics will be achieved. A Stock Unit is granted upon certification of the performance metrics. At that time, the associated liability is reclassified to stockholders’ equity.

Out of

5,295,007

Stock Units granted in

fiscal 2019

,

1,787,189

Stock Units were granted based on satisfaction of performance metrics.

There was no material liability related to potential Stock Units to be granted based on performance metrics as of

February 1, 2020

. As of

February 2, 2019

, there was a

$


million

liability related to potential Stock Units to be granted based on performance metrics, which was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Stock Options

We have stock options outstanding under the 2016 Plan. Stock options generally expire the earlier of


years

from the grant date, three months after employee termination, or one year after the date of an employee’s retirement or death. Vesting generally occurs over a period of

four

years of continued service by the employee, with


percent vesting on each of the four anniversary dates.

The fair value of stock options issued during

fiscal 2019

,


, and


was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), eligible U.S. and Canadian employees are able to purchase our common stock at


percent

of the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on the last day of the three-month purchase periods. Accordingly, compensation expense is recognized for an amount equal to the


percent discount. Employees pay for their stock purchases through payroll deductions at a rate equal to any whole percentage from


percent to


percent. There were

Leases

Net lease cost recognized on our Consolidated Statement of Income is summarized as follows:


As of

February 1, 2020

, the maturities of lease liabilities based on the total minimum lease commitment amount including options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised are as follows:

During

fiscal 2019

, non-cash operating lease asset additions, net of remeasurements and modifications, were

$


million

. As of

February 1, 2020

, the minimum lease commitment amount for operating leases signed but not yet commenced, primarily for retail stores, was

$

As of

February 1, 2020

, the weighted-average remaining operating lease term was

8.7

years and the weighted-average discount rate was

4.7

percent

for operating leases recognized on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of

February 1, 2020

, the Company's finance leases were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

See

Note 1

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures related to leases.

In accordance with ASC 840, Leases, the aggregate minimum non-cancelable annual lease payments under operating leases in effect on

February 2, 2019

were as follows:

The total minimum lease commitment amount above does not include minimum sublease rent income of

$


million

receivable in the future under non-cancelable sublease agreements. In addition, the total minimum lease commitment amount above excludes options to extend lease terms that are reasonably assured of being exercised.


Note 13

.

Income Taxes

For financial reporting purposes, components of income (loss) before income taxes are as follows:

The provision for income taxes consists of the following:

The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate is as follows:

On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business, such as imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income, reducing the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, and adopting a territorial tax system.

The TCJA includes a provision to tax GILTI of foreign subsidiaries, a base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) measure that taxes certain payments between a U.S. corporation and its subsidiaries, and favorable tax treatment for certain foreign derived intangible income (“FDII”), effective for us beginning fiscal 2018. The Company has made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense.

During fiscal 2019, we recorded a

$


million

adjustment to increase our fiscal 2017 tax liability for additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department regarding the TCJA. In addition, the tax impact of foreign operations includes the effects of restructuring costs in certain foreign subsidiaries for which the Company was not permitted to recognize a tax benefit.


During

fiscal 2018

, we recorded a

$


million

measurement period adjustment to reduce our

fiscal 2017

provisional estimated net charge related to the transition tax and recorded certain other immaterial measurement period adjustments to reduce our

fiscal 2017

provisional estimated impact of the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the TCJA rate reduction

.

During

fiscal 2017

, we recorded a net

$


million

charge related to the estimated effects of the TCJA primarily due to the impact of the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign income and the impact of the TCJA on deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, our estimate of the transition tax was also impacted by a change in the structure of certain legal entities in

fiscal 2017

, which resulted in an overall net tax benefit of approximately

$


million

.

Deferred tax assets (liabilities) consist of the following:

As of

February 1, 2020

, we had approximately

$


million

of state and

$


million

of foreign loss carryovers in multiple taxing jurisdictions that could be utilized to reduce the tax liabilities of future years. The tax-effected loss carryovers were approximately

$


million

for state and

$


million

for foreign as of

February 1, 2020

. We also had approximately

$


million

of foreign tax credit carryovers as of February 1, 2020.

We provided a valuation allowance of approximately

$


million

against the deferred tax assets related to the foreign loss carryovers. We also provided a valuation allowance of approximately

$


million

related to other foreign deferred tax assets and

$


million

related to other federal deferred tax assets, including foreign tax credit carryovers.

The state losses expire between fiscal


and fiscal


. Approximately

$


million

of the foreign losses expire between fiscal


and fiscal


, and

$


million

of the foreign losses do not expire. The foreign tax credits expire in fiscal 2029.


The activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Of the

$


million

,

$


million

, and

$


million

of total unrecognized tax benefits as of

February 1, 2020

,

February 2, 2019

, and

February 3, 2018

, respectively, approximately

$


million

,

$


million

, and

$


million

, respectively, represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods.

During

fiscal 2019

, 2018, and 2017, interest expense of

$


million

,

$


million

, and

$


million

, respectively, was recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income relating to income tax liabilities.

As of

February 1, 2020

and

February 2, 2019

, the Company had total accrued interest related to income tax liabilities of

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively. There were

no

accrued penalties related to income tax liabilities as of

February 1, 2020

or

February 2, 2019

.

The Company conducts business globally, and as a result, files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as the United States, Canada, France, the United Kingdom, China, Hong Kong, Japan, and India. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for fiscal years before


, and with few exceptions, we also are no longer subject to U.S. state, local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations for fiscal years before


.

The Company engages in continual discussions with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in the various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in the normal course of business. As of

February 1, 2020

, it is reasonably possible that we will recognize a decrease in gross unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months of up to $3 million, primarily due to the closing of audits. If we do recognize such a decrease, the net impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income would not be material.

Note 14

.

Employee Benefit Plans

We have two qualified defined contribution retirement plans, the GapShare 401(k) Plan and the GapShare Puerto Rico Plan (the “Plans”), which are available to employees who meet the eligibility requirements. The Plans permit eligible employees to make contributions up to the maximum limits allowable under the applicable Internal Revenue Codes. Under the Plans, we match, in cash, all or a portion of employees’ contributions under a predetermined formula. Our contributions vest immediately. Our matching contributions to the Plans were

$


million

,

$


million

, and

$


million

in

fiscal 2019

,


, and


, respectively.


We maintain the Gap, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (DCP), which allows eligible employees to defer base compensation and bonus up to a maximum percentage, and non-employee directors to defer receipt of a portion of their Board fees. Plan investments are directed by participants and are recorded at market value and designated for the DCP. The fair value of the Company’s DCP assets is determined based on quoted market prices. As of

February 1, 2020

and

February 2, 2019

, the assets related to the DCP were

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, and were recorded in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of

February 1, 2020

and

February 2, 2019

, the corresponding liabilities related to the DCP were

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, and were recorded in lease incentives and other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We match all or a portion of employees’ contributions under a predetermined formula. Plan investments are elected by the participants, and investment returns are not guaranteed by the Company. Our matching contributions to the DCP in

fiscal 2019

,


, and


were not material.

Note 15

Earnings per Share

Weighted-average number of shares used for earnings per share is as follows:

The above computations of weighted-average number of shares—diluted exclude


million

,


million

, and


million

shares related to stock options and other stock awards for

fiscal 2019

,


, and


, respectively, as their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share.

Note 16

.

Commitments and Contingencies

We are a party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters. These contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts, operating leases, trademarks, intellectual property, financial agreements, and various other agreements. Under these contracts, we may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties (e.g., ownership of assets, environmental or tax indemnifications), or personal injury matters. The terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined. Generally, the maximum obligation under such indemnifications is not explicitly stated, and as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements taken as a whole.

As a multinational company, we are subject to various Actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. As of

February 1, 2020

, Actions filed against us included commercial, intellectual property, customer, employment, and data privacy claims, including class action lawsuits. The plaintiffs in some Actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages and some are covered in part by insurance. As of

February 1, 2020

and

February 2, 2019

, we recorded a liability for an estimated loss if the outcome of an Action is expected to result in a loss that is considered probable and reasonably estimable. The liability recorded as of

February 1, 2020

and

February 2, 2019

was not material for any individual Action or in total. Subsequent to

February 1, 2020

and through the filing date of

March 17, 2020

, no information has become available that indicates a change is required that would be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements taken as a whole.

We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of Actions brought against us. Accordingly, developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement, or resolution. However, we do not believe that the outcome of any current Action would have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements taken as a whole.


Old Navy Separation

On February 28, 2019, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to separate the Company into two independently publicly-traded companies. On January 16, 2020, the Company announced it no longer intends to separate, as the cost and complexity of splitting into two companies, combined with softer business performance, limited our ability to create appropriate value from separation. As of

February 1, 2020

, there were

$


million

of estimated costs related to contracts and commitments that were accrued as a result of the separation being canceled, expected to be paid in fiscal 2020. These amounts were recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Fire at the Fishkill Distribution Center

In fiscal 2016, a fire occurred in one of the buildings at a Company-owned distribution center campus in Fishkill, New York. Total insurance proceeds for fiscal 2017 were

$


million

, all of which were received by

February 3, 2018

. A gain of

$


million

was recognized in fiscal 2017, primarily related to property and equipment. The remaining settlement was recorded as a reduction to the insurance receivable balance in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet or cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses or operating expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income, primarily offsetting fire-related costs incurred during fiscal 2017.

During fiscal 2017, we allocated

$


million

of insurance proceeds to the loss on property and equipment, and the amount has been reported as insurance proceeds related to loss on property and equipment, a component of cash flows from investing activities, on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

Segment Information

We identify our operating segments according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated. As of

February 1, 2020

, our operating segments included: Old Navy Global, Gap Global, Banana Republic Global, Athleta, and Intermix. Each operating segment has a brand president who is responsible for various geographies and channels. Each of our brands serves customers through its store and online channels, allowing us to execute on our omni-channel strategy where customers can shop seamlessly across all of our brands in retail stores and online through desktop or mobile devices. We have determined that each of our operating segments share similar economic and other qualitative characteristics, and therefore the results of our operating segments are aggregated into

one

reportable segment as of

February 1, 2020

. We continually monitor and review our segment reporting structure in accordance with authoritative guidance to determine whether any changes have occurred that would impact our reportable segments.

Net sales by brand and region are as follows:

Acquisition

On March 4, 2019, the Company acquired select assets of Gymboree Group, Inc. related to Janie and Jack, a premium children's clothing brand, through a bankruptcy auction. We purchased intellectual property and property and equipment at the Janie and Jack store locations. We assumed the leases for the majority of Janie and Jack stores and entered into a separate transaction to purchase Janie and Jack inventory.

The purchase price for the net assets acquired was

$


million

. The total purchase price was allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. Such estimated fair values require management to make estimates and judgments, especially with respect to intangible assets.

Amounts recorded for assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date were as follows:

The results of operations for Janie and Jack since the date of acquisition were not material to our net income.


Note 19

.

Store Closing and Other Operating Cost

On February 28, 2019, the Company announced plans to restructure the specialty fleet and revitalize the Gap brand, including closing about 230 Gap specialty stores during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. The Company believes these actions will drive a healthier specialty fleet and will serve as a more appropriate foundation for brand revitalization. The Company expects that the actions will be substantially completed by the end of the Company’s 2020 fiscal year ending January 30, 2021.

For the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020, we incurred

$


million

of pre-tax costs related to the store closing and other operating cost. The summary of the costs incurred are as follows:

__________

(1)

In accordance with ASC 842, this cost includes lease termination fees and amortization expense.

In addition to the total pre-tax amount incurred above, there was an unfavorable tax impact related to the restructuring costs incurred in certain foreign subsidiaries for which the Company was not able to recognize any tax benefit.

As of February 1, 2020, the balance for liabilities related to restructuring is not material.

Subsequent Events

On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. As of the date of this filing, many of our Company-operated and franchise stores globally have been impacted by temporary closures or reduced store hours. We cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of this pandemic, but we currently anticipate a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated cash flows in fiscal 2020.

On March 5, 2020, the Company announced that Sonia Syngal, the current president and chief executive officer of Old Navy Global, will become the Company’s president and chief executive officer, effective March 23, 2020. In connection with the naming of Ms. Syngal as CEO, Robert J. Fisher will step down as the Company's interim CEO and as Chairman of the Board, effective as of Ms. Syngal's start date, and will continue in his role as a director of the Company. Bob L. Martin, a current director of the Company, will serve as Chairman of the Board, an executive role, effective March 23, 2020.

On March 12, 2020, the Company announced that Katrina O’Connell will become the Company’s executive vice president and chief financial officer ("CFO"), effective March 23, 2020. The current CFO, Teri List-Stoll, will be stepping down and departing the Company after a transition period.
