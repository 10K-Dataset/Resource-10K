This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the “safe harbor”
provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than those that are purely historical are forward-looking statements. Words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,”
“estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” and similar expressions also identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding: our current strategies and initiatives; our launch of successor IT
systems related to supply chain; our launch of other successor IT systems; and outcome of legal actions.

Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ
materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: the risk that we will be unsuccessful in gauging fashion trends and changing consumer preferences; the highly competitive nature of
our business in the U.S. and internationally and our dependence on consumer spending patterns, which are influenced by numerous other factors; the risk that we will be unsuccessful in identifying and negotiating new store locations effectively; the
risk that comparable store sales and margins will experience fluctuations; the risk that we will be unsuccessful in implementing our strategic, operating and people initiatives; the risk that adverse changes in our credit ratings may have a negative
impact on our financing costs and structure in future periods; the risk that trade matters, events causing disruptions in product shipments from China and other foreign countries, or IT systems changes may disrupt our supply chain or operations; and
the risk that we will not be successful in defending various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, claims, and audits; any of which could impact net sales, costs and expenses, and/or planned strategies. Additional information regarding factors that could
cause results to differ can be found in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact net sales and profitability are difficult to predict. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of March 25, 2005 and we assume no
obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized.

PART I

Item 1 - Business

General

The Company was incorporated in the State of California in July 1969 and was reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in May 1988.

We are a global specialty retailer operating retail and outlet
stores selling casual apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men, women and children under the Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy brands. We operate stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France and Japan. In addition,
our U.S. customers may shop online at gap.com, bananarepublic.com, and oldnavy.com.

We design virtually all of our products, which are manufactured by independent sources, and sell them under three brands:

Gap.

Founded in 1969, Gap stores offer extensive selections of classically styled, high quality, casual apparel at moderate
price points. Products range from wardrobe basics such as denim, khakis and T-shirts to fashion apparel, accessories and personal care products for men and women, ages teen through adult. We entered the children’s apparel market with the
introduction of GapKids in 1986 and babyGap in 1989. These stores offer casual apparel and accessories in the tradition of Gap style and quality for children, ages newborn through pre-teen. Launched in 1998, GapBody offers women’s underwear,
sleepwear, swimwear and personal care products.

Banana Republic.

Acquired in 1983 with two stores, Banana Republic now offers sophisticated, fashionable collections of dress-casual and tailored apparel, shoes and accessories for men and women at higher price points than
Gap. Banana Republic products range from apparel, including intimate apparel, to personal care products.


Old Navy.

We launched Old Navy in 1994 to address the market for
value-priced family apparel. Old Navy offers broad selections of apparel, shoes and accessories for adults, children and infants as well as other items, including personal care products, in an innovative, exciting shopping environment. Old Navy also
offers a line of maternity and plus sizes in its stores.

As of
January 29, 2005, we operated a total of 2,994 store locations. For more information on the number of stores by brand and region, see the table in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
included as Part II, Item 7 of this form by reference to page 25 of our 2004 Annual Report to Shareholders.

We established Gap Online, a web-based store located at www.gap.com, in 1997. Products comparable to those carried in Gap, GapKids and babyGap stores can
be purchased on-line. Banana Republic introduced Banana Republic Online, a web-based store located at www.BananaRepublic.com, in 1999, which offers products comparable to those carried in the store collections. In 2000, we established Old Navy
Online, a web-based store located at www.oldnavy.com. Old Navy Online also offers apparel and accessories comparable to those carried in the store collections. Our online businesses are offered as an extension of our store experience and are
intended to strengthen our relationship with our customers.

Certain financial information about international operations is set forth under the heading “Segment Information” in Note M to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, incorporated by reference in Item 8 – Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data.

Store Operations

Our stores offer a shopper-friendly environment with an assortment of
casual apparel and accessories which emphasize style, quality and good value. The range of merchandise displayed in each store varies depending on the selling season and the size and location of the store.

Our stores generally are open seven days per week (where permitted by law)
and most holidays. All sales are tendered for cash, personal checks, debit cards, or credit cards, including Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy private label credit cards which are issued by a third party. We also issue and redeem gift cards through
our brands.

Merchandise Vendors

We purchase merchandise on average from approximately 700 vendors with
facilities in approximately 50 countries. No vendor accounted for more than 5% of the dollar amount of our fiscal 2004 purchases. Of our merchandise sold during fiscal 2004, approximately 2% of all units (representing approximately 2% of total cost)
was produced domestically while the remaining 98% of all units (representing approximately 98% of total cost) was made outside the United States. Approximately 18% of our total merchandise units (representing approximately 19% of total cost) was
made in China, with the remainder coming from more than 50 other countries. Any event causing disruption of imports from China or other foreign countries, including the imposition of additional import restrictions, could have a material adverse
effect on our operations. Substantially all of our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars. Also see the section entitled “Certain Additional Business Risk Factors – Trade matters and IT system changes
may disrupt our supply chain” below in this Item 1.

Seasonal
Business

Our business follows a seasonal pattern,
with sales peaking over a total of about 13 weeks during the Back-to-School (August) and Holiday (November through December) periods. During fiscal 2004, these periods accounted for approximately 32% of our net sales.


Brand Building

Our continued ability to develop new brands and continually change and evolve our existing brands is a key to our success. We believe our distinct brands
are among our most important assets. All aspects of brand development from product design and distribution, to marketing, merchandising and shopping environments are controlled by us. We continue to invest in the development of our brands through
consumer research and advertising. We have also made investments to enhance the customer experience through the expansion and remodeling of existing stores, the closure of under-performing stores, and a focus on customer service.

Advertising

We place print ads in major metropolitan newspapers and their Sunday magazines, major news weeklies and lifestyle and
fashion magazines. Our ads also appear in various outdoor venues, such as mass transit posters, exterior bus panels, bus shelters and billboards. We have also run TV ads for Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic and radio ads for Old Navy. We plan to
continue our investments in advertising and marketing in 2005. There can be no assurances that these investments will result in increased sales or profitability.

Employees

As of January 29, 2005, we had a work force of approximately 152,000 employees, which includes a combination of part and full-time employees. We hire
temporary employees primarily during the peak Back-to-School and Holiday seasons.

To remain competitive in the apparel retail industry we must attract, develop and retain skilled employees, including executives. Competition for such personnel is intense. Our success is dependent to a significant
degree on the continued contributions of key employees. The inability to develop effective plans to motivate, develop and retain key personnel could lead to unexpected loss of personnel and could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations. Also see the section entitled “Certain Additional Business Risk Factors – We must successfully gauge fashion trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed” below in this Item 1.

Trademarks and Service Marks

Gap, GapKids, babyGap, GapBody, Banana Republic and Old Navy trademarks and
service marks, and certain other trademarks, have been registered, or are the subject of pending trademark applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with the registries of many foreign countries and/or are protected by
common law.

Certain Additional Business Risk Factors

We must successfully gauge fashion trends and changing consumer
preferences to succeed.

Our success is largely dependent
upon our ability to gauge the fashion tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner. The global specialty retail business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences dictated, in
part, by fashion and season. To the extent we misjudge the market for our merchandise or the products suitable for local markets, our sales will be adversely affected and the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely
affect our operating results. In prior years, a disproportionate part of our past product offerings may have been too fashion-forward for our broad and diverse customer base. While we believe our current strategies and initiatives appropriately
address these issues, merchandise misjudgments could have a material adverse effect on our image with our customers and on our operating results.

Our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing fashion trends depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in our
design, merchandising, marketing and other functions. Competition for this personnel is intense, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods. Also see the section
entitled “Employees” above in this Item 1.


Fluctuations in the global specialty retail business especially affect the inventory owned by apparel
retailers, since merchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the season and frequently before fashion trends are evidenced by customer purchases. In addition, the cyclical nature of the global specialty retail business requires us to
carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to peak selling seasons when we build up our inventory levels. We must enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season.
As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. In the past, we have not always predicted our customers’ preferences and acceptance levels of our fashion items with
accuracy. In addition, lead times for many of our purchases are long, which may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing fashion trends or consumer acceptance for our products. If sales do not meet expectations, too much
inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower than planned margins. Also see the section entitled “We experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales and margins” below in this Item 1.

Our business is highly competitive and depends on consumer spending
patterns.

The global specialty retail industry is highly
competitive. We compete with national and local department stores, specialty and discount store chains, independent retail stores and internet businesses that market similar lines of merchandise. We face a variety of competitive challenges
including:

•

anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands;

•

maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to consumers in several diverse market segments;

•

developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors and styles that appeal to consumers of varying age groups and tastes;

•

sourcing merchandise efficiently;

•

competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value; and

•

providing strong and effective marketing support.

Our business is sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending, including political and economic conditions such as
recessionary environments, the levels of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates and consumer confidence. Declines in consumer spending on apparel and accessories could have an adverse effect on our operating results.

We are also faced with competition in European, Japanese and Canadian
markets from established regional and national chains. Our success in these markets depends on determining a sustainable profit formula to build brand loyalty and gain market share in these especially challenging retail environments. If
international business is not successful or if we cannot effectively take advantage of international growth opportunities, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

The market for prime real estate is competitive.

Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new stores depends upon the availability of real estate that meets our
criteria and our ability to negotiate terms that meet our financial targets. In addition, we must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases. Failure to secure real estate locations adequate to meet annual targets as well as effectively
manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

We experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales and margins.

Our continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to further improve sales, as well as both gross margins
and operating margins. Our comparable store sales have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual, quarterly and monthly basis, and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future. For example,


over the past three years, our quarterly comparable store sales have ranged from a decrease of 17% in the first fiscal
quarter of fiscal 2002 to an increase of 12% in the first fiscal quarter of 2003 to a decrease of 3% in the last fiscal quarter of 2004. A variety of factors affect comparable store sales, including fashion trends, competition, current economic
conditions, the timing of release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable store sales results to differ materially
from prior periods and from expectations. Over the past five years our reported gross margins have ranged from 37% in fiscal 2000 to 30% in fiscal 2001 to 34% in fiscal 2002 to 38% in fiscal 2003 to 39% in fiscal 2004. In addition, over the past
five years our reported operating margins, have ranged from 10.1% in fiscal 2000 to 2.2% in fiscal 2001 to 7.0% in fiscal 2002 to 11.9% in fiscal 2003 to 12.2% in fiscal 2004.

Our ability to deliver healthy comparable store sales results and margins depends in large part on accurately forecasting
demand and fashion trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base, managing inventory effectively, using more effective pricing strategies, and optimizing store
performance by closing under performing stores. Any failure to meet the expectations of investors, security analysts or credit rating agencies in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our common stock and cause our credit
ratings to decline.

Changes in our credit ratings may have
a negative or positive impact on our financing costs and structure in future periods.

In November 2001, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of debt securities of which only $138 million remains outstanding at an original annual interest rate of 8.80 %, due December 15, 2008 (the
“notes”). The interest rate payable on the notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if either Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) or Standard & Poor’s Rating Service (“Standard &
Poor’s”) reduces the rating ascribed to the notes below Baa2, in the case of Moody’s, or below BBB+, in the case of Standard & Poor’s. The interest rate on the notes increases by 0.25 % for each rating category downgrade by
either rating agency. In addition, if Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s subsequently increases the rating ascribed to the notes, the ongoing interest rate then payable on the notes decreases by 0.25% for each rating category upgrade by
either rating agency up to Baa2, in the case of Moody’s, or BBB+, in the case of Standard & Poor’s. In no event will the interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate payable on the notes. As a result of downgrades to our
long-term credit ratings, the interest rate payable by us on the notes increased to 10.05% per annum as of January 29, 2005. On February 10, 2005, Standard & Poor’s upgraded our long term credit rating which will decrease the interest rate
payable on the notes to 9.80% effective June 15, 2005. Given our current credit ratings, we do not have meaningful access to the commercial paper market. Any future reduction in our long-term senior unsecured credit rating could result in reduced
access to the capital markets and higher interest costs on future financings.

For further information on our credit rating including outlook see the section entitled “Credit Facility and Debt” in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations included as Part II, Item 7 of this form by reference to page 31 our 2004 Annual Report to Shareholders.

Trade matters and IT systems changes may disrupt our supply chain.

We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in
the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. and other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type or effect of any such restrictions. Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes,
safeguards and customs restrictions, against apparel items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us and adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Although the quota system established by the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing was completely phased out for World Trade Organization countries effective January 1, 2005, there can be no assurances that
restrictions will not be reestablished for certain categories in specific countries. We are unable to determine the impact of the changes to the quota system on our global sourcing operations, including China. Our sourcing operations may be
adversely affected by trade limits or political and financial instability resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries, significant fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, restrictions on the transfer
of funds and/or other trade disruptions.


Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to source and distribute merchandise efficiently. We
continue to evaluate and are currently implementing modifications and upgrades to our information technology systems supporting the product pipeline, including merchandise planning and forecasting, inventory and price management. Modifications
involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems or making changes to legacy systems. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing and changing these core systems, including accurately capturing data and possibly encountering
supply chain disruptions, and believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks through testing, training and staging implementation as well as securing appropriate commercial contracts with third-party vendors supplying such
replacement technologies. The launch of these successor systems will take place in a phased approach over an approximate five-year period that began in 2002. Although we are on track with the replacement of our systems, there can be no assurances
that we will successfully launch these new systems as planned or that they will occur without supply chain or other disruptions. Supply chain disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our
operations.

We are implementing certain other changes to
our IT systems that may disrupt operations.

In addition
to modifying and replacing our systems related to sourcing and distributing merchandise, we continue to evaluate and are currently implementing modifications and upgrades to our information technology systems for point of sales (cash registers),
real estate, and human resources. Modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these
systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions, and believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks through testing, training and staging implementation as well as securing appropriate commercial contracts with
third-party vendors supplying such replacement technologies. The launch of these successor systems will take place in a phased approach over an approximate five year period that began in 2002. In 2004 we completed installation of our new point of
sales system in all of our domestic stores, implemented our global financial systems, and replaced our lease management systems. Although we are on track with replacement of our systems, there can be no assurances that we will successfully launch
the remaining systems as planned or that they will occur without disruptions to operations. Information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

Our growth is dependent on strategy development.

Our ability to grow our existing brands and develop or
identify new growth opportunities depends in part on our ability to appropriately identify, develop and effectively execute strategies and initiatives. Failure to effectively identify, develop and execute strategies and initiatives may lead to
increased operating costs without offsetting benefits and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Item 2 – Properties

We operate stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Japan. The stores operated as of January 29, 2005 aggregated approximately 36.6 million square feet. Almost all our stores are leased either on a short term
basis with one or more options after our initial term, or slightly longer terms with negotiated sales termination clauses at predetermined sales thresholds. Economic terms vary by type of location.

We own approximately 1.2 million square feet of headquarters office space
located in San Francisco, San Bruno and Rocklin, California. We lease approximately 1.5 million square feet of headquarters office space, located in San Francisco, San Bruno and Rocklin, California; New York, New York; and Albuquerque, New Mexico.
Of the 1.5 million square feet of office space leased, approximately 130,000 square feet is under sublease to others and approximately 450,000 square feet is being marketed for sublease to others. We also lease approximately 25 domestic regional
offices and approximately 35 international offices. We own approximately 9.5 million square feet of distribution space located in Fresno, California; Edgewood, Maryland; Fishkill, New York; Groveport, Ohio; Gallatin, Tennessee; Brampton, Ontario,
Canada; and Rugby, England. We recently announced that we will be closing our Edgewood, Maryland facility and consolidating its operations into several of our other facilities in the summer of 2005. We lease approximately 1.7 million square feet of

property, customer, and labor and employment related claims, including class action lawsuits in which plaintiffs allege that we violated federal and state wage and hour and other laws. The plaintiffs in some Actions seek unspecified damages or
injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages, and some are covered in part by insurance.


We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of Actions brought against us. Accordingly, adverse
developments, settlements or resolutions may occur and negatively impact earnings in the quarter of such development, settlement or resolution. However, we do not believe that the outcome of any current Action would have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations, liquidity or financial position taken as a whole.

Not applicable.

Item 9A – Controls and
Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures

Management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this review, the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January 29, 2005.

As part of these disclosure controls and procedures, we review the appropriateness of our accounting policies. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004,
we initiated a reassessment of our policy related to the accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases. We determined that our policy should be corrected to recognize minimum rent payments on a straight-line basis beginning with the
time we take possession of the premises, instead of the previous policy of using the store opening date. The previously reported financial statements included in this Form 10-K have been restated to reflect this correction.

During fiscal 2003, we also reassessed our accounting policy that classified
a portion of our lease incentives as a reduction of leasehold improvements. Effective February 1, 2004, we prospectively changed our accounting policy to treat lease incentives received as deferred lease incentives. The controls related to the
application of this new policy were evaluated and deemed to be operating effectively as of January 29, 2005. We corrected the prior year financial statements in conjunction with the restatement.

Management’s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our system of internal control is evaluated on a cost benefit basis and is designed to provide reasonable, not absolute assurance
that reported financial information is materially accurate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”). Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of January 29, 2005.

In reaching
its conclusion that the internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 29, 2005, management carefully considered the facts and circumstances surrounding the restatement of the Company’s previously issued financial
statements.

During fiscal 2003, we reassessed our accounting
policy that classified a portion of our lease incentives as a reduction of leasehold improvements. Effective February 1, 2004, we prospectively changed our accounting policy


to treat lease incentives received as deferred lease incentives. The controls related to the application of this new
policy were evaluated and deemed to be operating effectively as of January 29, 2005. We corrected the prior year financial statements in conjunction with the restatement.

A control deficiency in monitoring compliance with generally accepted accounting principles in the area of accounting for
operating leases with scheduled rent increases was detected during our assessment process that resulted in cumulative, non-cash adjustments that would have been material to the financial performance of fiscal 2004. As a result, management decided to
restate previously issued financial statements to provide transparency as to the effect of the correction on the prior period results, and enhance the comparability of the prior financial information.

The impact of this correction on the periods subject to restatement was
immaterial. Substantially all of the adjustment related to periods prior to 2002, and the correcting cumulative adjustment was also immaterial to shareholders’ equity as of February 2, 2002. As a result, management concluded that this control
deficiency was not a material weakness.

Management’s
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2005 was audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is incorporated herein by
reference to page 40 of the 2004 Annual Report to Shareholders included as Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During fiscal 2004, the Company initiated a company-wide implementation of a new integrated financial application software system. As of January 29, 2005,
substantially all of the Company’s businesses were using the new system. Management believes the new system represents an improvement to the internal control environment. The new system was subject to review during its implementation phase, and
audit and validation during the controls self assessment process. As a result of these evaluations, it was concluded that the design and effectiveness of the controls over the new system was functioning effectively.

Other than the above, there were no changes in the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting during the Company’s fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 that has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
