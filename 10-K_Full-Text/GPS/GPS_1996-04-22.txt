	PART I

Item 1 - BUSINESS

General

	The Gap, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the "Company") is an 
international specialty retailer which operates stores selling casual apparel, 
shoes and other accessories for men, women and children under a number of trade 
names, including: Gap, GapKids, babyGap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy Clothing 
Co.  The Company was incorporated in the State of California in July 1969 and 
was reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in May 1988.  On 
March 25, 1996, the Company operated 1,701 stores, including 907 Gap, 444 
GapKids, 211 Banana Republic, and 139 Old Navy Clothing Co. stores (55 of the 
Gap and GapKids stores are located in the United Kingdom, 95 in Canada, 12 in 
France, 6 in Japan and 2 in Germany; 5 of the Banana Republic stores are 
located in Canada).  

	Virtually all of the Company's merchandise is private label.  The Gap 
stores offer casual clothing for men and women.  GapKids was introduced in 1986 
to provide well-designed, comfortable clothing for boys and girls ages 2-12.  
The babyGap line, offering mostly natural fiber clothing for infants and 
toddlers, was added in 1990 and is sold in all GapKids stores.  Banana Republic 
offers classic, casual fashions for men and women.  Old Navy Clothing Co. was 
introduced in 1993 and offers casual basic and fashion clothing and various 
accessories and gift items for men, women and children at lower price points.  

Recent Developments

	During fiscal 1995, the Company's efforts emphasized the development of 
its two newest growth vehicles: Old Navy Clothing Co. and the International 
division.  It is anticipated that this emphasis will continue in fiscal 1996.

	Old Navy Clothing Co., whose stores average 15,300 square feet, 
experienced a rapid expansion during fiscal 1995 (from 59 stores at the 
beginning of the period to 131 at the end), accounting for about 18% of the 
Company's total store space.  This rapid rate of expansion has involved 
infrastructure and new-store opening expenses.  Although Old Navy Clothing Co. 
is profitable even in its second year of operations, the risk remains that this 
rapid rate of expansion could adversely impact profitability.  In addition, the 
discount-store segment in which Old Navy operates is subject to particularly 
intense competitive pressures.  Old Navy competes with a wide variety of 
regional and national discount stores, many of whom are larger and have 
significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than Old Navy.  

	The Company's International division also experienced accelerated growth 
in fiscal 1995, notably opening Gap and GapKids stores in two new markets, 
Japan and Germany.  The Company has very limited or no operating history in 
these markets and is faced with competition from established regional and 
national chains.  Operations in international markets such as Germany and Japan 
involve special risks. If such expansion is not successful, the Company's 
results of operations could be adversely affected.

Merchandise Inventory, Replenishment and Distribution

	The retail apparel business fluctuates according to changes in customer 
preferences dictated in part by fashion and season.  These fluctuations 
especially affect the inventory owned by apparel retailers, since merchandise 
usually must be ordered well in advance of the season and sometimes before 
fashion trends are evidenced by customer purchases.  The Company is also 
vulnerable to changing fashion trends.  In addition, the cyclical nature of the 
retail business requires the Company to carry a significant amount of 
inventory, especially prior to peak selling seasons when the Company and other 
retailers generally build up their inventory levels.  The Company must enter 
into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of apparel well in advance of 
the applicable selling season.  As a result, the Company is vulnerable to 
demand and pricing shifts and to errors in selection and timing of merchandise 
purchases.

	The Company reviews its inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving 
merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient 
range of sizes) and may use markdowns to clear merchandise.  Markdowns may be 
used if inventory exceeds customer demand for reasons of style, seasonal 
adaptation, changes in customer preference, lack of consumer acceptance of 
fashion items, or if it is determined that the inventory in stock will not sell 
at its currently marked price.  Such markdowns may have an adverse impact on 
earnings, depending on their extent and the amount of inventory affected.  

	Because the Company does not carry much replenishment inventory in its 
stores, replenishment inventory is maintained in the Company's distribution 
centers in California, Kentucky, Maryland and Canada and in a distribution 
center owned and operated by a third party in the United Kingdom, and then 
shipped to the stores.  

Store Operations and Expansion

	The Company's stores offer a shopper-friendly environment with a select 
assortment of casual clothing and accessories which emphasize style, quality 
and good value. The range of apparel displayed in each store varies 
significantly depending on the selling season and the size of the store.

	The Company's stores generally are open seven days per week (where 
permitted by law), three to six nights per week and most holidays.  All sales 
are made for cash, personal checks or on credit cards issued by others.

	The Company opened 225 new stores and expanded 55 stores during the 1995 
fiscal year; the Company anticipates that it will open approximately 175 to 200 
new stores and expand approximately 30 to 40 stores during the 1996 fiscal 
year.  Over the past five years, the Company has increased the average size of 
its new stores and expanded the size of existing stores.  For fiscal year 1995, 
the average size of new stores was about 7,100 square feet for Gap, 4,300 
square feet for GapKids, 7,000 square feet for Banana Republic, and 15,600 
square feet for Old Navy Clothing Co.  Expanded stores are excluded from 
comparable store calculations until they have been open over one year in their 
new size.

	The Company's continued success depends, in part, upon its ability to 
increase sales at existing store locations, to open new stores and to operate 
stores on a profitable basis.  There can be no assurance that the Company's 
growth will result in enhanced profitability or that it will continue at the 
same rate in future years.  In addition, the Company's strategy of expanding 
domestically through new concepts (such as Old Navy Clothing Co.) and new 
product lines (such as personal care items), and internationally in countries 
in which the Company has no, or limited, operating history could result in 
reduced profitability if such expansion is not successful.  Currently, the 
Company is planning to open 4-6 Gap and GapKids stores in Japan and 2 Gap and 
GapKids stores in Germany during fiscal 1996.

Suppliers

	The Company purchases merchandise from over 1,000 suppliers located 
domestically and overseas.  No supplier accounted for more than 5% of the 
Company's fiscal 1995 purchases.  Of the Company's merchandise sold worldwide 
during fiscal 1995, approximately 31% was produced domestically while the 
remaining 69% was made overseas.  Approximately 14% of the Company's total 
merchandise was from Hong Kong, with the remainder coming from 50 other 
countries.  Any event causing a sudden disruption of imports from Hong Kong, 
including the imposition of additional import restrictions, could have a 
materially adverse effect on the Company's operations.  Substantially all of 
the Company's foreign purchases are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars.  

	The Company cannot predict whether any of the foreign countries in which 
its products currently are manufactured or may be manufactured in the future 
will be subject to trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. government, including 
the likelihood, type or effect of any such restrictions.  Trade restrictions, 
including increased tariffs or quotas, or both, against apparel items could 
increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to the Company and 
adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of 
operations.  In addition, the Company's import operations may be adversely 
affected by political instability resulting in the disruption of trade from 
exporting countries, significant fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar 
against foreign currencies, restrictions on the transfer of funds and/or other 
trade disruptions.

Seasonal Business

	The Company's business follows a seasonal pattern, peaking over a total 
of about 12 weeks during the late summer (late August through September) and 
holiday (Thanksgiving through Christmas) periods.  During fiscal year 1995, 
these periods accounted for approximately 34% of the Company's annual sales.

Competition

	The Company's business is highly competitive.  The Company's stores 
compete with national and local department, specialty and discount store chains 
and independent retail stores which handle similar lines of merchandise.  Some 
competitors have larger sales and assets than the Company.

	Depth of selection in sizes, colors and styles of merchandise, 
merchandise procurement and pricing, ability to anticipate fashion trends and 
customer preferences, inventory control, reputation, quality of merchandise, 
store design and location, advertising and customer service are all important 
factors in competing successfully in the retail industry.  Given the large 
number of companies in the retail industry, the Company cannot estimate the 
number of its competitors or its relative competitive position.

	The performance of the Company in recent years has increased imitation by 
other retailers.  Such imitation has made and will continue to make the retail 
environment in which the Company operates more competitive.  In addition, the 
success of the Company's operations depends upon a number of factors relating 
to consumer spending, including future economic conditions affecting disposable 
consumer income such as employment, business conditions, interest rates and 
taxation.  A decline in consumer spending could adversely affect the Company's 
net sales and profitability. 

Advertising

	The Company's marketing strategy primarily involves advertising in major 
metropolitan newspapers and their Sunday magazines and in major news weeklies, 
with smaller amounts of print advertising in lifestyle and fashion magazines.  
Other advertising media include various outdoor venues, such as bus shelters, 
mass transit posters, billboards, telephone kiosks and exterior bus panels, 
including double-decker London buses. 

Employees

	On February 3, 1996, the Company had a work force of approximately 60,000 
employees. Additionally, the Company hires temporary employees during the peak 
late summer and holiday seasons.  The Company considers its employee relations 
to be good.  

Trademarks and Service Marks

	The trademarks and service marks for Gap, GapKids, babyGap, Banana 
Republic and Old Navy Clothing Co., and certain other trademarks either have 
been registered, or have trademark applications pending, with the United States 
Patent and Trademark Office and with the registries of many foreign countries.

Item 2 - PROPERTIES

	During fiscal year 1995, the Company opened 225 stores and closed 53.  
The newly-opened stores include 59 Gap stores (including 3 stores in the United 
Kingdom, 8 stores in Canada, 5 stores in France, 2 stores in Japan and 1 store 
in Germany), 68 GapKids stores (including 3 stores in the United Kingdom, 11 
stores in Canada, 4 stores in France, 2 stores in Japan and 1 store in 
Germany), 26 Banana Republic stores (including 5 stores in Canada), and 72 Old 
Navy Clothing Co. stores.  In addition, during fiscal year 1995, the Company 
expanded 55 stores.  The expanded stores include 34 Gap stores, 17 GapKids 
stores (including 1 in the United Kingdom and 2 in Canada), 3 Banana Republic 
stores and 1 Old Navy Clothing Co. store.  The 1,680 stores operating on 
February 3, 1996 aggregated approximately 11.1 million square feet.  The 
Company leases virtually all of its store premises for terms generally ranging 
from 12 to 15 years.  Most leases provide for additional rent based on a 
percentage of store sales above a certain level in addition to or in lieu of 
minimum rentals, as well as for the payment of certain other expenses.  Some 
leases contain cancellation clauses in favor of the Company if specified sales 
levels are not achieved.  In the United States, the Company's stores are 
located in all of the 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas.

	During fiscal year 1996, the Company plans to increase store space by 
approximately 15%, before taking into account store closings.  This increase is 
expected to include the opening of approximately 175 to 200 new stores 
worldwide and the expansion of approximately 30 to 40 of the Company's existing 
stores.

	The Company leases its headquarters and regional office buildings, as 
well as its Eastern Distribution Center (EDC) and Kentucky Distribution Center 
(KDC).  The EDC/KDC in Erlanger, Kentucky together consist of approximately 
1,220,000 square feet.  They distribute Gap, GapKids, Banana Republic and Old 
Navy merchandise and their lease term runs through February 28, 2003, with 
options to extend the lease for an additional 30 years.  In order to capitalize 
on synergies with the nearby EDC/KDC, the Company has entered into a lease for 
19 acres of land and a 320,000 square foot structure for 
consolidation/deconsolidation purposes in Hebron, Kentucky.  The facility is 
expected to be in operation in the second quarter of fiscal year 1996.

	The Company owns its Canadian Distribution Center located in Brampton, 
Ontario.  It consists of approximately 150,000 square feet and distributes Gap, 
GapKids and Banana Republic merchandise.  The Company also owns its Western 
Distribution Center (WDC) located in Ventura, California.  This facility, which 
is approximately 344,000 square feet, distributes Gap and GapKids merchandise. 
The Company also owns an adjacent five acre parcel for possible future 
expansion.  The Atlantic Distribution Center (ADC), a facility owned by the 
Company in Edgewood, Maryland, covers approximately 745,000 square feet and 
distributes Gap, GapKids and Banana Republic merchandise.  The Company also 
owns 156 adjacent acres, portions of which could be used for potential 
expansion of the ADC.

	During 1995, the Company acquired land in Gallatin, Tennessee and began 
construction on a 640,000 square foot distribution center for an estimated cost 
at completion of approximately $45-55 million.  The Company expects the 
facility to be in operation in late 1996.

	The Company has entered into negotiations to purchase land in Roosendaal, 
Netherlands for the purpose of constructing a distribution center to serve its 
European stores.  The Company expects the facility to be in operation by the 
second quarter of fiscal 1996.

	The Company also owns and operates a data center located on seven acres 
of land in Rocklin, California; it covers approximately 40,000 square feet and 
serves as a corporate computer processing center. 

	In February 1996, the Company exercised an option to purchase a 12-acre 
parcel of land in San Bruno, California to expand its headquarters facilities. 
 Construction is expected to begin in late Spring 1996 for an estimated cost at 
completion of $55-60 million.  The facility is expected to be in operation in 
late 1997.  

Item 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

	The Company is a party to routine litigation incident to its business. 
Some of the lawsuits to which the Company is a party are covered by insurance 
and are being defended by the Company's insurance carriers.  The Company has 
established reserves which management believes are adequate to cover any 
litigation losses which may occur.
