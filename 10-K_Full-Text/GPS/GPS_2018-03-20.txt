THE GAP, INC.


ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K


Part I

Item 1. Business.

General

The Gap, Inc. (Gap Inc., the “Company,” “we,” and “our”) was incorporated in the State of California in July 1969 and was reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in May 1988.

Gap Inc. is a leading global apparel retail company. We offer apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, and children under the Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, Athleta, and Intermix brands. Our portfolio of distinct brands across multiple channels and geographies, combined with our size and scale which allows for strategic and advantageous partnerships with our third-party vendors and suppliers throughout the organization, gives us a competitive advantage in the global retail marketplace.

Gap Inc. is an omni-channel retailer, with sales to customers both in stores and online, through Company-operated and franchise stores, websites, and third-party arrangements. Gap Inc. has Company-operated stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Japan, Italy, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico. We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Old Navy, Gap, and Banana Republic stores throughout Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Under these agreements, third parties operate stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. Most of the products sold under our brand names are designed by us and manufactured by independent sources. We also sell products that are designed and manufactured by branded third parties, primarily at our Intermix brand.

Gap Inc. is a leader among apparel retailers in using omni-channel capabilities to bridge the digital world and physical stores, creating world-class shopping experiences regardless of where or how our customers shop. The Company's suite of omni-channel services, including order-in-store, reserve-in-store, find-in-store, and ship-from-store, as well as enhanced mobile experiences, are uniquely tailored across its portfolio of brands.

Old Navy.

Old Navy is a global apparel and accessories brand that believes in the democracy of style, making high quality, must-have fashion essentials for the whole family, while delivering incredible value and fun, unique store experiences. Old Navy opened its first store in 1994 in the United States and since has expanded its international presence with Company-operated stores in Canada, China, and Mexico, as well as franchise stores in eight countries. Customers can purchase Old Navy products globally in Company-operated and franchise stores and online.

Gap.

Gap is one of the world's most iconic apparel and accessories brands anchored in optimistic, casual, American style. Founded in San Francisco in 1969, the brand's collections continue to build the foundation of modern wardrobes - all things denim, tees, button-downs, and khakis, along with must-have trends.

Gap is designed to build the foundation of modern wardrobes through every stage of life with apparel and accessories for adult men and women under the Gap name, in addition to GapKids, babyGap, GapMaternity, GapBody, and GapFit collections. Beginning in 1987 with the opening of the first store outside North America in London, Gap continues to connect with customers around the world through specialty stores, online, and franchise stores. In addition, we bring the brand to value-conscious customers, with exclusively designed collections for Gap Outlet and Gap Factory stores and websites.

Banana Republic.

Acquired with two stores in 1983 as a travel and adventure outfitter, Banana Republic is now a global apparel and accessories brand focused on delivering versatile, contemporary classics, designed for today with style that endures. Banana Republic offers clothing and accessories with detailed craftsmanship and luxurious materials. Customers can purchase Banana Republic products globally in our specialty stores, online, and franchise stores.


Athleta.

Athleta is a premium fitness and lifestyle brand creating versatile performance apparel to inspire a community of active, confident women and girls. Established in 1998 and acquired by Gap Inc. in 2008, Athleta integrates technical features and innovative design across its women's collection to carry her through a life in motion, from yoga, training and sports, to everyday activities and travel. In 2016, the company launched Athleta Girl, mirroring its signature performance in styles for the next generation. Customers can purchase Athleta products in the United States through its stores and catalogs, or globally through its website.

Athleta has been certified as a benefit corporation ("B Corp"), furthering our commitment to using our business as a force for good to drive social and environmental impact. We have met rigorous standards across social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency. Additionally, we have amended Athleta's legal charter to become a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation in order to further uphold our commitments to people and the planet. With this accreditation, Gap Inc. has become one of the largest publicly traded retail companies with a B Corp certified subsidiary apparel brand. We plan to leverage the learnings from Athleta as a case study for Gap Inc., providing a benchmark and roadmap of potential opportunities for greater social and environmental impact across the enterprise.

Intermix.

Intermix curates must-have styles from the most coveted emerging and established designers. Known for styling on-trend pieces in unexpected ways, Intermix delivers a unique point of view and an individualized approach to shopping and personal style. Customers can shop in stores in the United States and Canada, and online.

The range of merchandise displayed in each store varies depending on the selling season and the size and location of the store. Stores are generally open seven days per week (where permitted by law) and most holidays.

We ended

fiscal 2017

with 3,165 Company-operated stores and


franchise store locations. For more information on the number of stores by brand and region, see the table in included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Form 10-K.

Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta each have a private label credit card program and a co-branded credit card program through which frequent customers receive benefits. Private label and co-branded credit cards are provided by a third-party financing company, with associated revenue sharing arrangements reflected in Gap Inc. operations. We also issue and redeem gift cards through our brands.

Certain financial information about international operations is set forth under the heading "Segment Information" in

Note 16

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K.

Merchandise Vendors

We purchase private label and non-private label merchandise from about 800 vendors. Our vendors have factories in about 50 countries. Our two largest vendors each accounted for about 5 percent of the dollar amount of our total

fiscal 2017

purchases. Of our merchandise purchased during

fiscal 2017

, substantially all purchases, by dollar value, were from factories outside the United States. Approximately 25 percent and 22 percent of our

fiscal 2017

purchases, by dollar value, were from factories in Vietnam and China, respectively. Product cost increases or events causing disruption of imports from Vietnam, China, or other foreign countries, including the imposition of additional import restrictions or taxes, or vendors potentially failing due to political, financial, or regulatory issues, could have an adverse effect on our operations. Substantially all of our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars. Also see the sections entitled “Risk Factors—Our business is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing," "Risk Factors—Risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries, including failure of our vendors to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct, could harm our business,” and “Risk Factors—Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain” in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K.

Seasonal Business

Our business follows a seasonal pattern, with sales peaking during the end-of-year holiday period.


Brand Building

Our ability to develop and evolve our existing brands is a key to our success. We believe our distinct brands are among our most important assets. With the exception of Intermix, virtually all aspects of brand development, from product design and distribution to marketing, merchandising and shopping environments, are controlled by Gap Inc. employees. With respect to Intermix, we control all aspects of brand development except for product design related to third-party products. We continue to invest in our business and enhance the customer experience through significant investments in our supply chain and customer, digital, and omni-channel capabilities, investments in marketing, enhancement of our online shopping sites, remodeling of existing stores, and international expansion.

Trademarks and Service Marks

Gap, GapKids, babyGap, GapMaternity, GapBody, GapFit, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Athleta, Intermix, and Weddington Way trademarks and service marks, and certain other trademarks and service marks, have been registered, or are the subject of pending trademark applications, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with the registries of many foreign countries and/or are protected by common law.

Franchising

We have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Old Navy, Gap, and Banana Republic stores in a number of countries throughout Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. For additional information on risks related to our franchise business, see the sections entitled “Risk Factors—Our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful” and “Risk Factors—Our franchise business is subject to certain risks not directly within our control that could impair the value of our brands” in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K.

Inventory

The nature of the retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we, along with other retailers, generally build up inventory levels. We maintain a large part of our inventory in distribution centers. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes or colors) and we primarily use promotions and markdowns to clear merchandise. Also see the sections entitled “Risk Factors—We must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed,” "Risk Factors—If we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our gross margins could be adversely affected," and "Risk Factors—Our results could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, negative global climate patterns, or other catastrophic events" in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K.

Competitors

The global apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We compete with local, national, and global apparel retailers. Also see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Our business is highly competitive” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Employees

As of

February 3, 2018

, we had a workforce of approximately 135,000 employees, which includes a combination of part-time and full-time employees. We also hire seasonal employees, primarily during the peak holiday selling season.

To remain competitive in the retail apparel industry, we must attract, develop, and retain skilled employees in our design, merchandising, supply chain, marketing, and other functions, as well as in our stores and distribution centers. Competition for such personnel is intense. Our success is dependent to a significant degree on the continued contributions of key employees. Also see the section entitled “Risk Factors—The failure to attract and retain key personnel, or effectively manage succession, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations” in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Our past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance because actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties discussed below. In addition, historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.

We must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed.

Our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our design and purchasing decisions may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing apparel trends or consumer acceptance of our products. The global apparel retail business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences, dictated in part by apparel trends and season. To the extent we misjudge the market for our merchandise or the products suitable for local markets or fail to execute trends and deliver product to market as timely as our competitors, our sales will be adversely affected, and the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely affect our operating results.

Our business is highly competitive.

The global apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We and our franchisees compete with local, national, and global department stores, specialty and discount store chains, independent retail stores, and online businesses that market similar lines of merchandise. We face a variety of competitive challenges in an increasingly complex and fast-paced environment, including:

•

anticipating and quickly responding to changing apparel trends and customer demands;

•

attracting customer traffic both in stores and online;

•

competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value;

•

maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to customers in several diverse market segments and geographic locations;

•

anticipating and responding to changing customer shopping preferences and practices, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement, social media communication, and online shopping;

•

developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to customers of varying age groups and tastes;

•

purchasing and stocking merchandise to match seasonal weather patterns, and our ability to react to shifts in weather that impact consumer demand;

•

sourcing and allocating merchandise efficiently; and

•

improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our processes in order to deliver cost savings to fund growth.

If we or our franchisees are not able to compete successfully in the United States or internationally, our results of operations would be adversely affected.

We must maintain our reputation and brand image.

Our brands have wide recognition, and our success has been due in large part to our ability to maintain, enhance and protect our brand image and reputation and our customers’ connection to our brands. Our continued success depends in part on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. Even if we react appropriately to negative posts or comments about us and/or our brands on social media and online, our customers’ perception of our brand image and our reputation could be negatively impacted. In addition, customer sentiment could be shaped by our sustainability policies and related design, sourcing and operations decisions. Failure to maintain, enhance and protect our brand image could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.


The failure to attract and retain key personnel, or effectively manage succession, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.

Our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing apparel trends depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in our design, merchandising, sourcing, marketing, and other functions. In addition, several of our strategic initiatives, including our technology initiatives and supply chain initiatives, require that we hire and/or develop employees with appropriate experience. Competition for talent is intense, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods. If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate talented employees with the appropriate skill sets, or if changes to our organizational structure, operating results, or business model adversely affect morale or retention, we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor to a key role could have a material adverse effect on our business. In fiscal 2017, there were changes to our senior leadership team, including our new President and Chief Executive Officer of Banana Republic, and our new Executive Vice President and Chief People Officer. In addition, in February 2018, we announced the departure of our President and Chief Executive Officer of Gap brand. The effectiveness of new leaders in these roles, and any further transition as a result of these changes, could have a significant impact on our results of operations.

Our investments in customer, digital, and omni-channel shopping initiatives may not deliver the results we anticipate.

One of our strategic priorities is to further develop an omni-channel shopping experience for our customers through the integration of our store and digital shopping channels. Our omni-channel initiatives include cross-channel logistics optimization and exploring additional ways to develop an omni-channel shopping experience, including further digital integration and customer personalization. These initiatives involve significant investments in IT systems and significant operational changes. In addition, our competitors are also investing in omni-channel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives

.

If the implementation of our customer, digital, and omni-channel initiatives is not successful, or we do not realize the return on our investments in these initiatives that we anticipate, our operating results would be adversely affected.

If we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our gross margins could be adversely affected.

Fluctuations in the global apparel retail markets impact the levels of inventory owned by apparel retailers. The nature of the global apparel retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we build up our inventory levels.

Merchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the season and frequently before apparel trends are confirmed by customer purchases. We must enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. In the past, we have not always predicted our customers’ preferences and acceptance levels of our trend items with accuracy. If sales do not meet expectations, too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower-than-planned margins.

We have key strategic initiatives designed to optimize our inventory levels and increase the efficiency and responsiveness of our supply chain, including vendor fabric platforming, product demand testing, and in-season rapid response to demand. These initiatives involve significant systems and operational changes, and we have limited experience operating in this manner. If we are unable to implement these initiatives successfully, we may not realize the return on our investments that we anticipate, and our operating results could be adversely affected.


We are subject to data and security risks, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and consumer confidence in our security measures.

As part of our normal operations, we receive and maintain confidential, proprietary, and personally identifiable information, including credit card information, and information about our customers, our employees, job applicants, and other third parties. Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of this information. However, despite our safeguards and security processes and protections, security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. The retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. We may not have the resources to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our vendors or customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. In addition, even if we take appropriate measures to safeguard our information security and privacy environment from security breaches, we could still expose our customers and our business to risk. Actual or anticipated attacks may disrupt or impair our technology capabilities, and may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. Measures we implement to protect against cyber attacks may also have the potential to impact our customers’ shopping experience or decrease activity on our websites by making them more difficult to use. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breach by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. In addition, the global regulatory environment surrounding information security, cybersecurity, and privacy is increasingly demanding, with new and changing requirements, such as the European Union's General Protection Regulation (GDPR), and customers have a high expectation that the Company will adequately protect their personal information from cyber-attack or other security breaches. Security breaches and cyber incidents could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of consumer confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.

Failures of, updates or changes to, our IT systems may disrupt operations.

We maintain a complex network of legacy systems. We require continual maintenance, upgrades and changes, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with maintaining and replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and addressing system disruptions and believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks through testing, training, and staging implementation, as well as ensuring appropriate commercial contracts are in place with third-party vendors supplying or supporting our IT initiatives. However, there can be no assurances that we will successfully maintain or launch these systems as planned or that they will be implemented without disruptions to our operations. IT system disruptions or failures, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, or failure to successfully implement new or upgraded systems, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.


Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain.

Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States or other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions. For example, the current political landscape has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to future tax and trade regulations. In addition, we face the possibility of anti-dumping or countervailing duties lawsuits from U.S. domestic producers. We are unable to determine the impact of the changes to the quota system or the impact that potential tariff lawsuits could have on our global sourcing operations. Our sourcing operations may be adversely affected by trade limits or political and financial instability, resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries, significant fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and/or other trade disruptions. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Laws and regulations at the local, state, federal, and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that may result from changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape.

Any changes in laws or regulations, the imposition of additional laws or regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts employment and labor, trade, product safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, privacy, operations, or environmental issues, among others, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our business is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing.

Independent third parties manufacture all of our products for us. As a result, we are directly impacted by increases in the cost of those products

.

If we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing vendor, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or that any vendor would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, for any new manufacturing source, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors in our methods, products, quality control standards, and environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could result in lower sales and net income. In addition, certain countries represent a larger portion of our global sourcing. For example, approximately 25 percent and 22 percent of our merchandise, by dollar value, is purchased from factories in Vietnam and China, respectively. Accordingly, any delays in production and added costs in Vietnam or China could have a more significant impact on our results of operations.

Because independent vendors manufacture virtually all of our products outside of our principal sales markets, third parties must transport our products over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with transitioning between vendors, could adversely impact our financial performance. Operating or manufacturing delays, transportation delays, or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as aircraft, which could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, the cost of fuel is a significant component of transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our gross margins.


Global economic conditions and any related impact on consumer spending patterns could adversely impact our results of operations.

The Company’s performance is subject to global economic conditions, as well as their impact on levels of consumer spending worldwide. Some of the factors that may influence consumer spending include high levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, fluctuating interest and foreign currency rates and credit availability, government austerity measures, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty.

Adverse economic changes in any of the regions in which we and our franchisees sell our products could reduce consumer confidence, and thereby could negatively affect earnings and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In challenging and uncertain economic environments, we cannot predict whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen, or what impact, if any, such circumstances could have on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.

Our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful.

Our current strategies include pursuing selective international expansion in a number of countries around the world through a number of channels. This includes our franchisees opening additional stores internationally. We have limited experience operating or franchising in some of these locations. In many of these locations, we face major, established competitors. In addition, in many of these locations, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics, regulatory, and other operating requirements differ dramatically from those in the places where we have more experience. Consumer tastes and trends may differ in many of these locations and, as a result, the sales of our products may not be successful or result in the margins we anticipate. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our operations and financial results could be materially, adversely affected.

Risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries, including failure of our vendors to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct, could harm our business.

We purchase nearly all merchandise from third-party vendors in many different countries, and we require those vendors to adhere to a Code of Vendor Conduct, which includes environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. From time to time, contractors or their subcontractors may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable local laws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to facilitate our compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise into various countries, there can be no assurance that suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more vendors could have a negative impact on our reputation, could subject us to liability, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.


Our franchise business is subject to certain risks not directly within our control that could impair the value of our brands.

We enter into franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores and, in limited circumstances, websites, in many countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores and websites that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. The effect of these arrangements on our business and results of operations is uncertain and will depend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in new markets internationally and our ability to successfully identify appropriate third parties to act as franchisees, distributors, or in a similar capacity. In addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as franchisee financial stability and the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store locations, store openings, and sales. Other risks that may affect these third parties include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, foreign exchange rates, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and political instability. Moreover, while the agreements we have entered into and plan to enter into in the future provide us with certain termination rights, the value of our brands could be impaired to the extent that these third parties do not operate their stores in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.

The market for prime real estate is competitive.

Our ability to effectively obtain real estate - to open new stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices nationally and internationally - depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases. In addition, we may seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition, relocate, or close some of our real estate locations, which in most cases requires a modification of an existing store lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations, successfully modify or exit existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Additionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties within the United States and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and the quality of our decisions to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Our business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and our hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks.

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, operating expenses, profits, assets, and liabilities generated or incurred in foreign currencies as well as inventory purchases in U.S. dollars for our foreign subsidiaries. Although we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in fully offsetting the negative impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally only delay the impact of adverse foreign currency rate movements on our business and financial results.


We experience fluctuations in our comparable sales and margins.

Our success depends in part on our ability to improve sales, in particular at our largest brands. A variety of factors affect comparable sales or margins, including but not limited to apparel trends, competition, current economic conditions, the timing of new merchandise releases and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs, foreign currency fluctuations, industry traffic trends, and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable sales results and margins to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations. Our comparable sales, including the associated comparable online sales, have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual and quarterly basis. Over the past fiscal year, our reported quarterly comparable sales have ranged from a high of positive 5 percent in the fourth quarter of

fiscal 2017

to a low of positive 1 percent in the second quarter of

fiscal 2017

. Over the past five years, our reported gross margins have ranged from a high of 39.0 percent in fiscal 2013 to a low of 36.2 percent in fiscal 2015. In addition, over the past five years, our reported operating margins have ranged from a high of 13.3 percent in fiscal 2013 to a low of 7.7 percent in fiscal 2016.

Our ability to deliver strong comparable sales results and margins depends in large part on accurately forecasting demand and apparel trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base, managing inventory effectively, using effective pricing strategies, and optimizing store performance. Failure to meet the expectations of investors, securities analysts, or credit rating agencies in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our common stock, cause our credit ratings to decline, and impact liquidity.

Changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the capital markets and adversely impact our financial position or our business initiatives.

In April 2011, we issued $

1.25 billion

aggregate principal amount of

5.95

percent notes due

April 2021

. As a result, we have additional costs that include interest payable semi-annually on the notes. In January 2014, we also entered into a

15 billion

Japanese yen, four-year, unsecured term loan which was fully repaid in June 2017.

Our cash flows from operations are the primary source of funds for these debt service payments. In this regard, we have generated annual cash flow from operating activities in excess of $1 billion per year for well over a decade and ended

fiscal 2017

with

$1.8 billion

of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. We are also able to supplement near-term liquidity, if necessary, with our $

500 million

revolving credit facility. We continue to target a cash balance between $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion, which provides not only for our working capital needs, but also a reserve for unexpected business downturns. However, if our cash flows from operating activities decline significantly, we may be required to reprioritize our business initiatives to ensure that we can continue to service or refinance our debt with favorable rates and terms. In addition, any future reduction in our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets and higher interest costs and potentially increased lease or hedging costs.

In May 2016, Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor's Rating Services downgraded their respective credit ratings of us from BBB- negative outlook to BB+ stable outlook. These downgrades, and any future reduction in our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings, could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets, more restrictive covenants in future financial documents and higher interest costs, and potentially increased lease or hedging costs.

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.


Our results could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, negative global climate patterns, or other catastrophic events.

Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, and other adverse weather conditions; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics; political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, labor unrest, and other political instability; negative global climate patterns, especially in water stressed regions; or other catastrophic events, such as fires or other disasters occurring at our distribution centers or our vendors' manufacturing facilities, whether occurring in the United States or internationally, could disrupt our operations, including the operations of our franchisees, or the operations of one or more of our vendors. In particular, these types of events could impact our supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability or the ability of our franchisees or other third parties to operate our stores or websites. In addition, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or, depending upon the severity, globally. Disasters occurring at our vendors

’

manufacturing facilities could impact our reputation and our customers

’

perception of our brands. To the extent any of these events occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.

Reductions in income and cash flow from our credit card arrangement related to our private label and co-branded credit cards could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.

A third-party, Synchrony Financial (“Synchrony”), owns and services our private label credit card and co-branded programs. Our agreement with Synchrony provides for certain payments to be made by Synchrony to us, including a share of revenues from the performance of the credit card portfolios. The income and cash flow that we receive from Synchrony is dependent upon a number of factors, including the level of sales on private label and co-branded accounts, the level of balances carried on the accounts, payment rates on the accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on the accounts, the level of credit losses for the accounts, Synchrony’s ability to extend credit to our customers as well as the cost of customer rewards programs. All of these factors can vary based on changes in federal and state credit card, banking, and commercial protection laws. The factors affecting the income and cash flow that the Company receives from Synchrony can also vary based on a variety of economic, legal, social, and other factors that we cannot control. If the income and cash flow that we receive from our consumer credit card program agreement with Synchrony decreases significantly, our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected

.

We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims from time to time, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

As a multinational company, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims (“Actions”) arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, intellectual property, customer, employment, and data privacy claims, including class action lawsuits. The plaintiffs in some Actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages and some are covered in part by insurance. We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of Actions brought against us. Accordingly, developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement, or resolution. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Fiscal 2017 results also include incremental sales attributable to the 53rd week.


Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Overview

We are a global retailer offering apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, and children under the Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, Athleta, and Intermix brands. We have Company-operated stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Japan, Italy, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico. We have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Old Navy, Gap, and Banana Republic stores throughout Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. Our products are also available to customers online through Company-owned websites and through the use of third parties that provide logistics and fulfillment services. In addition to operating in the specialty, outlet, online, and franchise channels, we also use our omni-channel capabilities to bridge the digital world and physical stores to further enhance our shopping experience for our customers. Our omni-channel services, including order-in-store, reserve-in-store, find-in-store, and ship-from-store, as well as enhanced mobile experiences, are tailored uniquely across our portfolio of brands. Most of the products sold under our brand names are designed by us and manufactured by independent sources. We also sell products that are designed and manufactured by branded third parties, primarily at our Intermix brand.

We identify our operating segments according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated. As of

February 3, 2018

, our operating segments included Gap Global, Old Navy Global, Banana Republic Global, Athleta, and Intermix. We have determined that each of our operating segments share similar economic and other qualitative characteristics, and therefore the results of our operating segments are aggregated into

one

reportable segment.

Fiscal 2017 consisted of 53 weeks versus 52 weeks in fiscal 2016 and 2015. Net sales and operating results, as well as other metrics derived from the Consolidated Statement of Income, include the impact of the additional week; however, the comparable sales calculation excludes the 53rd week.

On August 29, 2016, a fire occurred in one of the buildings at a Company-owned distribution center campus in Fishkill, New York ("the Fishkill fire"). In January 2018, the Company agreed upon a final settlement with its insurers and all insurance proceeds were received as of February 3, 2018.

In May 2016, we announced measures to better align talent and financial resources against our most important priorities to position the Company for improved business performance and long-term success. Our aim is to capture additional market share in our home market, North America, where we have our largest structural advantages, and to focus on international regions with the greatest potential. As part of this effort, we closed the entire fleet of 53 Old Navy stores in Japan during fiscal 2016. Japan remains an important market for the Company's portfolio, with a continued strong presence of approximately

200 Gap and Banana Republic stores. Including the Old Navy closures in Japan, the Company closed


stores in total related to these measures in fiscal 2016.

We also took steps toward creating a more efficient operating model, enabling us to more fully leverage our scale. For example, we centralized or consolidated several brand and corporate functions, allowing us to simplify the organization and operate more efficiently.

In connection with the decision to close stores and streamline the Company's operations, the Company incurred $197 million in restructuring costs during fiscal 2016 on a pre-tax basis. The charges primarily include lease termination fees, employee-related costs, and store asset impairment. Certain of the costs incurred in foreign subsidiaries did not result in a tax benefit.


Fiscal 2015 results were impacted by a series of strategic actions to position Gap brand for improved business performance in the future, including rightsizing the Gap brand store fleet primarily in North America, streamlining the brand's headquarter workforce, and developing a clear, on-brand product aesthetic framework to strengthen the Gap brand to compete more successfully on the global stage. During fiscal 2015, the Company completed the closure of about 150 Gap global specialty stores related to the strategic actions. During fiscal 2015, the Company incurred $132 million of charges in connection with the strategic actions, primarily consisting of impairment of store assets related to underperforming stores, lease termination fees and lease losses, employee-related expenses, and impairment of inventory that did not meet brand standards.

One of our primary objectives is to continue transforming our product to market process, with the development of a more efficient operating model, allowing us to more fully leverage our scale. To enable this, we have several product, supply chain, and IT initiatives underway. Further, we expect to continue our investment in customer experience to drive higher customer engagement and loyalty across all of our brands and channels, resulting in market share gains. Finally, we will continue to invest in strengthening brand awareness, customer acquisition, and digital capabilities. Underpinning these strategies is a focus on utilizing data, analytics, and technology to respond faster while making decisions that will fuel market share gains and lead to a more nimble organization.

Fiscal 2018 will consist of 52 weeks versus 53 weeks in fiscal 2017.


Results of Operations

Net Sales

See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,

Note 16

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for net sales by brand and region.

Comparable Sales ("Comp Sales")

The percentage change in Comp Sales by global brand and for total Company, as compared with the preceding year, is as follows:

Comp Sales include the results of Company-operated stores and sales through online channels in those countries where we have existing comparable store sales. The calculation of The Gap, Inc. Comp Sales includes the results of Athleta and Intermix but excludes the results of our franchise business.

A store is included in the Comp Sales calculations when it has been open and operated by the Company for at least one year and the selling square footage has not changed by 15 percent or more within the past year. A store is included in the Comp Sales calculations on the first day it has comparable prior year sales. Stores in which the selling square footage has changed by 15 percent or more as a result of a remodel, expansion, or reduction are excluded from the Comp Sales calculations until the first day they have comparable prior year sales.

A store is considered non-comparable (“Non-comp”) when it has been open and operated by the Company for less than one year or has changed its selling square footage by 15 percent or more within the past year.

A store is considered “Closed” if it is temporarily closed for three or more full consecutive days or it is permanently closed. When a temporarily closed store reopens, the store will be placed in the Comp/Non-comp status it was in prior to its closure. If a store was in Closed status for three or more days in the prior year, the store will be in Non-comp status for the same days the following year.

Current year foreign exchange rates are applied to both current year and prior year Comp Sales to achieve a consistent basis for comparison.

Store Count and Square Footage Information

Net sales per average square foot is as follows:

__________

(1)

Excludes net sales associated with our online and franchise businesses. Online sales includes both sales through our online channels as well as ship-from-store sales.

(2)

Fiscal 2017 includes incremental sales attributable to the 53rd week.


Store count, openings, closings, and square footage for our stores are as follows:

Gap and Banana Republic outlet and factory stores are reflected in each of the respective brands.

In

fiscal 2018

, we expect net openings of about


Company-operated store locations, primarily for Old Navy and Athleta, with closures weighted toward Gap brand and Banana Republic

.


Net Sales Discussion

Our net sales for

fiscal 2017

increased

$339 million

, or

2 percent

, compared with

fiscal 2016

, primarily

due to an increase in net sales at Old Navy and Athleta, partially offset by a decrease in net sales at Gap and Banana Republic. The translation of net sales in foreign currencies to U.S. dollars had an unfavorable impact of about $11 million for fiscal 2017 and is calculated by translating net sales for

fiscal 2016

at exchange rates applicable during

fiscal 2017

. Fiscal 2017 includes incremental sales attributable to the 53rd week.

Our net sales for

fiscal 2016

decreased $281 million, or 2 percent, compared with

fiscal 2015

primarily

due to a decrease in net sales at Gap and Banana Republic, partially offset by an increase in net sales at Old Navy and Athleta. The translation of net sales in foreign currencies to U.S. dollars had an unfavorable impact of about $20 million for fiscal 2016 and is calculated by translating net sales for

fiscal 2015

at exchange rates applicable during

fiscal 2016

.

In fiscal 2018, we will return to a 52-week fiscal year which could potentially impact the seasonality of net sales throughout the year as a result of the calendar shift of our fiscal quarters in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.

Cost of Goods Sold and Occupancy Expenses

Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses decreased 2.0 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in

fiscal 2017

compared with

fiscal 2016

.

•

Cost of goods sold decreased 1.3 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in

fiscal 2017

compared with

fiscal 2016

, primarily driven by higher margins achieved as a result of improved average selling price per unit at all global brands; partially offset by higher average unit cost at all global brands. This was offset by a negative foreign exchange impact for our foreign subsidiaries as our merchandise purchases are primarily in U.S. dollars.

•

Occupancy expenses decreased 0.7 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in

fiscal 2017

compared with

fiscal 2016

, primarily driven by an increase in online sales without a corresponding increase in occupancy expenses, international store closures, and higher sales from the impact of the 53rd week; partially offset by real estate expenses for the Times Square New York location for Gap and Old Navy.

Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses decreased 0.1 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in

fiscal 2016

compared with

fiscal 2015

.

•

Cost of goods sold decreased 0.3 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, primarily driven by higher selling at regular prices at all global brands and improved product acceptance resulting in improved margins at Old Navy. This was offset by a negative foreign exchange impact for our foreign subsidiaries as our merchandise purchases are primarily in U.S. dollars.

•

Occupancy expenses increased 0.2 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, primarily driven by the decrease in net sales without a corresponding decrease in occupancy expenses.

In

fiscal 2018

, we currently expect that gross margins for our foreign subsidiaries, net of the impact from our merchandise hedge program, will be slightly favorable due to the appreciation of certain foreign currencies as our merchandise purchases are primarily in U.S. dollars.


Operating Expenses and Operating Margin

Operating expenses increased

$138 million

or

0.2

percentage points as a percentage of net sales in

fiscal 2017

compared with

fiscal 2016

primarily due to the following:

•

an increase in variable costs, such as payroll-related costs, due to the growth in Old Navy and Athleta brands, increase in bonus expense, and the 53rd week impact;

•

an increase in advertising; and

•

an increase in overhead costs related to productivity work including investments in customer and digital initiatives as well as severance expenses and the impacts of store closures; partially offset by

•

a gain from insurance proceeds of $64 million related to the Fishkill fire recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017;

•

a decrease of $197 million of restructuring costs incurred in fiscal year 2016; and

•

a decrease of $71 million related to a goodwill impairment charges for Intermix in fiscal year 2016.

Operating expenses increased $253 million or 2.1 percentage points as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 primarily due to the following:

•

restructuring costs of $197 million in fiscal 2016 compared with the costs related to strategic actions of $98 million in fiscal 2015;

•

store asset impairment charges of $53 million unrelated to restructuring activities in fiscal 2016 compared with store asset impairment charges of $16 million unrelated to the strategic actions in fiscal 2015;

•

a goodwill impairment charge related to Intermix in fiscal 2016 of $71 million; and

•

an increase in bonus and marketing expense; partially offset by

•

a gain from insurance proceeds of $73 million related to the Fishkill fire, representing the excess over the loss on inventory; and

•

higher income from revenue sharing payments from Synchrony.

Interest Expense

Interest expense for fiscal 2017 and 2016 primarily includes interest on overall borrowings and obligations mainly related to our

$1.25 billion

long-term debt.

Interest expense for fiscal 2015 includes $74 million of interest on overall borrowings and obligations mainly related to our $1.25 billion long-term debt, offset by a reversal of $15 million of interest expense primarily resulting from a favorable foreign tax ruling and actions of foreign tax authorities related to transfer pricing matters in fiscal 2015.


Income Taxes

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) was enacted into law, which significantly changes existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business, such as imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income, reducing the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, and adopting a territorial tax system. The TCJA resulted in a one-time transition tax, payable over eight years without interest or penalties, on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for income held in foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income. The TCJA also reduces the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, which resulted in a remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

We have calculated a reasonable estimate of the impact of the TCJA in our income tax provision in accordance with our understanding of guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result have recorded $57 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted.

The increase in the effective tax rate for

fiscal 2017

compared with

fiscal 2016

was primarily due to the impact of the TCJA, partially offset by the recognition of certain tax benefits associated with legal structure changes.

The increase in the effective tax rate for

fiscal 2016

compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the impact of restructuring costs incurred in certain foreign subsidiaries for which the Company was not able to recognize any tax benefit and the impact of a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge related to Intermix. The increase was partially offset by the recognition of certain foreign tax benefits associated with a legal structure realignment.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our largest source of cash flows is cash collections from the sale of our merchandise. Our primary uses of cash include merchandise inventory purchases, occupancy costs, personnel-related expenses, purchases of property and equipment, and payment of taxes. In addition, we may have dividend payments, debt repayments, and share repurchases.

We consider the following to be measures of our liquidity and capital resources:

As of

February 3, 2018

, the majority of our cash and cash equivalents was held in the United States and is generally accessible without any limitations.

In October 2015, the Company entered into a $400 million unsecured term loan (the "Term Loan"), which was fully repaid in January 2017.

In January 2014, the Company entered into a

15 billion

Japanese yen,

four

-year, unsecured term loan ("Japan Term Loan"), which was fully repaid in June 2017.


We believe that current cash balances and cash flows from our operations will be sufficient to support our business operations, including growth initiatives, planned capital expenditures, and repayment of debt, for the next 12 months and beyond. We are also able to supplement near-term liquidity, if necessary, with our

$500 million

revolving credit facility or other available market instruments.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities during

fiscal 2017

decreased $339 million compared with

fiscal 2016

, primarily due to the following:

Net income

•

an increase of $172 million in net income.

Non-cash items

•

a decrease of $79 million in store asset impairment charges in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 in part due to restructuring activities in fiscal 2016; and

•

a decrease of $71 million due to a goodwill impairment charge related to Intermix during fiscal 2016.

Changes in operating assets and liabilities

•

a decrease of $236 million related to accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments;

•

a decrease of $188 million related to merchandise inventory primarily due to the volume and timing of receipts; and

•

a decrease of $71 million related to income taxes payable, net of prepaid and other tax-related items, primarily due to the timing of tax payments, partially offset by an increase in estimated current expense in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016; partially offset by

•

an increase of $115 million related to the recognition of deferred tax expense in fiscal 2017 compared with deferred tax benefit in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the deferred tax impact of federal tax reform and favorable current year temporary differences.

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2016 increased $125 million compared with fiscal 2015, primarily due to the following:

Net income

•

a decrease of $244 million in net income.

Non-cash items

•

an increase of $246 million related to non-cash and other items primarily due to the lower gain reclassified into income related to our derivative financial instruments in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, a goodwill impairment charge related to Intermix of $71 million during fiscal 2016, and an increase of $53 million related to store asset impairment; partially offset by

•

a decrease of $155 million related to deferred income taxes driven by fluctuations in book versus tax temporary differences for bonus accruals, depreciation, and share-based compensation.

Changes in operating assets and liabilities

•

an increase of $193 million related to accounts payable primarily due to the timing of merchandise and lease payments;

•

an increase of $117 million related to accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily due to bonus accruals; and

•

an increase of $52 million related to merchandise inventory primarily due to the volume and timing of receipts; partially offset by

•

a decrease of $79 million related to other current assets and other long-term assets in part due to the insurance claim receivable from the Fishkill fire.

We fund inventory expenditures during normal and peak periods through cash flows from operating activities and available cash. Our business follows a seasonal pattern, with sales peaking during the end-of-year holiday period. The seasonality of our operations, combined with the calendar shift of weeks in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 as a result of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017, may lead to significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts between fiscal year-end and subsequent interim periods.


Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Net cash used for investing activities during

fiscal 2017

increased $139 million compared with

fiscal 2016

, primarily due to the following:

•

$207 million increase for purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 primarily related to the rebuilding of the Company's Fishkill, New York distribution center campus; partially offset by

•

$66 million related to insurance proceeds allocated to loss on property and equipment in fiscal 2017 primarily related to the Fishkill fire compared with no insurance proceeds allocated to loss on property and equipment in fiscal 2016.

Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2016 decreased $201 million compared with fiscal 2015, primarily due to less property and equipment purchases.

In

fiscal 2017

, cash used for purchases of property and equipment was $

731 million

primarily related to investments in stores, information technology, and supply chain, including costs associated with the rebuilding of the company's Fishkill, New York distribution center campus.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Net cash used for financing activities during

fiscal 2017

decreased $46 million compared with

fiscal 2016

, primarily due to the following:

•

$67 million related to the final repayment of the Japan term loan in full in June 2017 compared with a $421 million payment of debt in fiscal 2016; partially offset by

•

$315 million of cash used for repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2017 compared with no repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2016.

Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2016 decreased $213 million compared with fiscal 2015, primarily due to the following:

•

no repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2016 compared with $1 billion cash outflow related to repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2015; partially offset by

•

no debt issuances in fiscal 2016 compared with the issuance of $400 million in debt in fiscal 2015; and

•

the repayment of $400 million in debt in fiscal 2016.

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe free cash flow is an important metric because it represents a measure of how much cash a company has available for discretionary and non-discretionary items after the deduction of capital expenditures as we require regular capital expenditures to build and maintain stores and purchase new equipment to improve our business. We use this metric internally, as we believe our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an important driver of value creation. However, this non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to supersede or replace our GAAP result. Free cash flow for fiscal 2017 is further adjusted for insurance proceeds allocated to loss on property and equipment, as our cash used for purchases of property and equipment for fiscal 2017 includes certain capital expenditures related to the rebuilding of the Company-owned distribution center which was impacted by the Fishkill fire.

The following table reconciles free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, from net cash provided by operating activities, a GAAP financial measure.

Debt and Credit Facilities

Certain financial information about the Company's debt and credit facilities is set forth under the headings "Debt" and "Credit Facilities" in

Notes 4 and 5

, respectively, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K.


Dividend Policy

In determining whether and at what level to declare a dividend, we consider a number of factors including sustainability, operating performance, liquidity, and market conditions.

We paid an annual dividend of $0.92 per share in

fiscal 2017

and

fiscal 2016

. We intend to increase our annual dividend to $0.97 per share in

fiscal 2018

.

Share Repurchases

Certain financial information about the Company's share repurchases is set forth under the heading "Share Repurchases" in

Note 8

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K.

Contractual Cash Obligations

We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. The following table provides summary information concerning our future contractual obligations as of

February 3, 2018

. These obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

February 3, 2018

, while others are disclosed as future obligations.

__________

(1)

Represents principal maturities, excluding interest. See

Note 4

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion on debt.

(2)

Excludes maintenance, insurance, taxes, and contingent rent obligations. See

Note 11

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our operating leases.

(3)

Represents estimated open purchase orders to purchase inventory as well as commitments for products and services used in the normal course of business.

There is $138 million of long-term liabilities recorded in lease incentives and other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

February 3, 2018

that is excluded from the table above as the amount relates to uncertain tax positions and deferred compensation, and we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time.

Commercial Commitments

We have commercial commitments, not reflected in the table above, that were incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations, including standby letters of credit of

$15 million

, surety bonds of

$43 million

, and bank guarantees of

$22 million

outstanding (of which

$17 million

was issued under the unsecured revolving credit facilities for our operations in foreign locations) as of

February 3, 2018

.

Other Cash Obligations Not Reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet (Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements)

The majority of our contractual obligations relate to operating leases for our stores. Future minimum lease payments represent commitments under non-cancelable operating leases and are disclosed in the table above with additional information provided under the heading "Leases" in

Note 11

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K.


Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large, global corporation. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information.

Our significant accounting policies can be found under the heading "Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in

Note 1

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K. The policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, which has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Merchandise Inventory

We value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value (“LCNRV”), with cost determined using the weighted-average cost method. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes or colors), and we primarily use promotions and markdowns to clear merchandise. We record an adjustment to inventory when future estimated selling price is less than cost. Our LCNRV adjustment calculation requires management to make assumptions to estimate the selling price and amount of slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments subject to markdowns, which is dependent upon factors such as historical trends with similar merchandise, inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand, and the promotional environment. In addition, we estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date. Our shortage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends. Historically, actual shortage has not differed materially from our estimates.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our LCNRV or inventory shortage adjustments. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or actual physical inventory shortage differs significantly from our estimate, our operating results could be affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to calculate our LCNRV or inventory shortage adjustments in the past three fiscal years.


Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill, and Intangible Assets

We review the carrying amount of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include a significant decrease in the operating performance of the long-lived asset, or the decision to close a store, corporate facility, or distribution center. Long-lived assets are considered impaired if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group. For impaired assets, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or asset group and its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of the asset or asset group is based on estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group using a discount rate commensurate with the related risk. The asset group is defined as the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available and largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. The asset group for our retail stores is reviewed for impairment primarily at the store level. Our estimate of future cash flows requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses and estimating useful lives of the assets. These estimates can be affected by factors such as future store results, real estate demand, and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. We have not made any material changes in the methodology to assess and calculate impairment of long-lived assets in the past three fiscal years. We recorded a charge for the impairment of long-lived assets of

$28 million

,

$107 million

, and

$54 million

for

fiscal 2017

,


, and


, respectively, related to store assets, which is recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

We also review the carrying amount of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include significant changes in the business climate, declines in our operating results, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

We early adopted ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The amendments simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill impairment by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Under the ASU, the impairment test is simply the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, with the impairment charge being the deficit in fair value but not exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The simplified one-step impairment test applies to all reporting units (including those with zero or negative carrying amounts).

In connection with the acquisitions of Athleta in September 2008 and Intermix in December 2012, we recorded $99 million and

$81 million

of goodwill. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment using the applicable reporting unit, which is an operating segment or a business unit one level below that operating segment for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. We have deemed Athleta and Intermix to be the reporting units at which goodwill is tested for Athleta and Intermix, respectively. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and we did not recognize any impairment charges. We determined that the respective fair value of goodwill attributed to Athleta and Intermix significantly exceeded their respective carrying amount as of the date of our annual impairment review.


In fiscal 2016, the Company performed the goodwill impairment test under the previous FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other as the annual impairment test was performed prior to January 1, 2017. At the end of each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, given the information available at the time of those assessments, we determined that there were no events or circumstances that indicated any impairment for goodwill related to Intermix. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, management updated the fiscal 2017 budget and financial projections beyond fiscal 2017 for Intermix. There were several factors that caused the financial projections and estimates to significantly decrease from the previous estimates, which included: poor fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 holiday performance at Intermix stores, the decision to reduce expected future store openings, the approval of additional store closures in fiscal 2017, and the budgeting of additional headcount required to support increased focus on the online business. These factors arising during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 had a significant and negative impact on the estimated fair value of the Intermix reporting unit, and we determined that the Intermix reporting unit’s carrying value exceeded its fair value as of the date of our annual impairment review. As such, we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test which resulted in an impairment charge of

$71 million

for goodwill related to Intermix in fiscal 2016. This impairment charge reduced the

$81 million

of purchase price allocated to goodwill in connection with the acquisition of Intermix in December 2012 to

$10 million

as of January 28, 2017.

We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in fiscal 2015.

As of

February 3, 2018

, the aggregate carrying value of trade names was $95 million, which primarily consisted of

$54 million

and

$38 million

related to Athleta and Intermix, respectively. A trade name is considered impaired if the carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. If a trade name is considered impaired, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the trade name. The fair value of the trade names is determined using the relief from royalty method. During the fourth quarter of

fiscal 2017

, we completed our annual impairment review of the trade names, and we did not recognize any impairment charges.

These analyses require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses, and selecting appropriate discount rates and royalty rates, which can be affected by economic conditions and other factors that can be difficult to predict.

If actual store and online results and brand performance, real estate market conditions, and economic conditions including interest rates are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in our calculations, we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that could be material.

Revenue Recognition

While revenue recognition for the Company does not involve significant judgment, it represents an important accounting policy. We recognize revenue and the related cost of goods sold at the time the products are received by the customers. For sales transacted at stores, revenue is recognized when the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register. For sales where we ship the merchandise to the customer from a distribution center or store, revenue is recognized at the time we estimate the customer receives the merchandise.

We sell merchandise to franchisees under multi-year franchise agreements. We recognize revenue from sales to franchisees at the time merchandise ownership is transferred to the franchisee, which generally occurs when the merchandise reaches the franchisee’s predesignated turnover point. We also receive royalties from franchisees primarily based on a percentage of the total merchandise purchased by the franchisee, net of any refunds or credits due them. Royalty revenue is recognized primarily when merchandise ownership is transferred to the franchisee.

We record an allowance for estimated returns based on our historical return patterns and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales return allowance. However, if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly, our operating results could be adversely affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate future sales returns in the past three fiscal years.


See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K for recent accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition and expected impact from the adoption of new standards.

Unredeemed Gift Cards, Gift Certificates, and Credit Vouchers

Upon issuance of a gift card, gift certificate, or credit voucher, a liability is established for its cash value. The liability is relieved and net sales are recorded upon redemption by the customer. Over time, some portion of these instruments is not redeemed (“breakage”). Based on historical redemption patterns, we determine breakage income for gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers when we can determine the portion of the liability where redemption is remote, which is three years after issuance. Breakage income, which has been historically immaterial, is recorded in other income which is a component of operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. When breakage income is recorded, a liability is recognized for any legal obligation to remit the unredeemed portion to relevant jurisdictions. Substantially all of our gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers have no expiration dates.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our breakage income. However, if the actual pattern of redemption for gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers changes significantly, our operating results could be adversely affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate breakage in the past three fiscal years. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K for recent accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition and expected impact on recognition of breakage income from the adoption of new standards.

Income Taxes

We record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future income, taxable income, and the mix of income or losses in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may also be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of income or losses, changes in the expected outcome of audits, or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance.

At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits.

We believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.

See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K for the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 on income taxes.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Certain financial information about the Company's derivative financial instruments is set forth under the heading "Derivative Financial Instruments" in

Note 7

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K.

We have performed a sensitivity analysis as of

February 3, 2018

based on a model that measures the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates to U.S. dollars (with all other variables held constant) on our underlying estimated major foreign currency exposures, net of derivative financial instruments. The foreign currency exchange rates used in the model were based on the spot rates in effect as of

February 3, 2018

. The sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have an unfavorable impact on the underlying cash flow, net of our foreign exchange derivative financial instruments, of $40 million as of

February 3, 2018

.

Debt

Certain financial information about the Company's debt is set forth under the heading "Debt" in

Note 4

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K.

Our $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.95 percent notes due April 2021 are not subject to interest rate risk as they have a fixed interest rate.

A final repayment of

7.5 billion

Japanese yen for the 15 billion Japanese yen, four-year, unsecured Japan Term Loan due January 2018 was fully repaid in June 2017.

Cash Equivalents

We have highly liquid fixed and variable income investments classified as cash equivalents, which are placed primarily in time deposits and money market funds. We value these investments at their original purchase prices plus interest that has accrued at the stated rate. The value of our investments is not subject to material interest rate risk. However, changes in interest rates would impact the interest income derived from our investments. We earned interest income of

$19 million

in

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of The Gap, Inc.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Gap, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of

February 3, 2018

and

January 28, 2017

, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the fiscal years ended

February 3, 2018

,

January 28, 2017

and

January 30, 2016

, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

February 3, 2018

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of

February 3, 2018

and

January 28, 2017

, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended

February 3, 2018

,

January 28, 2017

and

January 30, 2016

, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

February 3, 2018

, based on

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.


Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Note 1

. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization

The Gap, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a global omni-channel retailer offering apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, and children under the Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, Athleta, and Intermix brands. We have Company-operated stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Japan, Italy, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico. We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Old Navy, Gap, and Banana Republic stores in approximately 36 other countries around the world. In addition, our products are available to customers online through Company-owned websites and through the use of third parties that provide logistics and fulfillment services.

Principles of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of The Gap, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Fiscal Year and Presentation

Our fiscal year is a 52-week or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. The fiscal year ended February 3, 2018 (fiscal 2017) consisted of 53 weeks. The fiscal years ended

January 28, 2017

(

fiscal 2016

) and

January 30, 2016

(

fiscal 2015

) consisted of 52 weeks.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash includes funds deposited in banks and amounts in transit from banks for customer credit card and debit card transactions that process in less than seven days.

All highly liquid investments with original maturities of 91 days or less are classified as cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents are placed primarily in time deposits and money market funds. We value these investments at their original purchase prices plus interest that has accrued at the stated rate. Income related to these securities is recorded in interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Merchandise Inventory

We value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined using the weighted-average cost method. We record an adjustment when future estimated selling price is less than cost. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes or colors) and use promotions and markdowns to clear merchandise. In addition, we estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as other current assets, other long-term assets, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, or lease incentives and other long-term liabilities.


For derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative financial instruments is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and is recognized in income in the period in which the underlying transaction impacts the income statement. For derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative financial instruments is reported as a component of OCI and is reclassified into income in the period or periods during which the hedged subsidiary is either sold or liquidated (or substantially liquidated). Gains and losses on the derivative financial instruments representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, if any, are recognized in current income. For derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss on the derivative financial instruments is recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Cash flows from derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Property and Equipment

Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Estimated useful lives are as follows:

When assets are sold or retired, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, with any resulting gain or loss recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Costs of maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.

Asset Retirement Obligations

An asset retirement obligation represents a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that is incurred upon the acquisition, construction, development, or normal operation of that long-lived asset. The Company’s asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with leasehold improvements that we are contractually obligated to remove at the end of a lease to comply with the lease agreement. We recognize asset retirement obligations at the inception of a lease with such conditions if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Asset retirement obligations are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and lease incentives and other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are subsequently adjusted for changes in estimated asset retirement obligations. The associated estimated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset and depreciated over its useful life.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized for sales transacted at stores when the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register. For sales where we ship the merchandise to the customer from a distribution center or store, revenue is recognized at the time we estimate the customer receives the product. Amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to customers are recorded in net sales, and the related costs are recorded in cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Revenues are presented net of estimated returns and any taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities. Allowances for estimated returns are recorded based on estimated margin using our historical return patterns.


We sell merchandise to franchisees under multi-year franchise agreements. We recognize revenue from sales to franchisees at the time merchandise ownership is transferred to the franchisee, which generally occurs when the merchandise reaches the franchisee’s predesignated turnover point. These sales are recorded in net sales, and the related cost of goods sold is recorded in cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We also receive royalties from franchisees primarily based on a percentage of the total merchandise purchased by the franchisee, net of any refunds or credits due them. Royalty revenue is recognized primarily when merchandise ownership is transferred to the franchisee and is recorded in net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Classification of Expenses

Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses include the following:

•

the cost of merchandise;

•

inventory shortage and valuation adjustments;

•

freight charges;

•

online shipping and packaging costs;

•

costs associated with our sourcing operations, including payroll, benefits, and other administrative expenses;

•

gains and losses associated with foreign currency derivative contracts related to hedging of merchandise purchases and intercompany revenue transactions; and

•

rent, occupancy, depreciation, and amortization related to our store operations, distribution centers, and certain corporate functions.

Operating expenses include the following:

•

payroll, benefits, and other administrative expenses for our store operations and field management;

•

payroll, benefits, and other administrative expenses for our distribution centers;

•

payroll, benefits, and other administrative expenses for our corporate functions, including product design and development;

•

marketing;

•

information technology maintenance costs and expenses;

•

rent, occupancy, depreciation, and amortization for our corporate facilities;

•

third party credit card processing fees; and

•

other expenses (income).

Payroll, benefits, and other administrative expenses for our distribution centers recorded in operating expenses were

$297 million

,

$254 million

, and

$254 million

in

fiscal 2017

,


, and


, respectively. We receive payments from third parties that provide our customers with private label credit cards and/or co-branded credit cards. The majority of such income earned is recorded in other income, which is a component of operating expenses, and the remaining portion of income is recognized as a reduction to cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses.

The classification of expenses varies across the apparel retail industry. Accordingly, our cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses and operating expenses may not be comparable to those of other companies.


Rent Expense

Minimum rent expense is recognized over the term of the lease, starting when possession of the property is taken from the landlord, which normally includes a construction period prior to the store opening. When a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent, we recognize the related rent expense on a straight-line basis and record the difference between the recognized rent expense and the amounts payable under the lease as a short-term or long-term deferred rent liability. We also receive tenant allowances upon entering into certain leases, which are recorded as a short-term or long-term tenant allowance liability and amortized using the straight-line method as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease. Costs related to common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, and other occupancy costs the Company is obligated to pay are excluded from minimum rent expense.

Certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception. These contingent rents are primarily based on a percentage of sales that are in excess of a predetermined level and/or rent increase based on a change in the consumer price index or fair market value. These amounts are excluded from minimum rent and are included in the determination of rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We review the carrying amount of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include a significant decrease in the operating performance of the long-lived asset, or the decision to close a store, corporate facility, or distribution center. Long-lived assets are considered impaired if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group. For impaired assets, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or asset group and its estimated fair value, which is recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The estimated fair value of the asset or asset group is based on discounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group using a discount rate commensurate with the related risk. The asset group is defined as the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available and largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets, which for our retail stores is primarily at the store level.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

We review the carrying amount of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include significant changes in the business climate, declines in our operating results, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We assess potential impairment by considering present economic conditions as well as future expectations.

We early adopted ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The amendments simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill impairment by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Under the ASU, the impairment test is simply the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, with the impairment charge being the deficit in fair value but not exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The simplified one-step impairment test applies to all reporting units (including those with zero or negative carrying amounts).


In fiscal 2016, the Company performed the goodwill impairment test under the previous FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other as the annual impairment test was performed prior to January 1, 2017. Under the previous guidance, we reviewed goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, as a basis for determining whether it was necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If it was determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, the two-step test was performed to identify potential goodwill impairment. If it was determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, it was unnecessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. Based on certain circumstances, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to performing the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test. The first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test compared the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. The second step included hypothetically valuing all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Then, the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill was compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognized an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying amount.

A reporting unit is an operating segment or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. We have deemed Athleta and Intermix to be the reporting units at which goodwill is tested for Athleta and Intermix, respectively.

A trade name is considered impaired if the carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. If a trade name is considered impaired, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the trade name. The fair value of a trade name is determined using the relief from royalty method, which requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses, and selecting appropriate discount rates and royalty rates.

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, including the trade names, are recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Pre-Opening Costs

Pre-opening and start-up activity costs, which include rent and occupancy, supplies, advertising, and payroll expenses incurred prior to the opening of a new store or other facility, are expensed in the period in which they occur.

Advertising

Costs associated with the production of advertising, such as writing, copy, printing, and other costs, are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with communicating advertising that has been produced, such as television and magazine costs, are expensed when the advertising event takes place. Advertising expense was

$673 million

,

$601 million

, and

$578 million

in

fiscal 2017

,


, and


, respectively, and is recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Share-Based Compensation

Share-based compensation expense for stock options and other stock awards is determined based on the grant-date fair value. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, which requires the input of subjective assumptions regarding the expected term, expected volatility, dividend yield, and risk-free interest rate. For units granted whereby one share of common stock is issued for each unit as the unit vests (“Stock Units”), the fair value is determined based on the Company’s stock price on the date of grant less future expected dividends during the vesting period. For stock options and Stock Units, we recognize share-based compensation cost over the vesting period. With the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 in fiscal 2017, we account for forfeitures as they occur. Share-based compensation expense is recorded primarily in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for stock options and Stock Units.


Unredeemed Gift Cards, Gift Certificates, and Credit Vouchers

Upon issuance of a gift card, gift certificate, or credit voucher, a liability is established for its cash value. The liability is relieved and net sales are recorded upon redemption by the customer. Over time, some portion of these instruments is not redeemed. We determine breakage income for gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers based on historical redemption patterns. Breakage income is recorded in other income, which is a component of operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, when we can determine the portion of the liability where redemption is remote. Based on our historical information, three years after the gift card, gift certificate, or credit voucher is issued, we can determine the portion of the liability where redemption is remote. When breakage income is recorded, a liability is recognized for any legal obligation to remit the unredeemed portion to relevant jurisdictions. Substantially all of our gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers have no expiration dates. With the adoption of the new revenue standard in fiscal 2018, breakage income will be presented in net sales in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Credit Cards

We have credit card agreements with third parties to provide our customers with private label credit cards and co-branded credit cards (collectively, the “Credit Card” programs). Each private label credit card bears the logo of Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, or Athleta and can be used at any of our U.S. or Canadian store locations and online. The co-branded credit card is a VISA credit card bearing the logo of Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, or Athleta and can be used everywhere VISA credit cards are accepted. The Credit Card programs offer incentives to cardholders in the form of reward certificates upon the cumulative purchase of an established amount.

Synchrony Financial ("Synchrony"), a third-party financing company, is the sole owner of the accounts and underwrites the credit issued under the Credit Card programs. Our agreement with Synchrony provides for certain payments to be made by Synchrony to us, including a share of revenues from the performance of the Credit Card portfolios, which we recognize when the amounts are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. In addition, the cost associated with redemption of loyalty rewards is partially offset by reimbursements of loyalty program discounts that we recognize as a reduction to cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost associated with loyalty rewards is accrued as the rewards are earned by the cardholder and is recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In fiscal 2017, we recognized

$412 million

in income from our revenue sharing associated with our Credit Card programs, which was recorded as a reduction to operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In addition, in fiscal 2017 we recognized

$174 million

in reimbursements of loyalty program discounts associated with our Credit Card programs, which was recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. With the adoption of the new revenue standard in fiscal 2018, revenue sharing and reimbursements of loyalty program discounts associated with our Credit Card programs will be presented in net sales in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed as net income divided by basic weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed as net income divided by diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period including common stock equivalents. Common stock equivalents consist of shares subject to share-based awards with exercise prices less than the average market price of our common stock for the period, to the extent their inclusion would be dilutive. Stock options and other stock awards that contain performance conditions are not included in the calculation of common stock equivalents until such performance conditions have been achieved.


Foreign Currency

Our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as their functional currency and translate their assets and liabilities at the current rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses from their operations are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period in which the transactions occur. The resulting gains and losses from translation are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and in accumulated OCI in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. Transaction gains and losses resulting from intercompany balances of a long-term investment nature are also classified as accumulated OCI. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the local functional currency are recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The aggregate transaction gains and losses recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income are as follows:

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made.

The Company recognizes interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on income taxes.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Except as noted below, the Company has considered all recent accounting pronouncements and has concluded that there are no recent accounting pronouncements that may have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements, based on current information.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Related to Revenue Recognition

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued accounting standards update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to clarify the principles of recognizing revenue and create common revenue recognition guidance between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU No. 2014-09, as amended, is effective retrospectively for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017.


The adoption will result in a change in the timing of recognizing revenue for breakage income for gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers, as breakage income will now be recognized based on historical redemption patterns rather than when the likelihood of redemption is considered remote. The adoption will also result in a change in the timing of recognizing revenue for sales where we ship the merchandise to the customer from a distribution center or store, as revenue for sales where we ship the merchandise to customers will be recognized when control of the merchandise transfers to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment rather than upon delivery of the products to the customer. Additionally, under the new guidance, we will record allowances for estimated sales returns on a gross basis rather than on a net basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The adoption will also result in change in the timing of recognizing credit card reward points, as the portion of sales attributed to credit card reward points will be deferred until the reward points are redeemed or expire. We previously did not defer any portion of revenue related to reward points and certificates and recognized costs associated with reward points and certificates in cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income as the rewards were earned.

The most significant changes will be reclassifications from operating expenses to net sales related to the income from our revenue sharing agreement with Synchrony, as well as reclassifications from cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses to net sales for reimbursements of loyalty program discounts associated with our private label and co-branded credit card loyalty program. These reclassifications will have a significant impact on the affected line items of the Consolidated Statements of Income, but will not have a material impact to net income.

In addition, we will provide expanded disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. We will also provide disclosures of the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected during fiscal 2018 as compared to the prior year presentation.

We will adopt these ASUs on a modified retrospective basis beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 by recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard as an increase to the opening balance of retained earnings. We expect this adjustment to be about

$36 million

, net of tax, related primarily to breakage income for gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers, and reimbursements of loyalty program discounts, with an immaterial impact to our net income on an ongoing basis.

Other Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases (with the exception of leases with a term of 12 months or less) at the commencement date. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the new standard on our Consolidated Financial Statements as we implement a new lease accounting information system, but it will result in a substantial increase in our long-term assets and liabilities. We have elected to apply the practical expedients permitted within the new standard, which among other things, allows us to carryforward the historical lease classification. We also intend to elect the practical expedient of not separating non-lease components from lease components. The ASU is effective retrospectively for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018. We will adopt the ASU beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. See Note 11, Leases, for the aggregate minimum non-cancelable annual lease payments under leases in effect on February 3, 2018.


In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments are intended to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments and affect all organizations that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. We adopted the provisions of this ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we have made the policy election to account for forfeitures when they occur, rather than estimating expected forfeitures, when recognizing share-based compensation cost. We adopted this provision of the ASU using a modified retrospective transition method, which resulted in the cumulative-effect adjustment of a

$3 million

increase to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Also, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based payment awards are now reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Income as a component of the provision for income taxes on a prospective basis, whereas they were recognized in equity under the previous guidance. Additionally, excess tax benefits related to share-based payment awards are now reflected in operating activities, along with other income tax related cash flows, in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on a prospective basis.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The amendments provide guidance for eight specific cash flow issues and are intended to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective retrospectively for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. We will adopt the presentation and disclosure provisions of this ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash. The amendments address diversity in practice that exists in the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash and require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. The ASU is effective retrospectively for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. We will adopt the presentation and disclosure provisions of this ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. The amendments are intended to better align an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. The ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently assessing the potential impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

, and

$8 million

related to assets under construction was capitalized in

fiscal 2017

,


, and


, respectively.

We recorded a charge for the impairment of long-lived assets of

$28 million

,

$107 million

, and

$54 million

for

fiscal 2017

,


, and


, respectively, related to store assets which is recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Other Long-Term Assets

Other long-term assets consist of the following:

In fiscal 2016, we recorded a charge for the impairment of goodwill related to the Intermix reporting unit of

$71 million

, which was recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

No

goodwill impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2017 or 2015. See

Note 3

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on goodwill and other intangible assets.


Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities

Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consist of the following:

No other individual items accounted for greater than five percent of total current liabilities as of

February 3, 2018

or

January 28, 2017

.

Lease Incentives and Other Long-Term Liabilities

Lease incentives and other long-term liabilities consist of the following:

The activity related to asset retirement obligations includes adjustments to the asset retirement obligation balance and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Sales Return Allowance

A summary of activity in the sales return allowance account is as follows:

Sales return allowances are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Note 3

. Goodwill and Trade Names

The following goodwill and trade names are included in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:


Goodwill

Goodwill consists of

$99 million

and

$10 million

related to Athleta and Intermix, respectively, as of

February 3, 2018

and

January 28, 2017

.

We assess whether events or circumstances indicate that goodwill is impaired every quarter, and evaluate goodwill impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. At the end of each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2017, given the information available at the time of those assessments, we determined that there were no events or circumstances that indicated impairment of goodwill prior to the annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and we did not recognize any impairment charges.

At the end of each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, given the information available at the time of those assessments, we determined that there were no events or circumstances that indicated impairment of goodwill related to Intermix prior to the annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, management updated the fiscal 2017 budget and financial projections beyond fiscal 2017. There were several factors that arose during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, which caused the financial projections and estimates of Intermix to significantly decrease from the previous estimates. Such factors included: poor fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 holiday performance at Intermix stores, the decision to reduce future store openings, the approval of additional store closures in fiscal 2017, and the budgeting of additional headcount required to support increased focus on the online business. These factors arising in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 had a significant and negative impact on the estimated fair value of the Intermix reporting unit, and we have determined that the carrying value of the reporting unit for Intermix exceeded its fair value as of the date of our annual impairment review. The fair value of the Intermix reporting unit was determined using level 3 inputs and a combination of an income approach using the estimated discounted cash flow and a market-based valuation methodology. In the second step of the goodwill impairment test, we performed a hypothetical acquisition and purchase price allocation and measured the implied fair value of goodwill related to Intermix. The second step of the goodwill impairment test resulted in an impairment charge of

$71 million

for goodwill related to the Intermix reporting unit in fiscal 2016. This impairment charge was recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income and reduced the

$81 million

of purchase price allocated to goodwill in connection with the acquisition of Intermix in December 2012 to

$10 million

as of January 28, 2017.

We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill related to Athleta in fiscal 2016.

Trade Names

Trade names primarily consist of

$54 million

and

$38 million

related to Athleta and Intermix, respectively, as of

February 3, 2018

and

January 28, 2017

.

During the fourth quarter of

fiscal 2017

, we completed our annual impairment test of trade names and we did not recognize any impairment charges.

Note 4

. Debt

Long-term debt consists of the following:


We have

$1.25 billion

aggregate principal amount of

5.95 percent

notes (the "Notes") due

April 2021

. Interest is payable

semi-annually

on April 12 and October 12 of each year, and we have an option to call the Notes in whole or in part at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. The Notes agreement is unsecured and does not contain any financial covenants. The amount recorded in long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the Notes is equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, net of the unamortized discount. As of

February 3, 2018

and

January 28, 2017

, the estimated fair value of the Notes was

$1.33 billion

and

$1.32 billion

, respectively, and was based on the quoted market price of the Notes (level 1 inputs) as of the last business day of the respective fiscal year.

In January 2014, we entered into a

15 billion

Japanese yen,

four

-year, unsecured term loan due

January 2018

. Repayments of

2.5 billion

Japanese yen were payable on January 15 of each year, and a final repayment of

7.5 billion

Japanese yen, which was due on

January 15, 2018

, was paid in full in June 2017. Interest was payable at least

quarterly

based on an interest rate equal to the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate plus a fixed margin. The carrying amount of the Japan Term Loan as of

January 28, 2017

approximated its fair value, as the interest rate varied depending on quoted market rates (level 1 inputs).

In October 2015, we entered into a

$400 million

unsecured Term Loan. The Term Loan was originally scheduled to mature on

October 15, 2016

, but had an option to be extended until

October 15, 2017

. In August 2016, the Company exercised the option to extend the Term Loan. In January 2017, the Term Loan was repaid in full. Interest was payable at least

quarterly

based on an interest rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a fixed margin.

Note 5

. Credit Facilities

We have a

$500 million

,

five

-year, unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Facility"), which expires in

May 2020

. The Facility is available for general corporate purposes including working capital, trade letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. The Facility fees fluctuate based on our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio. If we were to draw on the Facility, interest would be a base rate (typically LIBOR) plus a margin based on our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio on the unpaid principal amount. To maintain availability of funds under the Facility, we pay a facility fee on the full facility amount, regardless of usage. As of

February 3, 2018

, there were

no

borrowings and

no

material outstanding standby letters of credit under the Facility.

We maintain multiple agreements with third parties that make unsecured revolving credit facilities available for our operations in foreign locations (the “Foreign Facilities”). These Foreign Facilities are uncommitted and are generally available for borrowings, overdraft borrowings, and the issuance of bank guarantees. The total capacity of the Foreign Facilities was

$50 million

as of

February 3, 2018

. As of

February 3, 2018

, there were

no

borrowings under the Foreign Facilities. There were

$17 million

in bank guarantees issued and outstanding primarily related to store leases under the Foreign Facilities as of

February 3, 2018

.

We have bilateral unsecured standby letter of credit agreements that are uncommitted and do not have expiration dates. As of

February 3, 2018

, we had

$15 million

in standby letters of credit issued under these agreements.

The Facility contains financial and other covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on liens and subsidiary debt, as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios—a minimum annual fixed charge coverage ratio of

2.00

and a maximum annual leverage ratio of

2.25

. As of

February 3, 2018

, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Violation of these covenants could result in a default under the Facility, which would permit the participating banks to terminate our ability to access the Facility for letters of credit and advances and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding advances.


Note 6

. Fair Value Measurements

There were

no

purchases, sales, issuances, or settlements related to recurring level 3 measurements during

fiscal 2017

or


. There were

no

transfers into or out of level 1 and level 2 during

fiscal 2017

or


.

Financial Assets and Liabilities

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and cash equivalents held at amortized cost are as follows:

We have highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents, which are placed primarily in time deposits and money market funds. We value these investments at their original purchase prices plus interest that has accrued at the stated rate.

Derivative financial instruments primarily include foreign exchange forward contracts. The currencies hedged against changes in the U.S. dollar are Canadian dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds, Euro, Mexican pesos, Chinese yuan, and Taiwan dollars. The fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments is determined using pricing models based on current market rates. Derivative financial instruments in an asset position are recorded in other current assets or other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivative financial instruments in a liability position are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or lease incentives and other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We maintain the Gap Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (“DCP”), which allows eligible employees and non-employee directors to defer base compensation up to a maximum percentage. Plan investments are directed by participants and are recorded at market value and designated for the DCP. The fair value of the Company’s DCP assets is determined based on quoted market prices, and the assets are recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.


Nonfinancial Assets

As discussed above and in

Note 2

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we recorded a total charge for the impairment of long-lived assets of

$28 million

,

$107 million

, and

$54 million

in

fiscal 2017

,


, and


, respectively, related to store assets which is recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The impairment charge reduced the then carrying amount of the applicable long-lived assets of

$30 million

,

$125 million

, and

$62 million

to their fair value of

$2 million

,

$18 million

, and

$8 million

during

fiscal 2017

,


, and


, respectively. The fair value of the long-lived assets was determined using level 3 inputs and the valuation techniques discussed in

Note 1

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In May 2016, the Company announced measures that resulted in the closure of its fleet of 53 Old Navy stores in Japan and select Banana Republic stores, primarily internationally. In fiscal 2016, we recorded a charge for the impairment of long-lived assets of

$54 million

related to the announced store closures, and an additional

$53 million

for long-lived assets that were unrelated to the announced measures.

In June 2015, the Company announced a series of strategic actions to position Gap brand for improved business performance in the future, including its plan to close about 175 Gap brand specialty stores in North America and a limited number of stores in Europe and Asia over the next few years. As a result of the strategic actions, in fiscal 2015, we recorded an impairment charge of

$38 million

related to long-lived assets. We also recorded an impairment charge of

$16 million

for long-lived assets that were unrelated to the Gap brand strategic actions.

There were

no

impairment charges recorded for other indefinite-lived intangible assets for fiscal


or


. In fiscal 2015, we recorded an impairment charge of

$5 million

related to an indefinite-lived intangible asset as a result of the strategic actions discussed above. The impairment charge was recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income and reduced the then carrying amount of the applicable indefinite-lived intangible asset of

$6 million

to its fair value of

$1 million

during fiscal 2015.

There were

no

impairment charges recorded for goodwill for fiscal


or


. In fiscal 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of

$71 million

for Intermix goodwill. The fair value of the Intermix reporting unit was determined using level 3 inputs and valuation techniques discussed in

Note 3

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Note 7

. Derivative Financial Instruments

We operate in foreign countries, which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and do not enter into derivative financial contracts for trading purposes. Consistent with our risk management guidelines, we hedge a portion of our transactions related to merchandise purchases for foreign operations and certain intercompany transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts. These contracts are entered into with large, reputable financial institutions that are monitored for counterparty risk. The currencies hedged against changes in the U.S. dollar are Canadian dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds, Euro, Mexican pesos, Chinese yuan, and Taiwan dollars.

Cash Flow Hedges

We designate the following foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedges: (1) forward contracts used to hedge forecasted merchandise purchases and related costs denominated in U.S. dollars made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currencies are their local currencies; (2) forward contracts used to hedge forecasted intercompany royalty payments denominated in foreign currencies received by entities whose functional currencies are U.S. dollars; and (3) forward contracts used to hedge forecasted intercompany revenue transactions related to merchandise sold from our regional purchasing entity, whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, to certain international subsidiaries in their local currencies. The foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to hedge forecasted merchandise purchases and related costs, intercompany royalty payments, and intercompany revenue transactions generally have terms of up to 24 months.


Net Investment Hedges

We also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the net assets of international subsidiaries to offset the foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our investment in the subsidiaries.

Other Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

We use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our market risk exposure associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for certain intercompany balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity with the intercompany balance. The gain or loss on the derivative financial instruments that represent economic hedges, as well as the remeasurement of the underlying intercompany balances, is recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same period and generally offset.

Outstanding Notional Amounts

As of

February 3, 2018

and

January 28, 2017

, we had foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding in the following notional amounts:


Quantitative Disclosures about Derivative Financial Instruments

The fair values of foreign exchange forward contracts are as follows:

Substantially all of the unrealized gains and losses from designated cash flow hedges as of

February 3, 2018

will be recognized in income within the next 12 months at the then-current values, which may differ from the fair values as of

February 3, 2018

shown above.

Our foreign exchange forward contracts are subject to master netting arrangements with each of our counterparties and such arrangements are enforceable in the event of default or early termination of the contract. We do not elect to offset the fair values of our derivative financial instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and as such the fair values shown above represent gross amounts. The amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements are

$1 million

and

$18 million

as of

February 3, 2018

and

January 28, 2017

, respectively. If we did elect to offset, the net amounts of our derivative financial instruments in an asset position would be

$13 million

and

$40 million

and the net amounts of the derivative financial instruments in a liability position would be

$42 million

and

$3 million

as of

February 3, 2018

and

January 28, 2017

, respectively.

See

Note 6

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures on the fair value measurements of our derivative financial instruments.


The effective portion of gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts in cash flow hedging and net investment hedging relationships recorded in OCI and the Consolidated Statements of Income, on a pre-tax basis, are as follows

:

For

fiscal 2017

,


, and


, there were

no

amounts of gain or loss reclassified from accumulated OCI into income for derivative financial instruments in net investment hedging relationships, as we did not sell or liquidate (or substantially liquidate) any of our hedged subsidiaries during the periods.

Gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income, on a pre-tax basis are as follows:

February 3, 2018

.

Share Repurchases

Share repurchase activity is as follows:

__________

(1)

Excludes shares withheld to settle employee statutory tax withholding related to the vesting of stock units.

In October 2014, the Board of Directors authorized a total of

$500 million

for share repurchases, all of which was completed by the end of May 2015.


In February 2015, the Board of Directors approved a

$1.0 billion

share repurchase authorization (the "February 2015 repurchase program"). In February 2016, the Board of Directors approved a new

$1.0 billion

share repurchase authorization. The February 2015 repurchase program, which had

$302 million

remaining, was superseded and replaced by the February 2016 repurchase program. The February 2016 repurchase program has

$685 million

remaining as of

February 3, 2018

.

All of the share repurchases were paid for as of February 3, 2018 and January 30, 2016.

Note 9

. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

Changes in accumulated OCI by component, net of tax, are as follows:

See

Note 7

of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures about reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income and their corresponding effects on the respective line items in the Consolidated Statements of Income.


Note 10

. Share-Based Compensation

Share-based compensation expense is as follows:

No material share-based compensation expense was capitalized in

fiscal 2017

,


, or


.

There were no material modifications made to our outstanding stock options and other stock awards in

fiscal 2017

,


, or


.

Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimate expected forfeitures, when recognizing share-based compensation expense. The cumulative-effect adjustment of this change was recognized as a

$3 million

increase, net of tax, to retained earnings as of the beginning of fiscal 2017.

General Description of Stock Option and Other Stock Award Plans

Under the 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2016 Plan"), as amended and restated as of February 22, 2017, nonqualified stock options and other stock awards are granted to officers, directors, eligible employees, and consultants at exercise prices or initial values equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant or as determined by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors.

As of

February 3, 2018

, there were

216,586,781

shares that have been authorized for issuance under the 2016 Plan.

Stock Units

Under the 2016 Plan, Stock Units are granted to employees and members of the Board of Directors. Vesting generally occurs over a period of

three

to

four

years of continued service by the employee in equal annual installments. Vesting is immediate in the case of members of the Board of Directors.

In some cases, Stock Unit vesting is also subject to the attainment of pre-determined performance metrics ("Performance Shares"). At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the probability that the Performance Shares will vest. We record share-based compensation expense on an accelerated basis over a period of

two

to

three

years once granted, based on the grant-date fair value and the probability that the pre-determined performance metrics will be achieved.

A summary of Stock Unit activity under the 2016 Plan for

fiscal 2017

is as follows:


There were

1,470,938

Performance Shares for which the pre-determined performance metrics had not yet been achieved. As a result, they will not be considered granted until such performance metrics have been achieved.

A summary of additional information about Stock Units is as follows:

The aggregate intrinsic value of unvested Stock Units as of

February 3, 2018

was

$201 million

.

As of

February 3, 2018

, there was

$100 million

(before any related tax benefit) of unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested Stock Units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

2.3

years. Total unrecognized share-based compensation expense may be adjusted for future forfeitures as they occur.

Stock Units Granted Based on Performance Metrics

Under the 2016 Plan, some Stock Units are granted to employees only after the achievement of pre-determined performance metrics.

At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the probability that Stock Units will be granted. We record share-based compensation expense based on the probability that the performance metrics will be achieved, with an offsetting increase to current liabilities. We revalue the liability at the end of each reporting period and record an adjustment to share-based compensation expense as required based on the probability that the performance metrics will be achieved. Upon achievement of the performance metrics, a Stock Unit is granted. At that time, the associated liability is reclassified to stockholders’ equity.

Out of

4,028,594

Stock Units granted in

fiscal 2017

,

334,765

Stock Units were granted based on satisfaction of performance metrics.

The liability related to potential Stock Units to be granted based on performance metrics, which is recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was

$12 million

and

$1 million

as of

February 3, 2018

and

January 28, 2017

, respectively.

Stock Options

We have stock options outstanding under the 2016 Plan. Stock options generally expire the earlier of

10 years

from the grant date, three months after employee termination, or one year after the date of an employee’s retirement or death. Vesting generally occurs over a period of

four

years of continued service by the employee, with


percent vesting on each of the four anniversary dates.

The fair value of stock options issued during

fiscal 2017

,


, and


was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:


A summary of stock option activity under the 2016 Plan for

fiscal 2017

years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), eligible U.S. and Canadian employees are able to purchase our common stock at

85 percent

of the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on the last day of the three-month purchase periods. Accordingly, compensation expense is recognized for an amount equal to the


percent discount. Employees pay for their stock purchases through payroll deductions at a rate equal to any whole percentage from


percent to


percent. There were

1,113,640

,

1,260,361

, and

949,751

shares issued under the ESPP in

fiscal 2017

,


, and


, respectively. As of

February 3, 2018

, there were

8,144,190

shares reserved for future issuances under the ESPP.


Note 11

. Leases

We lease most of our store premises and some of our corporate facilities and distribution centers. These operating leases expire at various dates through


. Most store leases have a five-year base period and include options that allow us to extend the lease term beyond the initial base period, subject to terms agreed upon at lease inception. Some leases also include early termination options, which can be exercised under specific conditions.

The aggregate minimum non-cancelable annual lease payments under leases in effect on

February 3, 2018

are as follows:

The total minimum lease commitment amount above does not include minimum sublease rent income of

$18 million

receivable in the future under non-cancelable sublease agreements.

Rent expense related to our store premises, corporate facilities, and distribution centers under operating leases is as follows:

Note 12

. Income Taxes

For financial reporting purposes, components of income before income taxes are as follows:


The provision for income taxes consists of the following:

The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate is as follows:

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “TCJA”) was enacted into law, which significantly changes existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business, such as imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income, reducing the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, and adopting a territorial tax system. The TCJA resulted in a one-time transition tax, payable over eight years without interest or penalties, on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of

15.5%

for income held in foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and

8%

on the remaining income. The TCJA also reduces the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from

35%

to

21%

effective January 1, 2018, which resulted in a remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The TCJA includes a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) of foreign subsidiaries and a base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) measure that taxes certain payments between a U.S. corporation and its subsidiaries. The GILTI and BEAT provisions of the TCJA will be effective for us beginning fiscal 2018.

On December 22 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 118 to address the application of FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 740, Income Taxes, in reporting periods that include December 22, 2017. SAB No. 118 permits organizations to report provisional amounts during a measurement period for the specific income tax effects of the TCJA for which the accounting under ASC Topic 740 will be incomplete but a reasonable estimate can be determined. The measurement period ends when an organization has obtained, prepared and analyzed the information needed to complete the accounting requirements under ASC Topic 740, not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date of the TCJA.


As of February 3, 2018, we have not finalized our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA. We have made a reasonable estimate of the effects of TCJA and recorded an estimated net charge of

$57 million

, primarily due to the impact of the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign income and the impact of TCJA on remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The provisional net charge is subject to revisions as we complete our analysis of the TCJA, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), FASB, and other standard-setting and regulatory bodies. Adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. Our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA will be completed during the measurement period, which will not extend beyond one year from the enactment date.

We recorded an estimated

$59 million

charge related to the transition tax, which was included in income taxes on our Consolidated Income Statement and lease incentives and other long term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We have not finalized our accounting for the transition tax as our analysis of our total post-1986 earnings and profits (E&P) which we have previously deferred from U.S. income taxes is not complete. This amount may change when we finalize the calculation of post-1986 foreign E&P previously deferred from U.S. federal taxation, determine the impact on the transition tax of other fiscal year 2017 transactions and finalize the amounts held in cash or other specified assets. Our estimate of the transition tax is also impacted by a change in the structure of certain legal entities in fiscal 2017, which resulted in an overall net tax benefit of approximately

$23 million

.

We recorded a provisional estimated benefit of

$2 million

related to the impact of TCJA on our recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities, which was included in income taxes on our Consolidated Income Statement and other long-term assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We remeasured our deferred taxes to reflect the reduced rate that will apply when these deferred taxes are settled or realized in future periods and reversed certain deferred tax balances recorded for previously unremitted earnings. We have not yet completed our accounting for changes to deferred taxes, including those balances associated with fixed assets and executive compensation, and have recorded provisional estimates in our financial statements that will be subject to further revisions as a result of TCJA.

Due to the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules, we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the TCJA. Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense, or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We will make such accounting policy election during the measurement period.

For fiscal 2016, the tax impact of foreign operations includes the effects of restructuring costs incurred in certain foreign subsidiaries for which the Company was not able to recognize any tax benefit. In connection with a review of the Company’s legal entity structure, we realigned certain entities in fiscal 2016, which resulted in an overall net tax benefit of approximately

$57 million

. This benefit is primarily due to the recognition of foreign tax credits which exceeded the taxes due upon the realignment.

The impact of state and local income taxes for fiscal 2015, net of federal benefit, includes retroactive tax benefits resulting from the approval of certain state tax credits which the company received in fiscal 2015.


Deferred tax assets (liabilities) consist of the following:

As of

February 3, 2018

, we had approximately

$28 million

of state and

$277 million

of foreign loss carryovers in multiple taxing jurisdictions that could be utilized to reduce the tax liabilities of future years. The tax-effected loss carryovers were approximately

$2 million

for state and

$61 million

for foreign as of

February 3, 2018

. We provided a valuation allowance of approximately

$50 million

against the deferred tax assets related to the foreign loss carryovers. We also provided a valuation allowance of approximately

$101 million

related to other foreign deferred tax assets. The state losses expire between fiscal


and fiscal


, approximately

$73 million

of the foreign losses expire between fiscal


and fiscal


, and

$204 million

of the foreign losses do not expire.

The activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Of the

$118 million

,

$44 million

, and

$47 million

of total unrecognized tax benefits as of

February 3, 2018

,

January 28, 2017

, and

January 30, 2016

, respectively, approximately

$106 million

,

$34 million

, and

$34 million

, respectively, represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods.


During

fiscal 2017

and


, interest expense of

$4 million

and

$1 million

, respectively, was recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income relating to tax liabilities. During

fiscal 2016

, there were

no

material amounts for interest expense relating to tax liabilities. In fiscal 2015, we also recognized an interest expense reversal of

$15 million

in the Consolidated Statement of Income, primarily as a result of a favorable foreign tax ruling and actions of foreign tax authorities related to transfer pricing matters. We reduced our unrecognized tax benefits for these matters by

$32 million

, and there was no impact on the tax provision due to the offsetting decrease for the U.S. indirect effect of these unrecognized tax benefits.

As of

February 3, 2018

and

January 28, 2017

, the Company had total accrued interest related to the unrecognized tax benefits of

$7 million

and

$3 million

, respectively. There were

no

accrued penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits as of

February 3, 2018

or

January 28, 2017

.

The Company conducts business globally, and as a result, files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as the United States, Canada, France, the United Kingdom, China, Hong Kong, Japan, and India. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for fiscal years before


, and with few exceptions, we also are no longer subject to U.S. state, local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations for fiscal years before


.

The Company engages in continual discussions with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in the various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in the normal course of business. As of

February 3, 2018

, it is reasonably possible that we will recognize a decrease in gross unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months of up to

$7 million

, primarily due to the closing of audits. If we do recognize such a decrease, the net impact on the Consolidated Statement of Income would not be material.

Note 13

. Employee Benefit Plans

We have two qualified defined contribution retirement plans, the GapShare 401(k) Plan and the GapShare Puerto Rico Plan (the “Plans”), which are available to employees who meet the eligibility requirements. The Plans permit eligible employees to make contributions up to the maximum limits allowable under the applicable Internal Revenue Codes. Under the Plans, we match, in cash, all or a portion of employees’ contributions under a predetermined formula. Our contributions vest immediately. Our matching contributions to the Plans were

$45 million

,

$44 million

, and

$42 million

in

fiscal 2017

,


, and


, respectively.

We maintain the Gap Inc. DCP, which allows eligible employees and non-employee directors to defer base compensation up to a maximum percentage. Plan investments are directed by participants and are recorded at market value and designated for the DCP. The fair value of the Company’s DCP assets is determined based on quoted market prices. As of

February 3, 2018

and

January 28, 2017

, the assets related to the DCP were

$47 million

and

$40 million

, respectively, and were recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of

February 3, 2018

and

January 28, 2017

, the corresponding liabilities related to the DCP were

$47 million

and

$41 million

, respectively, and were recorded in lease incentives and other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We match all or a portion of employees’ contributions under a predetermined formula. Plan investments are elected by the participants, and investment returns are not guaranteed by the Company. Our matching contributions to the DCP in

fiscal 2017

,


, and


were not material.


Note 14

. Earnings per Share

Weighted-average number of shares used for earnings per share is as follows:

The above computations of weighted-average number of shares—diluted exclude

9 million

,

7 million

, and

4 million

shares related to stock options and other stock awards for

fiscal 2017

,


, and


, respectively, as their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share.

Note 15

. Commitments and Contingencies

We are a party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters. These contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts, operating leases, trademarks, intellectual property, financial agreements, and various other agreements. Under these contracts, we may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties (e.g., ownership of assets, environmental or tax indemnifications), or personal injury matters. The terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined. Generally, the maximum obligation under such indemnifications is not explicitly stated, and as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements taken as a whole.

As a multinational company, we are subject to various Actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. As of

February 3, 2018

, Actions filed against us included commercial, intellectual property, customer, employment, and data privacy claims, including class action lawsuits. The plaintiffs in some Actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages and some are covered in part by insurance. As of

February 3, 2018

and

January 28, 2017

, we recorded a liability for an estimated loss if the outcome of an Action is expected to result in a loss that is considered probable and reasonably estimable. The liability recorded as of

February 3, 2018

and

January 28, 2017

was not material for any individual Action or in total. Subsequent to

February 3, 2018

and through the filing date of

March 20, 2018

, no information has become available that indicates a change is required that would be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements taken as a whole.

We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of Actions brought against us. Accordingly, developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement, or resolution. However, we do not believe that the outcome of any current Action would have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements taken as a whole.


Fire at the Fishkill Distribution Center

On August 29, 2016, a fire occurred in one of the buildings at a Company-owned distribution center campus in Fishkill, New York impacting primarily products held for Gap and Banana Republic. The Company recorded insurance recoveries based on the determination that recovery of certain fire-related costs of

$133 million

incurred as of

January 28, 2017

was probable. In January of

fiscal 2016

, the Company agreed upon a partial settlement of

$159 million

related to the loss on inventory and recorded a gain of

$73 million

, representing the excess over the loss on inventory, which was recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. During

fiscal 2016

, the Company received

$174 million

of insurance proceeds. As a result, the insurance receivable balance was

$32 million

as of

January 28, 2017

and was recorded in other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

During

fiscal 2017

, the Company incurred additional fire-related costs that are recorded in cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses and operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

In January 2018, the Company agreed upon a final settlement with its insurers. Total insurance proceeds for fiscal 2017 were

$193 million

, all of which were received as of

February 3, 2018

. Included in the

$193 million

was

$15 million

in certain fire-related costs incurred in fiscal 2017 for which the Company recorded insurance recoveries based on the determination that recovery of these fire-related costs is probable, a gain of

$64 million

primarily related to property and equipment, and the reduction of the

$32 million

insurance receivable balance in the Consolidated Balance Sheet from

fiscal 2016

. The remaining settlement was recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses or operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income, primarily offsetting the fire-related costs incurred during fiscal 2017.

During fiscal 2017, we allocated

$66 million

of insurance proceeds to the loss on property and equipment based on the settlements of claims reported as insurance proceeds related to loss on property and equipment, a component of cash flows from investing activities, in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.


Note 16
