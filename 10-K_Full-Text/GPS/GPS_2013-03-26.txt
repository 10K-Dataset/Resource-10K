THE GAP, INC.


ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K



Part I

Item 1. Business.

General

The Gap, Inc. (Gap Inc., the “Company,” “we,” and “our”) was incorporated in the State of California in July 1969 and was reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in May 1988.

Gap Inc. is a leading global apparel retail company. We offer apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, children, and babies under the Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Piperlime, Athleta, and Intermix brands. Our global portfolio of distinct brands across multiple channels and geographies gives us a competitive advantage in the global retail marketplace. We operate in the specialty, outlet, online, and franchise channels.

Gap Inc. has Company-operated stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Japan, China, and Italy. We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap and Banana Republic stores throughout Asia, Australia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. We have grown our franchise store base to


stores in 40 countries at the end of fiscal 2012. Our products are also available to customers online in over 80 countries. Most of the products sold under our brand names are designed by us and manufactured by independent sources. We also sell products that are designed and manufactured by branded third parties, especially at our Piperlime and Intermix brands.

Gap.

Founded in 1969, Gap is our flagship brand and remains one of the most iconic apparel brands in the marketplace today. The brand stands for casual, American style and offers classic apparel at accessible price points to help customers express their individuality. In addition to designing its own merchandise, Gap offers limited capsule collections in partnership with some of the fashion industry’s best-loved designers and other third-party merchandise from time to time.

Gap entered the children’s apparel market in 1986 with GapKids and in 1989 with babyGap. Maternity apparel was later added to the collection. In 1998, we launched GapBody, which offers loungewear, sleepwear, intimates, and active apparel for women. Today, Gap products are available globally in our specialty and outlet stores, online, and in franchise stores.

Banana Republic.

Banana Republic is a global apparel and accessories brand that focuses on delivering modern, covetable workplace style for both men and women. The brand offers versatile workwear that can be styled for any occasion - from desk to dinner. Banana Republic also partners with notable fashion designers to offer exclusive limited-edition collections inspired by the designers' distinct styles and trends.

Acquired in 1983 with two stores, Banana Republic has evolved to offer collections that include apparel, handbags, shoes, jewelry, personal care products, and eyewear for men and women at higher price points than Gap. Today, customers can purchase Banana Republic products in our specialty and outlet stores, online, and in franchise stores.

Old Navy.

Old Navy opened its first store in 1994, offering fun, fashion, and value to the whole family. The brand offers customers on-trend clothing and accessories, as well as updated basics for adults, children, and babies, at great prices in a unique and energizing shopping environment. Customers can purchase Old Navy products in stores and online, which includes online-exclusive items such as a plus-size line. In July 2012, the brand opened its first store outside of North America in Odaiba, Japan.

Piperlime.

Launched in 2006, Piperlime offers a mix of private-label and branded apparel and jewelry as well as leading brands in shoes and handbags. The brand inspires customers with a fresh and unique mix of products, brands, and price points, as well as favorite picks and tips on how to wear the season's trends from famous guest editors. Customers can shop online and in the brand's first store, which opened in the SoHo neighborhood of New York in September 2012.

Athleta.

Acquired in September 2008, Athleta is Gap Inc.’s premier brand in the rapidly growing women's active apparel market. Athleta offers high-quality, stylish, and functional apparel, footwear, and accessories across a wide variety of sports and fitness activities, including crossover apparel and casualwear. Customers can purchase Athleta products online, in stores, and through catalogs.

Intermix.

Gap, Inc. acquired Intermix Holdco Inc. ("Intermix") on December 31, 2012. Intermix is known for its tasteful mixing of luxury and contemporary fashion and offering the most coveted existing and up-and-coming designer brands. In addition to its array of seasonal must-haves, Intermix also offers exclusive designer product. Customers can shop in stores in the United States and Canada and online.



All sales are tendered for cash, debit cards, credit cards, or personal checks. We also issue and redeem gift cards through our brands. Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy each have a private label credit card program and a co-branded credit card program through which frequent customers receive benefits. Private label and co-branded credit cards are provided by a third-party financing company.

The range of merchandise displayed in each store varies depending on the selling season and the size and location of the store. Stores are generally open seven days per week (where permitted by law) and most holidays.

We ended

fiscal 2012

with

3,407

Company-operated and franchise store locations. For more information on the number of stores by brand and region, see the table in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.

During

fiscal 2012

, we operated two reportable segments: Stores and Direct.

Certain financial information about our reportable segments and international operations is set forth under the heading “Segment Information” in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Merchandise Vendors

We purchase private label and non-private label merchandise from over 1,000 vendors. Our vendors have facilities in about 40 countries. No vendor accounted for more than 5 percent of the dollar amount of our total

fiscal 2012

purchases. Of our merchandise purchased during

fiscal 2012

, approximately 98 percent of all units were produced outside the United States, while the remaining 2 percent of all units were produced domestically. Approximately 26 percent of our merchandise units were produced in China. Product cost increases or events causing disruption of imports from China or other foreign countries, including the imposition of additional import restrictions or vendors potentially failing due to political, financial, or regulatory issues, could have an adverse effect on our operations. Substantially all of our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars. Also see the sections entitled “Risk Factors—Our business, including our costs and supply chain, is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing” and “Risk Factors—Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Seasonal Business

Our business follows a seasonal pattern, with sales peaking over a total of about eight weeks during the end-of-year holiday period.

Brand Building

Our ability to develop and evolve our existing brands is a key to our success. We believe our distinct brands are among our most important assets. With the exception of Piperlime and Intermix, virtually all aspects of brand development, from product design and distribution to marketing, merchandising and shopping environments, are controlled by Gap Inc. employees. With respect to Piperlime and Intermix, we control all aspects of brand development except for product design related to third-party products. We continue to invest in our brands and enhance the customer experience through significant investments in marketing, enhancement of our online shopping sites, international expansion, remodeling of existing stores, and continued focus on customer service.

Trademarks and Service Marks

Gap, GapKids, babyGap, GapBody, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Piperlime, Athleta, and Intermix trademarks and service marks, and certain other trademarks, have been registered, or are the subject of pending trademark applications, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with the registries of many foreign countries and/or are protected by common law.

Franchising

We have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in a number of countries throughout Asia, Australia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. We continue to increase the number of countries in which we enter into these types of arrangements as part of our strategy to expand internationally. For additional information on risks related to our franchise business, see the sections entitled “Risk Factors—Our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful” and “Risk Factors—Our franchise business is subject to certain risks not directly within our control and could impair the value of our brands” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.



Inventory

The nature of the retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to peak holiday selling season when we, along with other retailers, generally build up inventory levels. We maintain a large part of our inventory in distribution centers. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes or colors) and we primarily use markdowns to clear merchandise. Also see the section entitled “Risk Factors—We must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Competitors

The global apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We compete with local, national, and global apparel retailers. We are also faced with competition in European, Japanese, Chinese, and Canadian markets from established regional and national chains, and our franchisees face significant competition in the markets in which they operate. Also see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Our business is highly competitive” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Employees

As of

February 2, 2013

, we had a workforce of approximately

136,000

employees, which includes a combination of part-time and full-time employees. We also hire seasonal employees, primarily during the peak end-of-year holiday period. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

To remain competitive in the apparel retail industry, we must attract, develop, and retain skilled employees in our design, merchandising, marketing, and other functions. Competition for such personnel is intense. Our success is dependent to a significant degree on the continued contributions of key employees. Also see the section entitled “Risk Factors—We must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Our past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance because actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties discussed below. In addition, historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.

Global economic conditions and the impact on consumer spending patterns could adversely impact our results of operations.

The Company’s performance is subject to global economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending worldwide. Some of the factors influencing consumer spending include high levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, fluctuating interest rates and credit availability, government austerity measures, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty.

Adverse economic changes in any of the regions in which we sell our products, could reduce consumer confidence, and thereby could negatively affect earnings and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  In a challenging and uncertain economic environment, we cannot predict whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen, or what impact, if any, such circumstances could have on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.

Our business is highly competitive.

The global apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We compete with local, national, and global department stores, specialty and discount store chains, independent retail stores, and online businesses that market similar lines of merchandise. We face a variety of competitive challenges including:

•

anticipating and quickly responding to changing apparel trends and customer demands;

•

attracting customer traffic;

•

competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value;

•

maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to customers in several diverse market segments;

•

developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to customers of varying age groups and tastes;



•

sourcing merchandise efficiently; and

•

providing strong and effective marketing support.

In addition, our franchisees face significant competition in the markets in which they operate. If we or our franchisees are not able to compete successfully in the United States or internationally, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Furthermore, beginning in fiscal 2013, we will combine all channels and geographies under one global leader each for Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy. We do not have experience operating under this new global brand structure. If we are not successful in competing effectively under this structure, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

We must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed.

Our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our purchases are long, which may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing apparel trends or consumer acceptance of our products. The global apparel retail business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences, dictated in part by apparel trends and season. To the extent we misjudge the market for our merchandise or the products suitable for local markets or fail to execute trends and deliver product to market as timely as our competitors, our sales will be adversely affected, and the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely affect our operating results. Some of our past product offerings have not been well received by our broad and diverse customer base. Merchandise misjudgments could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

Our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing apparel trends depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in our design, merchandising, marketing, and other functions in the context of our new global brand structure announced in October 2012. Competition for this personnel is intense, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods.

Fluctuations in the global apparel retail business especially affect the inventory owned by apparel retailers, as merchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the season and frequently before apparel trends are evidenced by customer purchases. In addition, the nature of the global apparel retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we build up our inventory levels. We must enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. In the past, we have not always predicted our customers’ preferences and acceptance levels of our trend items with accuracy. If sales do not meet expectations, too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower than planned margins.

Our business, including our costs and supply chain, is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing.

Independent third parties manufacture nearly all of our products for us. As a result, we are directly impacted by increases in the cost of those products

.

For example, cotton prices rose substantially during fiscal 2011, which put significant pressure on our average unit costs and gross margins.

If we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing vendor, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or that any vendor would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, for any new manufacturing source, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors in our methods, products, quality control standards, and environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could result in lower sales and net income.

Because independent vendors manufacture nearly all of our products outside of our principal sales markets, third parties must transport our products over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with transitioning between vendors, could adversely impact our financial performance. Manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as aircraft, which could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, the cost of fuel is a significant component in transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our gross margins.



Our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful.

Our current strategies include moving to a global brand structure and pursuing continued international expansion in a number of countries around the world through a number of channels. Beginning in fiscal 2013, we will combine all channels and geographies under one global leader each for Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy. Each global brand president will oversee their brand's specialty, outlet, online, and franchise operations. We currently plan to open additional Old Navy stores outside of North America, open additional Gap stores in China, open additional international outlet stores, and continue to grow online sales internationally. We have limited experience operating in some of these locations. In many of these locations, we face major, established competitors. In addition, in many of these locations, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics, regulatory, and other operating requirements differ dramatically from those in the places where we have experience. Moreover, consumer tastes and trends may differ in many of these locations, and as a result, the sales of our products may not be successful or result in the margins we anticipate. In addition, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, profits, assets, and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Although we use instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our operations and financial results could be materially, adversely affected.

Our franchise business is subject to certain risks not directly within our control and could impair the value of our brands.

We enter into franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores in many countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. The effect of these arrangements on our business and results of operations is uncertain and will depend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in new markets internationally and our ability to successfully identify appropriate third parties to act as franchisees, distributors, or in a similar capacity. In addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store locations, store openings, and sales. Other risks that may affect these third parties include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, foreign exchange, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, and political instability. Moreover, while the agreements we have entered into and plan to enter into in the future provide us with certain termination rights, the value of our brands could be impaired to the extent that these third parties do not operate their stores in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.

The market for prime real estate is competitive.

Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new stores nationally and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases. In addition, in recent years, we have been seeking to downsize, consolidate, reposition, or close some of our real estate locations, which in most cases requires a modification of an existing store lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Additionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of retail real estate properties within the United States and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and the quality of our decisions to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.



We experience fluctuations in our comparable sales and margins.

Our success depends in part on our ability to improve sales, in particular at our largest brands. A variety of factors affect comparable sales and margins, including apparel trends, competition, current economic conditions, the timing of new merchandise releases and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs, and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations. Our comparable sales, including the associated comparable online sales, have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual, quarterly, and monthly basis. Over the past 24 months, our reported monthly comparable sales have ranged from an increase of 10 percent in July 2012 to a decrease of 10 percent in March 2011. Over the past five years, our reported gross margins have ranged from a high of 40.3 percent in fiscal 2009 to a low of 36.2 percent in fiscal 2011. In addition, over the past five years, our reported operating margins have ranged from a high of 13.4 percent in fiscal 2010 to a low of 9.9 percent in fiscal 2011.

Our ability to deliver strong comparable sales results and margins depends in large part on accurately forecasting demand and apparel trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base, managing inventory effectively, using effective pricing strategies, and optimizing store performance. Failure to meet the expectations of investors, securities analysts, or credit rating agencies in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our common stock and cause our credit ratings to decline.

Changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the capital markets and adversely impact our financial results or our business initiatives.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, given favorable market conditions and our history of generating consistent and strong operating cash flow, we made the strategic decision to issue debt. In April 2011, we issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.95 percent notes due April 12, 2021. As a result, we have additional costs that include interest payable semiannually on the notes. We also entered into a $400 million five-year term loan due April 2016, which was funded in May 2011 and repaid in full in August 2012.

Our cash flows from operations are the primary source of funds for these debt service payments. In this regard, we have generated annual cash flow from operations in excess of $1 billion per year for the past decade and ended fiscal 2012 with $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. We are also able to supplement near-term liquidity, if necessary, with our $500 million revolving credit facility. We continue to target a cash balance of about $1.2 billion, which provides not only for our working capital needs, but also a reserve for unexpected business downturns. However, if our cash flows from operations decline significantly we may be required to reprioritize our business initiatives to ensure that we can continue to service or refinance our debt with favorable rates and terms. In addition, any future reduction in our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets and higher interest costs on future financings.

We remain committed to maintaining a strong financial profile with ample liquidity. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes including share repurchases.

For further information on our debt and credit facilities, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes 5 and 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain.

Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States and other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions. In addition, we face the possibility of anti-dumping or countervailing duties lawsuits from U.S. domestic producers. We are unable to determine the impact of the changes to the quota system or the impact that potential tariff lawsuits could have on our global sourcing operations. Our sourcing operations may be adversely affected by trade limits or political and financial instability, resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries, significant fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and/or other trade disruptions.



Updates or changes to our IT systems may disrupt operations.

We continue to evaluate and implement upgrades and changes to our IT systems, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions, and believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks through testing, training, and staging implementation, as well as ensuring appropriate commercial contracts are in place with third-party vendors supplying or supporting our IT initiatives. However, there can be no assurances that we will successfully launch these systems as planned or that they will occur without disruptions to our operations. IT system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, or failure to successfully implement new or upgraded systems, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our IT services agreement with IBM could cause disruptions in our operations and have an adverse effect on our financial results.

We have entered into the eighth year of a ten-year non-exclusive services agreement under which IBM operates certain significant aspects of our IT infrastructure. Under the original agreement, this included supporting our mainframe, server, network and data center, and store operations, as well as help desk, end user support, and some disaster recovery. Since the original agreement in January 2006, we have amended the agreement to take back certain services originally performed by IBM. These returned services include services related to management of our server and data center environment, along with disaster recovery, circuit expense billing, database administration services, and help desk services for stores worldwide. All other services remain with IBM per the original agreement. Our ability to realize the expected benefits of this arrangement is subject to various risks, some of which are not within our complete control. These risks include, but are not limited to, disruption in services and the failure to protect the security and integrity of the Company’s data under the terms of the agreement. We are unable to provide assurances that some or all of these risks will not occur. Failure to effectively mitigate these risks, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.

We are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.

Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, job applicants, and others, including credit card information and personal identification information. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. In addition, data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breach by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. Any compromise or breach of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.

Our results could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, or other catastrophic events.

Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, and other adverse weather and climate conditions; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics; political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, and other political instability; or other catastrophic events, whether occurring in the United States or internationally, could disrupt our operations, the operations of our franchisees, or the operations of one or more of our vendors. In particular, these types of events could impact our product supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability or the ability of our franchisees or other third parties to operate our stores or websites. In addition, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or depending upon the severity, globally. To the extent any of these events occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.



Failure of our vendors to adhere to our code of vendor conduct could harm our business.

We purchase nearly all merchandise from third-party vendors outside of the United States and we require those vendors to adhere to a code of vendor conduct and other environmental, labor, health, and safety standards for the benefit of their workers. From time to time, contractors or their subcontractors may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable local laws. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could have a negative impact on our reputation and an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Laws and regulations at the local, state, federal, and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that may result from changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts employment and labor, trade, product safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, privacy, operations, or environmental issues, among others, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.

Item 2. Properties.

We have Company-operated stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Japan, China, and Italy. As of

February 2, 2013

, the Company-operated stores aggregated approximately

36.9 million

square feet. Almost all of these stores are leased, with one or more renewal options after our initial term. Economic terms vary by type of location.

We own approximately 1.2 million square feet of corporate office space located in San Francisco, San Bruno, and Rocklin, California, of which approximately 448,000 square feet is leased to and occupied by others. We lease approximately 915,000 square feet of corporate office space located in San Francisco,  Rocklin, Petaluma, and Los Angeles, California; New York, New York; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  We also lease regional offices in North America and in various international locations. We own approximately 8.6 million square feet of distribution space located in Fresno, California; Fishkill, New York; Groveport, Ohio; Gallatin, Tennessee; Brampton, Ontario, Canada; and Rugby, England. Of the 8.6 million square feet of owned distribution space, 100,000 square feet is leased to others. We lease approximately 2.4 million square feet of distribution space located in Phoenix, Arizona; Grove City, Ohio; Northern Kentucky; Bolton, Ontario, Canada; and Stafford, England. Third-party logistics companies provide logistics services to us through distribution warehouses in Chiba, Japan; Shanghai and Hong Kong, China; and Edison, New Jersey.

In January 2013, we announced that we will not renew our lease agreement for a significant portion of the Northern Kentucky distribution space when it expires in June 2013.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

As a multinational company, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims (“Actions”) arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, intellectual property, customer, employment, data privacy, and securities-related claims, including class action lawsuits. The plaintiffs in some Actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages, and some are covered in part by insurance.

We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of Actions brought against us. Accordingly, developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement, or resolution. However, we do not believe that the outcome of any current Action would have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.

Not applicable.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Overview

We are a global retailer offering apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, children, and babies under the Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Piperlime, Athleta, and Intermix brands. We have Company-operated stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Japan, and beginning in November 2010, China and Italy. We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in many other countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. In addition, our products are available to customers online in over 80 countries. Most of the products sold under our brand names are designed by us and manufactured by independent sources. We also sell products that are designed and manufactured by branded third parties, especially at our Piperlime and Intermix brands.

We identify our operating segments based on the way we manage and evaluate our business activities. As of

February 2, 2013

, we have

two

reportable segments: Stores and Direct.

We are pleased with our fiscal 2012 results. We delivered against our stated priorities to drive increased sales with healthy merchandise margins, prudently invest in our business, grow earnings per share, and return excess cash to shareholders. We delivered positive comparable sales in North America for Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy in each of the four quarters of fiscal 2012. We executed on key expansion initiatives with 25 new Athleta stores, more than 30 new Gap stores in China, and our first Old Navy store in Japan. We generated

$1.3 billion

of free cash flow and distributed

$1.3 billion

to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. For a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure, from a GAAP financial measure, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.

Fiscal 2012 consisted of 53 weeks versus 52 weeks in fiscal 2011 and 2010. Net sales and operating results, as well as other metrics derived from the Consolidated Statement of Income, include the impact of the additional week; however, the comparable sales calculation excludes the 53rd week.

Financial results for

fiscal 2012

are as follows:

•

Net sales for

fiscal 2012

increased

$1.1 billion

to

$15.7 billion

compared with

$14.5 billion

to

$2.33

for

fiscal 2012

compared with

$1.56

for

fiscal 2011

.

•

In

fiscal 2012

, we generated free cash flow of

$1.3 billion

compared with free cash flow of

$815 million

for

fiscal 2011

.

•

During

fiscal 2012

, we repurchased about

34 million

shares for

$1.0 billion

and paid cash dividends of

$240 million

.

In October 2012, we announced a new global brand structure that will guide our long-term growth strategies and shape our future management structure. Beginning in

fiscal 2013

, we will combine all channels and geographies under one global leader each for Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy. Each global brand president will oversee their brand's specialty, outlet, online, and franchise operations. Our newer brands (Piperlime, Athleta, and Intermix) will be managed within our new Growth, Innovation, and Digital division as part of the new structure.

Our business and financial priorities for

fiscal 2013

are as follows:

•

grow sales with healthy merchandise margins;

•

manage our expenses in a disciplined manner;

•

deliver operating margin expansion and earnings per share growth; and

•

return excess cash to shareholders.



In addition to increasing sales within our existing business, we also plan to grow revenues through our new brands, channels, and geographies, including the following:

•

opening additional stores in Asia with a focus on Gap China and Old Navy Japan;

•

expanding our global outlet presence;

•

continuing to open franchise stores worldwide; and

•

opening additional Athleta stores.

In

fiscal 2013

, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.52 to $2.60.

Results of Operations

Net Sales

Net sales primarily consist of retail sales, online sales, and franchise revenues.

See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for net sales by brand, region, and reportable segment.

Comparable Sales

The percentage change in comparable ("Comp") sales by brand and region and for total Company, including the associated comparable online sales, as compared with the preceding year, is as follows:

The percentage change in Comp store sales by brand and region and for total Company, excluding the associated comparable online sales, as compared with the preceding year, is as follows:

Only Company-operated stores are included in the calculations of Comp sales. Gap and Banana Republic outlet Comp sales are reflected within the respective results of each brand. The calculation of total Company Comp sales excludes the results of our franchise business, Piperlime, Athleta, and Intermix.

A store is included in the Comp sales calculations when it has been open and operated by Gap, Inc. for at least one calendar year and the selling square footage has not changed by 15 percent or more within the past year. A store is included in the Comp sales calculations on the first day it has comparable prior year sales. Stores in which the selling square footage has changed by 15 percent or more as a result of a remodel, expansion, or reduction are excluded from the Comp sales calculations until the first day they have comparable prior year sales.

A store is considered non-comparable (“Non-comp”) when it has been open and operated by Gap, Inc. for less than one calendar year or has changed its selling square footage by 15 percent or more within the past year.

A store is considered “Closed” if it is temporarily closed for three or more full consecutive days or is permanently closed. When a temporarily closed store reopens, the store will be placed in the Comp/Non-comp status it was in prior to its closure. If a store was in Closed status for three or more days in the prior year, the store will be in Non-comp status for the same days the following year.

Online Comp sales are defined as sales through online channels in all countries where we have existing Comp store sales.



Current year foreign exchange rates are applied to both current year and prior year Comp sales to achieve a consistent basis for comparison.

Store Count and Square Footage Information

Net sales per average square foot is as follows:

__________

(1)

Excludes net sales associated with our online, catalog, and franchise businesses.

Store count, openings, closings, and square footage for our stores are as follows:

__________

(1)

On December 31, 2012, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Intermix. The 31 stores acquired were not included as store openings for fiscal 2012; however, they are included in the ending number of store locations as of February 2, 2013.

Gap and Banana Republic outlet stores are reflected in each of the respective brands. In addition, we have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap and Banana Republic stores throughout Asia, Australia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa.



In

fiscal 2013

, we expect to open about


Company-operated store locations (about 160 net of repositions) and close about


Company-operated store locations (about 80 net of repositions). We expect square footage for Company-operated stores to increase about

1 percent

for

fiscal 2013

.  We expect our franchisees to open about


franchise stores in

fiscal 2013

.

Net Sales Discussion

Our net sales for

fiscal 2012

increased

$1.1 billion

compared with

fiscal 2011

due to an increase in net sales of $735 million related to our Stores reportable segment and an increase in net sales of $367 million related to our Direct reportable segment. Fiscal 2012 consisted of 53 weeks.

•

For the Stores reportable segment, our net sales for

fiscal 2012

increased $735 million compared with

fiscal 2011

. The increase was primarily due to an increase in Comp store sales, excluding the associated comparable online sales, for North America and incremental sales for new international stores; partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $43 million. The foreign exchange impact is the translation impact if net sales for

fiscal 2011

were translated at

fiscal 2012

exchange rates.

•

For the Direct reportable segment, our net sales for

fiscal 2012

increased $367 million compared with

fiscal 2011

. The increase was due to growth in our online business across all brands and the incremental sales related to new Athleta stores.

In

fiscal 2012

, our net sales (including Direct) for the U.S. and Canada were

$13.3 billion

, an increase of

$914 million

compared with

$12.4 billion

for

fiscal 2011

. In

fiscal 2012

, our net sales (including Direct and franchise), outside of the U.S. and Canada were

$2.4 billion

, an increase of

$188 million

compared with

$2.2 billion

for

fiscal 2011

.

Our net sales for

fiscal 2011

decreased $115 million, or 1 percent, compared with

fiscal 2010

due to a decrease in net sales of $376 million related to our Stores reportable segment, partially offset by an increase in net sales of $261 million related to our Direct reportable segment.

•

For the Stores reportable segment, our net sales for

fiscal 2011

decreased $376 million, or 3 percent, compared with fiscal 2010. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in Comp store sales, excluding the associated comparable online sales, of 6 percent for

fiscal 2011

compared with

fiscal 2010

, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $156 million and an increase in franchise sales. The foreign exchange impact is the translation impact if net sales for

fiscal 2010

were translated at

fiscal 2011

exchange rates.

•

For the Direct reportable segment, our net sales for

fiscal 2011

increased $261 million, or 20 percent, compared with

fiscal 2010

. The increase was due to the growth in our online business across all brands and the incremental sales related to the introduction of international online sales in

fiscal 2010

.

In

fiscal 2011

, our net sales (including Direct) for the U.S. and Canada were $12.4 billion, a decrease of $353 million, or 3 percent, compared with $12.7 billion for

fiscal 2010

. In

fiscal 2011

, our net sales (including Direct and franchise) outside of the U.S. and Canada were $2.2 billion, an increase of $238 million, or 12 percent, compared with $1.9 billion for

fiscal 2010

.

In

fiscal 2013

, we will return to a 52-week fiscal year which could potentially impact the seasonality of net sales throughout the year as a result of the calendar shift of our fiscal quarters in

fiscal 2013

compared with

fiscal 2012

. In addition, we expect foreign exchange rate fluctuations to have a meaningful impact on our net sales generated internationally. For example, if the Japanese yen continues to weaken against the U.S. dollar, our yen-based sales translated into U.S. dollars will vary significantly from prior years and could negatively impact our total Company net sales growth.

Cost of Goods Sold and Occupancy Expenses

Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses decreased 3.2 percentage points in

fiscal 2012

compared with

fiscal 2011

.

•

Cost of goods sold decreased 2.0 percentage points in

fiscal 2012

compared with

fiscal 2011

. The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by decreased cost of merchandise as well as improved product acceptance resulting in improved regular price margins.



•

Occupancy expenses decreased 1.2 percentage points in

fiscal 2012

compared with

fiscal 2011

. The decrease in occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by higher net sales without a corresponding increase in occupancy expenses.

Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses increased 4.0 percentage points in

fiscal 2011

compared with

fiscal 2010

.

•

Cost of goods sold increased 3.7 percentage points in

fiscal 2011

compared with

fiscal 2010

. The increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by increased cost of merchandise primarily due to higher cotton prices.

•

Occupancy expenses increased 0.3 percentage points in

fiscal 2011

compared with

fiscal 2010

. The increase in occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by lower net sales for the Stores reportable segment without a corresponding decrease in occupancy expenses, partially offset by higher net sales for the Direct reportable segment without a corresponding increase in occupancy expenses.

Operating Expenses and Operating Margin

Operating expenses increased

$393 million

, or 0.6 percentage points, in

fiscal 2012

compared with

fiscal 2011

. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher marketing expenses driven largely by investments in Gap brand marketing and customer relationship marketing, store payroll and other store-related expenses, and higher bonus expense.

Operating expenses decreased $85 million, or 0.3 percentage points, in

fiscal 2011

compared with

fiscal 2010

. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to higher income from fees earned under the private label and co-branded credit card agreements, partially offset by an increase in marketing expenses.

In

fiscal 2013

, we expect operating margin to be about 13%.

Interest Expense (Reversal)

Interest expense for

fiscal 2012

and


primarily consists of interest expense related to our

$1.25 billion

long-term debt, which was issued in

April 2011

, and

$400 million

term loan, which was funded in

May 2011

and repaid in full in

August 2012

.

Interest expense for

fiscal 2010

includes an interest expense reversal of

$15 million

from the reduction of interest expense accruals resulting primarily from the filing of a U.S. federal income tax accounting method change application and the resolution of the Internal Revenue Service's review of the Company's federal income tax returns and refund claims for fiscal 2001 through 2006.

Income Taxes

The decrease in the effective tax rate for

fiscal 2012

compared with

fiscal 2011

was the result of slight changes in the individual components of the effective tax rate. The changes were primarily due to the impact of higher federal tax credits, which were partially offset by an increase in our state taxes as a result of changes in the mix of state earnings in

fiscal 2012

.



While the effective tax rate for

fiscal 2011

decreased slightly compared with

fiscal 2010

, there were changes in individual components of the effective tax rate. State and other income taxes decreased primarily due to changes in state tax laws and increases in state and federal tax credits. The decreases in these components were offset by the tax impact of foreign operations, which increased primarily due to operating losses in China and Hong Kong for

fiscal 2011

(for which no tax benefit has been provided), and their greater impact due to lower Gap Inc. pre-tax income for

fiscal 2011

, as well as the unfavorable impact of a change in the mix of income between domestic and foreign operations.

We currently expect the fiscal 2013 effective tax rate to be about 39 percent. The actual rate will ultimately depend on several variables, including the mix of income between domestic and international operations, the overall level of income, the potential resolution of outstanding tax contingencies, and changes in tax laws and rates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from the sale of our merchandise. Our primary uses of cash include merchandise inventory purchases, occupancy costs, personnel-related expenses, purchases of property and equipment, payment of taxes, and share repurchases. In addition to share repurchases, we also continue to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends.

In the first quarter of

fiscal 2011

, we made the strategic decision to issue debt in the aggregate amount of

$1.65 billion

. Given favorable market conditions and our history of generating consistent and strong operating cash flow, we took this step to provide a more optimal capital structure. We remain committed to maintaining a strong financial profile with ample liquidity. Proceeds from the debt issuance were available for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. During fiscal 2012, we repaid our $400 million, five-year, unsecured term loan in full.

We consider the following to be measures of our liquidity and capital resources:

As of

February 2, 2013

, about half of our cash and cash equivalents were held in the U.S. and are generally accessible without any limitations.

We believe that current cash balances and cash flows from our operations will be sufficient to support our business operations, including growth initiatives and planned capital expenditures, for the next 12 months and beyond. We are also able to supplement near-term liquidity, if necessary, with our

$500 million

revolving credit facility.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities during

fiscal 2012

increased $573 million compared with

fiscal 2011

, primarily due to the following:

•

an increase in net income in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011;

•

an increase related to income taxes payable, net of prepaid income taxes and other tax-related items, in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 primarily due to the timing of tax payments;

•

an increase related to accrued expenses and other current liabilities in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 primarily due to a higher bonus accrual in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011; and

•

an increase related to accounts payable in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 primarily due to the volume and timing of payments; partially offset by

•

an increase in merchandise inventory in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 primarily due to the timing of inventory receipts.

Net cash provided by operating activities during

fiscal 2011

decreased $381 million compared with

fiscal 2010

, primarily due to the following:

•

a decrease in net income in

fiscal 2011

compared with

fiscal 2010

.



We fund inventory expenditures during normal and peak periods through cash flows from operating activities and available cash. Our business follows a seasonal pattern, with sales peaking over a total of about eight weeks during the end-of-year holiday period. The seasonality of our operations, combined with the calendar shift of weeks in fiscal 2013 compared with

fiscal 2012

as a result of the 53rd week in

fiscal 2012

, may lead to significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts between fiscal year-end and subsequent interim periods.

In

fiscal 2013

, we expect depreciation and amortization, net of amortization of lease incentives, to be about $475 million.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Our cash outflows for investing activities are primarily for capital expenditures and purchases of investments, while cash inflows are primarily proceeds from maturities of investments. Net cash used for investing activities during

fiscal 2012

increased $390 million compared with

fiscal 2011

, primarily due to the following:

•

$50 million of net purchases of short-term investments in fiscal 2012 compared with $100 million of net maturities in fiscal 2011;

•

$129 million used for the acquisition of Intermix in fiscal 2012; and

•

$111 million more property and equipment purchases in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011.

Net cash used for investing activities during

fiscal 2011

increased $25 million compared with

fiscal 2010

, primarily due to the following:

•

$25 million less net maturities of short-term investments in

fiscal 2011

compared with

fiscal 2010

.

In

fiscal 2012

, capital expenditures were $659 million. In

fiscal 2013

, we expect capital expenditures to be about

$675 million

.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Our cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of the repurchases of our common stock, repayments of debt,  and dividend payments. Cash inflows primarily consist of proceeds from the issuance of debt and proceeds from issuances under share-based compensation plans, net of withholding tax payments. Net cash used for financing activities during

fiscal 2012

increased $879 million compared with

fiscal 2011

, primarily due to the following:

•

$1.6 billion of proceeds from our issuance of long-term debt in fiscal 2011; and

•

$400 million of payments of long-term debt in fiscal 2012; partially offset by

•

$1.1 billion less repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011.

Net cash used for financing activities during

fiscal 2011

decreased $1.5 billion compared with

fiscal 2010

, primarily due to the following:

•

$1.6 billion of proceeds from our issuance of long-term debt in

fiscal 2011

; partially offset by

•

$133 million more repurchases of common stock in

fiscal 2011

compared with

fiscal 2010

.

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe free cash flow is an important metric because it represents a measure of how much cash a company has available for discretionary and non-discretionary items after the deduction of capital expenditures, as we require regular capital expenditures to build and maintain stores and purchase new equipment to improve our business. We use this metric internally, as we believe our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an important driver of value creation. However, this non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to supersede or replace our GAAP result.

The following table reconciles free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, from a GAAP financial measure.



Long-Term Debt

In April 2011, we issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.95 percent notes (the “Notes”) due April 2021 and received proceeds of $1.24 billion in cash, net of underwriting and other fees. Interest is payable semi-annually on April 12 and October 12 of each year and commenced on October 12, 2011. We have an option to call the Notes in whole or in part at any time, subject to a make whole premium. The Notes agreement is unsecured and does not contain any financial covenants.

In April 2011, we also entered into a $400 million, five-year, unsecured term loan due April 2016, which was funded in May 2011. Repayments of $40 million were payable on April 7 of each year, commencing on April 7, 2012, with a final repayment of $240 million due on April 7, 2016. In addition, interest was payable at least quarterly based on an interest rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin based on our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings. In April 2012, we repaid

$40 million

on the term loan and in August 2012, we repaid the remaining

$360 million

reducing the outstanding balance on the term loan to zero.

Credit Facilities

We have a $500 million, five-year, unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Facility”), which is scheduled to expire in April 2016. The Facility is available for general corporate purposes including working capital, trade letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. The Facility fees fluctuate based on our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio. If we were to draw on the Facility, interest would be a base rate (typically LIBOR) plus a margin based on our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio on the unpaid principal amount. To maintain availability of funds under the Facility, we pay a facility fee on the full facility amount, regardless of usage. As of

February 2, 2013

, there were

no

borrowings under the Facility. The net availability of the Facility, reflecting

$30 million

of outstanding standby letters of credit, was

$470 million

as of

February 2, 2013

.

On April 7, 2011, we obtained long-term senior unsecured credit ratings from Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”). Moody’s assigned a rating of Baa3, and Fitch assigned a rating of BBB-. Standard & Poor’s Rating Service (“Standard & Poor’s”) continues to rate us BB+. As of

February 2, 2013

, there were no changes in these credit ratings. Any future reduction in the Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s ratings would increase any future interest expense if we were to draw on the Facility. If a one notch reduction in our Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s ratings were to occur during

fiscal 2013

, the increase in our interest expense for

fiscal 2013

would be immaterial.

We also have two separate agreements to make unsecured revolving credit facilities available for our operations in China (the “China Facilities”). The China Facilities are uncommitted and are available for borrowings, overdraft borrowings, and the issuance of bank guarantees. The

196 million

Chinese yuan China Facilities expired in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and they were subsequently renewed with an increased availability of

250 million

Chinese yuan (

$40 million

as of

February 2, 2013

) and no expiration date. As of

February 2, 2013

, there were

no

borrowings under the China Facilities. There were

24 million

Chinese yuan (

$4 million

as of

February 2, 2013

) in bank guarantees related to store leases under the China Facilities as of

February 2, 2013

. The China Facility agreements do not contain any financial covenants.

As of

February 2, 2013

, we also had a

$50 million

, two-year, unsecured committed letter of credit agreement with an expiration date of

September 2014

. As of

February 2, 2013

, we had

no

material trade letters of credit issued under this letter of credit agreement. Trade letters of credit represent a payment undertaking guaranteed by a bank on our behalf to pay a vendor a given amount of money upon presentation of specific documents demonstrating that merchandise has shipped.

The Facility and letter of credit agreement contain financial and other covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on liens and subsidiary debt, as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios—a minimum annual fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.00 and a maximum annual leverage ratio of 2.25. As of

February 2, 2013

, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Violation of these covenants could result in a default under the Facility and letter of credit agreement, which would permit the participating banks to terminate our ability to access the Facility for letters of credit and advances, terminate our ability to request letters of credit under the letter of credit agreement, require the immediate repayment of any outstanding advances under the Facility, and require the immediate posting of cash collateral in support of any outstanding letters of credit under the letter of credit agreement.

Dividend Policy

In determining whether and at what level to declare a dividend, we consider a number of factors including sustainability, operating performance, liquidity, and market conditions.

We increased our annual dividend, which had been

$0.45

per share for

fiscal 2011

, to

$0.50

per share for

fiscal 2012

. We intend to increase our annual dividend to $0.60 per share for

fiscal 2013

.



Share Repurchases

Between February 2010 and February 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a total of

$5.25 billion

for share repurchases, all of which was completed by the end of December 2012. In January 2013, we announced that the Board of Directors approved a new

$1 billion

share repurchase authorization, of which

$975 million

was remaining as of

February 2, 2013

.

During

fiscal 2012

, we repurchased approximately

34 million

shares for

$1.0 billion

, including commissions, at an average price per share of

$29.89

.

Contractual Cash Obligations

We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. The following table provides summary information concerning our future contractual obligations as of

February 2, 2013

. These obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, while others are disclosed as future obligations.

__________

(1)

Represents principal maturities, excluding interest. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)

Excludes $102 million of long-term liabilities recorded in lease incentives and other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

February 2, 2013

, as the amount relates to uncertain tax positions and we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur.

(3)

Excludes maintenance, insurance, taxes, and contingent rent obligations. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our operating leases.

(4)

Represents estimated open purchase orders to purchase inventory as well as commitments for products and services used in the normal course of business.

Commercial Commitments

We have commercial commitments, not reflected in the table above, that were incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations, including standby letters of credit of

$97 million

(of which

$30 million

was issued under the Facility), surety bonds of

$38 million

, and bank guarantees of

$12 million

outstanding as of

February 2, 2013

.

Other Cash Obligations Not Reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet (Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements)

The majority of our contractual obligations relate to operating leases for our stores. Future minimum lease payments represent commitments under non-cancelable operating leases and are disclosed in the table above with additional information provided in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our other off-balance sheet arrangements are disclosed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. In many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. We maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large, global corporation. However, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information.



Our significant accounting policies can be found in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, which has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Merchandise Inventory

We value inventory at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”), with cost determined using the weighted-average cost method. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes or colors) and we primarily use markdowns to clear merchandise. We record an adjustment to inventory when future estimated selling price is less than cost. Our LCM adjustment calculation requires management to make assumptions to estimate the selling price and amount of slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments subject to markdowns, which is dependent upon factors such as historical trends with similar merchandise, inventory aging, forecasted consumer demand, and the promotional environment. In addition, we estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date. Our shortage estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends. Historically, actual shortage has not differed materially from our estimates.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our LCM or inventory shortage adjustments. However, if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or actual physical inventory shortage differs significantly from our estimate, our operating results could be affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to calculate our LCM or inventory shortage adjustments in the past three fiscal years.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill, and Intangible Assets

We review the carrying amount of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include the decision to close a store, corporate facility, or distribution center, or a significant decrease in the operating performance of the long-lived asset. Long-lived assets are considered impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group are less than the carrying amount. For impaired assets, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or asset group and its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of the asset or asset group is based on estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group using a discount rate commensurate with the risk. The asset group is defined as the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available, which for retail stores is at the store level. Our estimate of future cash flows requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses and estimating useful lives of the assets. These estimates can be affected by factors such as future store results, real estate demand, and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. We have not made any material changes in the methodology to assess and calculate impairment of long-lived assets in the past three fiscal years. We recorded a charge for the impairment of long-lived assets of

$8 million

,

$16 million

, and

$8 million

for

fiscal 2012

,


, and


, respectively.

We also review the carrying amount of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include significant changes in the business climate, declines in our operating results, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

In connection with the acquisitions of Athleta in September 2008 and Intermix in December 2012, we allocated $99 million and $85 million of the respective purchase prices to goodwill. The carrying amount of goodwill was

$184 million

as of

February 2, 2013

. We review goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it is unnecessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test is required to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the two-step goodwill impairment test is required to measure the goodwill impairment loss. The second step includes hypothetically valuing all the tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Then, the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying amount.



A reporting unit is an operating segment or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. We have deemed our Direct operating segment to be the reporting unit at which goodwill is tested for Athleta and for fiscal 2012, we have identified Intermix as the reporting unit at which goodwill is tested for Intermix. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and we did not recognize any impairment charges. We determined that as of the date of our annual impairment review, the fair value of goodwill attributable to Athleta significantly exceeded its carrying amount, and it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the Direct reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The fair value of the goodwill attributable to Intermix, as determined on December 31, 2012 (the date of acquisition), is equal to its carrying amount as of

February 2, 2013

.

In connection with the acquisitions of Athleta in September 2008 and Intermix in December 2012, we allocated $54 million  and $38 million of the respective purchase prices to trade names. The carrying amount of the trade names was

$92 million

as of

February 2, 2013

. A trade name is considered impaired if the estimated fair value of the trade name is less than the carrying amount. If a trade name is considered impaired, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the trade name. The fair value of the trade names is determined using the relief from royalty method. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we completed our annual impairment review of the trade names and we did not recognize any impairment charges. The fair value of the Athleta trade name significantly exceeded its carrying amount as of the date of our annual impairment review. The fair value of the Intermix trade name, as determined on December 31, 2012 (the date of acquisition), is equal to its carrying amount as of

February 2, 2013

.

These analyses require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses, and selecting appropriate discount rates and royalty rates, which can be affected by economic conditions and other factors that can be difficult to predict.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment losses of long-lived assets, goodwill, and intangible assets. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in the calculations, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material.

Revenue Recognition

While revenue recognition for the Company does not involve significant judgment, it represents an important accounting policy. We recognize revenue and the related cost of goods sold at the time the products are received by the customers. For store sales, revenue is recognized when the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register, primarily with either cash, debit card, or credit card. For sales from our online and catalog business, revenue is recognized at the time we estimate the customer receives the merchandise. We record an allowance for estimated returns based on our historical return patterns and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable.

We sell merchandise to franchisees under multi-year franchise agreements. We recognize revenue from sales to franchisees at the time merchandise ownership is transferred to the franchisee, which generally occurs when the merchandise reaches the franchisee’s pre-designated turnover point. We also receive royalties from franchisees based on a percentage of the total merchandise purchased by the franchisee, net of any refunds or credits due them. Royalty revenue is recognized when merchandise ownership is transferred to the franchisee.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales return reserve. However, if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly, our operating results could be adversely affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate future sales returns in the past three fiscal years.

Unredeemed Gift Cards, Gift Certificates, and Credit Vouchers

Upon issuance of a gift card, gift certificate, or credit voucher, a liability is established for its cash value. The liability is relieved and net sales are recorded upon redemption by the customer. Over time, some portion of these instruments is not redeemed (“breakage”). We determine breakage income for gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers based on historical redemption patterns. Breakage income is recorded in other income, which is a component of operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, when we can determine the portion of the liability where redemption is remote, which is three years after the gift card, gift certificate, or credit voucher is issued. When breakage income is recorded, a liability is recognized for any legal obligation to remit the unredeemed portion to relevant jurisdictions. Our gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers do not have expiration dates.



We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our breakage income. However, if the actual rate of redemption for gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers increases significantly, our operating results could be adversely affected. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate breakage income in the past three fiscal years.

Income Taxes

We record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future income, taxable income, and the mix of income or losses in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may also be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of income or losses, changes in the expected outcome of audits, or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance.

At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits.

We believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We operate in foreign countries, which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our risk management policy is to hedge the following using foreign exchange forward contracts: (1) a significant portion of forecasted merchandise purchases denominated primarily in U.S. dollars made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currencies are their local currencies; (2) forecasted intercompany royalty payments; (3) forecasted intercompany revenue transactions related to merchandise sold from our regional purchasing entity, whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, to certain international subsidiaries in their local currencies; and (4) intercompany obligations that bear foreign exchange risk. We also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the net assets of international subsidiaries to offset the foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our investment in the subsidiaries. These contracts are entered into with large, reputable financial institutions that are monitored for counterparty risk. The principal currencies hedged against changes in the U.S. dollar are British pounds, Canadian dollars, Euro, and Japanese yen. Our use of derivative financial instruments represents risk management; we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for trading purposes. Additional information is presented in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our derivative financial instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value as of the balance sheet dates. As of

February 2, 2013

, we had foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding related to our forecasted merchandise purchases for foreign operations, forecasted intercompany royalty payments, forecasted intercompany revenue transactions, and intercompany obligations that bear foreign exchange risk to buy the notional amounts of

$988 million

and

31 million

British pounds. As of

February 2, 2013

, we had foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to hedge the net assets of our subsidiaries in the notional amount of

25 million

Euro.

We have performed a sensitivity analysis as of

February 2, 2013

based on a model that measures the impact of a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the level of foreign currency exchange rates to U.S. dollars (with all other variables held constant) on our underlying exposure, net of derivative financial instruments. The foreign currency exchange rates used in the model were based on the spot rates in effect as of

February 2, 2013

. The sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have an unfavorable impact on the underlying cash flow exposure, net of our foreign exchange derivative financial instruments, of $33 million as of

February 2, 2013

.



Long-Term Debt

In

April 2011

, we issued

$1.25 billion

aggregate principal amount of

5.95 percent

Notes due

April 2021

and received proceeds of

$1.24 billion

in cash, net of underwriting and other fees. Interest is payable semi-annually on April 12 and October 12 of each year and commenced on October 12, 2011. The Notes are not subject to interest rate risk, as they have a fixed interest rate.

Cash Equivalents

We have highly liquid fixed and variable income investments classified as cash equivalents, which are placed primarily in money market funds, time deposits, and commercial paper. These investments are classified as held-to-maturity based on our positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. We value these investments at their original purchase prices plus interest that has accrued at the stated rate. The value of our investments is not subject to material interest rate risk. However, changes in interest rates would impact the interest income derived from our investments. We earned interest income of

$6 million

in

fiscal 2012

.

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Gap, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Gap, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended February 2, 2013. We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Gap, Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended February 2, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2013, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission

Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization

The Gap, Inc., a Delaware Corporation, is a global retailer offering apparel, accessories, and personal care products for men, women, children, and babies under the Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Piperlime, Athleta, and Intermix brands. We have Company-operated stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Japan, and beginning in November 2010, China and Italy. We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in Asia, Australia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. In addition, our products are available to customers online in over 80 countries.

We identify our operating segments based on the way we manage and evaluate our business activities. As of

February 2, 2013

, we have

two

reportable segments: Stores and Direct.

Principles of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of The Gap, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Fiscal Year and Presentation

Our fiscal year is a 52-week or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. The fiscal year ended

February 2, 2013

(

fiscal 2012

) consisted of 53 weeks. The fiscal years ended

January 28, 2012

(

fiscal 2011

) and

January 29, 2011

(

fiscal 2010

) consisted of 52 weeks.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

Cash includes funds deposited in banks as well as amounts in transit from banks for customer credit card and debit card transactions that process in less than seven days. The majority of these amounts are processed within five business days.

All highly liquid investments with original maturities of 91 days or less are classified as cash equivalents. Highly liquid investments with original maturities of greater than 91 days that will mature less than one year from the balance sheet date are classified as short-term investments. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments are placed primarily in money market funds, time deposits, and commercial paper and are classified as held-to-maturity based on our positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. We value these investments at their original purchase prices plus interest that has accrued at the stated rate. Income related to these securities is recorded in interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists primarily of cash that serves as collateral for our insurance obligations. Any cash that is legally restricted from use is classified as restricted cash. If the purpose of restricted cash relates to acquiring a long-term asset, liquidating a long-term liability, or is otherwise unavailable for a period longer than one year from the balance sheet date, the restricted cash is included in other long-term assets. Otherwise, restricted cash is included in other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Merchandise Inventory

We value inventory at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using the weighted-average cost method. We record an adjustment when future estimated selling price is less than cost. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes or colors) and use markdowns to clear merchandise. In addition, we estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date.



Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as other current assets, other long-term assets, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, or lease incentives and other long-term liabilities.

For derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative financial instruments is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and is recognized in income in the period in which the underlying transaction occurs. For derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative financial instruments is reported as a component of OCI and is reclassified into income in the period or periods during which the hedged subsidiary is either sold or liquidated (or substantially liquidated). Gains and losses on the derivative financial instruments representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, if any, are recognized in current income. For derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the gain or loss on the derivative financial instruments is recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Cash flows from derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Property and Equipment

Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Estimated useful lives are as follows:

When assets are sold or retired, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, with any resulting gain or loss recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Costs of maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.

Lease Rights, Key Money, and Favorable Lease Assets

Lease rights are costs incurred to acquire the right to lease a specific property. A majority of our lease rights are related to premiums paid to landlords. Key money is the amount of funds paid to a landlord or tenant to acquire the rights of tenancy under a commercial property lease for a property located in France. These rights can be subsequently sold by us to a new tenant or the amount of key money paid can potentially be recovered from the landlord should the landlord refuse to allow the automatic right of renewal to be exercised. Lease rights and key money are recorded at cost and are amortized over the corresponding lease term. Lease rights and key money are recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of related amortization.

In connection with our acquisition of Intermix, we acquired favorable lease assets as a result of leases with terms that were considered favorable relative to market terms for similar leases as of the date of acquisition. The favorable lease assets will be recognized as rent expense in cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining term of the leases.

Insurance and Self-Insurance

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risk management activities including workers’ compensation, general liability, and employee-related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by our employees. Undiscounted liabilities associated with these risks are estimated based primarily on actuarially-determined amounts and are accrued in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions.



Asset Retirement Obligations

An asset retirement obligation represents a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that is incurred upon the acquisition, construction, development, or normal operation of that long-lived asset. The Company’s asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with leasehold improvements that we are contractually obligated to remove at the end of a lease to comply with the lease agreement. We recognize asset retirement obligations at the inception of a lease with such conditions if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The asset retirement obligation is recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and lease incentives and other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is subsequently adjusted for changes in estimated asset retirement obligations. The associated estimated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset and depreciated over its useful life.

Treasury Stock

We account for treasury stock under the cost method, using the first-in, first-out flow assumption, and we include treasury stock as a component of stockholders’ equity.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue and the related cost of goods sold at the time the products are received by the customers. Revenue is recognized for store sales when the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register. For sales through online and catalog orders, we estimate and defer recognition of revenue and the related product costs for shipments that are in-transit to the customer. Revenue is recognized at the time we estimate the customer receives the product, which is typically within a few days of shipment. Amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to customers are recorded in net sales, and the related costs are recorded in cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Revenues are presented net of estimated returns and any taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities. Allowances for estimated returns are recorded based on estimated margin using our historical return patterns.

We sell merchandise to franchisees under multi-year franchise agreements. We recognize revenue from sales to franchisees at the time merchandise ownership is transferred to the franchisee, which generally occurs when the merchandise reaches the franchisee’s pre-designated turnover point. These sales are recorded in net sales, and the related cost of goods sold is recorded in cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We also receive royalties from franchisees based on a percentage of the total merchandise purchased by the franchisee, net of any refunds or credits due them. Royalty revenue is recognized when merchandise ownership is transferred to the franchisee and is recorded in net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Classification of Expenses

Cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses include the following:

•

the cost of merchandise;

•

inventory shortage and valuation adjustments;

•

freight charges;

•

shipping and handling costs;

•

costs associated with our sourcing operations, including payroll and related benefits;

•

production costs;

•

insurance costs related to merchandise; and

•

rent, occupancy, depreciation, and amortization related to our store operations, distribution centers, and certain corporate functions.

Operating expenses include the following:

•

payroll and related benefits (for our store operations, field management, distribution centers, and corporate functions);

•

marketing;

•

general and administrative expenses;

•

costs to design and develop our products;

•

merchandise handling and receiving in distribution centers;

•

distribution center general and administrative expenses;

•

rent, occupancy, depreciation, and amortization for our corporate facilities; and



•

other expenses (income).

The classification of expenses varies across the apparel retail industry. Accordingly, our cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses and operating expenses may not be comparable to those of other companies. Merchandise handling and receiving expenses and distribution center general and administrative expenses recorded in operating expenses were

$231 million

,

$224 million

, and

$226 million

in

fiscal 2012

,


, and


, respectively.

Rent Expense

Minimum rent expense is recognized over the term of the lease. We recognize minimum rent starting when possession of the property is taken from the landlord, which normally includes a construction period prior to the store opening. When a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent, we recognize the related rent expense on a straight-line basis and record the difference between the recognized rent expense and the amounts payable under the lease as a short-term or long-term deferred rent liability. We also receive tenant allowances upon entering into certain leases, which are recorded as a short-term or long-term tenant allowance liability and amortized using the straight-line method as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease. A co-tenancy failure by our landlord during the lease term may result in a reduction of the required cash payments made to the landlord for the duration of the co-tenancy failure and is recorded as a reduction to rent expense as the reduced cash payments are made. Future payments for common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, and other occupancy costs the Company is obligated to make are excluded from minimum lease payments.

Certain leases provide for contingent rents that are not measurable at inception. These contingent rents are primarily based on a percentage of sales that are in excess of a predetermined level and/or rent increase based on a change in the consumer price index or fair market value. These amounts are excluded from minimum rent and are included in the determination of rent expense when it is probable that the expense has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We review the carrying amount of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include the decision to close a store, corporate facility, or distribution center, or a significant decrease in the operating performance of the long-lived asset. Long-lived assets are considered impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group are less than the carrying amount. For impaired assets, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or asset group and its estimated fair value, which is recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The estimated fair value of the asset or asset group is based on discounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group using a discount rate commensurate with the risk. The asset group is defined as the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available, which for retail stores is at the store level.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

We review the carrying amount of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events that result in an impairment review include significant changes in the business climate, declines in our operating results, or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We assess potential impairment by considering present economic conditions as well as future expectations.

We review goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it is unnecessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test is required to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the two-step goodwill impairment test is required to measure the goodwill impairment loss. The second step includes hypothetically valuing all the tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Then, the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying amount.



A trade name is considered impaired if the estimated fair value of the trade name is less than the carrying amount. If a trade name is considered impaired, we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the trade name. The fair value of a trade name is determined using the relief from royalty method, which requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses, and selecting appropriate discount rates and royalty rates.

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, including the trade names, are recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Lease Losses

The decision to close a store, corporate facility, or distribution center can result in accelerated depreciation and amortization over the revised remaining useful lives of the associated long-lived assets. In addition, upon exiting leased premises, we record a charge and corresponding lease loss reserve equal to the incremental amount of the present value of the net future obligation greater than the remaining rent-related deferred balances. The net future obligation is determined as the remaining contractual rent obligations less the amount for which we are able to or expect to be able to sublease the properties. We estimate the amount for which we expect to be able to sublease the properties based on the status of our efforts to sublease vacant office space and stores, a review of real estate market conditions, our projections for sublease income, and our assumptions regarding sublease commencement. Lease losses are recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Pre-Opening Costs

Pre-opening and start-up activity costs, which include rent and occupancy, supplies, advertising, and payroll expenses incurred prior to the opening of a new store or other facility, are expensed in the period in which they occur.

Advertising

Costs associated with the production of advertising, such as writing, copy, printing, and other costs, are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with communicating advertising that has been produced, such as television and magazine costs, are expensed when the advertising event takes place. Advertising expense was

$653 million

,

$548 million

, and

$516 million

in

fiscal 2012

,


, and


, respectively, and is recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Prepaid catalog expense consists of the cost to prepare, print, and distribute catalogs. Such costs are amortized over their expected period of future benefit, which is approximately one to five months.

Share-Based Compensation

Share-based compensation expense for stock options and other stock awards is determined based on the grant-date fair value. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, which requires the input of subjective assumptions regarding the expected term, expected volatility, dividend yield, and risk-free interest rate. For units granted whereby one share of common stock is issued for each unit as the unit vests (“Stock Units”), the fair value is determined based on the Company’s stock price on the date of grant less future expected dividends during the vesting period. For stock options and Stock Units, we recognize share-based compensation cost net of estimated forfeitures and revise the estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as expected future behavior. Share-based compensation expense is recorded primarily in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for stock options and Stock Units.

Unredeemed Gift Cards, Gift Certificates, and Credit Vouchers

Upon issuance of a gift card, gift certificate, or credit voucher, a liability is established for its cash value. The liability is relieved and net sales are recorded upon redemption by the customer. Over time, some portion of these instruments is not redeemed. We determine breakage income for gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers based on historical redemption patterns. Breakage income is recorded in other income, which is a component of operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, when we can determine the portion of the liability where redemption is remote. Based on our historical information, three years after the gift card, gift certificate, or credit voucher is issued, we can determine the portion of the liability where redemption is remote. When breakage income is recorded, a liability is recognized for any legal obligation to remit the unredeemed portion of gift certificates and credit vouchers to relevant jurisdictions. Our gift cards, gift certificates, and credit vouchers do not have expiration dates.



Credit Cards

We have credit card agreements (the “Agreements”) with third parties to provide our customers with private label credit cards and/or co-branded credit cards (collectively, the “Credit Cards”). Each private label credit card bears the logo of Gap, Old Navy, or Banana Republic and can be used at any of our U.S. or Canadian store locations and online. The co-branded credit card is a VISA credit card bearing the logo of Gap, Old Navy, or Banana Republic and can be used everywhere VISA credit cards are accepted. A third-party financing company is the sole owner of the accounts issued under the Credit Card programs, and this third party absorbs the losses associated with non-payment by the cardholder and a portion of any fraudulent usage of the accounts. We receive cash from the third-party financing company in accordance with the Agreements and based on usage of the Credit Cards. We also receive payment from Visa U.S.A. Inc. in accordance with the Agreements and based on specified transactional fees. We recognize income for such cash receipts when the amounts are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured, which is generally the time at which the actual usage of the Credit Cards or specified transaction occurs. The income is recorded in other income, which is a component of operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

The Credit Card programs offer incentives to cardholders in the form of reward certificates upon the cumulative purchase of an established amount. The cost associated with reward points and certificates is accrued as the rewards are earned by the cardholder and is recorded in cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Other administrative costs related to the Credit Card programs, including payroll, marketing expenses, and other direct costs, are recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed as net income divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed as net income divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period including common stock equivalents. Common stock equivalents consist of shares subject to share-based awards with exercise prices less than the average market price of our common stock for the period, to the extent their inclusion would be dilutive. Stock options and other stock awards that contain performance conditions are not included in the calculation of common stock equivalents until such performance conditions have been achieved.

Foreign Currency

Our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the functional currency and translate their assets and liabilities at the current rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses from their operations are translated using the monthly average exchange rates in effect during the period in which the transactions occur. The resulting gains and losses from translation are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and in accumulated OCI in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the local functional currency are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The aggregate transaction gains and losses included in the Consolidated Statements of Income were as follows:

Comprehensive Income

In the first quarter of

fiscal 2012

, we adopted the revised requirements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") to present comprehensive income in a separate statement. Comprehensive income is comprised of net income and other gains and losses affecting equity that are excluded from net income. The components of OCI consist of foreign currency translation gains and losses, net of tax, changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments, net of tax, and reclassification adjustments for realized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments, net of tax.

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.



Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made.

The Company recognizes interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2012, the FASB issued an accounting standards update (“ASU”) to simplify the manner in which entities may test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The ASU permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. The ASU is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt the provisions of the ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. We do not expect the adoption of the ASU to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In February 2013, the FASB issued an ASU that requires enhanced disclosures around the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The amendments do not change the requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income. The ASU requires an entity to present information about significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income and their corresponding effects on the respective line items in net income. The ASU is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012 and as such, we will adopt the disclosure provisions in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.

, there were

no

changes in the

$99 million

carrying amount of goodwill related to Athleta. The goodwill associated with both Athleta and Intermix is allocated to the Direct reportable segment.

During the fourth quarter of

fiscal 2012

, we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and we did not recognize any impairment charges.

Other Intangible Assets

As discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we allocated

$38 million

to trade name and

$3 million

to intangible assets subject to amortization in connection with our acquisition of Intermix. The intangible assets subject to amortization related to Intermix consist of customer relationships and a non-compete agreement that will be amortized over a period of

four

years and

one

year, respectively. There was no material amortization expense recognized in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income in

fiscal 2012

related to Intermix's intangible assets subject to amortization. The future amortization expense associated with Intermix's intangible assets subject to amortization is

$2 million

in fiscal 2013 and immaterial amounts in each of the following three fiscal years.

During

fiscal 2012

,


, and


, there were

no

changes in the

$54 million

carrying amount of Athleta's trade name. Athleta's intangible assets subject to amortization of

$15 million

, consisting primarily of customer relationships, were fully amortized in

fiscal 2012

. Amortization expense for Athleta's intangible assets subject to amortization was

$1 million

,

$2 million

, and

$4 million

for

fiscal 2012

,


, and


, respectively, and it is recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

During the fourth quarter of

fiscal 2012

, we completed our annual impairment test of trade names and we did not recognize any impairment charges.



Note 5. Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt consists of the following:

In April 2011, we issued

$1.25 billion

aggregate principal amount of

5.95 percent

Notes due

April 2021

and received proceeds of

$1.24 billion

in cash, net of underwriting and other fees of

$11 million

. The net proceeds were available for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock. Interest is payable

semi-annually

on April 12 and October 12 of each year and commenced on October 12, 2011. We have an option to call the Notes in whole or in part at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. The Notes agreement is unsecured and does not contain any financial covenants. The amount recorded in long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the Notes is equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, net of the unamortized discount. As of

February 2, 2013

and

January 28, 2012

, the estimated fair value of the Notes was

$1.41 billion

and

$1.19 billion

, respectively, and was based on the quoted market price of the Notes (level 1 inputs) as of the last business day of the respective fiscal year.

In April 2011, we also entered into a

$400 million

,

five

-year, unsecured term loan due

April 2016

, which was funded in May 2011. Repayments of

$40 million

were payable on April 7 of each year, commencing on April 7, 2012, with a final repayment of

$240 million

due on April 7, 2016. In addition, interest was payable at least

quarterly

based on an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin based on our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings. The average interest rate during fiscal 2012 and 2011 was

2 percent

. In April 2012, we repaid

$40 million

on the term loan and in August 2012, we repaid the remaining

$360 million

reducing the outstanding balance on the term loan to

zero

. The estimated fair value of the term loan was

$400 million

as of

January 28, 2012

. The carrying amount of the term loan as of

January 28, 2012

approximated its fair value, as the interest rate varied depending on quoted market rates (level 1 inputs) and our credit rating.

Note 6. Credit Facilities

Our

$500 million

,

five

-year, unsecured revolving credit Facility, which is scheduled to expire in

April 2016

, is available for general corporate purposes including working capital, trade letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. The Facility fees fluctuate based on our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio. If we were to draw on the Facility, interest would be a base rate (typically LIBOR) plus a margin based on our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings and our leverage ratio on the unpaid principal amount. To maintain availability of funds under the Facility, we pay a facility fee on the full facility amount, regardless of usage. As of

February 2, 2013

, there were

no

borrowings under the Facility. The net availability of the Facility, reflecting

$30 million

of outstanding standby letters of credit, was

$470 million

as of

February 2, 2013

.

In conjunction with our financings in April 2011, we obtained long-term senior unsecured credit ratings from Moody’s and Fitch. Moody’s assigned a rating of

Baa3

, and Fitch assigned a rating of

BBB-

. Standard & Poor’s continued to rate us

BB+

. As of

February 2, 2013

, there were no changes in these credit ratings. Any future reduction in the Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s ratings would increase any future interest expense if we were to draw on the Facility.

The China Facilities are

two

separate agreements to make unsecured revolving credit facilities available for our operations in China; they are uncommitted and are available for borrowings, overdraft borrowings, and the issuance of bank guarantees. The

196 million

Chinese yuan China Facilities expired in October 2012 and they were subsequently renewed with an increased availability of

250 million

Chinese yuan (

$40 million

as of

February 2, 2013

) and no expiration date. As of

February 2, 2013

, there were

no

borrowings under the China Facilities. There were

24 million

Chinese yuan (

$4 million

as of

February 2, 2013

) in bank guarantees related to store leases under the China Facilities as of

February 2, 2013

. The China Facility agreements do not contain any financial covenants. As of

January 28, 2012

, there were borrowings of

$19 million

under the China Facilities, which were recorded in current maturities of debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.



Trade letters of credit represent a payment undertaking guaranteed by a bank on our behalf to pay a vendor a given amount of money upon presentation of specific documents demonstrating that merchandise has shipped. Vendor payables are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the time of merchandise title transfer, although the letters of credit are generally issued prior to the title transfer. As of

February 2, 2013

, we had a

$50 million

,

two

-year, unsecured letter of credit agreement with an expiration date of

September 2014

. As of

February 2, 2013

, we had

no

material trade letters of credit issued under this letter of credit agreement.

The Facility and letter of credit agreement contain financial and other covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on liens and subsidiary debt, as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios—a minimum annual fixed charge coverage ratio of

2.00

and a maximum annual leverage ratio of

2.25

. As of

February 2, 2013

, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Violation of these covenants could result in a default under the Facility and letter of credit agreement, which would permit the participating banks to terminate our ability to access the Facility for letters of credit and advances, terminate our ability to request letters of credit under the letter of credit agreement, require the immediate repayment of any outstanding advances under the Facility, and require the immediate posting of cash collateral in support of any outstanding letters of credit under the letter of credit agreement.

Note 7. Fair Value Measurements

There were

no

purchases, sales, issuances, or settlements related to recurring level 3 measurements during

fiscal 2012

or


. There were

no

transfers into or out of level 1 and level 2 during

fiscal 2012

or


.

Financial Assets and Liabilities

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and cash equivalents and short-term investments held at amortized cost are as follows:

We have highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents and short-term investments, which are placed primarily in money market funds, time deposits, and commercial paper. These investments are classified as held-to-maturity based on our positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. We value these investments at their original purchase prices plus interest that has accrued at the stated rate.



Derivative financial instruments primarily include foreign exchange forward contracts. The principal currencies hedged against changes in the U.S. dollar are British pounds, Canadian dollars, Euro, and Japanese yen. The fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments is determined using pricing models based on current market rates. Derivative financial instruments in an asset position are recorded in other current assets or other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivative financial instruments in a liability position are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or lease incentives and other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We maintain the Gap Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (“DCP”), which allows eligible employees to defer compensation up to a maximum amount. Plan investments are recorded at market value and are designated for the DCP. The fair value of the Company’s DCP assets is determined based on quoted market prices, and the assets are recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Nonfinancial Assets

As discussed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we recorded a charge for the impairment of long-lived assets of

$8 million

,

$16 million

, and

$8 million

in

fiscal 2012

,


, and


, respectively. The impairment charge reduced the then carrying amount of the applicable long-lived assets of

$11 million

,

$21 million

, and

$12 million

to their fair value of

$3 million

,

$5 million

, and

$4 million

during

fiscal 2012

,


, and


, respectively. The fair value of the long-lived assets was determined using level 3 inputs and the valuation techniques discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As discussed in Note 2 of Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements, we acquired favorable lease assets in connection with our acquisition of Intermix. There were

no

impairment charges recorded for favorable lease assets in

fiscal 2012

. The fair value of the favorable lease assets was determined using the with-and-without method, with inputs that included discount rates and annual market rent escalation factors (level 3 inputs).

As discussed in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, there were

no

impairment charges recorded for goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets for

fiscal 2012

,


, or


.

Note 8. Derivative Financial Instruments

We operate in foreign countries, which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our risk management policy is to hedge a portion of our transactions related to merchandise purchases for foreign operations and certain intercompany transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts. The principal currencies hedged against changes in the U.S. dollar are British pounds, Canadian dollars, Euro, and Japanese yen. We do not enter into derivative financial contracts for trading purposes.

Cash Flow Hedges

We designate the following foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedges: (1) forward contracts used to hedge forecasted merchandise purchases and related costs denominated primarily in U.S. dollars made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currencies are their local currencies; (2) forward contracts used to hedge forecasted intercompany royalty payments denominated in Japanese yen and Canadian dollars received by entities whose functional currencies are U.S. dollars; and (3) forward contracts used to hedge forecasted intercompany revenue transactions related to merchandise sold from our regional purchasing entity, whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, to certain international subsidiaries in their local currencies of Euro and British pounds. The foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to hedge forecasted merchandise purchases and related costs, intercompany royalty payments, and intercompany revenue transactions generally have terms of up to 18 months.

During

fiscal 2011

, we entered into and settled treasury rate lock agreements in anticipation of issuing our

5.95 percent

fixed-rate Notes of

$1.25 billion

in April 2011. Prior to the issuance of the Notes, we were subject to changes in interest rates, and we therefore locked into fixed-rate coupons to hedge against the interest rate fluctuations. The gain related to the treasury lock agreements is reported as a component of OCI and is recognized in income over the life of the Notes.

There were

no

material amounts recorded in income for

fiscal 2012

,


, or


as a result of hedge ineffectiveness, hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, or the discontinuance of cash flow hedges because the forecasted transactions were no longer probable.

Net Investment Hedges

We also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the net assets of international subsidiaries to offset the foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our investment in the subsidiaries.



There were

no

amounts recorded in income for

fiscal 2012

,


, or


as a result of hedge ineffectiveness, hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, or the discontinuance of net investment hedges.

Other Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

We use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our market risk exposure associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for certain intercompany balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity with the intercompany balance. The gain or loss on the derivative financial instruments, as well as the remeasurement of the underlying intercompany balances, is recorded in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same period and generally offset. We generally enter into foreign exchange forward contracts as needed to hedge intercompany balances that bear foreign exchange risk.

Outstanding Notional Amounts

As of

February 2, 2013

and

January 28, 2012

, we had foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding in the following notional amounts:

__________

(1)

The principal currencies hedged against changes in the U.S. dollar were British pounds, Canadian dollars, Euro, and Japanese yen.

Contingent Features

We had

no

derivative financial instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features underlying the agreements as of

February 2, 2013

or

January 28, 2012

.



Quantitative Disclosures about Derivative Financial Instruments

The fair values of foreign exchange forward contracts are as follows:

Substantially all of the unrealized gains and losses from designated cash flow hedges as of

February 2, 2013

Share Repurchases

Share repurchase activity is as follows:

In November 2009, the Board of Directors authorized

$500 million

for share repurchases, which was fully utilized by the end of March 2010. In connection with this authorization, we entered into purchase agreements with individual members of the Fisher family (related-party transactions). The Fisher family shares were purchased at the same weighted-average market price that we paid for share repurchases in the open market. During fiscal 2010, approximately

0.5 million

shares were repurchased for

$10 million

from the Fisher family subject to these agreements.

Between February 2010 and February 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a total of

$5.25 billion

for share repurchases, all of which was completed by the end of December 2012. In January 2013, we announced that the Board of Directors approved a new

General Description of Stock Option and Other Stock Award Plans

The 1996 Stock Option and Award Plan (the “1996 Plan”) was established on March 26, 1996 and amended and restated on January 28, 2003. The 1996 Plan was further amended and restated on January 24, 2006 and renamed the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”). The 2006 Plan was amended and restated on August 20, 2008. The 2006 Plan was further amended and restated on May 17, 2011 and renamed the 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan”). Under the 2011 Plan, nonqualified stock options and other stock awards are granted to officers, directors, eligible employees, and consultants at exercise prices or initial values equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant or as determined by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”).

The 2002 Stock Option Plan (the “2002 Plan”) was established on January 1, 1999. The 2002 Plan empowered the Committee to award nonqualified stock options to non-officer employees. On May 9, 2006, the 2002 Plan was discontinued, and those awards then outstanding continued to be subject to the terms of the 2002 Plan under which they were granted. Pursuant to the 2011 Plan, any shares (not to exceed

28,019,786

shares) that otherwise would have been returned to the 2002 Plan after May 9, 2006 on account of expiration, cancellation, or forfeiture of awards granted are available for grant under the 2011 Plan.

As of

February 2, 2013

, there were

216,586,781

shares that have been authorized for issuance under the 2011 Plan, including those shares available for issuance under the 2002 Plan, which have or may become available for issuance under the 2011 Plan.

All shares related to stock options and other stock awards are issued from treasury stock.

Stock Units

Under the 2011 Plan, Stock Units are granted to employees and members of the Board of Directors. Vesting generally occurs over a period of

three

to

four

years of continued service by the employee in equal annual installments. Vesting is immediate in the case of members of the Board of Directors. In some cases, vesting is subject to the attainment of a pre-determined financial target (“Performance Shares”). Performance Shares generally vest over a period of

three

to

four

years.

At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the probability that the Performance Shares will vest. We record share-based compensation expense on an accelerated basis based on the grant-date fair value and the probability that the pre-determined financial target will be achieved.

A summary of Stock Unit activity under the 2011 Plan for

fiscal 2012

is as follows:

A summary of additional information about Stock Units is as follows:

The aggregate intrinsic value of unvested Stock Units as of

February 2, 2013

was

$309 million

.



As of

February 2, 2013

, there was

$92 million

(before any related tax benefit) of unrecognized share-based compensation, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, related to unvested Stock Units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

2.04 years

. Total unrecognized share-based compensation may be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures.

Stock Units Granted Based on Performance Metrics

Under the 2011 Plan, some Stock Units are granted to certain employees only after the achievement of pre-determined performance metrics. Once the Stock Unit is granted, vesting is then subject to continued service by the employee, and expense is recognized over a period of three years on an accelerated basis.

At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the probability that Stock Units will be granted. We record share-based compensation expense based on the probability that the performance metrics will be achieved, with an offsetting increase to current liabilities. We revalue the liability at the end of each reporting period and record an adjustment to share-based compensation expense as required, based on the probability that the performance metrics will be achieved. Upon achievement of the performance metrics, a Stock Unit is granted. At that time, the associated liability is reclassified to stockholders’ equity.

Out of

3,798,940

Stock Units granted in

fiscal 2012

,

235,451

Stock Units were granted based on satisfaction of performance metrics.

The liability related to potential Stock Units based on performance metrics, which is recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was

$3 million

and

$1 million

as of

February 2, 2013

and

January 28, 2012

, respectively.

Stock Options

We have stock options outstanding under the 2011 Plan and the 2002 Plan. Stock options generally expire 10 years from the grant date, three months after employee termination, or one year after the date of an employee’s retirement or death, if earlier. Vesting generally occurs over a period of

four

years of continued service by the employee, with


percent vesting on each of the four anniversary dates.

The fair value of stock options issued during

fiscal 2012

,


, and


was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:

A summary of stock option activity under the 2011 Plan and the 2002 Plan for

fiscal 2012

is as follows:



A summary of additional information about stock options is as follows:

Information about stock options outstanding, vested or expected to vest, and exercisable as of

February 2, 2013

is as follows:

The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding, options vested or expected to vest, and options exercisable as of

February 2, 2013

was

$160 million

,

$144 million

, and

$95 million

, respectively. Stock options exercisable as of

February 2, 2013

had a weighted-average remaining contractual life of

4.15 years

.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), eligible U.S. employees are able to purchase our common stock at 85 percent of the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on the last day of the three-month purchase periods. Accordingly, compensation expense is recognized for an amount equal to the


percent discount. Employees pay for their stock purchases through payroll deductions at a rate equal to any whole percentage from


percent to


percent. There were

960,930

,

1,357,769

, and

1,301,167

shares issued under the ESPP in

fiscal 2012

,


, and


, respectively. As of

February 2, 2013

, there were

5,064,960

shares reserved for future issuances under the ESPP.

Note 11. Leases

We lease most of our store premises and some of our corporate facilities and distribution centers. These operating leases expire at various dates through


. Most store leases have a five-year base period and include options that allow us to extend the lease term beyond the initial base period, subject to terms agreed upon at lease inception. Some leases also include early termination options, which can be exercised under specific conditions.

We also lease certain equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates through


.



The aggregate minimum non-cancelable annual lease payments under leases in effect on

February 2, 2013

are as follows:

The total minimum lease commitment amount above does not include minimum sublease rent income of

$31 million

receivable in the future under non-cancelable sublease agreements.

Rent expense related to our store premises, corporate facilities, and distribution centers under operating leases is as follows:

In addition to rent expense related to our store premises, corporate facilities, and distribution centers as noted above, we had rent expense related to equipment under operating leases of

$2 million

,

$4 million

, and

$3 million

for

fiscal 2012

,


, and


, respectively.

We had lease loss reserves of

$6 million

and

$9 million

as of

February 2, 2013

and

January 28, 2012

, respectively. Lease losses were

$3 million

,

$4 million

, and

$3 million

for

fiscal 2012

,


, and


, respectively. Remaining lease payments associated with our lease loss reserve are expected to be paid over the various remaining lease terms through


. Based on our current assumptions as of

February 2, 2013

, we expect our lease payments, net of sublease income, to result in a total net cash outlay of approximately

$13 million

for the remaining lease terms.

Note 12. Income Taxes

For financial reporting purposes, components of income before income taxes are as follows:



The provision for income taxes consists of the following:

Except as noted below and where required by U.S. tax law,

no

provision has been made for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as we intend to utilize those earnings in our foreign operations for an indefinite period of time. Such undistributed earnings and profits, as calculated pursuant to provisions in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and related Treasury Regulations, of foreign subsidiaries as of

February 2, 2013

and

January 28, 2012

were approximately

$1.7 billion

and

$1.5 billion

, respectively. Cash balances in these foreign subsidiaries are substantially lower than these earnings and profits. If we had not intended to utilize the undistributed earnings in our foreign operations for an indefinite period of time, the deferred tax liability as of

February 2, 2013

and

January 28, 2012

would have been approximately

$237 million

and

$225 million

, respectively.

In fiscal 2012, we assessed the forecasted cash needs and overall financial position of our foreign subsidiaries. As a result, we determined that approximately

$54 million

of undistributed earnings was in excess of the amount we expect to utilize in the operations of our Canadian subsidiaries for an indefinite period of time, and accordingly, we have established a deferred tax liability for U.S. income taxes with respect to such earnings as of

February 2, 2013

and we have recorded related tax expense of

$5 million

.

The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal tax rate is as follows:

In fiscal 2012, we changed the presentation of our effective tax rate reconciliation to reflect the impact of state and foreign tax credits and other related items in the corresponding line items in the table. Previously, these items were included in Other within the table. The reconciliations for fiscal 2011 and 2010 have been conformed to reflect these changes in presentation.



Deferred tax assets (liabilities) consist of the following:

As of

February 2, 2013

, we had approximately

$50 million

state and

$137 million

foreign NOL carryovers in multiple taxing jurisdictions that could be utilized to reduce the tax liabilities of future years. The tax-effected NOL was approximately

$3 million

for state and

$34 million

for foreign as of

February 2, 2013

. We provided a valuation allowance of approximately

$1 million

and

$33 million

against the deferred tax asset related to the state and foreign NOLs, respectively. The state losses expire between fiscal


and fiscal


, approximately

$106 million

of the foreign losses expire between fiscal


and fiscal


, and

$31 million

of the foreign losses do not expire.

The activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Of the

$109 million

,

$102 million

, and

$67 million

of total unrecognized tax benefits as of

February 2, 2013

,

January 28, 2012

, and

January 29, 2011

, respectively, approximately

$29 million

,

$25 million

, and

$5 million

(net of the federal benefit on state issues), respectively, represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods. During

fiscal 2012

and


, interest expense of

$5 million

and

$6 million

, respectively, was recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income relating to tax liabilities. During

fiscal 2010

, an interest expense reversal of

$15 million

was recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. As of

February 2, 2013

and

January 28, 2012

, the Company had total accrued interest related to the unrecognized tax benefits of

$33 million

and

$29 million

, respectively. There were

no

accrued penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits as of

February 2, 2013

or

January 28, 2012

.



The Company conducts business globally, and as a result, files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as the United States, Canada, France, Hong Kong, Japan, India, and the United Kingdom. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for fiscal years before


, and with few exceptions, we are also no longer subject to U.S. state, local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations for fiscal years before


.

The Company engages in continual discussions with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in the various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that we will recognize a decrease in gross unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 month of up to

$50 million

, primarily due to the possible completion of several advance pricing agreements and the closing of audits. If we do recognize such a decrease, the net impact on the Consolidated Statement of Income would be a benefit to our income taxes of approximately

$10 million

.

Note 13. Employee Benefit Plans

We have two qualified defined contribution retirement plans, the GapShare 401(k) Plan and the GapShare Puerto Rico Plan (the “Plans”), which are available to employees who meet the eligibility requirements. The Plans permit eligible employees to make contributions up to the maximum limits allowable under the applicable Internal Revenue Codes. Under the Plans, we match, in cash, all or a portion of employees’ contributions under a predetermined formula. Our contributions vest immediately. Our matching contributions to the Plans were

$37 million

,

$36 million

, and

$36 million

in

fiscal 2012

,


, and


, respectively.

We maintain the Gap Inc. DCP, which allows eligible employees and non-employee directors to defer compensation up to a maximum amount. Plan investments are recorded at market value and are designated for the DCP. The fair value of the Company’s DCP assets is determined based on quoted market prices. As of

February 2, 2013

and

January 28, 2012

, the assets related to the DCP were

$27 million

and

$22 million

, respectively, and were recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of

February 2, 2013

and

January 28, 2012

, the corresponding liabilities related to the DCP were

$27 million

and

$22 million

, respectively, and were recorded in lease incentives and other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We match all or a portion of employees’ contributions under a predetermined formula. Plan investments are elected by the participants, and investment returns are not guaranteed by the Company. Our matching contributions to the DCP in

fiscal 2012

,


, and


were not material.

Note 14. Earnings per Share

Weighted-average number of shares used for earnings per share is as follows:

There were

no

material shares with an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share for

fiscal 2012

. The above computations of weighted-average number of shares—diluted exclude

12 million

and

11 million

shares related to stock options and other stock awards for fiscal


and


, respectively, as their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share.

Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies

Our future purchase obligations and commitments as of

February 2, 2013

are as follows:

__________

(1)

Represents estimated open purchase orders to purchase inventory as well as commitments for products and services used in the normal course of business.



In January 2006, we entered into a non-exclusive services agreement with IBM under which IBM operates certain significant aspects of our IT infrastructure. The services agreement expires in

March 2016

, and we have the right to renew it for up to three additional years. We have various options to terminate the agreement, and we pay IBM a combination of fixed and variable charges, with the variable charges fluctuating based on our actual consumption of services. IBM also has certain termination rights in the event of our material breach of the agreement and failure to cure. We paid

$95 million

,

$107 million

, and

$118 million

to IBM for fixed charges in

fiscal 2012

,


, and


, respectively. Based on the current projection of service needs, we expect to pay approximately

$267 million

to IBM over the remaining term of the contract.

We are a party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters. These contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts, operating leases, trademarks, intellectual property, financial agreements, and various other agreements. Under these contracts, we may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties (e.g., ownership of assets, environmental or tax indemnifications), or personal injury matters. The terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined. Generally, the maximum obligation under such indemnifications is not explicitly stated, and as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements taken as a whole.

In January 2012, we were released from our reinsurance pool for workers’ compensation, general liability, and automobile liability and no longer have any related obligations as of

February 2, 2013

.

As a multinational company, we are subject to various Actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. As of

February 2, 2013

, actions filed against us included commercial, intellectual property, customer, employment, and data privacy claims, including class action lawsuits. The plaintiffs in some Actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages, and some are covered in part by insurance. As of

February 2, 2013

and

January 28, 2012

, we recorded a liability for the estimated loss if the outcome of an Action is expected to result in a loss that is considered probable and reasonably estimable. The liability recorded as of

February 2, 2013

and

January 28, 2012

was not material for any individual Action or in total. Subsequent to

February 2, 2013

and through our filing date of

March 26, 2013

, no information has become available that indicates a material change to our estimate is required.

We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of Actions brought against us. Accordingly, developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement, or resolution. However, we do not believe that the outcome of any current Action would have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements taken as a whole.

Note 16. Segment Information

We identify our operating segments according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated. All of our operating segments sell a group of similar products – apparel, accessories, and personal care products. As of

February 2, 2013

, we have

two

reportable segments:

The accounting policies for each of our operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Financial Information for Reportable Segments

Operating income is a primary measure of profit we use to make decisions on allocating resources to our operating segments and to assess the operating performance of each operating segment. It is defined as income before interest expense, interest income, and income taxes. Corporate expenses are allocated to each operating segment and recorded in operating income on a rational and systematic basis.



Reportable segment assets presented below include those assets that are directly used in, or allocable to, that segment’s operations. Total assets for the Stores reportable segment primarily consist of merchandise inventory, the net book value of store assets, and prepaid expenses and receivables related to store operations. Total assets for the Direct reportable segment primarily consist of merchandise inventory, the net book value of IT and distribution center assets, and the net book value of goodwill and intangible assets as a result of the acquisitions of Athleta and Intermix. We do not allocate corporate assets to our operating segments. Unallocated corporate assets primarily include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, the net book value of corporate property and equipment, and tax-related assets.
