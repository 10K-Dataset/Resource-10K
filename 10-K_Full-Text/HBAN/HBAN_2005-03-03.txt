HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED

INDEX


Huntington Bancshares Incorporated

PART I

Item 1: Business

Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (Huntington or the Company) is a multi-state
diversified financial holding company organized under Maryland law in 1966 and headquartered in
Columbus, Ohio. Through its subsidiaries, Huntington is engaged in providing full-service
commercial and consumer banking services, mortgage banking services, automobile financing,
equipment leasing, investment management, trust services, and discount brokerage services, as well
as reinsuring credit life and disability insurance, and selling other insurance and financial
products and services. The Huntington National Bank (the Bank), organized in 1866, is Huntington’s
only bank subsidiary. At December 31, 2004, the Bank had 167 banking offices in Ohio, 112 banking
offices in Michigan, 27 banking offices in West Virginia, 21 banking offices in Indiana, 12 banking
offices in Kentucky, 3 private banking offices in Florida, and one foreign office in each of the
Cayman Islands and Hong Kong. Certain activities are conducted in other states including Arizona,
Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. Foreign banking
activities, in total or with any individual country, are not significant to the operations of
Huntington. At December 31, 2004, Huntington and its subsidiaries had 7,812 full-time equivalent
employees.

A discussion of Huntington’s lines of business can be found in its Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Annual Report to Shareholders,
which is incorporated into this report by reference. The financial statement results for each line
of business can be found in Note 28 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Annual
Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated into this report by reference.

Competition is intense in most of the markets Huntington serves. Huntington competes on price
and service with other banks and financial services companies such as savings and loans, credit
unions, finance companies, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, and brokerage firms.
Competition could intensify in the future as a result of industry consolidation, the increasing
availability of products and services from non-banks, greater technological developments in the
industry, and banking reform. For example, financial services reform legislation enacted in 1999
eliminated the long-standing Glass-Steagall Act restrictions on securities activities of bank
holding companies and banks. The legislation, among other things, permits securities and insurance
firms to engage in banking activities under specified conditions.

Regulatory Matters

As
discussed further in note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, on March 1, 2005, Huntington announced that it had
entered into formal, written agreements with its banking regulators,
the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency. More information about these
arrangements can be found in the “Recent Regulatory
Agreements” section and in the “Business
Risks—Operational Risks” section. To the extent that
the following information describes statutory or regulatory
provisions or their impact on Huntington, it
is qualified in its entirety by reference to such statutory or
regulatory provisions and, to the extent applicable, to the formal,
written agreements with Huntington’s regulators.

General

As a financial holding company, Huntington is subject to examination and supervision by the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). Huntington is required to file reports and
other information regarding its business operations and the business operations of its subsidiaries
with the FRB. It is also required to obtain FRB approval prior to acquiring, directly or
indirectly, ownership or control of voting shares of any bank, if, after such acquisition, it would
own or control more than 5% of the voting stock of such bank.

Pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLB Act), however, a financial holding company
may engage in, or own or control companies that engage in, any activities determined by the FRB to
be financial in nature or incidental to activities financial in nature, or complementary to
financial activities, provided that such complementary activities do not pose a substantial risk to
the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. The GLB Act
designated various lending; advisory; insurance underwriting; securities underwriting, dealing, and
market-making; and merchant banking activities (as well as those activities previously approved for
bank holding companies by the FRB) as financial in nature, and authorized by the FRB, in
coordination with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), to determine that additional
activities are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature. Except
for the acquisition of a savings association, a financial holding company may commence any new
financial activity with notice to the FRB within 30 days subsequent to the commencement of the new
financial activity.



The Bank is subject to examination and supervision by the OCC. It’s deposits are insured by
the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Huntington’s
non-bank subsidiaries are also subject to examination and supervision by the FRB (or, in the case
of non-bank subsidiaries of the Bank, by the OCC), and examination by other federal and state
agencies, including, in the case of certain securities and investment management activities,
regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the National Association of
Securities Dealers.

In addition to the impact of federal and state regulation, the Bank and non-bank subsidiaries
of Huntington are affected significantly by the actions of the FRB as it attempts to control the
money supply and credit availability in order to influence the economy.

Holding Company Structure

Huntington is a financial holding company with one national bank subsidiary, The Huntington
National Bank, and numerous non-bank subsidiaries. See Exhibit 21 for a list of Huntington’s
subsidiaries. The Bank is subject to affiliate transaction restrictions under federal laws, which
limit the transfer of funds by the subsidiary bank to the parent or any non-bank subsidiary of the
parent, whether in the form of loans, extensions of credit, investments, or asset purchases. Such
transfers by a subsidiary bank to its parent corporation or to any individual non-bank subsidiary
of the parent are limited to 10% of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and, with respect to
such parent together with all such non-bank subsidiaries of the parent, to an aggregate of 20% of
the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus. Furthermore, such loans and extensions of credit are
required to be secured within specified amounts. In addition, all affiliate transactions must be
conducted on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same as such transactions
with unaffiliated entities.

As a matter of policy, the FRB expects a bank holding company to act as a source of financial
and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support each
such subsidiary bank. Under the source of strength doctrine, the FRB may require a bank holding
company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank, and may charge the bank holding
company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a
subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when Huntington does not have the
resources to provide it. Any loans by a holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in
right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the
event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by
the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary
bank. Moreover, the bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be
entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the institution’s general unsecured creditors,
including the holders of its note obligations.

Federal law permits the OCC to order the pro rata assessment of shareholders of a national
bank whose capital stock has become impaired, by losses or otherwise, to relieve a deficiency in
such national bank’s capital stock. This statute also provides for the enforcement of any such pro
rata assessment of shareholders of such national bank to cover such impairment of capital stock by
sale, to the extent necessary, of the capital stock owned by any assessed shareholder failing to
pay the assessment. Huntington, as the sole shareholder of the Bank, is subject to such provisions.
Moreover, the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative expenses
and the claims of holders of deposit liabilities of such an institution are accorded priority over
the claims of general unsecured creditors of such an institution, including the holders of the
institution’s note obligations, in the event of a liquidation or other resolution of such
institution. Claims of a receiver for administrative expenses and claims of holders of deposit
liabilities of the Bank (including the FDIC, as the subrogee of such holders) would receive
priority over the holders of notes and other senior debt of the Bank in the event of a liquidation
or other resolution and over the interests of Huntington as sole shareholder of the Bank.

Dividend Restrictions

Dividends from the Bank are the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to
Huntington’s shareholders. In the year ended December 31, 2004, Huntington declared cash dividends
to its shareholders of $172.7 million. There are, however, statutory limits on the amount of
dividends that the Bank can pay to Huntington without regulatory approval.

The Bank may not, without prior regulatory approval, pay a dividend in an amount greater than
its undivided profits. In addition, the prior approval of the OCC is required for the payment of a
dividend by a national



bank if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of its
net income for the year combined with its retained net income for the two preceding years. Under
these provisions and in accordance with the above-described formula, the Bank could, without
regulatory approval, declare dividends to Huntington in 2005 of approximately $274.3 million plus
an additional amount equal to its net profits during 2005.

If, in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a bank under its jurisdiction is
engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the
financial condition of the bank, could include the payment of dividends), such authority may
require, after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from such practice. The FRB and
the OCC have issued policy statements that provide that insured banks and bank holding companies
should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings.

FDIC Insurance

During 2004, the Bank was classified by the FDIC as a “well-capitalized” institution in the
highest supervisory subcategory and was therefore not obliged under FDIC assessment practices to
pay deposit insurance premiums in 2004, either on its deposits insured by the BIF or on that
portion of its deposits acquired from savings and loan associations and insured by the Savings and
Loan Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). Although not currently subject to FDIC assessments for
insurance premiums, the Bank is required to make payments for the servicing of obligations of the
Financing Corporation (FICO) that were issued in connection with the resolution of savings and loan
associations, so long as such obligations remain outstanding.

The FDIC may alter its assessment practices in the future if required by developments
affecting the resources of the BIF or the SAIF. Assessment practices may also be altered if pending
legislative initiatives involving the merger of the BIF and the SAIF, as well as other changes,
become law.

Capital Requirements

The FRB has issued risk-based capital ratio and leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding
companies such as Huntington. The risk-based capital ratio guidelines establish a systematic
analytical framework that makes regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk
profiles among banking organizations, takes off-balance sheet exposures into explicit account in
assessing capital adequacy, and minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets. Under
the guidelines and related policies, bank holding companies must maintain capital sufficient to
meet both a risk-based asset ratio test and a leverage ratio test on a consolidated basis. The
risk-based ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet commitments
into four weighted categories, with higher weighting being assigned to categories perceived as
representing greater risk. A bank holding company’s capital (as described below) is then divided by
total risk weighted assets to yield the risk-based ratio. The leverage ratio is determined by
relating core capital (as described below) to total assets adjusted as specified in the guidelines.
The Bank is subject to substantially similar capital requirements.

Generally, under the applicable guidelines, a financial institution’s capital is divided into
two tiers. Institutions that must incorporate market risk exposure into their risk-based capital
requirements may also have a third tier of capital in the form of restricted short-term
subordinated debt. “Tier 1”, or core capital, includes common equity, non-cumulative perpetual
preferred stock (excluding auction rate issues), and minority interests in equity accounts of
consolidated subsidiaries, less both goodwill and, with certain limited exceptions, all other
intangible assets. Bank holding companies, however, may include cumulative preferred stock in their
Tier 1 capital, up to a limit of 25% of such Tier 1 capital. “Tier 2”, or supplementary capital,
includes, among other things, cumulative and limited-life preferred stock, hybrid capital
instruments, mandatory convertible securities, qualifying subordinated debt, and the allowance for
loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations. “Total capital” is the sum of Tier 1 and
Tier 2 capital.

The FRB and the other federal banking regulators require that all intangible assets, with
certain limited exceptions, be deducted from Tier 1 capital. Under the FRB’s rules the only types
of intangible assets that may be included in (i.e., not deducted from) a bank holding company’s
capital are originated or purchased mortgage servicing rights, non-mortgage servicing assets, and
purchased credit card relationships, provided that, in the aggregate, the total amount of these
items included in capital does not exceed 100% of Tier 1 capital.

Under the risk-based guidelines, financial institutions are required to maintain a risk-based
ratio (total capital to risk-weighted assets) of 8%, of which 4% must be Tier 1 capital. The
appropriate regulatory authority may set higher capital requirements when an institution’s
circumstances warrant.



Under the leverage guidelines, financial institutions are required to maintain a leverage
ratio (Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets, as specified in the guidelines) of at least 3%. The
3% minimum ratio is applicable only to financial institutions that meet certain specified criteria,
including excellent asset quality, high liquidity, low interest rate exposure, and the highest
regulatory rating. Financial institutions not meeting these criteria are required to maintain a
minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.

Special minimum capital requirements apply to equity investments in nonfinancial companies.
The requirements consist of a series of marginal capital charges that increase within a range from
8% to 25% as a financial institution’s over-all exposure to equity investments increases as a
percentage of its Tier 1 capital.

Failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject the financial institution to a
variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities. These include
limitations on the ability to pay dividends, the issuance by the regulatory authority of a capital
directive to increase capital, and the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, as well as the
measures described below under “Prompt Corrective Action” as applicable to “under-capitalized”
institutions.

The risk-based capital standards of the FRB, the OCC, and the FDIC specify that evaluations by
the banking agencies of a bank’s capital adequacy will include an assessment of the exposure to
declines in the economic value of the bank’s capital due to changes in interest rates. These
banking agencies issued a joint policy statement on interest rate risk describing prudent methods
for monitoring such risk that rely principally on internal measures of exposure and active
oversight of risk management activities by senior management.

Prompt Corrective Action

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) requires federal
banking regulatory authorities to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to depository
institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, FDICIA establishes
five capital tiers: “well-capitalized”, “adequately-capitalized”, “under-capitalized”,
“significantly under-capitalized”, and “critically under-capitalized”.

An institution is deemed to be “well-capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio
of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio
of 5% or greater and is not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and
maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An institution is deemed to be
“adequately-capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio of 4% or greater, and, generally, a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% or greater
and the institution does not meet the definition of a “well-capitalized” institution. An
institution that does not meet one or more of the “adequately-capitalized” tests is deemed to be
“under-capitalized”. If the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6%,
a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 3%, or a Tier 1 leverage ratio that is less
than 3%, it is deemed to be “significantly under-capitalized”. Finally, an institution is deemed to
be “critically under-capitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity, as defined in the
regulations, to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%. Through out 2004, both Huntington
and the Bank had regulatory capital ratios in excess of the levels established for
“well-capitalized” institutions.

FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution,
including payment of a cash dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the
depository institution would thereafter be “under-capitalized”. “Under-capitalized” institutions
are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. If any
depository institution subsidiary of a holding company is required to submit a capital restoration
plan, the holding company would be required to provide a limited guarantee regarding compliance
with the plan as a condition of approval of such plan by the appropriate federal banking agency. If
an “under-capitalized” institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is
“significantly under-capitalized”. “Significantly under-capitalized” institutions may be subject to
a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to
become “adequately-capitalized”, requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of
deposits from correspondent banks. “Critically under-capitalized” institutions may not, beginning
60 days after becoming “critically under-capitalized”, make any payment of principal or interest on
their subordinated debt. In addition, “critically under-capitalized” institutions are subject to
appointment of a receiver or conservator within 90 days of becoming so classified.

Under FDICIA, a depository institution that is not “well-capitalized” is generally prohibited
from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing
rate in its market. The Bank,



however, is “well-capitalized” and, therefore, the FDICIA’s brokered deposit rule did not
adversely affect the ability of the Bank to accept brokered deposits. Under the regulatory
definition of brokered deposits, the Bank had $2.1 billion of such deposits at December 31, 2004.

Financial Holding Company Status

Huntington operates as a “financial holding company”. In order to maintain its status as a
financial holding company, a bank holding company’s depository subsidiaries must all be both “well
capitalized” and “well managed,” and must meet their Community Reinvestment Act obligations.

Financial holding company powers relate to “financial activities” that are determined by the
FRB, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, to be financial in nature, incidental to
an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity (provided that
the complementary activity does not pose a safety and soundness risk). The statute itself defines
certain activities as financial in nature, including but not limited to underwriting insurance or
annuities; providing financial or investment advice; underwriting, dealing in, or making markets in
securities; merchant banking, subject to significant limitations; insurance company portfolio
investing, subject to significant limitations; and any activities previously found by the FRB to be
closely related to banking.

Recent Regulatory Developments

Authority for financial holding companies to engage in real estate brokerage and property
management services was proposed by the Treasury Department and the FRB in 2000, but final
regulations implementing the proposal have been subject to a statutory moratorium which was renewed
by Congress during 2004 for a period ending September 30, 2005. It is not possible at present to
assess the likelihood of the ultimate effectiveness of final regulations

Congress took no action toward reform of the federal deposit insurance program during 2004,
but the subject is likely to receive legislative attention in 2005. It is not possible to predict
if deposit insurance reform legislation will be enacted, or if enacted, what its effect will be on
Huntington.

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision presented its “Basel II” regulatory capital
guidelines in July 2004, which would require changes by large banks in the way in which their
risk-based capital requirements are calculated. Federal banking regulators are considering the
extent and timing of application of the guidelines to U.S. depository institutions. It is uncertain
at the present time if Huntington will be either required or permitted to make changes in its
regulatory capital structure in accordance with Basel II guidelines.

In December 2004, the FRB announced a revision of its bank holding company rating system to
align the system more closely with current supervisory practices. The revised system emphasizes
risk management, introduces a framework for analyzing and rating financial factors, and provides a
framework for assessing and rating the potential impact of nondepository entities of a holding
company on its subsidiary depository institution(s). A composite rating will be assigned based on
the foregoing three components, but a fourth component will also be rated, and will reflect
generally the assessment of depository institution subsidiaries by their principal regulators.
Ratings will be made on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 highest) and will, like current ratings, not be made
public. The new rating system will be applied to Huntington commencing with Huntington’s first
examination following the system’s effective date of January 1, 2005.

Information related to the Securities Exchange Commission’s formal investigation and formal
regulatory supervisory agreements can be found in Notes 22 and 23, respectively, of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements of the Annual Report to Shareholders, which are incorporated into
this report by reference.

Business Risks

Huntington, like other financial companies, is subject to a number of risks, many of which are
outside of Management’s control, though Management strives to manage those risks while optimizing
returns. Among the risks assumed are: (1)

credit risk

, which is the risk that loan and
lease customers or other counter parties will be unable to perform their contractual obligations,
(2)

market risk

, which is the risk that changes in market rates and prices will adversely
affect Huntington’s financial condition or results of operation, (3)

liquidity risk

, which
is the risk that Huntington and / or the Bank will have insufficient cash or access to cash to meet
its operating needs, and (4)



operational risk

, which is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed
internal processes, people and systems, or from external events.

In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report,
readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could
materially impact Huntington’s business, future results of operations, and future cash flows.

(1) Credit Risks:

Huntington extends credit to a variety of customers based on internally set standards and the
judgment of Management. Huntington manages the credit risk it takes through a program of
underwriting standards that it follows, the review of certain credit decisions, and an on-going
process of assessment of the quality of the credit it has already extended. There can be no
assurance that Huntington’s credit standards and its on-going process of credit assessment will
protect Huntington from significant credit losses.

Huntington takes credit risk by virtue of funding loans and leases, purchasing
non-governmental securities, extending loan commitments and letters of credit, and being
counterparties to off-balance sheet financial instruments such as interest rate and foreign
exchange derivatives.

Huntington’s exposure to credit risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting
standards that emphasize “in-market” lending while avoiding highly leveraged transactions as well
as excessive industry and other concentrations. The credit administration function employs risk
management techniques to ensure that loans and leases adhere to corporate policy and problem loans
and leases are promptly identified. These procedures provide Management with the information
necessary to implement policy adjustments where necessary, and to take proactive corrective
actions. In 2004, Management continued to focus on commercial lending to customers with existing or
potential relationships within Huntington’s primary markets.

For further discussion about Huntington’s management of credit risk, see the “Credit Risk”
section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
included in Huntington’s 2004 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as Exhibit
13 to this report and incorporated herein by reference. There can be no assurance that Huntington’s
credit standards and its on-going process of credit assessment will protect Huntington from
significant credit losses.

Huntington’s loans, leases, and deposits are focused in five states and adverse economic conditions
in those states, in particular, could negatively impact results from operations, cash flows, and
financial condition.

Concentration of credit risk can also arise with respect to loans and leases when the
borrowers are located in the same geographical region. Huntington’s customers with loan and/or
deposit balances at December 31, 2004, were located predominantly in Ohio, Michigan, West Virginia,
Indiana, and Kentucky. Because of the concentration of loans, leases, and deposits in these states,
in the event of adverse economic conditions in these states, Huntington could experience more
difficulty in attracting deposits and experience higher rates of loss and delinquency on its loans
and leases than if the loans and leases were more geographically diversified. Adverse economic
conditions and other factors, such as political or business developments or natural hazards that
may affect these states, may reduce demand for credit or fee-based products and could negatively
affect real estate and other collateral values, interest rate levels, and the availability of
credit to refinance loans at or prior to maturity.

(2) Market Risks:

Changes in interest rates could negatively impact Huntington’s financial condition and results of
operations.

Huntington’s results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, the difference
between interest earned on interest-earning assets (such as investments, loans, and direct
financing leases) and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (such as deposits and
borrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary
policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Conditions such as
inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors beyond Management’s control may
also affect interest rates. If Huntington’s interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly
than interest-bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment, net interest income
could be adversely impacted. Likewise, if interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more
quickly than interest-earnings assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income
could be adversely impacted.



Changes in interest rates also can affect the value of loans and other assets, including
retained interests in securitizations, mortgage and non-mortgage servicing rights, and Huntington’s
ability to realize gains on the sale of assets. A portion of Huntington’s earnings results from
transactional income. Examples of this type of earnings result from gains on sales of loans and
other real estate owned. This type of income can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and
year-to-year based on a number of different factors, including the interest rate environment. An
increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or
interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in non-performing assets and a reduction of
discount accreted into income, which could have a material adverse effect on Huntington’s results
of operations and cash flows. For further discussion, see “Loan Sales and Securitizations” in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Huntington’s 2004 Annual Report to
Shareholders, portions of which are filed as Exhibit 13 to this report and incorporated herein by
reference.

Although fluctuations in market interest rates are neither completely predictable nor
controllable, Huntington’s Market Risk Committee (MRC) meets periodically to monitor Huntington’s
interest rate sensitivity position and oversee its financial risk management by establishing
policies and operating limits. For further discussion, see the “Interest Rate Risk” section of
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in
Huntington’s 2004 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as Exhibit 13 to this
report and incorporated herein by reference.

Huntington could experience losses on its residual values related to its automobile lease
portfolio.

Inherently, automobile lease portfolios are subject to residual risk, which arises when the
market price of the leased vehicle at the end of the lease term is below the estimated residual
value at the time the lease is originated. This situation arises due to a decline in used car
market values. For further discussion about Huntington’s management of lease residual risk, see the
“Lease Residual Risk” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations included in Huntington’s 2004 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of
which are filed as Exhibit 13 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.

(3) Liquidity Risks:

If Huntington is unable to borrow funds through access to capital markets, it may not be able to
meet the cash flow requirements of its depositors and borrowers, or meet the operating cash needs
of Huntington to fund corporate expansion and other activities.

Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The
liquidity of the Bank is used to make loans and leases and to repay deposit liabilities as they
become due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and limits are established by the board
of directors, with operating limits set by MRC, based upon the ratio of loans to deposits and
percentage of assets funded with non-core or wholesale funding. The Bank’s MRC regularly monitors
the overall liquidity position of the Bank and the parent company to ensure that various
alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. MRC also
establishes policies and monitors guidelines to diversify the Bank’s wholesale funding sources to
avoid concentrations in any one market source. Wholesale funding sources include Federal funds
purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and medium- and
long-term debt, which includes a domestic bank note program and a Euronote program. The Bank is
also a member of certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB), which provide funding through advances to
members that are collateralized with mortgage-related assets.

Huntington maintains a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of
liquidity. There are other sources of liquidity should they be needed. These sources include the
sale or securitization of loans, the ability to acquire additional national market, non-core
deposits, additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances, the issuance of debt
securities, and the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions.
The Bank also can borrow through the Federal Reserve’s discount window.

If Huntington were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed, it might be
unable to meet the needs of its customers, which could adversely impact Huntington’s financial
condition, its results of operations, cash flows, and its level of regulatory-qualifying capital.
For further discussion, see the “Liquidity” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Huntington’s 2004 Annual Report to
Shareholders, portions of which are filed as Exhibit 13 to this report and incorporated herein by
reference.



If Huntington’s credit rating were downgraded, its ability to access funding sources may be
negatively impacted or eliminated and Huntington’s liquidity and the market price of its common
stock could be adversely impacted.

Credit ratings by the three major credit rating agencies are an important component of the
Company’s liquidity profile. Among other factors, the credit ratings are based on the financial
strength, credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio, the level and volatility of
earnings, capital adequacy, the quality of Management, the liquidity of the balance sheet, the
availability of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits, and the Company’s
ability to access a broad array of wholesale funding sources. Adverse changes in these factors
could result in a negative change in credit ratings and impact not only the ability to raise funds
in the capital markets, but also the cost of these funds. In addition, certain financial on- and
off-balance sheet arrangements contain credit rating triggers that could increase funding needs if
a negative rating change occurs. Letter of credit commitments for marketable securities, interest
rate swap collateral agreements, and certain asset securitization transactions contain credit
rating provisions.

Credit ratings as of February 8, 2005, for the parent company and the Bank can be found in
Table 17 of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
included in Huntington’s 2004 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit
13 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.

Huntington relies on certain funding sources such as large corporate deposits, public fund
deposits, federal funds, Euro deposits, FHLB advances, and bank notes. Although not contractually
tied to credit ratings, Huntington’s ability to access these funding sources may be impacted by
negative changes in credit ratings. In the case of public funds or FHLB advances, a credit
downgrade also may trigger a requirement that Huntington pledge additional collateral against
outstanding borrowings.

A downgraded credit rating by any of the three credit rating agencies could negatively affect
Huntington’s common stock price and accelerate the timing of the pass through of cash flows from
obligors to its securitization trusts. In addition, if the unsecured senior debt of the Bank falls
below BBB+ or Baa1, a Servicer Downgrade Event automatically occurs, which will trigger an early
amortization event in Huntington’s largest securitization. At that point, Huntington would no
longer be permitted to sell additional loans to the trust.

(4) Operational Risks:

Huntington has significant competition in both attracting and retaining deposits and in originating
loans and leases.

Competition is intense in most of the markets Huntington serves. Huntington competes on price
and service with other banks and financial services companies such as savings and loans, credit
unions, finance companies, and brokerage firms. Competition could intensify in the future as a
result of industry consolidation, the increasing availability of products and services from
non-banks, greater technological developments in the industry, and banking reform.

Management maintains internal operational controls and Huntington has invested in technology to
help it process large volumes of transactions. However, there can be no assurance that Huntington
will be able to continue processing at the same or higher levels of transactions. If Huntington’s
system of internal controls should fail to work as expected, if its systems were to be used in an
unauthorized manner, or if employees were to subvert the system of internal controls, significant
losses to Huntington could occur.

Huntington processes large volumes of transactions on a daily basis and is exposed to numerous
types of operational risk. Operational risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes,
people, and systems includes the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside Huntington, the
execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and
systems, and breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements. This risk of loss
also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of the operational
deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards.

Huntington establishes and maintains systems of internal operational controls that provide
Management with timely and accurate information about its level of operational risk. While not
foolproof, these systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate, cost
effective levels. Huntington has also established



procedures that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business
practices are followed. From time to time, Huntington experiences losses from operational risk,
including the effects of operational errors, and these losses are recorded as non-interest expense.

While Management continually monitors and improves its system of internal controls, data
processing systems, and corporate-wide processes and procedures, there can be no assurance that
Huntington will not suffer such losses in the future.

Huntington’s acquisitions may not receive the necessary approvals, meet income expectations and/or
cost savings levels, or be integrated within time frames originally anticipated. Huntington may
encounter unforeseen difficulties, including unanticipated integration problems and business
disruption in connection with its acquisitions. Acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value
and adversely affect operating results.

The completion of any merger is dependent on, among other things, receipt of shareholder and
regulatory approvals, the timing of which cannot be predicted with precision and which may not be
received at all. Additionally, a merger may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, as a
result of unexpected factors or events and the anticipated cost savings of a merger may take longer
to be realized or may not be achieved in their entirety. The integration of acquired businesses and
operations with those of Huntington, including systems conversions, may take longer than
anticipated, may be more costly than anticipated and may have unanticipated adverse results
relating to Huntington’s existing businesses or the businesses acquired. Further, decisions to sell
or close units or otherwise change the business mix of either company may adversely impact combined
results. Moreover, Huntington may be unable to identify, negotiate, or finance future acquisitions
successfully. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity
securities or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses.

An extended disruption of vital infrastructure could negatively impact Huntington’s business,
results of operations, and financial condition.

Huntington’s operations depend upon, among other things, its infrastructure, including its
equipment and facilities. Extended disruption of its vital infrastructure by fire, power loss,
natural disaster, telecommunications failure, computer hacking or viruses, terrorist activity or
the domestic and foreign response to such activity, or other events outside of Huntington’s control
could have a material adverse impact on the financial services industry as a whole and on
Huntington’s business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition in particular. To
mitigate this risk, Huntington has established a business recovery plan.

Huntington’s financial statements must conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States (GAAP), which require Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires Management to
establish critical accounting policies and make accounting estimates, assumptions, and judgments
that affect amounts recorded and reported in its financial statements. An accounting estimate
requires assumptions about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the financial
statements if a different amount within a range of estimates were used or if estimates changed from
period to period. Huntington’s financial statements include estimates related to accruals of income
and expenses and determination of fair values or carrying values of certain, but not all, assets
and liabilities. These estimates are based on information available to Management at the time the
estimates are made. Factors involved in these estimates could change in the future leading to a
change of those estimates, which could be material to Huntington’s results of operations or
financial condition.

For further discussion, see the “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant
Estimates” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations included in Huntington’s 2004 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed
as Exhibit 13 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.

Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future could impair
Huntington’s ability to accurately and timely report its financial results or prevent fraud,
resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting Huntington’s business and stock
price.



Effective
internal controls over financial reporting
are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent
fraud. As a financial holding company, Huntington is subject to regulation that focuses on
effective internal controls and procedures. Management continually seeks to improve these controls
and procedures. In addition, in 2004, Huntington has worked diligently to further document and
test its internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This Act requires, beginning with this report, Management to furnish a
report assessing Huntington’s internal controls over financial reporting and stating whether such
controls are effective. Huntington’s independent auditors must attest to Management’s assessment.
These reports for the year ended December 31, 2004, can be found in Part II, Item 9A: Controls and
Procedures.

Management believes that Huntington’s key internal controls over financial reporting are
currently effective; however, such controls and procedures will be modified, supplemented, and
changed from time to time as necessitated by the Company’s growth and in reaction to external
events and developments. While Management will continue to assess Huntington’s controls and
procedures and take immediate action to remediate any future perceived gaps, there can be no
guarantee of the effectiveness of these controls and procedures on an on-going basis. Any failure
to maintain in the future an effective internal control environment could impact Huntington’s
ability to report its financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could result in
regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and adversely impact its business and stock price.

New or changes in existing tax, accounting, and regulatory laws, regulations, rules, standards,
policies, and interpretations or requirements could significantly impact strategic initiatives,
results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

The financial services industry is extensively regulated. Federal and state banking
regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers, not to
benefit a financial company’s shareholders. These regulations may sometimes impose significant
limitations on operations. The significant federal and state banking regulations that affect
Huntington are described in this report under the heading “Regulatory Matters.” These regulations,
along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, and monetary laws,
regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which financial
institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern
financial reporting and disclosures. These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and
interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time.

In addition, Huntington may be subject to actions of its regulators that are specific to
Huntington itself. For further discussion, see Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements of the Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as Exhibit 13 to this
report and incorporated herein by reference.

Events that may not have a direct impact on Huntington, such as the bankruptcy of major U.S.
companies, have resulted in legislators, regulators, and authoritative bodies, such as the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board, and various taxing authorities responding by adopting and/or proposing
substantive revisions to laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations.
International capital standards developed in the framework of the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision may also affect the competitive environment for United States banks.

The nature, extent, and timing of the adoption of significant new laws and regulations, or
changes in or repeal of existing laws and regulations, or specific actions of regulators, may have
a material impact on Huntington’s business and results of operations; however, it is impossible to
predict at this time the extent to which any such adoption, change, or repeal would impact
Huntington.

The OCC may impose dividend payment and other restrictions on the Bank, which would impact
Huntington’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders or repurchase its stock.

The OCC is the primary regulatory agency that examines the Bank, its subsidiaries, and their
respective activities. Under certain circumstances, including any determination that the activities
of the Bank or its subsidiaries constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice, the OCC has the
authority by statute to restrict the Bank’s ability to transfer assets, make distributions to its
shareholder, and redeem preferred securities.

Under applicable statutes and regulations, dividends by a national bank may be paid out of
current or retained net profits, but a national bank is prohibited from declaring a cash dividend
on shares of its common stock out of net profits until the surplus fund equals the amount of
capital stock or, if the surplus fund does not equal the



amount of capital stock, until certain amounts from net profits are transferred to the surplus
fund. Moreover, the prior approval of the OCC is required for the payment of a dividend if the
total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of
its net profits for the year combined with its net profits for the two preceding years, less any
required transfers to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred securities.

Payment of dividends could also be subject to regulatory limitations if the Bank became
under-capitalized for purposes of the OCC prompt corrective action regulations. Under-capitalized
is currently defined as having a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, or a core capital, or leverage, ratio of less than
4.0%. The Bank’s inability to pay dividends to Huntington would negatively impact Huntington’s
ability to pay dividends to its shareholders and repurchase its stock. Through out 2004, the Bank
was in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements and considered to be “well-capitalized”.

For further discussion, see the “Bank Liquidity” section of Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Huntington’s 2004 Annual
Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as Exhibit 13 to this report and incorporated
herein by reference.

The Federal Reserve Board may require Huntington to commit capital resources to support the Bank.

The FRB, which examines Huntington and its non-bank subsidiaries, has a policy stating that a
bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a
subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the source of
strength doctrine, the FRB may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a
troubled subsidiary bank, and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and
unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. A capital injection
may be required at times when the holding company may not have the resources to provide it, and
therefore may be required to borrow the funds. Any loans by a holding company to its subsidiary
bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such
subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will
assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the
capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, the bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such
commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the institution’s general
unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must
be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection becomes more
difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the holding company’s results of operations and
cash flows.

Management does not foresee the need to make capital injections to the Bank under the source
of strength doctrine in the foreseeable future.

If any of Huntington’s Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) affiliates fail to qualify as a REIT,
Huntington may be subject to a higher consolidated effective tax rate.

Huntington Preferred Capital, Inc. (HPCI) and Huntington Preferred Capital II, Inc. (HPC-II)
operate as REITs for federal income tax purposes. HPCI and HPC-II are consolidated subsidiaries of
Huntington that were established to acquire, hold, and manage mortgage assets and other authorized
investments to generate net income for distribution to their shareholders.

Qualification as a REIT involves application of specific provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code relating to various asset tests. A REIT must satisfy six asset tests quarterly: (1) 75% of the
value of the REIT’s total assets must consist of real estate assets, cash and cash items, and
government securities; (2) not more than 25% of the value of the REIT’s total assets may consist of
securities, other than those includible under the 75% test; (3) not more than 5% of the value of
its total assets may consist of securities of any one issuer, other than those securities
includible under the 75% test or securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries; (4) not more than 10% of
the outstanding voting power of any one issuer may be held, other than those securities includible
under the 75% test or securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries; (5) not more than 10% of the total
value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer may be held, other than those securities
includible under the 75% test or securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries; and (6) a REIT cannot own
securities in one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries which comprise more than 20% of its total
assets. At December 31, 2004, HPCI had met all of the quarterly asset tests.

Also, a REIT must annually satisfy two gross income tests: (1) 75% of its gross income must be
from qualifying income closely connected with real estate activities; and (2) 95% of its gross
income must be derived



from sources qualifying for the 75% test plus dividends, interest and gains from the sale of
securities. In addition, a REIT must distribute 90% of the REIT’s taxable income for the taxable
year, excluding any net capital gains, to maintain its non-taxable status for federal income tax
purposes. For the tax year, HPCI had met all annual income and distribution tests. If these REIT
affiliates fail to meet any of the required provisions for REITs, HPCI or HPC-II will no longer
qualify as a REIT and the resulting tax consequences would increase Huntington’s effective tax
rate.

Huntington could be held responsible for environmental liabilities of properties acquired through
foreclosure of loans secured by real estate.

In the event that Huntington is forced to foreclose on a defaulted commercial mortgage and/or
residential mortgage loan to recover its investment in the mortgage loan, Huntington may be subject
to environmental liabilities in connection with the underlying real property, which could exceed
the value of the real property. Although Huntington exercises due diligence to discover potential
environmental liabilities prior to the acquisition of any property through foreclosure, hazardous
substances or wastes, contaminants, pollutants, or their sources may be discovered on properties
during Huntington’s ownership or after a sale to a third party. There can be no assurance that
Huntington would not incur full recourse liability for the entire cost of any removal and clean-up
on an acquired property, that the cost of removal and clean-up would not exceed the value of the
property, or that Huntington could recover any of the costs from any third party.

Huntington is currently under investigation by the SEC, the final results of which are unknown.

On June 26, 2003, Huntington announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff
was conducting a formal investigation into certain financial accounting matters relating to fiscal
years 2002 and earlier and certain related disclosure matters. On August 9, 2004, Huntington
announced the Company was in negotiations with the staff of the SEC regarding a settlement of the
formal investigation and disclosed that it expected that a settlement of this matter, which is
subject to approval by the SEC, would involve the entry of an order requiring, among other possible
matters, Huntington to comply with various provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
the Securities Act of 1933, along with the imposition of a civil money penalty. At December 31,
2004, the Company had reserves related to the expectation of the imposition of a civil money
penalty, which the Company viewed as sufficient given negotiations with the SEC. However, no
assurances can be made that any assessed penalty may not exceed this amount.

Management continues to have ongoing discussions with the staff of the SEC regarding
resolution of this matter. The final results of the investigation, however, are not known at the
time of this filing and therefore, the impact to Huntington’s financial condition, results of
operations, and cash flows is not known.

Huntington has entered into formal supervisory agreements with its banking regulators.

On March 1, 2005, Huntington announced that it had entered into formal written agreements with
its banking regulators, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (FRBC) and the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), providing for a comprehensive action plan designed to enhance
its corporate governance, internal audit, risk management, accounting policies and procedures, and
financial and regulatory reporting. They call for independent
third-party reviews, as well as the submission of written plans and
progress reports by management. These written agreements remain in effect until terminated by
the banking regulators.

Management has been working with its banking regulators over the past several months and has been
taking actions and devoting significant resources to address all of the issues raised. Management
believes that the changes that it has already made, and is in the process of making, will address
these issues fully and comprehensively. No assurances, however, can be provided as to the ultimate
timing or outcome of these matters.

As a result of regulatory, supervisory and examination activities, Huntington has been
advised that it no longer satisfies financial holding company requirements for purposes of the
advantages in regulatory procedures and powers existing under the GLB Act for financial holding
companies (the “GLB Procedures and Powers”), and Huntington has agreed to take certain corrective
actions within a 180 day period. During the interim, Huntington is unable to engage in new
activities or make new investments in reliance on the GLB Procedures and Powers without prior FRB
approval, and Huntington may be subject to limitations on the conduct of its activities. The
failure to take these corrective actions could result in Huntington’s loss of the GLB Procedures
and Powers, though any such loss is not expected to be material to Huntington’s consolidated
business.

As a result of entering into the written agreements, Huntington Bank is required to obtain
approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency prior to employing new senior executive
officers. In addition, Huntington and Huntington Bank are prohibited from making “golden parachute
payments” as defined in applicable regulations without prior regulatory approval.

Item 2: Properties

The headquarters of Huntington and the Bank are located in the Huntington Center, a
thirty-seven-story office building located in Columbus, Ohio. Of the building’s total office space
available, Huntington leases approximately 39%. The lease term expires in 2015, with nine five-year
renewal options for up to 45 years but with no purchase option. The Bank has an indirect minority
equity interest of 18% in the building. Huntington’s other major properties consist of a
thirteen-story and a twelve-story office building, both of which are located adjacent to the
Huntington Center; a twenty-one story office building, known as the Huntington Building, located in
Cleveland, Ohio; an eighteen-story office building in Charleston, West Virginia; a three-story
office building located in Holland, Michigan; a Business Service Center in Columbus, Ohio, which
serves as Huntington’s primary operations and data center; The Huntington Mortgage Group’s
building, located in the greater Columbus area; an office complex located in Troy, Michigan; and
two data processing and operations centers located in Ohio. The office buildings above serve as
regional administrative offices occupied predominantly by Huntington’s Regional and Private
Financial Group lines of business. The Dealer Sales line of business is primarily located in a
three-story office building located in Columbus Ohio. Of these properties, Huntington owns the
thirteen-story and twelve-story office buildings, and the Business Service Center. All of the other
major properties are held under long-term leases. In 1998, Huntington entered into a sale/leaseback
agreement that included the sale of 51 of its locations. The transaction included a mix of branch
banking offices, regional offices, and operational facilities, including certain properties
described above, which Huntington will continue to operate under a long-term lease.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Huntington’s Management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of Huntington’s disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of
the period covered by this report. Based upon such evaluation, Huntington’s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, Huntington’s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting

Information required by this item is set forth in “Report of Management” and “Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” included in the 2004 Annual Report to Shareholders,
portions of which are filed as Exhibit 13 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.



Changes in Control Over Financial Reporting

During 2004, Huntington worked diligently to document and test its internal control procedures
in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Among other
things, this Act requires, beginning with this Form 10-K, annual management assessments of the
effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent
auditors addressing these assessments.

In order to be in a position to give the required reports, Huntington engaged an outside
consultant and adopted a detailed work plan to (1) assess and document the adequacy of Huntington’s
internal control over financial reporting, (2) take steps to remediate any perceived gaps in its
internal control over financial reporting and improve its control processes where appropriate, and
(3) validate through testing that Huntington’s control processes are functioning as documented.
This work was completed prior to the end of 2004 and serves as the basis for management’s
conclusion that Huntington’s internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December
31, 2004.

There have not been any changes in Huntington’s internal control over financial reporting (as
such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter
ended December 31, 2004 to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, Huntington’s internal control over financial reporting.

On September 4, 2001, options totaling 3.2 million shares of common stock were
granted to, with certain specified exceptions, full- and part-time employees under the Huntington
Bancshares Incorporated Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the Incentive Plan). Under the terms of the
Incentive Plan, these options were to vest on the earlier of September 4, 2006, or at such time as
the closing price for Huntington’s common stock for five consecutive trading days reached or
exceeded $25.00. Huntington’s common stock closing price exceeded $25.00 for each of the five
consecutive trading days beginning October 1, 2004, and ending October 7, 2004. As a result,

1.2 million shares cancelled due to employee attrition, became fully vested and exercisable after
the close of trading on October 7, 2004. At December 31, 2004, the number of outstanding options
