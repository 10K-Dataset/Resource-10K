HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED

INDEX



Huntington Bancshares Incorporated

PART I

When we refer to “we,” “our,” and “us” in this report, we mean Huntington Bancshares
Incorporated and our consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates that we refer only to
the parent company, Huntington Bancshares Incorporated. When we refer to the “Bank” in this
report, we mean our only bank subsidiary The Huntington National Bank, and its subsidiaries.

Item 1: Business

We are a multi-state diversified financial holding company organized under Maryland law in
1966 and headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. Through our subsidiaries, we provide full-service
commercial and consumer banking services, mortgage banking services, automobile financing,
equipment leasing, investment management, trust services, brokerage services, customized insurance
service programs, and other financial products and services. The Bank, organized in 1866, is our
only bank subsidiary. At December 31, 2008, the Bank had:

We conduct certain activities in other states including Arizona, Florida, Maryland, New
Jersey, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Our foreign banking activities, in total or with any
individual country, are not significant. At December 31, 2008, we had 10,951 full-time equivalent
employees.

Our lines of business are discussed in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations and the financial statement results for each of our lines of
business can be found in Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, both are
included in our Annual Report to shareholders, which is incorporated into this report by
reference.

Competition

Competition is intense in most of our markets. We compete on price and service with other
banks and financial services companies such as savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies,
mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, and brokerage firms. Competition could intensify
in the future as a result of industry consolidation, the increasing availability of products and
services from non-banks, greater technological developments in the industry, and banking reform.



Regulatory Matters

General

We are a bank holding company and are qualified as a financial holding company with the
Federal Reserve. We are subject to examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve pursuant to
the Bank Holding Company Act. We are required to file reports and other information regarding our
business operations and the business operations of our subsidiaries with the Federal Reserve.

Because we are a public company, we are also subject to regulation by the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC has established three categories of issuers for the purpose of
filing periodic and annual reports. Under these regulations, we are considered to be a “large
accelerated filer” and, as such, must comply with SEC accelerated reporting requirements.

The Bank is subject to examination and supervision by the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency (OCC). Its domestic deposits are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which also has certain regulatory and supervisory
authority over it. Our non-bank subsidiaries are also subject to examination and supervision by
the Federal Reserve or, in the case of non-bank subsidiaries of the Bank, by the OCC. Our
subsidiaries are also subject to examination by other federal and state agencies, including, in
the case of certain securities and investment management activities, regulation by the SEC and the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

In connection with emergency economic stabilization programs adopted in late 2008 as
described below under “Recent Regulatory Developments,” we are also subject for the foreseeable
future to certain direct oversight by the U.S. Treasury Department and to certain non-traditional
oversight by our normal banking regulators.

In addition to the impact of federal and state regulation, the Bank and our non-bank
subsidiaries are affected significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve as it attempts to
control the money supply and credit availability in order to influence the economy.

Holding Company Structure

We have one national bank subsidiary and numerous non-bank subsidiaries. Exhibit 21.1 of this
report lists all of our subsidiaries.

The Bank is subject to affiliate transaction restrictions under federal laws, which limit the
transfer of funds by a subsidiary bank or its subsidiaries to its parent corporation or any
non-bank subsidiary of its parent corporation, whether in the form of loans, extensions of credit,
investments, or asset purchases. Such transfers by a subsidiary bank are limited to:

•

10% of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus for transfers to its parent
corporation or to any individual non-bank subsidiary of the parent, and

•

An aggregate of 20% of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus for transfers to such
parent together with all such non-bank subsidiaries of the parent.

Furthermore, such loans and extensions of credit must be secured within specified amounts. In
addition, all affiliate transactions must be conducted on terms and under circumstances that are
substantially the same as such transactions with unaffiliated entities.

As a matter of policy, the Federal Reserve expects a bank holding company to act as a source
of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to
support each such subsidiary bank. Under this source of strength doctrine, the Federal Reserve may
require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank. They
may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if it fails to
commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the Federal Reserve
believes might jeopardize its ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank. A capital
injection may be required at times when the holding company does not have the resources to provide
it.



Any loans by a holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to
deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding
company’s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to
a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, the
bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of
payment over the claims of the institution’s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of
its note obligations.

Federal law permits the OCC to order the pro rata assessment of shareholders of a national
bank whose capital stock has become impaired, by losses or otherwise, to relieve a deficiency in
such national bank’s capital stock. This statute also provides for the enforcement of any such pro
rata assessment of shareholders of such national bank to cover such impairment of capital stock by
sale, to the extent necessary, of the capital stock owned by any assessed shareholder failing to
pay the assessment. As the sole shareholder of the Bank, we are subject to such provisions.

Moreover, the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative
expenses and the claims of holders of deposit liabilities of such an institution are accorded
priority over the claims of general unsecured creditors of such an institution, including the
holders of the institution’s note obligations, in the event of liquidation or other resolution of
such institution. Claims of a receiver for administrative expenses and claims of holders of
deposit liabilities of the Bank, including the FDIC as the insurer of such holders, would receive
priority over the holders of notes and other senior debt of the Bank in the event of liquidation
or other resolution and over our interests as sole shareholder of the Bank.

The Federal Reserve maintains a bank holding company rating system that emphasizes risk
management, introduces a framework for analyzing and rating financial factors, and provides a
framework for assessing and rating the potential impact of non-depository entities of a holding
company on its subsidiary depository institution(s).

A composite rating is assigned based on the foregoing three components, but a fourth
component is also rated, reflecting generally the assessment of depository institution
subsidiaries by their principal regulators. Ratings are made on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 highest) and
are not made public. The bank holding company rating system, which became effective in 2005,
applies to us. The composite ratings assigned to us, like those assigned to other financial
institutions, are confidential and may not be directly disclosed, except to the extent required by
law.

Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,
 Financial Stability Plan, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009, Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan, and Other Regulatory Developments

Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008

On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) was enacted. EESA
enables the federal government, under terms and conditions to be developed by the Secretary of the
Treasury, to insure troubled assets, including mortgage-backed securities, and collect premiums
from participating financial institutions. EESA includes, among other provisions: (a) the $700
billion Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP), under which the Secretary of the Treasury is
authorized to purchase, insure, hold, and sell a wide variety of financial instruments,
particularly those that are based on or related to residential or commercial mortgages originated
or issued on or before March 14, 2008; and (b) an increase in the amount of deposit insurance
provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Both of these specific provisions
are discussed in the below sections.

Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP)

Under the TARP, the Department of Treasury authorized a voluntary capital purchase program
(CPP) to purchase up to $250 billion of senior preferred shares of qualifying financial
institutions that elected to participate by November 14, 2008. Participating companies must adopt
certain standards for executive compensation, including (a) prohibiting “golden parachute” payments
as defined in EESA to senior Executive Officers; (b) requiring recovery of any compensation paid to
senior Executive Officers based on criteria that is later proven to be materially inaccurate; and
(c) prohibiting incentive compensation that encourages unnecessary and excessive risks that
threaten the value of the financial institution. The terms of the CPP also limit certain uses of
capital by the issuer, including repurchases of company stock, and increases in dividends.



On November 14, 2008, we participated in the CPP and issued approximately $1.4 billion in
capital in the form of non-voting cumulative preferred stock that pays cash dividends at the rate
of 5% per annum for the first five years, and then pays cash dividends at the rate of 9% per annum
thereafter. In addition, the Department of Treasury received warrants to purchase shares of our
common stock having an aggregate market price equal to 15% of the preferred stock amount. The
proceeds of the $1.4 billion have been credited to the preferred stock and additional
paid-in-capital. The difference between the par value of the preferred stock and the amount
credited to the preferred stock account is amortized against retained earnings and is
reflected in our  income statement as dividends on preferred shares, resulting in additional
dilution to our common stock. The exercise price for the warrant of $8.90, and the market price for
determining the number of shares of common stock subject to the warrants, was determined on the
date of the preferred investment (calculated on a 20-trading day trailing average). The warrants
are immediately exercisable, in whole or in part, over a term of 10 years. The warrants are
included in our diluted average common shares outstanding in periods when the effect of their
inclusion is dilutive to earnings per share.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)

EESA temporarily raised the limit on federal deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to
$250,000 per depositor. Separate from EESA, in October 2008, the FDIC also announced the Temporary
Liquidity Guarantee Program. Under one component of this program, the FDIC temporarily provides
unlimited coverage for noninterest bearing transaction deposit accounts through December 31, 2009.
The limits are scheduled to return to $100,000 on January 1, 2010.

In addition, on February 3, 2009, the Bank completed the issuance and sale of $600 million of
Floating Rate Senior Bank Notes with a variable rate of three month LIBOR plus 40 basis points, due
June 1, 2012 (the Notes). The Notes are guaranteed by the FDIC under the FDIC’s Temporary
Liquidity Guarantee Program and are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. The
FDIC’s guarantee cost $20 million, which will be amortized over the term of the notes.

(See “Bank Liquidity” discussion for additional details regarding the Temporary Liquidity
Guarantee Program.)

Financial Stability Plan

On February 10, 2009, the Financial Stability Plan (FSP) was announced by the U.S.
Treasury Department.  The FSP is a comprehensive set of measures intended to shore up the
financial system.  The core elements of the plan include making bank capital injections, creating a public-private investment fund to buy troubled assets, establishing guidelines for loan modification programs and expanding the Federal Reserve lending program.
The U.S. Treasury Department has indicated more details regarding the FSP are to be
announced on a newly created government website, FinancialStability.gov, in the
next several weeks.  We continue to monitor these developments and assess their potential impact on our business.

American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009

On February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was enacted.
 ARRA is intended to provide a stimulus to the U.S. economy in the wake of the economic downturn
brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis and the resulting credit crunch.  The bill includes
federal tax cuts, expansion of unemployment benefits and other social welfare provisions, and
domestic spending in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, including the energy structure.
The new law also includes numerous non-economic recovery related items, including a limitation
on executive compensation in federally aided banks.

Under ARRA, an institution will be subject to the following restrictions and standards
through out the period in which any obligation arising from financial assistance provided
under TARP remains outstanding:

•

Limits on compensation incentives for risk taking by senior executive officers.

•

Requirement of recovery of any compensation paid based on inaccurate financial information.

•

Prohibition on “Golden Parachute Payments”.

•

Prohibition on compensation plans that would encourage
manipulation of reported earnings to enhance the compensation of employees.

•

Publicly registered TARP recipients must establish a board compensation
committee comprised entirely
of independent directors, for the purpose of reviewing employee compensation plans.

•

Prohibition on bonus, retention award, or incentive compensation, except for
payments of long term restricted stock.

•

Limitation on luxury expenditures.

•

TARP recipients are required to permit a separate shareholder vote to approve the
compensation of executives, as disclosed pursuant to the SEC’s
compensation disclosure rules.

•

The chief executive officer and chief financial officer of each TARP recipient will be required
to provide a written certification of compliance with these standards to the SEC.

The foregoing is a summary of requirements to be included in
 standards to be established by the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department.

Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan

On February 18, 2009, the Homeowner Affordability and Stability
Plan (HASP) was announced by the President of the United States.  HASP is intended to support a
recovery in the housing market and ensure that workers can continue to pay off their mortgages
through the following elements:

•

Provide access to low-cost refinancing for
responsible homeowners suffering from falling home prices.

•

A $75 billion homeowner stability initiative to prevent foreclosure and help responsible families stay in their homes.

•

Support low mortgage rates by strengthening confidence in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

More details regarding HASP are to be announced on March 4, 2009.
We continue to monitor these
developments and assess their potential impact on our business

Other Regulatory Developments

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s “Basel II” regulatory capital guidelines
originally published in June 2004 and adopted in final form by U.S. regulatory agencies in
November 2007 are designed to promote improved risk measurement and management processes and
better align minimum capital requirements with risk. The Basel II guidelines became operational
in April 2008, but are mandatory only for “core banks,” i.e., banks with consolidated total assets
of $250 billion or more. They are thus not applicable to the Bank, which continues to operate
under U.S. risk-based capital guidelines consistent with “Basel I” guidelines published in 1988.

Federal regulators issued for public comment in December 2006 proposed rules (designated as
“Basel IA” rules) applicable to non-core banks that would have modified the existing U.S. Basel
I-based capital framework. In July 2008, however, these regulators issued

,

instead of the Basel
1A proposals

,

a new rulemaking involving a “standardized approach” that would implement some of
the simpler approaches for both credit risk and operational risk from the more advanced Basel II
framework. Non-core U.S. depository institutions would be allowed to opt in to the standardized
approach or elect to remain under the existing Basel 1-based regulatory capital framework. The
new rulemaking remained pending at the end of 2008.

Dividend Restrictions

Dividends from the Bank are the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to our
shareholders. However, there are statutory limits on the amount of dividends that the Bank can
pay to us without regulatory approval. The Bank may not, without prior regulatory approval, pay a
dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits. In addition, the prior approval of the
OCC is required for the payment of a dividend by a national bank if the total of all dividends
declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for the year combined with
its retained net income for the two preceding years. As a result, for the year ended December 31,
2008, the Bank did not pay any cash dividends to Huntington. At December 31, 2008, the Bank could
not have declared and paid any additional dividends to the parent company without regulatory
approval.



If, in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a bank under its jurisdiction is
engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice, such authority may require,
after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from such practice. Depending on the
financial condition of the Bank, the applicable regulatory authority might deem us to be engaged
in an unsafe or unsound practice if the Bank were to pay dividends. The Federal Reserve and the
OCC have issued policy statements that provide that insured banks and bank holding companies
should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. As previously described,
the CPP limits our ability to increase dividends to shareholders.

FDIC Insurance

With the enactment in February 2006 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 and
related legislation, and the adoption by the FDIC of implementing regulations in November 2006,
major changes were introduced in FDIC deposit insurance, effective January 1, 2007.

Under the reformed deposit insurance regime, the FDIC designates annually a target reserve
ratio for the DIF within the range of 1.15 percent and 1.5 percent, instead of the prior fixed
requirement to manage the DIF so as to maintain a designated reserve ratio of 1.25 percent.

In addition, the FDIC adopted a new risk-based system for assessment of deposit insurance
premiums on depository institutions, under which all such institutions would pay at least a minimum
level of premiums. The new system is based on an institution’s probability of causing a loss to
the DIF, and requires that each depository institution be placed in one of four risk categories,
depending on a combination of its capitalization and its supervisory ratings. Under the base rate
schedule adopted in late 2006, institutions in Risk Category I would be assessed between 2 and 4
basis points, while institutions in Risk Category IV could be assessed a maximum of 40 basis
points.

The FDIC set 2007 assessment rates at three basis points above the base schedule rates, i.e.,
between 5 and 7 basis points for Risk Category I institutions and up to 43 basis points for Risk
Category IV institutions. To assist the transition to the new system requiring assessment payments
by all insured institutions, the Bank and other depository institutions that were in existence on
and paid deposit insurance assessments prior to December 31, 1996, were made eligible for a
one-time assessment credit based on their shares of the aggregate 1996 assessment base. The Bank’s
assessment rate, like that of other financial institutions, is confidential and may not be directly
disclosed, except to the extent required by law.

For 2008, the FDIC resolved to maintain the designated reserve ratio at 1.25 percent, and to
leave risk-based assessments at the same rates as in 2007, that is between 5 and 43 basis points,
depending upon an institution’s risk category.

As a participating FDIC insured bank, we were assessed deposit insurance premiums totaling
$24.1 million during 2008. However, the one-time assessment credit described above was fully
utilized to substantially offset our 2008 deposit insurance premium and, therefore, only $7.6
million of deposit insurance premium expense was recognized during 2008.

In late 2008, the FDIC raised assessment rates for the first quarter of 2009 by a uniform 7
basis points, resulting in a range between 12 and 50 basis points, depending upon the risk
category. At the same time, the FDIC proposed further changes in the assessment system beginning
in the second quarter of 2009. These changes commencing April 1, 2009, would set base assessment
rates between 10 and 45 basis points, depending on the risk category, but would apply adjustments
(relating to unsecured debt, secured liabilities, and brokered deposits) to individual institutions
that could result in assessment rates between 8 and 21 basis points for institutions in the lowest
risk category and 43 to 77.5 basis points for institutions in the highest risk category. A final
rule to be issued in early 2009 could adjust these assessment rates further in the light of
developing conditions. The purpose of the April 1, 2009, changes is to ensure that riskier
institutions will bear a greater share of the proposed increase in assessments, and will be
subsidized to a lesser degree by less risky institutions. The changes are also part of an FDIC
plan to restore the designated reserve ratio to 1.25% by 2013. That ratio was expected to fall to
0.65 to 0.70 percent during the course of 2009.



The Bank continues to be required to make payments for the servicing of obligations of the
Financing Corporation (FICO) that were issued in connection with the resolution of savings and loan
associations, so long as such obligations remain outstanding.

Capital Requirements

The Federal Reserve has issued risk-based capital ratio and leverage ratio guidelines for bank
holding companies. The risk-based capital ratio guidelines establish a systematic analytical
framework that:

•

makes regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among
banking organizations,

•

takes off-balance sheet exposures into explicit account in assessing capital adequacy,
and

•

minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets.

Under the guidelines and related policies, bank holding companies must maintain capital
sufficient to meet both a risk-based asset ratio test and a leverage ratio test on a consolidated
basis. The risk-based ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet
commitments into four weighted categories, with higher weighting assigned to categories perceived
as representing greater risk. The risk-based ratio represents capital divided by total risk
weighted assets. The leverage ratio is core capital divided by total assets adjusted as specified
in the guidelines. The Bank is subject to substantially similar capital requirements.

Generally, under the applicable guidelines, a financial institution’s capital is divided into
two tiers. Institutions that must incorporate market risk exposure into their risk-based capital
requirements may also have a third tier of capital in the form of restricted short-term
subordinated debt. These tiers are:

•

“Tier 1”, or core capital, includes total equity plus qualifying capital securities and
minority interests, excluding unrealized gains and losses accumulated in other
comprehensive income, and non-qualifying intangible and servicing assets.

•

“Tier 2”, or supplementary capital, includes, among other things, cumulative and
limited-life preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, qualifying subordinated
debt, and the allowance for credit losses, up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets.

•

“Total capital” is Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital.

The Federal Reserve and the other federal banking regulators require that all intangible
assets (net of deferred tax), except originated or purchased mortgage-servicing rights,
non-mortgage servicing assets, and purchased credit card relationships, be deducted from Tier 1
capital. However, the total amount of these items included in capital cannot exceed 100% of its
Tier 1 capital.

Under the risk-based guidelines, financial institutions are required to maintain a risk-based
ratio of 8%, with 4% being Tier 1 capital. The appropriate regulatory authority may set higher
capital requirements when they believe an institution’s circumstances warrant.

Under the leverage guidelines, financial institutions are required to maintain a leverage
ratio of at least 3%. The minimum ratio is applicable only to financial institutions that meet
certain specified criteria, including excellent asset quality, high liquidity, low interest rate
risk exposure, and the highest regulatory rating. Financial institutions not meeting these criteria
are required to maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.

Special minimum capital requirements apply to equity investments in non-financial companies.
The requirements consist of a series of deductions from Tier 1 capital that increase within a range
from 8% to 25% of the adjusted carrying value of the investment.

Failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject the financial institution to a
variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities. These include
limitations on the ability to pay dividends, the issuance by the regulatory authority of a capital
directive to increase capital, and the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC. In addition,
the financial institution could be subject to the measures described below under “Prompt Corrective
Action” as applicable to “under-capitalized” institutions.



The risk-based capital standards of the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the FDIC specify that
evaluations by the banking agencies of a bank’s capital adequacy will include an assessment of the
exposure to declines in the economic value of the bank’s capital due to changes in interest rates.
These banking agencies issued a joint policy statement on interest rate risk describing prudent
methods for monitoring such risk that rely principally on internal measures of exposure and active
oversight of risk management activities by senior management.

Prompt Corrective Action

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, known as FDICIA, requires
federal banking regulatory authorities to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to
depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, FDICIA
establishes five capital tiers: “well-capitalized,” “adequately-capitalized,” “under-capitalized,”
“significantly under-capitalized,” and “critically under-capitalized.”

An institution is deemed to be:

•

“well-capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% or greater and is
not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific
capital level for any capital measure;

•

“adequately-capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a
Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4% or greater, and, generally, a Tier 1 leverage ratio of
4% or greater and the institution does not meet the definition of a “well-capitalized”
institution;

•

“under-capitalized” if it does not meet one or more of the “adequately-capitalized” tests;

•

“significantly under-capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less
than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 3%, or a Tier 1 leverage ratio
that is less than 3%; and

•

“critically under-capitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity, as defined in the
regulations, to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%.

Throughout 2008, our regulatory capital ratios and those of the Bank were in excess of the
levels established for “well-capitalized” institutions.

FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution,
including payment of a cash dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company, if the
depository institution would be “under-capitalized” after such payment. “Under-capitalized”
institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required by the appropriate federal banking
agency to submit a capital restoration plan. If any depository institution subsidiary of a holding
company is required to submit a capital restoration plan, the holding company would be required to
provide a limited guarantee regarding compliance with the plan as a condition of approval of such
plan.

If an “under-capitalized” institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if
it is “significantly under-capitalized.” “Significantly under-capitalized” institutions may be
subject to a number of requirements and



restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting
stock to become “adequately-capitalized,” requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of
receipt of deposits from correspondent banks.

“Critically under-capitalized” institutions may not, beginning 60 days after becoming
“critically under-capitalized,” make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated
debt. In addition, “critically under-capitalized” institutions are subject to appointment of a
receiver or conservator within 90 days of becoming so classified.

Under FDICIA, a depository institution that is not “well-capitalized” is generally prohibited
from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing
rate in its market. As previously stated, the Bank is “well-capitalized” and the FDICIA brokered
deposit rule did not adversely affect its ability to accept brokered deposits. The Bank had $3.4
billion of such brokered deposits at December 31, 2008.

Financial Holding Company Status

In order to maintain its status as a financial holding company, a bank holding company’s
depository subsidiaries must all be both “well capitalized” and “well managed,” and must meet
their Community Reinvestment Act obligations.

Financial holding company powers relate to “financial activities” that are determined by the
Federal Reserve, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, to be financial in nature,
incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity,
provided that the complementary activity does not pose a safety and soundness risk. The
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act designates certain activities as financial in nature, including:

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also authorizes the Federal Reserve, in coordination with the
Secretary of the Treasury, to determine that additional activities are financial in nature or
incidental to activities that are financial in nature.

We are required by the Bank Holding Company Act to obtain Federal Reserve approval prior to
acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of voting shares of any bank, if, after
such acquisition, we would own or control more than 5% of its voting stock. However, as a
financial holding company, we may commence any new financial activity, except for the acquisition
of a savings association, with notice to the Federal Reserve within 30 days after the commencement
of the new financial activity.

USA Patriot Act

The USA Patriot Act of 2001 and its related regulations require insured depository
institutions, broker-dealers, and certain other financial institutions to have policies,
procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing.
The statute and its regulations also provide for information sharing, subject to conditions,
between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial
institutions, for counter-terrorism purposes. Federal banking regulators are required, when
reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications, to take into account the
effectiveness of the anti-money laundering activities of the applicants.

Customer Privacy and Other Consumer Protections

Pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, we, like all other financial institutions, are
required to:

•

provide notice to our customers regarding privacy policies and practices,



•

inform our customers regarding the conditions under which their non-public personal
information may be disclosed to non-affiliated third parties, and

•

give our customers an option to prevent disclosure of such information to non-affiliated
third parties.

Under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, our customers may also opt out of
information sharing between and among us and our affiliates. We are also subject, in connection
with our lending and leasing activities, to numerous federal and state laws aimed at protecting
consumers, including the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act,
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposed new or revised corporate governance, accounting, and
reporting requirements on us and all other companies having securities registered with the SEC.
In addition to a requirement that chief executive officers and chief financial officers certify
financial statements in writing, the statute imposed requirements affecting, among other matters,
the composition and activities of audit committees, disclosures relating to corporate insiders and
insider transactions, codes of ethics, and the effectiveness of internal controls over financial
reporting.

Item 1A: Risk Factors

We, like other financial companies, are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect
our financial condition or results of operation, many of which are outside of our direct control,
though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns. Among the risks assumed
are: (1)

credit risk

, which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other
counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms, (2)

market risk

, which is the risk of loss due to changes in the market value of assets and
liabilities due to changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and
credit spreads, (3)

liquidity risk

, which is the risk of loss due to the possibility that
funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments based on external macro market
issues, investor and customer perception of financial strength, and events unrelated to the Company
such as war, terrorism, or financial institution market specific issues, and (4)

operational
risk

, which is the risk of loss due to human error, inadequate or failed internal systems and
controls, violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or
ethical standards, and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities,
disasters, and security risks.

In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report,
readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could
materially impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows.



(1) Credit Risks:

The allowance for loan losses may prove inadequate or be negatively affected by credit risk
exposures.

Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. We periodically review the
allowance for loan and lease losses for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends,
collateral values and credit quality indicators, including past charge-off experience and levels of
past due loans and nonperforming assets. There is no certainty that the allowance for loan losses
will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse
changes in the economy, market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers,
industries or markets. If the credit quality of the customer base materially decreases, if the
risk profile of a market, industry or group of customers changes materially, or if the allowance
for loan losses is not adequate, our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, and results
of operations could be materially adversely affected.

The largest single contributor to our net loss in the fourth quarter of 2008, and our reduced net
income in 2008, was $438.0 million of provision expense relating to our credit relationship with
Franklin Credit Management Corporation (Franklin). This charge represents our best estimate of the
inherent loss within this credit relationship. However, there can be no assurance that we will not
incur further losses relating to the Franklin relationship.

We have a significant loan relationship with Franklin. Franklin describes itself as a
specialty consumer finance company primarily engaged in the servicing and resolution of performing,
re-performing, and nonperforming residential mortgage loans. Franklin’s portfolio consists of
loans secured by 1-4 family residential real estate that generally fall outside the underwriting
standards of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and involve elevated credit risk as a result of the nature
or absence of income documentation, limited credit histories, higher levels of consumer debt or
past credit difficulties. Franklin purchased these loan portfolios at a discount to the unpaid
principal balances and originated loans with interest rates and fees calculated to provide a rate
of return adjusted to reflect the elevated credit risk inherent in these types of loans. Franklin
originated non-prime loans through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tribeca Lending Corp., and has
generally held for investment the loans acquired and a significant portion of the loans originated.

Through the 2008 third quarter, the Franklin relationship continued to perform and accrue
interest. While the cash flow generated by the underlying collateral declined slightly, it
continued to exceed the requirements of the restructuring agreement. However, during the 2008
fourth quarter the cash flows deteriorated significantly, reflecting a more severe than expected
deterioration in the overall economy. Principal payments associated with the first mortgage
portfolios contracted significantly as the availability of credit was further reduced. An
important source of principal reductions had been proceeds from the sale of properties in
foreclosure, so the tightening of credit standards had a direct negative impact on the cash flows
during the quarter. In addition, interest collections declined in the Franklin second mortgage
portfolio as delinquencies continued to increase. These factors, coupled with the significant
economic downturn in the 2008 fourth quarter, further weakened Franklin’s borrowers’ ability to
pay, which resulted in significant deterioration in the cash flow that we expected to receive from
these loans. As such, the changes in our estimates of the future expected cash flows led to the
following 2008 fourth quarter actions:

•

$423.3 million of our loans to Franklin were charged-off,

•

$9.0 million of interest income was reversed as the remaining loans were put on nonaccrual,

•

$7.3 million of interest swap exposure was written off, and

•

$438.0 million of provision expense was recorded to replenish and increase the remaining
specific loan loss reserve.

As a result of these actions, at December 31, 2008, total loans outstanding to Franklin were
$650.2 million, down $444.3 million, or 41%, from $1.095 billion at September 30, 2008. The
specific allowance for loan losses on the Franklin exposure at December 31, 2008, was $130.0
million, up from $115.3 million at September 30, 2008, and represented 20% of the remaining loans
outstanding. Subtracting the specific reserve from total loans outstanding, our total net exposure
to Franklin at December 31, 2008, was $520.2 million.

For further discussion concerning our exposure to Franklin, see the “Significant Items
Influencing Financial Performance and Comparisons” section included in our 2008 Annual Report to
Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by
reference.



If Franklin’s financial or operating condition were to deteriorate further, we have
established alternatives for loan servicing. In the event of default by Franklin, we can terminate
servicing responsibilities and appoint a successor servicer. Franklin would be contractually
obligated to cooperate with us and incur the costs of transferring all documents, files, and
balances to the successor.

We do not control Franklin, and Franklin’s ability to collect payments of principal and
interest on its loans and other recoveries from its real estate assets depends upon the efforts of
its own employees and third-party servicers hired by it. Franklin, like other residential mortgage
lenders, is likely to be materially adversely affected by further declines in home prices and
disruptions in credit markets in many locales across the United States.

A sustained weakness or weakening in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in
the markets in which we do business could adversely affect our business and operating results.

Our business could be adversely affected to the extent that weaknesses in business and
economic conditions have direct or indirect impacts on us or on our customers and counterparties.
These conditions could lead, for example, to one or more of the following:

•

A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;

•

A decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment
products offered by us; and

•

An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file
for protection under bankruptcy laws, or default on their loans or other obligations to us.

An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher
level of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses, and valuation
adjustments on loans held for sale. The markets we serve are dependent, indirectly, on industrial
businesses and thus particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in these
regions.

Our commercial real estate loan portfolio has and will continue to be affected by the on-going
correction in residential real estate prices and reduced levels of home sales.

At December 31, 2008, we had $10.1 billion of commercial real estate loans, including $1.6
billion of loans to builders of single family homes. There continues to be a general slowdown in
the housing market across our geographic footprint, reflecting declining prices and excess
inventories of houses to be sold. As a result, home builders have shown signs of financial
deterioration. We expect the home builder market to continue to be volatile and anticipate
continued pressure on the home builder segment in the coming months. As we continue our on-going
portfolio monitoring, we will make credit and reserve decisions based on the current conditions of
the borrower or project combined with our expectations for the future. If the slow down in the
housing market continues, we could experience higher charge-offs and delinquencies in this
portfolio.

Declines in home values and reduced levels of home sales in our markets could continue to adversely
affect us.

Like all banks, we are subject to the effects of any economic downturn. There has been a
slowdown in the housing market across our geographic footprint, reflecting declining prices and
excess inventories of houses to be sold. These developments have had, and further declines may
continue to have, a negative effect on our financial conditions and results of operations. At
December 31, 2008, we had:

•

$7.6 billion of home equity loans and lines, representing 18% of total loans and
leases.

•

$4.8 billion in residential real estate loans, representing 12% of total loans
and leases. Adjustable-rate mortgages, primarily mortgages that have a fixed rate
for the first 3 to 5 years and then adjust annually, comprised 63% of this
portfolio.

•

$1.6 billion of loans to single family home builders, including loans made to
both middle market and small business home builders. These loans represented 4% of
total loans and leases.

•

$0.7 billion of loans to Franklin, net of amounts charged-off, substantially all
of which is secured by and ultimately reflects exposures to residential real estate
loans. These loans represented 2% of total loans and leases.



•

$2.1 billion of mortgage-backed securities, including $1.6 billion of Federal Agency
mortgage-backed securities, $0.5 billion of private label collateralized mortgage
obligations, $0.3 billion of Alt-A mortgage backed securities, and $0.1 billion of
pooled trust preferred securities that could be negatively affected by a decline in
home values.

Adverse economic conditions in the automobile manufacturing and related service industries may
impact our banking business.

Many of the banking markets we serve are dependent, directly or indirectly, on the automobile
manufacturing industry. We do not have any direct credit exposure to
automobile manufacturers. However,  we do
have $288 million of exposure to companies that derive more than
25% of their revenues from contracts with the automobile
manufacturing companies. Also, these automobile manufacturers
or their suppliers employ many of our consumer customers. The automobile manufacturing industry
has experienced significant economic difficulties over the past five years, which, in turn, has
adversely impacted a number of related industries that serve the automobile manufacturing industry,
including automobile parts suppliers and other indirect businesses. We cannot provide assurance
that the economic conditions in the automobile manufacturing and related service industries will
improve at any time in the foreseeable future or that adverse economic conditions in these
industries will not impact the Bank.

We could experience losses on residual values related to our automobile lease portfolio.

Inherently, automobile lease portfolios are subject to residual risk, which arises when the
market price of the leased vehicle at the end of the lease term is below the estimated residual
value at the time the lease is originated. This situation arises due to a decline in used car
market values. A reduction in the expected proceeds from the residual values of our direct
financing leases would result in an immediate recognition of impairment on the lease whereas a
reduction in the expected proceeds from the residual values of our operating leases would result in
an increase in the depreciation of our operating lease assets over the remaining term of the lease.
For further discussion about our management of lease residual risk, see the “Lease Residual Risk”
section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions
of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by reference.

(2) Market Risks:

If our stock price declines from levels at December 31, 2008, we will evaluate our goodwill
balances for impairment, and if the values of our businesses have declined, we could recognize an
impairment charge for our goodwill.

We performed interim evaluations of our goodwill balances at June 30, 2008, and December 31,
2008, and an annual goodwill impairment assessment as of October 1, 2008. Based on our analyses, we
concluded that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded the fair value of our assets and
liabilities and, therefore, goodwill was not considered impaired at any of those dates. The
valuation of each of these lines of business included determining the value of the assets and
liabilities we currently own, as well as an estimate of the future earnings that we expect from
each line of business. To validate our evaluation of the values of our businesses, we reconcile
the aggregate values of our lines of business to our total market capitalization, allowing for an
appropriate control premium, typically in a range of 20% to 50%. The estimated control premium was
determined by a review of premiums paid for similar companies over the past five years. It is
possible that our assumptions and conclusions regarding the valuation of our lines of business
could change adversely, which could result in the recognition of impairment for our goodwill, which
could have a material effect on our financial position and future results of operations.

The value of certain investment securities is volatile and future declines or other-than-temporary
impairments could materially adversely affect our future earnings and regulatory capital.

Continued volatility in the market value for certain of our investment securities, whether
caused by changes in market perceptions of credit risk, as reflected in the expected market yield of
the security, or actual defaults in the portfolio could result in significant fluctuations in the
value of the securities. This could have a material adverse impact on our accumulated other
comprehensive loss and shareholders’ equity depending on the direction of the fluctuations.
Furthermore, future downgrades or defaults in these securities could result in future
classifications as other than temporarily impaired. This could have a material impact on our
future earnings, although the  impact on shareholders’ equity
will be offset by any amount already included
in other comprehensive income for securities where we have recorded temporary impairment.



Changes in interest rates could negatively impact our financial condition and results of
operations.

Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference
between interest earned on interest-earning assets (such as investments, loans, and direct
financing leases) and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (such as deposits and
borrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary
policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Conditions such as
inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors beyond our control may also
affect interest rates. If our interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than
interest-bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment, net interest income could be
adversely impacted. Likewise, if interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than
interest-earnings assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income could be
adversely impacted.

Changes in interest rates also can affect the value of loans, securities, and other assets,
including retained interests in securitizations, mortgage and non-mortgage servicing rights and
assets under management. A portion of our earnings results from transactional income. Examples of
transactional income include trust income, brokerage income, gain on sales of loans and other real
estate owned. This type of income can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year
based on a number of different factors, including the interest rate environment. An increase in
interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on
loans and leases may lead to an increase in nonperforming assets and a reduction of income
recognized, which could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations and cash
flows. When we decide to stop accruing interest on a loan, we reverse any accrued but unpaid
interest receivable, which decreases interest income. Subsequently, we continue to have a cost to
fund the loan, which is reflected as interest expense, without any interest income to offset the
associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the amount of loans on nonaccrual status could
have an adverse impact on net interest income.

Although fluctuations in market interest rates are neither completely predictable nor
controllable, our Market Risk Committee (MRC) meets periodically to monitor our interest rate
sensitivity position and oversee our financial risk management by establishing policies and
operating limits. For further discussion, see the Market Risk — “Interest Rate Risk” section
included in our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to
this report, and incorporated by reference. If short-term interest rates remain at their
historically low levels for a prolonged period, and assuming longer-term interest rates fall
further, we could experience net interest margin compression as our interest-earning assets would
continue to reprice downward while our interest-bearing liability rates, especially customer
deposit rates, could remain at current levels.

(3) Liquidity Risks:

If the Bank or holding company were unable to borrow funds through access to capital markets, we
may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors,
creditors, and borrowers, or the
operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.

Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The
liquidity of the Bank is used to make loans and leases and to repay deposit liabilities as they
become due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and limits are established by the board
of directors, with operating limits set by MRC, based upon the ratio of loans to deposits and
percentage of assets funded with non-core or wholesale funding. The Bank’s MRC regularly monitors
the overall liquidity position of the Bank and the parent company to ensure that various
alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. MRC also
establishes policies and monitors guidelines to diversify the Bank’s wholesale funding sources to
avoid concentrations in any one market source. Wholesale funding sources include Federal funds
purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and medium- and
long-term debt, which includes a domestic bank note program and a Euronote program. The Bank is
also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, Ohio (FHLB), which provides funding
through advances to members that are collateralized with mortgage-related assets.

We maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity.
There are other sources of liquidity available to us should they be needed. These sources include
the sale or securitization of loans, the ability to acquire additional national market, non-core
deposits, issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances, the issuance of
debt securities, and the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or private
transactions. The Bank also can borrow from the Federal Reserve’s discount window.



Starting in the middle of 2007, there has been significant turmoil and volatility in worldwide
financial markets which is, at present, ongoing. These conditions have resulted in a disruption in
the liquidity of financial markets, and could directly impact us to the extent we need to access
capital markets to raise funds to support our business and overall liquidity position. This
situation could affect the cost of such funds or our ability to raise such funds.


If we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed, we might be unable to
meet customers’ needs, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations,
cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. We may, from
time to time, consider opportunistically retiring our outstanding
securities, including our subordinated debt, trust preferred
securities and preferred shares in privately negotiated or open
market transactions for cash or common shares. For further discussion, see the “Liquidity
Risk” section included in our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as
exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by reference.

If our credit ratings were downgraded, the ability to access funding sources may be negatively
impacted or eliminated, and our liquidity and the market price of our common stock could be
adversely impacted. The Bank has issued letters of credit that support $500 million of notes and
bonds issued by our customers. The majority of the bonds have been sold by The Huntington
Investment Company, our broker-dealer subsidiary. A downgrade in the Bank’s short term rating
might influence some of the bond investors to put the bonds back to the remarketing agent. A
failure to remarket would require the Bank to obtain funding for the amount of notes and bonds that
cannot be remarketed.

Credit ratings by the three major credit rating agencies are an important component of our
liquidity profile. Among other factors, the credit ratings are based on the financial strength,
credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings,
capital adequacy, the quality of Management, the liquidity of the balance sheet, the availability
of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits, and the ability to access a broad
array of wholesale funding sources. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a negative
change in credit ratings and impact not only the ability to raise funds in the capital markets, but
also the cost of these funds. In addition, certain financial on- and off-balance sheet arrangements
contain credit rating triggers that could increase funding needs should a negative rating change
occur. Letter of credit commitments for marketable securities, interest rate swap collateral
agreements, and certain asset securitization transactions contain credit rating provisions.

Credit ratings as of February 13, 2009, for the parent company and the Bank can be found in
Table 40 of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders,
portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by reference.

We rely on certain funding sources such as large corporate deposits, public fund deposits,
federal funds, Euro deposits, FHLB advances, and bank notes. Although not contractually tied to
credit ratings, our ability to access these funding sources may be impacted by negative changes in
credit ratings. In the case of public funds or FHLB advances, a credit downgrade may also trigger a
requirement that we pledge additional collateral against outstanding borrowings. Credit rating
downgrades could result in a loss of equity investor confidence.

The OCC may impose dividend payment and other restrictions on the Bank, which could impact our
ability to pay dividends to shareholders or repurchase stock. Due to the significant loss that the
Bank incurred in the fourth quarter of 2008, at December 31, 2008, the Bank could not declare and
pay dividends to the holding company without regulatory approval.

The OCC is the primary regulatory agency that examines the Bank, its subsidiaries, and their
respective activities. Under certain circumstances, including any determination that the activities
of the Bank or its subsidiaries constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice, the OCC has the
authority by statute to restrict the Bank’s ability to transfer assets, make shareholder
distributions, and redeem preferred securities.

Under applicable statutes and regulations, dividends by a national bank may be paid out of
current or retained net profits, but a national bank is prohibited from declaring a cash dividend
on shares of its common stock out of net profits until the surplus fund equals the amount of
capital stock or, if the surplus fund does not equal the amount of capital stock, until certain
amounts from net profits are transferred to the surplus fund. Moreover, the prior approval of the
OCC is required for the payment of a dividend if the total of all dividends declared by a national
bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for the year combined with its
net profits for the two preceding years, less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for the
retirement of any preferred securities.



We do not anticipate that the holding company will receive dividends from the Bank during
2009, as we build the Bank’s regulatory capital levels above our
already “well-capitalized” level.

Payment of dividends could also be subject to regulatory limitations if the Bank became
“under-capitalized” for purposes of the OCC “prompt corrective action” regulations.
“Under-capitalized” is currently defined as having a total risk-based capital ratio of less than
8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, or a core capital, or leverage, ratio of
less than 4.0%. If the Bank were unable to pay dividends to the parent company, it could impact
our ability to pay dividends to shareholders or repurchase stock. Throughout 2008, the Bank was in
compliance with all regulatory capital requirements and considered to be “well-capitalized.”

For further discussion, see the “Parent Company Liquidity” section included in our 2008 Annual
Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and
incorporated by reference.

(4) Operational Risks:

If our regulators deem it appropriate, they can take regulatory actions that could impact our
ability to compete for new business, constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs, and
increase the cost of our services.

Huntington and its subsidiaries are subject to the supervision and regulation of various State
and Federal regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal
Reserve, the FDIC, SEC, FINRA, and various state regulatory agencies. As such, Huntington is
subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations, many of which are discussed in the “Regulatory
Matters” section. As part of their supervisory process, which includes
periodic examinations and continuous monitoring, the regulators have the authority to impose
restrictions or conditions on our activities and the manner in which we manage the organization.
These actions could impact the organization in a variety of ways, including subjecting us to
monetary fines, restricting our ability to pay dividends, precluding mergers or acquisitions,
limiting our ability to offer certain products or services, or imposing additional capital
requirements.

The resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse
affect on our results of operations for a particular period.

Huntington faces legal risks in its businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages
and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions
remain high. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against Huntington could
have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to Huntington, which
in turn could seriously harm Huntington’s business prospects. As more fully described in Note 21
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2008 Annual Report to
Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by
reference, three putative class actions and three shareholder derivative action were filed against
Huntington, certain affiliated committees, and / or certain of its current or former officers and
directors from December 2007 through February 2008 related to Huntington’s transactions with
Franklin and the financial disclosures relating to such transactions and, in one case, Huntington
stock being offered as an investment in a Huntington employee benefit plan. At this time, it is
not possible for management to assess the probability of an adverse outcome, or reasonably estimate
the amount of any potential loss in connection with these lawsuits. Although no assurance can be
given, based on information currently available, consultation with counsel, and available insurance
coverage, management believes that the eventual outcome of these claims against us will not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
position or results of operations. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these
matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations for a particular period.



Huntington faces significant operational risk.

Huntington is exposed to many types of operational risk, including reputational risk, legal
and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized
transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or
those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Negative public
opinion can result from Huntington’s actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities,
including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by
government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public
opinion can adversely affect Huntington’s ability to attract and keep customers and can expose it
to litigation and regulatory action.

We establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide us with timely
and accurate information about our level of operational risk. While not foolproof, these systems
have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate, cost-effective levels. Procedures
exist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practices
are followed. While we continually monitor and improve the system of internal controls, data
processing systems, and corporate-wide processes and procedures, there can be no assurance that
future losses will not occur.

Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future could impair
our ability to accurately and timely report its financial results or prevent fraud, resulting in
loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and stock price.

Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable
financial reports and prevent fraud. As a financial holding company, we are subject to regulation
that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures. Management continually seeks to improve
these controls and procedures.

Management believes that our key internal controls over financial reporting are currently
effective; however, such controls and procedures will be modified, supplemented, and changed from
time to time as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments.
While Management will continue to assess our controls and procedures and take immediate action to
remediate any future perceived gaps, there can be no guarantee of the effectiveness of these
controls and procedures on an on-going basis. Any failure to maintain in the future an effective
internal control environment could impact our ability to report its financial results on an
accurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence,
and adversely impact its business and stock price.



Item 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2: Properties

Our headquarters, as well as the Bank’s, are located in the Huntington Center, a
thirty-seven-story office building located in Columbus, Ohio. Of the building’s total office space
available, we lease approximately 40%. The lease term expires in 2015, with nine five-year renewal
options for up to 45 years but with no purchase option. The Bank has an indirect minority equity
interest of 18.4% in the building.

Our other major properties consist of:

The office buildings above serve as regional administrative offices occupied predominantly by
our Regional Banking and Private Financial, Capital Markets, and Insurance Group lines of business.
The Auto Finance and Dealer Services line of business is located in the Northland operations
center.

Of these properties, we own the thirteen-story and twelve-story office buildings, and the
Business Service Center in Columbus and the twelve-story office building in Youngstown, Ohio. All
of the other major properties are held under long-term leases. In 1998, we entered into a
sale/leaseback agreement that included the sale of 59 of our locations. The transaction included a
mix of branch banking offices, regional offices, and operational facilities, including certain
properties described above, which we will continue to operate under a long-term lease.

Item 9A: Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Huntington maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that the
information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time
periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and
communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Huntington’s Management, with the participation of its Chief
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of Huntington’s
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon such evaluation,
Huntington’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end
of such period, Huntington’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

There have not been any significant changes in Huntington’s internal control over financial
reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during
the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, Huntington’s internal control over financial reporting.
