Huntington
    Bancshares Incorporated

PART I

When we refer to “we,” “our,” and
    “us” in this report, we mean Huntington Bancshares
    Incorporated and our consolidated subsidiaries, unless the
    context indicates that we refer only to the parent company,
    Huntington Bancshares Incorporated. When we refer to the
    “Bank” in this report, we mean our only bank
    subsidiary, The Huntington National Bank, and its subsidiaries.

Item 1:

Business

We are a multi-state diversified regional bank holding company
    organized under Maryland law in 1966 and headquartered in
    Columbus, Ohio. Through the Bank, we have 145 years of
    serving the financial needs of our customers. We provide
    full-service commercial, small business, consumer banking
    services, mortgage banking services, automobile financing,
    equipment leasing, investment management, trust services,
    brokerage services, customized insurance programs, and other
    financial products and services. The Bank, organized in 1866, is
    our only bank subsidiary. At December 31, 2010, the Bank
    had 611 branches as follows:

•

344 branches in Ohio

•

119 branches in Michigan

•

57 branches in Pennsylvania

•

50 branches in Indiana

•

28 branches in West Virginia

•

13 branches in Kentucky

Select financial services and other activities are also
    conducted in various other states. International banking
    services are available through the headquarters office in
    Columbus, Ohio and a limited purpose office located in the
    Cayman Islands, and another limited purpose office located in
    Hong Kong. Our foreign banking activities, in total or with any
    individual country, are not significant.

In late 2010, we reorganized the way in which we manage our
    business. Our segments are based on our internally-aligned
    segment leadership structure, which is how we monitor results
    and assess performance. For each of our four business segments,
    we expect the combination of our business model and exceptional
    service to provide a competitive advantage that supports revenue
    and earnings growth. Our business model emphasizes the delivery
    of a complete set of banking products and services offered by
    larger banks, but distinguished by local delivery, customer
    service, and pricing of these products.

Beginning in 2010, a key strategic emphasis has been for our
    business segments to operate in cooperation to provide products
    and services to our customers to build stronger and more
    profitable relationships using our Optimal Customer Relationship
    (OCR) sales and service process. The objectives of OCR are to:

1. Provide a consultative sales approach to provide
    solutions that are specific to each customer.

2. Leverage each business segment in terms of its products
    and expertise to benefit the customer.

3. Target prospects who may want to have their full
    relationship with us.

Following is a description of our four business segments and
    Treasury / Other function:

•

Retail and Business Banking — This segment provides
    financial products and services to consumer and small business
    customers located within our primary banking markets consisting
    of five areas covering the six states of Ohio, Michigan,
    Pennsylvania, Indiana, West Virginia, and Kentucky. Its products
    include individual and small business checking accounts, savings
    accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit,
    consumer loans, and small business loans and leases. Other
    financial services available to consumers and small business
    customers include investments, insurance services, interest rate
    risk protection products, foreign exchange hedging, and treasury
    management services. Retail and



Business Banking provides these services through a banking
    network of over 600 traditional branches and convenience
    branches located in grocery stores and retirement centers. In
    addition, an array of alternative distribution channels is
    available to customers including internet and mobile banking,
    telephone banking, and over 1,300 ATMs.

•

Commercial Banking — Our Commercial Banking group
    provides a wide array of products and services to the middle
    market and large corporate client base located primarily within
    our core geographic banking markets. Products and services are
    delivered through a relationship banking model and include
    commercial lending, as well as depository and liquidity
    management products. Dedicated teams collaborate with our
    primary bankers to deliver complex and customized treasury
    management solutions, equipment and technology leasing,
    international services, capital markets services such as
    interest rate protection, foreign exchange hedging and sales,
    trading of securities, and employee benefit programs (insurance,
    410(k)). The Commercial Banking team specializes in serving a
    number of industry segments such as government entities,

not-for-profit

organizations, heath-care entities, and large, publicly traded
    companies.

•

Automobile Finance and Commercial Real Estate — This
    segment provides lending and other banking products and services
    to customers outside of our normal retail or commercial
    channels. More specifically, we serve automotive dealerships,
    retail customers who obtain financing at the dealerships,
    professional real estate developers, REITs, and other customers
    with lending needs that are secured by commercial properties.
    Most of our customers are located in our primary banking
    markets. Our products and services include financing for the
    purchase of automobiles by customers of automotive dealerships;
    financing for the purchase of new and used vehicle inventory by
    automotive dealerships; and financing for land, buildings, and
    other commercial real estate owned or constructed by real estate
    developers, automobile dealerships, or other customers with real
    estate project financing needs. We also provide other banking
    products and services to our customers as well as their owners
    or principals. These products and services are delivered
    through: (1) our relationships with developers in our
    primary banking markets believed to be experienced,
    well-managed, and well-capitalized and are capable of operating
    in all phases of the real estate cycle (top-tier developers),
    (2) relationships with established automobile dealerships,
    (3) our leads through community involvement, and
    (4) referrals from other professionals.

•

Wealth Advisors, Government Finance, and Home
    Lending — This segment consists primarily of fee-based
    businesses including home lending, wealth management, and
    government finance. We originate and service consumer loans to
    customers who are generally located in our primary banking
    markets. Consumer lending products are distributed to these
    customers primarily through the Retail and Business Banking
    segment and commissioned loan originators. We provide wealth
    management banking services to high net worth customers in our
    primary banking markets and in Florida by utilizing a cohesive
    model that employs a unified sales force to deliver products and
    services directly and through the other segments. We provide
    these products and services through a unified sales team, which
    consists of former private bankers, trust officers, and
    investment advisors; Huntington Asset Advisors, which provides
    investment management services; Huntington Asset Services, which
    offers administrative and operational support to fund complexes;
    retirement plan services, and the national settlements business.
    We also provide banking products and services to government
    entities across our primary banking markets by utilizing a team
    of relationship managers providing public finance, brokerage,
    trust, lending, and treasury management services.

A Treasury / Other function includes our insurance
    brokerage business, which specializes in commercial
    property/casualty, employee benefits, personal lines, life and
    disability and specialty lines. We also provide brokerage and
    agency services for residential and commercial title insurance
    and excess and surplus product lines. As an agent and broker we
    do not assume underwriting risks; instead we provide our
    customers with quality, noninvestment insurance contracts. The
    Treasury / Other function also includes technology and
    operations, other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and
    expense.



The financial results for each of these business segments are
    included in Note 25 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements and are discussed in the Business Segment Discussion
    of our MD&A.

Competition

Although there has been consolidation in the financial services
    industry, our markets remain competitive. We compete with other
    banks and financial services companies such as savings and
    loans, credit unions, and finance and trust companies, as well
    as mortgage banking companies, automobile and equipment
    financing companies, insurance companies, mutual funds,
    investment advisors, and brokerage firms, both within and
    outside of our primary market areas. Internet companies are also
    providing nontraditional, but increasingly strong, competition
    for our borrowers, depositors, and other customers. In addition,
    our AFCRE segment faces competition from the financing divisions
    of automobile manufacturers.

We compete for loans primarily on the basis of a combination of
    value and service by building customer relationships as a result
    of addressing our customers’ entire suite of banking needs,
    demonstrating expertise, and providing convenience to our
    customers. We also consider the competitive pricing pressures in
    each of our markets.

We compete for deposits similarly on a basis of a combination of
    value and service and by providing convenience through a banking
    network of over 600 branches and over 1,300 ATMs within our
    markets and our award-winning website at www.huntington.com. We
    have also instituted new and more customer friendly practices
    under our Fair Play banking philosophy, such as our

24-Hour

Grace

tm

account feature introduced in 2010, which gives customers an
    additional business day to cover overdrafts to their consumer
    account without being charged overdraft fees.

Many of our nonfinancial institution competitors have fewer
    regulatory constraints, broader geographic service areas,
    greater capital, and, in some cases, lower cost structures. In
    addition, competition for quality customers has intensified as a
    result of changes in regulation, advances in technology and
    product delivery systems, consolidation among financial service
    providers, bank failures, and the conversion of certain former
    investment banks to bank holding companies.



Regulatory
    Matters

General

We are a bank holding company and are qualified as a financial
    holding company with the Federal Reserve. We are subject to
    examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve pursuant to
    the Bank Holding Company Act. We are required to file reports
    and other information regarding our business operations and the
    business operations of our subsidiaries with the Federal Reserve.

Because we are a public company, we are also subject to
    regulation by the SEC. The SEC has established four categories
    of issuers for the purpose of filing periodic and annual
    reports. Under these regulations, we are considered to be a
    large accelerated filer and, as such, must comply with SEC
    accelerated reporting requirements.

The Bank, which is chartered by the OCC, is a national bank, and
    our only bank subsidiary. In addition, we have numerous nonbank
    subsidiaries. Exhibit 21.1 of this

Form 10-K

lists all of our subsidiaries. The Bank is subject to
    examination and supervision by the OCC. Its domestic deposits
    are insured by the DIF of the FDIC, which also has certain
    regulatory and supervisory authority over it. Our nonbank
    subsidiaries are also subject to examination and supervision by
    the Federal Reserve or, in the case of nonbank subsidiaries of
    the Bank, by the OCC. Our subsidiaries are subject to
    examination by other federal and state agencies, including, in
    the case of certain securities and investment management
    activities, regulation by the SEC and the Financial Industry
    Regulatory Authority.

In connection with EESA, we sold TARP Capital and a warrant to
    purchase shares of common stock to the Treasury pursuant to the
    CPP under TARP. As a result of our participation in TARP, we
    were subject to certain restrictions and direct oversight by the
    Treasury. Upon our repurchase of the TARP Capital on
    December 22, 2010, we are no longer subject to the
    TARP-related restrictions on dividends, stock repurchases, or
    executive compensation.

Legislative and regulatory reforms continue to have significant
    impacts throughout the financial services industry. In July
    2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted. The Dodd-Frank Act, which
    is complex and broad in scope, establishes the CFPB, which will
    have extensive regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer
    financial products and services, and the Financial Stability
    Oversight Council, which has oversight authority for monitoring
    and regulating systemic risk. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act
    alters the authority and duties of the federal banking and
    securities regulatory agencies, implements certain corporate
    governance requirements for all public companies including
    financial institutions with regard to executive compensation,
    proxy access by shareholders, and certain whistleblower
    provisions, and restricts certain proprietary trading and hedge
    fund and private equity activities of banks and their
    affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the issuance of
    many implementing regulations which will take effect over
    several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall
    impact to us, our customers, or the financial industry more
    generally. While the overall impact cannot be predicted with any
    degree of certainty, we believe we are likely to be negatively
    impacted by the Dodd-Frank Act primarily in the areas of capital
    requirements, restrictions on fees, and other charges to
    customers.

In addition to the impact of federal and state regulation, the
    Bank and our nonbank subsidiaries are affected significantly by
    the actions of the Federal Reserve as it attempts to control the
    money supply and credit availability in order to influence the
    economy.

As a
    bank holding company, we must act as a source of financial and
    managerial strength to the Bank and the Bank is subject to
    affiliate transaction restrictions.

Under changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act, a bank holding company
    must act as a source of financial and managerial strength to
    each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support
    each such subsidiary bank. Under current federal law, the
    Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make
    capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank. It may
    charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and
    unsound practices if the bank holding company fails to commit
    resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions
    that the Federal Reserve believes might jeopardize the bank
    holding company’s ability to commit resources to such
    subsidiary bank.



Any loans by a holding company to a subsidiary bank are
    subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other
    indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank
    holding company’s bankruptcy, an appointed bankruptcy
    trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a
    federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a
    subsidiary bank. Moreover, the bankruptcy law provides that
    claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a
    priority of payment over the claims of the institution’s
    general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note
    obligations.

Federal law permits the OCC to order the pro-rata assessment of
    shareholders of a national bank whose capital stock has become
    impaired, by losses or otherwise, to relieve a deficiency in
    such national bank’s capital stock. This statute also
    provides for the enforcement of any such pro-rata assessment of
    shareholders of such national bank to cover such impairment of
    capital stock by sale, to the extent necessary, of the capital
    stock owned by any assessed shareholder failing to pay the
    assessment. As the sole shareholder of the Bank, we are subject
    to such provisions.

Moreover, the claims of a receiver of an insured depository
    institution for administrative expenses and the claims of
    holders of deposit liabilities of such an institution are
    accorded priority over the claims of general unsecured creditors
    of such an institution, including the holders of the
    institution’s note obligations, in the event of liquidation
    or other resolution of such institution. Claims of a receiver
    for administrative expenses and claims of holders of deposit
    liabilities of the Bank, including the FDIC as the insurer of
    such holders, would receive priority over the holders of notes
    and other senior debt of the Bank in the event of liquidation or
    other resolution and over our interests as sole shareholder of
    the Bank.

The Bank is subject to affiliate transaction restrictions under
    federal laws, which limit certain transactions generally
    involving the transfer of funds by a subsidiary bank or its
    subsidiaries to its parent corporation or any nonbank subsidiary
    of its parent corporation, whether in the form of loans,
    extensions of credit, investments, or asset purchases, or
    otherwise undertaking certain obligations on behalf of such
    affiliates. Furthermore, covered transactions which are loans
    and extensions of credit must be secured within specified
    amounts. In addition, all covered transactions and other
    affiliate transactions must be conducted on terms and under
    circumstances that are substantially the same as such
    transactions with unaffiliated entities.

The Federal Reserve maintains a bank holding company rating
    system that emphasizes risk management, introduces a framework
    for analyzing and rating financial factors, and provides a
    framework for assessing and rating the potential impact of
    nondepository entities of a holding company on its subsidiary
    depository institution(s). A composite rating is assigned based
    on the foregoing three components, but a fourth component is
    also rated, reflecting generally the assessment of depository
    institution subsidiaries by their principal regulators. The bank
    holding company rating system, which became effective in 2005,
    applies to us. The composite ratings assigned to us, like those
    assigned to other financial institutions, are confidential and
    may not be disclosed, except to the extent required by law.

In
    2008, we sold TARP Capital and a warrant to purchase shares of
    common stock to the Treasury pursuant to the CPP under TARP. We
    repurchased the TARP Capital in the 2010 fourth
    quarter.

On October 3, 2008, EESA was enacted. EESA includes, among
    other provisions, TARP, under which the Secretary of the
    Treasury was authorized to purchase, insure, hold, and sell a
    wide variety of financial instruments, particularly those that
    were based on or related to residential or commercial mortgages
    originated or issued on or before March 14, 2008. Under
    TARP, the Treasury authorized a voluntary CPP to purchase up to
    $250 billion of senior preferred shares of stock from
    qualifying financial institutions that elected to participate.

On November 14, 2008, at the request of the Treasury and
    other regulators, we participated in the CPP by issuing to the
    Treasury, in exchange for $1.4 billion, 1.4 million
    shares of Huntington’s fixed-rate cumulative perpetual
    preferred stock, Series B, par value $0.01 per share, with
    a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (TARP Capital), and
    a ten-year warrant (Warrant), which was immediately exercisable,
    to purchase up to 23.6 million shares of Huntington’s
    common stock (approximately 3% of common shares outstanding at
    December 31, 2010), par value $0.01 per share, at an
    exercise price of $8.90 per share. The securities issued to the
    Treasury were accounted for as additions to our regulatory
    Tier 1 and Total capital. The proceeds were



used by the holding company to provide potential capital support
    for the Bank. This helped the Bank to continue its active
    lending programs for customers. This is evidenced by the
    increase in mortgage originations from $3.8 billion in
    2008, to $5.3 billion in 2009, and $5.5 billion in
    2010.

In connection with the issuance and sale of the TARP Capital to
    the Treasury, we agreed, among other things, to (1) limit
    the payment of quarterly dividends on our common stock,
    (2) limit our ability to repurchase our common stock or our
    outstanding serial preferred stock, (3) grant the holders
    of the TARP Capital, the Warrant, and the common stock to be
    issued under the Warrant certain registration rights, and
    (4) subject ourselves to the executive compensation
    limitations contained in EESA. These compensation limitations
    included (a) prohibiting “golden parachute”
    payments, as defined in EESA, to senior executive officers;
    (b) requiring recovery of any compensation paid to senior
    executive officers based on criteria that is later proven to be
    materially inaccurate; and (c) prohibiting incentive
    compensation that encouraged unnecessary and excessive risks
    that threaten the value of the financial institution.

On December 19, 2010, we sold $920.0 million of our
    common stock and $300.0 million of subordinated debt in
    public offerings. On December 22, 2010, these proceeds,
    along with other available funds, were used to complete the
    repurchase of our $1.4 billion of TARP Capital. On
    January 19, 2011, we repurchased the Warrant for our common
    stock associated with our participation in the TARP CPP for
    $49.1 million, or $2.08 for each of the 23.6 million
    common shares to which the Treasury was entitled. Prior to this
    repurchase, we were in compliance with all TARP standards,
    restrictions, and dividend payment limitations. Because of the
    repurchase of our TARP Capital, we are no longer subject to the
    TARP-related restrictions on dividends, stock repurchases, or
    executive compensation.

We
    have participated in certain extraordinary programs of the
    FDIC.

EESA temporarily raised the limit on federal deposit insurance
    coverage from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. This increase
    was made permanent in the Dodd-Frank Act. Separate from EESA, in
    October 2008, the FDIC also announced the TLGP to guarantee
    certain debt issued by FDIC-insured institutions.

On February 3, 2009, the Bank completed the issuance and
    sale of $600 million of Floating Rate Senior Bank Notes
    with a variable interest rate of three month LIBOR plus
    40 basis points, due June 1, 2012 (the Notes). The
    Notes are guaranteed by the FDIC under the TLGP and are backed
    by the full faith and credit of the United States of America.
    The FDIC’s guarantee costs $20 million which is being
    amortized over the term of these notes.

Under TAGP, a component of the TLGP, the FDIC temporarily
    provided unlimited coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction
    deposit accounts. We voluntarily began participating in the TAGP
    in October of 2008, but opted out of the TAGP effective
    July 1, 2010. Subsequently, both the TLGP and TAGP were
    terminated in light of Section 343 of the Dodd-Frank Act,
    which amended the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to provide
    unlimited deposit insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing
    transaction accounts beginning December 31, 2010, for a
    two-year period with no opt out provisions.

We are
    subject to capital requirements mandated by the Federal Reserve
    and these requirements will be changing under the Dodd-Frank
    Act.

The Federal Reserve has issued risk-based capital ratio and
    leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies. Under the
    guidelines and related policies, bank holding companies must
    maintain capital sufficient to meet both a risk-based asset
    ratio test and a leverage ratio test on a consolidated basis.
    The risk-based ratio is determined by allocating assets and
    specified off-balance sheet commitments into four weighted
    categories, with higher weighting assigned to categories
    perceived as representing greater risk. The risk-based ratio
    represents total capital divided by total risk-weighted assets.
    The leverage ratio is core capital divided by total assets
    adjusted as specified in the guidelines. The Bank is subject to
    substantially similar capital requirements.



Generally, under the applicable guidelines, a financial
    institution’s capital is divided into two tiers.
    Institutions that must incorporate market risk exposure into
    their risk-based capital requirements may also have a third tier
    of capital in the form of restricted short-term subordinated
    debt. These tiers are:

•

Tier 1, or core capital, includes total equity plus
    qualifying capital securities and minority interests, excluding
    unrealized gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive
    income, and nonqualifying intangible and servicing assets.

•

Tier 2, or supplementary capital, includes, among other
    things, cumulative and limited-life preferred stock, mandatory
    convertible securities, qualifying subordinated debt, and the
    allowance for credit losses, up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets.

•

Total Capital is Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital.

The Federal Reserve and the other federal banking regulators
    require that all intangible assets (net of deferred tax), except
    originated or purchased MSRs, nonmortgage servicing assets, and
    purchased credit card relationships, be deducted from
    Tier 1 capital. However, the total amount of these items
    included in capital cannot exceed 100% of its Tier 1
    capital.

Under the risk-based guidelines to remain
    Adequately-capitalized, financial institutions are required to
    maintain a total risk-based ratio of 8%, with 4% being
    Tier 1 capital. The appropriate regulatory authority may
    set higher capital requirements when they believe an
    institution’s circumstances warrant.

Under the leverage guidelines, financial institutions are
    required to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least
    3%. The minimum ratio is applicable only to financial
    institutions that meet certain specified criteria, including
    excellent asset quality, high liquidity, low interest rate risk
    exposure, and the highest regulatory rating. Financial
    institutions not meeting these criteria are required to maintain
    a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.

Failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject the
    financial institution to a variety of enforcement remedies
    available to the federal regulatory authorities. These include
    limitations on the ability to pay dividends, the issuance by the
    regulatory authority of a directive to increase capital, and the
    termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC. In addition, the
    financial institution could be subject to the measures described
    below under Prompt Corrective Action as applicable to
    Under-capitalized institutions.

The risk-based capital standards of the Federal Reserve, the
    OCC, and the FDIC specify that evaluations by the banking
    agencies of a bank’s capital adequacy will include an
    assessment of the exposure to declines in the economic value of
    a bank’s capital due to changes in interest rates. These
    banking agencies issued a joint policy statement on interest
    rate risk describing prudent methods for monitoring such risk
    that rely principally on internal measures of exposure and
    active oversight of risk management activities by senior
    management.

FDICIA requires federal banking regulatory authorities to take
    Prompt Corrective Action with respect to depository institutions
    that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these
    purposes, FDICIA establishes five capital tiers:
    Well-capitalized, Adequately-capitalized, Under-capitalized,
    Significantly under-capitalized, and Critically
    under-capitalized.

Throughout 2010, our regulatory capital ratios and those of the
    Bank were in excess of the levels established for
    Well-capitalized institutions. An institution is deemed to be
    Well-capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of
    10% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or
    greater, and a Tier 1



leverage ratio of 5% or greater and is not subject to a
    regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a
    specific capital level for any capital measure.

FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making
    any capital distribution, including payment of a cash dividend
    or paying any management fee to its holding company, if the
    depository institution would become Under-capitalized after such
    payment. Under-capitalized institutions are also subject to
    growth limitations and are required by the appropriate federal
    banking agency to submit a capital restoration plan. If any
    depository institution subsidiary of a holding company is
    required to submit a capital restoration plan, the holding
    company would be required to provide a limited guarantee
    regarding compliance with the plan as a condition of approval of
    such plan.

Depending upon the severity of the under capitalization, the
    Under-capitalized institutions may be subject to a number of
    requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell
    sufficient voting stock to become Adequately-capitalized,
    requirements to reduce total assets, cessation of receipt of
    deposits from correspondent banks, and restrictions on making
    any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt.
    Critically Under-capitalized institutions are subject to
    appointment of a receiver or conservator within 90 days of
    becoming so classified.

Under FDICIA, a depository institution that is not
    Well-capitalized is generally prohibited from accepting brokered
    deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the
    prevailing rate in its market. Since the Bank is
    Well-capitalized, the FDICIA brokered deposit rule did not
    adversely affect its ability to accept brokered deposits. The
    Bank had $1.5 billion of such brokered deposits at
    December 31, 2010.

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, important changes will be implemented
    concerning the capital requirements for financial institutions.
    The “Collins Amendment” provision of the Dodd-Frank
    Act imposes increased capital requirements in the future. The
    Collins Amendment also requires federal banking regulators to
    establish minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements
    to apply to insured depository institutions, bank and thrift
    holding companies, and systemically important nonbank financial
    companies. These capital requirements must not be less than the
    Generally Applicable Risk-based Capital Requirements and the
    Generally Applicable Leverage Capital Requirements as of
    July 21, 2010, and must not be quantitatively lower than
    the requirements that were in effect for insured depository
    institution as of July 21, 2010. The Collins Amendment
    defines Generally Applicable Risk-based Capital Requirements and
    Generally Applicable Leverage Capital Requirements to mean the
    risk-based capital requirements and minimum ratios of
    Tier 1 capital to average total assets, respectively,
    established by the appropriate federal banking agencies to apply
    to insured depository institutions under the Prompt Corrective
    Action provisions, regardless of total consolidated asset size
    or foreign financial exposure. We will be assessing the impact
    on us of these new regulations as they are proposed and
    implemented.



There
    are restrictions on our ability to pay dividends.

Dividends from the Bank to the parent company are the primary
    source of funds for payment of dividends to our shareholders.
    However, there are statutory limits on the amount of dividends
    that the Bank can pay to us without regulatory approval. The
    Bank may not, without prior regulatory approval, pay a dividend
    in an amount greater than its undivided profits. In addition,
    the prior approval of the OCC is required for the payment of a
    dividend by a national bank if the total of all dividends
    declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net
    income for the year combined with its retained net income for
    the two preceding years. As a result, for the year ended
    December 31, 2010, the Bank did not pay any cash dividends
    to us. At December 31, 2010, the Bank could not have
    declared and paid any dividends to the parent company without
    regulatory approval.

Since the first quarter of 2008, the Bank has requested and
    received OCC approval each quarter to pay periodic dividends to
    shareholders outside the Bank’s consolidated group on
    preferred and common stock of its REIT and capital financing
    subsidiaries to the extent necessary to maintain their REIT
    status. A wholly-owned nonbank subsidiary of the parent company
    owns a portion of the preferred shares of the REIT and capital
    financing subsidiaries. Outside of the REIT and capital
    financing subsidiary dividends, we do not anticipate that the
    Bank will declare dividends during 2011.

If, in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a
    bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in, or is about to engage
    in, an unsafe or unsound practice, such authority may require,
    after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from
    such practice. Depending on the financial condition of the Bank,
    the applicable regulatory authority might deem us to be engaged
    in an unsafe or unsound practice if the Bank were to pay
    dividends. The Federal Reserve and the OCC have issued policy
    statements that provide that insured banks and bank holding
    companies should generally only pay dividends out of current
    operating earnings.

The
    amount and timing of payments for FDIC Deposit Insurance are
    changing.

In late 2008, under the assessment regime that was applicable
    prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC raised assessment rates
    for the first quarter of 2009 by a uniform 7 basis points
    of adjusted domestic deposits, resulting in a range between 12
    and 50 basis points, depending upon the risk category. At
    the same time, the FDIC proposed further changes in the
    assessment system beginning in the second quarter of 2009. As
    amended in a final rule issued in March 2009, the changes,
    commencing April 1, 2009, set a five-year target of 1.15%
    for the designated reserve ratio, and set base assessment rates
    between 12 and 45 basis points of adjusted domestic
    deposits, depending on the risk category. In addition to these
    changes in the basic assessment regime, the FDIC, in an interim
    rule also issued in March 2009, imposed a 20 basis point
    emergency special assessment on deposits of insured institutions
    as of June 30, 2009, to be collected on September 30,
    2009. In May 2009, the FDIC imposed a further special assessment
    on insured institutions of five basis points on their
    June 30, 2009 assets minus Tier 1 capital, also
    payable September 30, 2009. And in November 2009, the FDIC
    required all insured institutions to prepay, on
    December 30, 2009, slightly over three years of estimated
    insurance assessments.

With the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, major changes were
    introduced to the FDIC deposit insurance system. Under the
    Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC now has until the end of September 2020
    to bring its reserve ratio to the new statutory minimum of
    1.35%. New rules amending the deposit insurance assessment
    regulations under the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act have
    been adopted, including a final rule designating 2% as the
    designated reserve ratio and a final rule extending temporary
    unlimited deposit insurance to noninterest bearing transaction
    accounts maintained in connection with lawyers’ trust
    accounts. On February 7, 2011, the FDIC adopted regulations
    effective for the 2011 second quarter assessment and payable in
    September 2011, which outline significant changes in the
    risk-based premiums approach for banks with over
    $10 billion of assets and creates a “Scorecard”
    system. The “Scorecard” system uses a performance
    score and loss severity score, which aggregate to an initial
    base assessment rate. The assessment base also changes from
    deposits to an institution’s average total assets minus its
    average tangible equity. We are



currently evaluating the effect of these new regulations, but do
    not expect the 2011 FDIC assessment impact on our Consolidated
    Financial Statements to be materially higher than the prior
    period.

As a
    financial holding company, we are subject to additional
    regulations.

In order to maintain its status as a financial holding company,
    a bank holding company’s depository subsidiaries must all
    be both Well-capitalized and well-managed, and must meet their
    Community Reinvestment Act obligations.

Financial holding company powers relate to financial activities
    that are determined by the Federal Reserve, in coordination with
    the Secretary of the Treasury, to be financial in nature,
    incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or
    complementary to a financial activity, provided that the
    complementary activity does not pose a safety and soundness
    risk. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act designates certain activities
    as financial in nature, including:

•

lending, exchanging, transferring, investing for others, or
    safeguarding money or securities;

•

underwriting insurance or annuities;

•

providing financial or investment advice;

•

underwriting, dealing in, or making markets in securities;

•

merchant banking, subject to significant limitations;

•

insurance company portfolio investing, subject to significant
    limitations; and

•

any activities previously found by the Federal Reserve to be
    closely related to banking.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also authorizes the Federal Reserve,
    in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, to determine
    if additional activities are financial in nature or incidental
    to activities that are financial in nature.

In addition, we are required by the Bank Holding Company Act to
    obtain Federal Reserve approval prior to acquiring, directly or
    indirectly, ownership or control of voting shares of any bank,
    if, after such acquisition, we would own or control more than 5%
    of its voting stock.

We
    also must comply with anti-money laundering, customer privacy,
    and consumer protection statutes and regulations as well as
    corporate governance, accounting, and reporting
    requirements.

The USA Patriot Act of 2001 and its related regulations require
    insured depository institutions, broker-dealers, and certain
    other financial institutions to have policies, procedures, and
    controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and
    terrorist financing. The statute and its regulations also
    provide for information sharing, subject to conditions, between
    federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as
    well as among financial institutions, for counter-terrorism
    purposes. Federal banking regulators are required, when
    reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger
    applications, to take into account the effectiveness of the
    anti-money laundering activities of the applicants.

Pursuant to Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, we, like
    all other financial institutions, are required to:

•

provide notice to our customers regarding privacy policies and
    practices,

•

inform our customers regarding the conditions under which their
    nonpublic personal information may be disclosed to nonaffiliated
    third parties, and

•

give our customers an option to prevent certain disclosure of
    such information to nonaffiliated third parties.

Under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, our
    customers may also opt-out of certain information sharing
    between and among us and our affiliates. We are also subject, in
    connection with our



lending and leasing activities, to numerous federal and state
    laws aimed at protecting consumers, including the Home Mortgage
    Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the
    Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, and the
    Fair Credit Reporting Act.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposed new or revised corporate
    governance, accounting, and reporting requirements on us and all
    other companies having securities registered with the SEC. In
    addition to a requirement that chief executive officers and
    chief financial officers certify financial statements in
    writing, the statute imposed requirements affecting, among other
    matters, the composition and activities of audit committees,
    disclosures relating to corporate insiders and insider
    transactions, code of ethics, and the effectiveness of internal
    controls over financial reporting.

In
    2010, we implemented compliance with the Amendment to
    Regulation E dealing with overdraft fees.

In November 2009, the Federal Reserve Board amended
    Regulation E of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to
    prohibit banks from charging overdraft fees for ATM or

point-of-sale

debit card transactions that overdrew the account unless the
    customer opt-in to the discretionary overdraft service and to
    require banks to explain the terms of their overdraft services
    and their fees for the services (Regulation E Amendment).
    Compliance with the Regulation E Amendment was required by
    July 1, 2010. Our strategy to comply with the
    Regulation E Amendment is to alert our customers that we
    can no longer cover such overdrafts unless they opt-in to our
    overdraft service while disclosing the terms of our service and
    our fees for the service.

Item 1A:

Risk
    Factors

Risk
    Governance

We use a multi-faceted approach to risk governance. It begins
    with the board of directors defining our risk appetite in
    aggregate as

moderate-to-low.

This does not preclude engagement in higher risk activities when
    we have the demonstrated expertise and control mechanisms to
    selectively manage higher risk. Rather, the definition is
    intended to represent a directional average of where we want our
    overall risk to be managed.

Two board committees oversee implementation of this desired risk
    profile: The Audit Committee and the Risk Oversight Committee.

•

The Audit Committee is principally involved with overseeing the
    integrity of financial statements, providing oversight of the
    internal audit department, and selecting our external auditors.
    Our chief auditor reports directly to the Audit Committee.

•

The Risk Oversight Committee supervises our risk management
    processes which primarily cover credit, market, liquidity,
    operational, and compliance risks. It also approves the charters
    of executive management committees, sets risk limits on certain
    risk measures (e.g., economic value of equity), receives results
    of the risk self-assessment process, and routinely engages
    management in dialogues pertaining to key risk issues. Our
    credit review executive reports directly to the Risk Oversight
    Committee.

Both committees are comprised of independent directors and
    routinely hold executive sessions with our key officers engaged
    in accounting and risk management.

On a periodic basis, the two committees meet in joint session to
    cover matters relevant to both such as the construct and
    adequacy of the ACL, which is reviewed quarterly.

We maintain a philosophy that each colleague is responsible for
    risk. This is manifested by the design of a risk management
    organization that places emphasis on risk-ownership by
    risk-takers. We believe that by placing ownership of risk within
    its related business segment, attention to, and accountability
    for, risk is heightened.

Further, through its Compensation Committee, the board of
    directors seeks to ensure its system of rewards is
    risk-sensitive and aligns the interests of management,
    creditors, and shareholders. We utilize a variety of
    compensation-related tools to induce appropriate behavior,
    including equity deferrals, holdbacks, clawback provisions, and
    the right to terminate compensation plans at any time when
    undesirable outcomes may result.



Management has introduced a number of steps to help ensure an
    aggregate

moderate-to-low

risk appetite is maintained. Foremost is a quarterly,
    comprehensive self-assessment process in which each business
    segment produces an analysis of its risks and the strength of
    its risk controls. The segment analyses are combined with
    assessments by our risk management organization of major risk
    sectors (e.g., credit, market, operational, reputational,
    compliance, etc.) to produce an overall enterprise risk
    assessment. Outcomes of the process include a determination of
    the quality of the overall control process, the direction of
    risk, and our position compared to the defined risk appetite.

Management also utilizes a wide series of metrics (key risk
    indicators) to monitor risk positions throughout the Company. In
    general, a range for each metric is established that identifies
    a

moderate-to-low

position. Deviations from the range will indicate if the risk
    being measured is moving into a high position, which may then
    necessitate corrective action.

In 2010, we enhanced our process of risk-based capital
    attribution. Our economic capital model will be upgraded and
    integrated into a more robust system of stress testing in 2011.
    We believe this tool will further enhance our ability to manage
    to the defined risk appetite. Our board level Capital
    Planning Committee will monitor and react to output from the
    integrated modeling process.

We also have three other executive level committees to manage
    risk: ALCO, Credit Policy and Strategy, and Risk Management.
    Each committee focuses on specific categories of risk and is
    supported by a series of subcommittees that are tactical in
    nature. We believe this structure helps ensure appropriate
    elevation of issues and overall communication of strategies.

Huntington utilizes three levels of defense with regard to risk
    management: (1) business segments, (2) corporate risk
    management, (3) internal audit and credit review. To induce
    greater ownership of risk within its business segments, segment
    risk officers have been embedded to identify and monitor risk,
    elevate and remediate issues, establish controls, perform
    self-testing, and oversee the quarterly self-assessment process.
    Segment risk officers report directly to the related segment
    manager with a dotted line to the Chief Risk Officer. Corporate
    Risk Management establishes policies, sets operating limits,
    reviews new or modified products/processes, ensures consistency
    and quality assurance within the segments, and produces the
    enterprise risk assessment. The Chief Risk Officer has
    significant input into the design and outcome of incentive
    compensation plans as they apply to risk. Internal Audit and
    Credit Review provide additional assurance that risk-related
    functions are operating as intended.

Huntington believes it has provided a sound risk governance
    foundation to support the Bank. Our process will be subject to
    continuous improvement and enhancement. Our objective is to have
    strong risk management practices and capabilities.

Risk
    Overview

We, like other financial companies, are subject to a number of
    risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or
    results of operation, many of which are outside of our direct
    control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while
    optimizing returns. Among the risks assumed are: (1)

credit
    risk

, which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease
    customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their
    financial obligations under agreed upon terms, (2)

market
    risk

, which is the risk of loss due to changes in the market
    value of assets and liabilities due to changes in market
    interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and
    credit spreads, (3)

liquidity risk

, which is the risk of
    loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to
    satisfy current or future commitments based on external macro
    market issues, investor and customer perception of financial
    strength, and events unrelated to us such as war, terrorism, or
    financial institution market specific issues, (4)

operational
    risk

, which is the risk of loss due to human error,
    inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, violations
    of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed
    practices, or ethical standards, and external influences such as
    market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, and
    security risks, and (5)

compliance risk

, which exposes us
    to money penalties, enforcement actions or other sanctions as a
    result of nonconformance with laws, rules, and regulations that
    apply to the financial services industry.



We also expend considerable effort to contain risk which
    emanates from execution of our business strategies and work
    relentlessly to protect the Company’s reputation. Strategic
    and reputational risks do not easily lend themselves to
    traditional methods of measurement. Rather, we closely monitor
    them through processes such as new
    product / initiative reviews, frequent financial
    performance reviews, employee and client surveys, monitoring
    market intelligence, periodic discussions between management and
    our board, and other such efforts.

In addition to the other information included or incorporated by
    reference into this report, readers should carefully consider
    that the following important factors, among others, could
    negatively impact our business, future results of operations,
    and future cash flows materially.

Credit
    Risks

:

1.

Our ACL
    may prove inadequate or be negatively affected by credit risk
    exposures which could materially adversely affect our net income
    and capital.

Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers.
    Our ACL of $1.3 billion at December 31, 2010,
    represents Management’s estimate of probable losses
    inherent in our loan and lease portfolio as well as our unfunded
    loan commitments and letters of credit. We periodically review
    our ACL for adequacy. In doing so, we consider economic
    conditions and trends, collateral values, and credit quality
    indicators, such as past charge-off experience, levels of past
    due loans, and nonperforming assets. There is no certainty that
    our ACL will be adequate over time to cover losses in the
    portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the
    economy, market conditions, or events adversely affecting
    specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit
    quality of our customer base materially decreases, if the risk
    profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes
    materially, or if the ACL is not adequate, our net income and
    capital could be materially adversely affected which, in turn,
    could have a material negative adverse affect on our financial
    condition and results of operations.

In addition, bank regulators periodically review our ACL and may
    require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses
    or loan charge-offs. Any increase in our ACL or loan charge-offs
    as required by these regulatory authorities could have a
    material adverse affect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

2.

A
    sustained weakness or further weakening in economic conditions
    could materially adversely affect our business.

Our performance could be negatively affected to the extent that
    further weaknesses in business and economic conditions have
    direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us, our
    customers, and our counterparties. These conditions could result
    in one or more of the following:

•

A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and
    services offered by us;

•

A decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for
    savings and investment products offered by us; and

•

An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who
    become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws, or
    default on their loans or other obligations to us.

An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies, or
    defaults could result in a higher level of NPAs, NCOs, provision
    for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for
    sale. The markets we serve are dependent on industrial and
    manufacturing businesses and thus are particularly vulnerable to
    adverse changes in economic conditions affecting these sectors.

3.

Further
    declines in home values or reduced levels of home sales in our
    markets could result in higher delinquencies, greater
    charge-offs, and increased losses on the sale of foreclosed real
    estate in future periods.

Like all financial institutions, we are subject to the effects
    of any economic downturn. There has been a slowdown in the
    housing market across our geographic footprint, reflecting
    declining prices and excess



inventories of houses to be sold. These developments have had,
    and further declines may continue to have, a negative effect on
    our financial conditions and results of operations. At
    December 31, 2010, we had:

•

$7.7 billion of home equity loans and lines, representing
    20% of total loans and leases.

•

$4.5 billion in residential real estate loans, representing
    12% of total loans and leases.

•

$4.7 billion of Federal Agency mortgage-backed securities,
    $0.1 billion of private label CMOs, and $0.1 billion
    of Alt-A mortgage-backed securities that could be negatively
    affected by a decline in home values.

•

$0.3 billion of bank owned life insurance investments
    primarily in mortgage-backed securities.

Because of the decline in home values, some of our borrowers
    have mortgages greater than the value of their homes. The
    decline in home values, coupled with the weakened economy, has
    increased short sales and foreclosures. The reduced levels of
    home sales have had a materially adverse affect on the prices
    achieved on the sale of foreclosed properties. Continued decline
    in home values may escalate these problems resulting in higher
    delinquencies, greater charge-offs, and increased losses on the
    sale of foreclosed real estate in future periods.

Market
    Risks

:

1.

Changes
    in interest rates could reduce our net interest income, reduce
    transactional income, and negatively impact the value of our
    loans, securities, and other assets. This could have a material
    adverse impact on our cash flows, financial condition, results
    of operations, and capital.

Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest
    income, which is the difference between interest earned on
    interest earning assets (such as investments and loans) and
    interest paid on interest bearing liabilities (such as deposits
    and borrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many
    factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic
    and international economic and political conditions. Conditions
    such as inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money
    supply, and other factors beyond our control may also affect
    interest rates. If our interest earning assets mature or reprice
    more quickly than interest bearing liabilities in a declining
    interest rate environment, net interest income could be
    materially adversely impacted. Likewise, if interest bearing
    liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning
    assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest
    income could be adversely impacted.

At December 31, 2010, $2.6 billion, or 13%, of our
    commercial loan portfolio, as measured by the aggregate
    outstanding principal balances, was fixed-rate loans and the
    remainder was adjustable-rate loans. As interest rates rise, the
    payment by the borrower rises to the extent permitted by the
    terms of the loan, and the increased payment increases the
    potential for default. At the same time, the marketability of
    the underlying property may be adversely affected by higher
    interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, there
    may be an increase in prepayments on the loans underlying our
    participation interests as borrowers refinance their mortgages
    at lower interest rates.

Changes in interest rates also can affect the value of loans,
    securities, and other assets, including mortgage and nonmortgage
    servicing rights and assets under management. Examples of
    transactional income include trust income, brokerage income, and
    gain on sales of loans. This type of income can vary
    significantly from

quarter-to-quarter

and

year-to-year

based on a number of different factors, including the interest
    rate environment. An increase in interest rates that adversely
    affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or
    interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in NPAs and
    a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. When
    we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but
    unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income.
    Subsequently, we continue to have a cost to fund the loan, which
    is reflected as interest expense, without any interest income to
    offset the associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the
    amount of NPAs would have an adverse impact on net interest
    income.

Rising interest rates will result in a decline in value of our
    fixed-rate debt securities and cash flow hedging derivatives
    portfolio. The unrealized losses resulting from holding these
    securities and financial



instruments would be recognized in OCI and reduce total
    shareholders’ equity. Unrealized losses do not negatively
    impact our regulatory capital ratios; however Tangible Common
    Equity and the associated ratios would be reduced. If debt
    securities in an unrealized loss position are sold, such losses
    become realized and will reduce Tier I and Total Risk-based
    Capital regulatory ratios. If cash flow hedging derivatives are
    terminated, the impact is reflected in earnings over the life of
    the instrument and reduces Tier I and Total Risk-based
    Capital regulatory ratios. Somewhat offsetting these negative
    impacts to OCI in a rising interest rate environment, is a
    decrease in pension and other post-retirement obligations.

If short-term interest rates remain at their historically low
    levels for a prolonged period, and assuming longer term interest
    rates fall further, we could experience net interest margin
    compression as our interest earning assets would continue to
    reprice downward while our interest bearing liability rates
    could fail to decline in tandem. This would have a material
    adverse effect on our net interest income and our results of
    operations.

2.

The value
    of our Alt-A mortgage-backed, Pooled-Trust-Preferred and Private
    Label CMO investment securities are volatile and future
    valuation declines or

other-than-temporary

impairments could have a materially adverse affect on our future
    earnings and regulatory capital.

Continued volatility in the market value for these securities in
    our investment securities portfolio, whether caused by changes
    in market perceptions of credit risk, as reflected in the
    expected market yield of the security, or actual defaults in the
    portfolio, could result in significant fluctuations in the value
    of these securities. This could have a material adverse impact
    on our accumulated OCI and shareholders’ equity depending
    on the direction of the fluctuations. Furthermore, future
    downgrades or defaults in these securities could result in
    future classifications as

other-than-temporarily

impaired and limit our ability to sell these securities at
    reasonable prices. This could have a material negative impact on
    our future earnings, although the impact on shareholders’
    equity would be offset by any amount already included in OCI for
    securities where we have recorded temporary impairment. At
    December 31, 2010, the fair value of these securities was
    $284.6 million.

3.

An
    issuance of additional capital would have a dilutive effect on
    the existing holders of our common stock and adversely affect
    the market price of our common stock.

We and the Bank are highly regulated, and we, as well as our
    regulators, continue to regularly perform a variety of capital
    analyses, including the preparation of stress case scenarios. As
    a result of those assessments, we could determine, or our
    regulators could require us, to raise additional capital in the
    future. Any such capital raise could include, among other
    things, the potential issuance of additional common equity to
    the public, or the additional conversions of our existing
    Series A Preferred Stock to common equity. There could also
    be market perceptions that we need to raise additional capital,
    and regardless of the outcome of any stress test or other stress
    case analysis, such perceptions could have an adverse effect on
    the price of our common stock.

Furthermore, in order to improve our capital ratios above our
    already Well-capitalized levels, we can decrease the amount of
    our risk-weighted assets, increase capital, or a combination of
    both. If it is determined that additional capital is required in
    order to improve or maintain our capital ratios, we may
    accomplish this through the issuance of additional common stock.

The issuance of any additional shares of common stock or
    securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or
    that represent the right to receive common stock, or the
    exercise of such securities, could be substantially dilutive to
    existing common shareholders. Shareholders of our common stock
    have no preemptive rights that entitle them to purchase their
    pro-rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series
    and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in
    increased dilution to existing shareholders. The market price of
    our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of
    our common stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable
    for, common stock in anticipation of such sales.



Liquidity
    Risks

:

1.

If we are
    unable to borrow funds through access to capital markets, we may
    not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our
    depositors, creditors, and borrowers, or have the operating cash
    needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate
    activities.

Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely
    basis at a reasonable cost. The liquidity of the Bank is used to
    make loans and leases and to repay deposit liabilities as they
    become due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and
    limits are established by our board of directors, with operating
    limits set by Management. Wholesale funding sources include
    federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase
    agreements, noncore deposits, and medium- and long-term debt,
    which includes a domestic bank note program and a Euronote
    program. The Bank is also a member of the FHLB, which provides
    funding through advances to members that are collateralized with
    mortgage-related assets.

We maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a
    secondary source of liquidity. There are other sources of
    liquidity available to us should they be needed. These sources
    include the sale or securitization of loans, the ability to
    acquire additional national market noncore deposits, issuance of
    additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances, the
    issuance of debt securities, and the issuance of preferred or
    common securities in public or private transactions. The Bank
    also can borrow from the Federal Reserve’s discount window.

Starting in the middle of 2007, significant turmoil and
    volatility in worldwide financial markets increased, though
    current volatility has declined. Such disruptions in the
    liquidity of financial markets directly impact us to the extent
    we need to access capital markets to raise funds to support our
    business and overall liquidity position. This situation could
    affect the cost of such funds or our ability to raise such
    funds. If we were unable to access any of these funding sources
    when needed, we might be unable to meet customers’ needs,
    which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of
    operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying
    capital. We may, from time to time, consider opportunistically
    retiring our outstanding securities in privately negotiated or
    open market transactions for cash or common shares. This could
    adversely affect our liquidity position.

2.

Due to
    the losses that the Bank incurred in 2008 and 2009, at
    December 31, 2010, the Bank and its subsidiaries could not
    declare and pay dividends to the holding company, any subsidiary
    of the holding company outside the Bank’s consolidated
    group, or any security holder outside the Bank’s
    consolidated group, without regulatory approval.

Dividends from the Bank to the parent company are the primary
    source of funds for the payment of dividends to our
    shareholders. Under applicable statutes and regulations, a
    national bank may not declare and pay dividends in any year in
    excess of an amount equal to the sum of the total of the net
    income of the bank for that year and the retained net income of
    the bank for the preceding two years, minus the sum of any
    transfers required by the OCC and any transfers required to be
    made to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock, unless
    the OCC approves the declaration and payment of dividends in
    excess of such amount. Due to the losses that the Bank incurred
    in 2008 and 2009, at December 31, 2010, the Bank and its
    subsidiaries could not declare and pay dividends to the parent
    company, any subsidiary of the parent company outside the
    Bank’s consolidated group, or any security holder outside
    the Bank’s consolidated group, without regulatory approval.
    Since the first quarter of 2008, the Bank has requested and
    received OCC approval each quarter to pay periodic dividends to
    shareholders outside the Bank’s consolidated group on the
    preferred and common stock of its REIT and capital financing
    subsidiaries to the extent necessary to maintain their REIT
    status. A wholly-owned nonbank subsidiary of the parent company
    owns a portion of the preferred shares of the REIT and capital
    financing subsidiaries. Outside of the REIT and capital
    financing subsidiary dividends, we do not anticipate that the
    Bank will declare dividends during 2011.



Operational
    Risks

:

1.

The
    resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable,
    could have a material adverse affect on our results of
    operations for a particular period.

We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims
    and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and
    regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain
    high. Substantial legal liability against us could have material
    adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm
    to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business
    prospects. As more fully described in Note 22 of the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain putative class
    actions and shareholder derivative actions were filed against
    us, certain affiliated committees,

and/or

certain of our current or former officers and directors. These
    cases allege violations of the securities laws, breaches of
    fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, abuse of control,
    gross mismanagement, unjust enrichment, and violations of
    Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) laws in
    connection with our acquisition of Sky Financial, the
    transactions between Franklin and us, and the financial and
    other disclosures related to these transactions. Although no
    assurance can be given, based on information currently
    available, consultation with counsel, and available insurance
    coverage, we believe that the eventual outcome of these claims
    against us will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
    or results of operations. However, it is possible that the
    ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be
    material to the results of operations for a particular reporting
    period.

2.

We face
    significant operational risks which could lead to expensive
    litigation and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators,
    and capital markets.

We are exposed to many types of operational risks, including
    reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud
    or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by
    employees or outsiders, or operational errors by employees,
    including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting
    from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems.
    In addition, today’s threats to customer information and
    information systems are complex, more wide spread, continually
    emerging, and increasing at a rapid pace. Although we establish
    and maintain systems of internal operational controls that
    provide us with timely and accurate information about our level
    of operational risks, continue to invest in better tools and
    processes in all key areas, and monitor threats with increased
    rigor and focus, these operational risks could lead to expensive
    litigation and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators,
    and the capital markets.

Moreover, negative public opinion can result from our actual or
    alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending
    practices, corporate governance, and acquisitions and from
    actions taken by government regulators and community
    organizations in response to those activities. Negative public
    opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain
    customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory
    action. Relative to acquisitions, we cannot predict if, or when,
    we will be able to identify and attract acquisition candidates
    or make acquisitions on favorable terms. We incur risks and
    challenges associated with the integration of acquired
    institutions in a timely and efficient manner, and we cannot
    guarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing
    customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating
    efficiencies.

3.

We are
    subject to routine on-going tax examinations by the IRS and by
    various other jurisdictions, including the states of Ohio,
    Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and
    Illinois. The IRS, Ohio, and Kentucky have proposed various
    adjustments to our previously filed tax returns. It is possible
    that the ultimate resolution of all proposed and future
    adjustments, if unfavorable, may be materially adverse to the
    results of operations in the period it occurs.

The calculation of our provision for federal income taxes is
    complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments. In the
    ordinary course of business, we operate in various taxing
    jurisdictions and are subject to income and nonincome taxes. The
    effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretation of the
    relevant current tax laws. We believe the aggregate liabilities
    related to taxes are appropriately reflected in the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.



From

time-to-time,

we engage in business transactions that may have an effect on
    our tax liabilities. Where appropriate, we have obtained
    opinions of outside experts and have assessed the relative
    merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of business
    transactions taking into account statutory, judicial, and
    regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position.

We file income tax returns with the IRS and various state, city,
    and foreign jurisdictions. Federal income tax audits have been
    completed through 2007. In addition, various state and other
    jurisdictions remain open to examination, including Ohio,
    Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and
    Illinois.

The IRS and other taxing jurisdictions, including the states of
    Ohio and Kentucky, have proposed adjustments to our previously
    filed tax returns. We do not agree with these adjustments and
    believe that the tax positions taken by us related to such
    proposed adjustments were correct and supported by applicable
    statutes, regulations, and judicial authority, and we intend to
    vigorously defend our positions. Appropriate tax reserves have
    been established in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes and
    ASC 450, Contingencies. However, it is also possible that
    the ultimate resolution of the proposed adjustments, if
    unfavorable, may result in penalties and interest. Such
    adjustments, including any penalties and interest, may be
    material to our results of operations in the period such
    adjustments occur and increase our effective tax rate.
    Nevertheless, although no assurances can be given, we believe
    that the resolution of these examinations will not, individually
    or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position in future periods. For further
    discussion, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

The Franklin restructuring in the 2009 first quarter resulted in
    a $159.9 million net deferred tax asset equal to the amount
    of income and equity that was included in our operating results
    for the 2009 first quarter. During the 2010 first quarter, a
    $38.2 million net tax benefit was recognized, primarily
    reflecting the increase in the net deferred tax asset relating
    to the assets acquired from the March 31, 2009 Franklin
    restructuring. In the 2010 fourth quarter, we entered into an
    asset monetization transaction that generated a tax benefit of
    $63.6 million. While we believe that our positions
    regarding the deferred tax asset and related income recognition
    is correct, the positions could be subject to challenge.

4.

Failure
    to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting
    in the future could impair our ability to accurately and timely
    report our financial results or prevent fraud, resulting in loss
    of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and
    stock price.

Effective internal controls over financial reporting are
    necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent
    fraud. As a financial holding company, we are subject to
    regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and
    procedures. Management continually seeks to improve these
    controls and procedures.

We believe that our key internal controls over financial
    reporting are currently effective; however, such controls and
    procedures will be modified, supplemented, and changed from

time-to-time

as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events
    and developments. While we will continue to assess our controls
    and procedures and take immediate action to remediate any future
    perceived gaps, there can be no guarantee of the effectiveness
    of these controls and procedures on an on-going basis. Any
    failure to maintain, in the future, an effective internal
    control environment could impact our ability to report our
    financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could
    result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and
    adversely impact our business and stock price.

Compliance
    Risks

:

1.

If our
    regulators deem it appropriate, they can take regulatory actions
    that could materially adversely impact our ability to compete
    for new business, constrain our ability to fund our liquidity
    needs or pay dividends, and increase the cost of our
    services.

We are subject to the supervision and regulation of various
    state and Federal regulators, including the OCC, Federal
    Reserve, FDIC, SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and
    various state regulatory agencies. As such, we are subject to a
    wide variety of laws and regulations, many of which are
    discussed in the Regulatory Matters section. As part of their
    supervisory process, which includes periodic examinations and



continuous monitoring, the regulators have the authority to
    impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the
    manner in which we manage the organization. These actions could
    impact the organization in a variety of ways, including
    subjecting us to monetary fines, restricting our ability to pay
    dividends, precluding mergers or acquisitions, limiting our
    ability to offer certain products or services, or imposing
    additional capital requirements.

2.

Legislative
    and regulatory actions taken now or in the future to address the
    current liquidity and credit crisis in the financial industry
    may materially adversely affect us by increasing our costs,
    adding complexity in doing business, impeding the efficiency of
    our internal business processes, negatively impacting the
    recoverability of certain of our recorded assets, requiring us
    to increase our regulatory capital, limiting our ability to
    pursue business opportunities, and otherwise materially
    adversely impacting our financial condition, results of
    operation, liquidity, or stock price.

Current economic conditions, particularly in the financial
    markets, have resulted in government regulatory agencies and
    political bodies placing increased focus on and scrutiny of the
    financial services industry. The U.S. Government has
    intervened on an unprecedented scale, responding to what has
    been commonly referred to as the financial crisis. In addition
    to the previously enacted governmental assistance programs
    designed to stabilize and stimulate the U.S. economy,
    recent economic, political, and market conditions have led to
    numerous programs and proposals to reform the financial
    regulatory system and prevent future crises.

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law.
    The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the
    financial services industry within the United States,
    establishes the new federal CFPB, and requires the bureau and
    other federal agencies to implement many new and significant
    rules and regulations. At this time, it is difficult to predict
    the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act or the resulting rules
    and regulations will impact our business. Compliance with these
    new laws and regulations may result in additional costs, which
    could be significant, and may have a material and adverse effect
    on our results of operations.

In addition, international banking industry regulators have
    largely agreed upon significant changes in the regulation of
    capital required to be held by banks and their holding companies
    to support their businesses. The new international rules, known
    as Basel III, generally increase the capital required to be held
    and narrow the types of instruments which will qualify as
    providing appropriate capital and impose a new liquidity
    measurement. The Basel III requirements are complex and
    will be phased in over many years.

The Basel III rules do not apply to U.S. banks or
    holding companies automatically. Among other things, the
    Dodd-Frank Act requires U.S. regulators to reform the
    system under which the safety and soundness of banks and other
    financial institutions, individually and systemically, are
    regulated. That reform effort will include the regulation of
    capital and liquidity. It is not known whether or to what extent
    the U.S. regulators will incorporate elements of
    Basel III into the reformed U.S. regulatory system,
    but it is expected that the U.S. reforms will include an
    increase in capital requirements, a narrowing of what qualifies
    as appropriate capital, and impose a new liquidity measurement.
    One likely effect of a significant tightening of
    U.S. capital requirements would be to increase our cost of
    capital, among other things. Any permanent significant increase
    in our cost of capital could have significant adverse impacts on
    the profitability of many of our products, the types of products
    we could offer profitably, our overall profitability, and our
    overall growth opportunities, among other things. Although most
    financial institutions would be affected, these business impacts
    could be felt unevenly, depending upon the business and product
    mix of each institution. Other potential effects could include
    less ability to pay cash dividends and repurchase our common
    shares, higher dilution of common shareholders, and a higher
    risk that we might fall below regulatory capital thresholds in
    an adverse economic cycle.

In 1998, we entered into a sale/leaseback agreement that
    included the sale of 59 of our locations. The transaction
    included a mix of branch banking offices, regional offices, and
    operational facilities, including certain properties described
    above, which we will continue to operate under a long-term lease.

    and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

The common stock of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated is traded
    on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol “HBAN”.
    The stock is listed as “HuntgBcshr” or
    “HuntBanc” in most newspapers. As of January 31,
    2011, we had 38,676 shareholders of record.

Information regarding the high and low sale prices of our common
    stock and cash dividends declared on such shares, as required by
    this item, is set forth in Table 58 entitled Selected Quarterly
    Income Statement Data and incorporated into this Item by
    reference. Information regarding restrictions on dividends, as
    required by this item, is set forth in Item 1
    Business-Regulatory Matters and in Note 23 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements and incorporated into this
    Item by reference.

As a condition to participate in the TARP, Huntington could not
    repurchase any additional shares without prior approval from the
    Treasury. On February 18, 2009, the board of directors
    terminated the previously authorized program for the repurchase
    of up to 15 million shares of common stock (the 2006
    Repurchase Program). Huntington did not repurchase any common
    shares for the year ended December 31, 2010.



The line graph below compares the yearly percentage change in
    cumulative total shareholder return on Huntington common stock
    and the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 Index and
    the KBW Bank Index for the period December 31, 2005,
    through December 31, 2010. The KBW Bank Index is a market
    capitalization-weighted bank stock index published by Keefe,
    Bruyette & Woods. The index is composed of the largest
    banking companies and includes all money center banks and

EXECUTIVE
    OVERVIEW

    Financial Performance Review

In 2010, we reported net income of $312.3 million, or $0.19
    per common share (

see Table 1

). The current year included
    a nonrecurring reduction of $0.08 per common share for the
    deemed dividend resulting from the repurchase of
    $1.4 billion in TARP Capital. This compared with a net loss
    of $3,094.2 million, or $6.14 per common share, for 2009.

The 2009 loss primarily reflected two items:
    $2,606.9 million in noncash goodwill impairment charges and
    $2,074.7 million in provision for credit losses. Most of
    the $2,606.9 million in goodwill impairment charges related
    to the acquisitions of Sky Financial and Unizan. While this
    impairment charge reduced reported net income, equity, and total
    assets, it had no impact on key regulatory capital ratios. As a
    noncash charge, it had no affect on our liquidity. The provision
    for credit losses reflected higher net charge-offs as we
    addressed issues in our loan portfolio. We also strengthened our
    allowance for credit losses because of higher levels of
    nonperforming assets.

Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income was
    $1.6 billion in 2010, up $0.2 billion, or 14%, from
    2009. The increase primarily reflected the favorable impact of
    the increase in net interest margin to 3.44% from 3.11% and, to
    a lesser degree, a 3% increase in average total earning assets.
    A significant portion of the increase in the net interest margin
    reflected a shift in our deposit mix from higher-cost time
    deposits to lower-cost transaction-based accounts. Additionally,
    we grew our average core deposits $3.1 billion, or 9%, from
    2009. Although average total earning assets increased only
    slightly compared with 2009, this change reflected a
    $2.9 billion, or 45%, increase in average total investment
    securities, partially offset by a $1.4 billion, or 4%,
    decline in average total loans and leases. The change in average
    loan balances from the prior year reflected our strategy to
    reduce our CRE exposure as average CRE loans declined
    $1.9 billion, or 21%, from 2009. Average C&I loans
    declined $0.7 billion, or 5%, for the full year. Average
    automobile loans and leases increased $1.3 billion, or 38%,
    from 2009, reflecting the consolidation of a $0.8 billion
    automobile loan securitization on January 1, 2010. These
    changes in loan and investment securities balances from the
    prior year reflected the execution of our balance sheet
    management strategy, and not a change in standards for making
    loans or for investing in securities.

Noninterest income was $1.0 billion in 2010, a slight
    increase compared with 2009. The increase in noninterest income
    was primarily a result of an increase in mortgage banking
    income, reflecting an increase in origination and secondary
    marketing income as loan originations and loan sales were
    substantially higher, and MSR hedging. This was partially offset
    by a decline in service charges on deposit accounts, which was
    due to a decline in personal NSF / OD service charges.
    The decline reflected our implementation of changes to
    Regulation E and the introduction of our Fair Play banking
    philosophy. As part of this philosophy, we voluntarily reduced
    certain NSF / OD fees and implemented our

24-Hour

Grace

tm

overdraft policy. The goal of our Fair Play banking philosophy
    is to introduce more customer-friendly fee structures with the
    objective of accelerating the acquisition and retention of
    customers.

Noninterest expense was $1.7 billion in 2010, a decrease of
    $2.4 billion, or 59%, compared with 2009. The decrease in
    noninterest expense was primarily due to goodwill impairment in
    the year-ago period. The decline also reflected a decrease in
    OREO and foreclosure expense from lower OREO losses. Further,
    there was a decline in deposit and other insurance expense,
    primarily due to a $23.6 million FDIC insurance special
    assessment in 2009, partially offset by continued growth in
    total deposits and higher FDIC insurance costs in the current
    period as premium rates increased. The decline was partially
    offset by a 2009 benefit from a gain on the early extinguishment
    of debt, and 2010 increases in personnel costs, reflecting a
    combination of factors



including higher salaries due to a 10% increase in full-time
    equivalent staff in support of strategic initiatives, higher
    sales commissions, and retirement fund and 401(k) plan expenses.

Credit quality performance continued to show strong improvement
    as our NPAs and NCOs declined and reserve coverage increased.
    This improvement reflected the benefits of our focused actions
    taken in 2009 to address credit-related issues. Compared with
    the prior year, NPAs declined 59%. NCOs were
    $874.5 million, or an annualized 2.35% of average total
    loans and leases, down from $1,476.6 million, or 3.82%, in
    2009. While the ACL as a percentage of loans and leases was
    3.39%, down from 4.16% at December 31, 2009, the ACL as a
    percentage of total NALs increased to 166% from 80%.

In December 2010, we successfully completed multiple capital
    actions, particularly improving our then relatively low level of
    common equity. We sold $920.0 million of common stock in a
    public offering and issued $300.0 million of subordinated
    debt. On December 22, 2010, these proceeds, along with
    other available funds, were used to complete the repurchase of
    our $1.4 billion of TARP Capital we issued to the Treasury
    under its TARP CPP. Subsequently, on January 19, 2011, we
    exited our TARP-related relationship with the Treasury by
    repurchasing the warrant we had issued to the Treasury as part
    of the TARP CPP for $49.1 million. The warrant had entitled
    the Treasury to purchase 23.6 million common shares of
    stock.

At December 31, 2010, our regulatory Tier 1 and Total
    risk-based capital were $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion,
    respectively, above the Well-capitalized regulatory thresholds.
    Our tangible common equity ratio improved 164 basis points
    to 7.56% and our Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio
    improved 253 basis points to 9.29% from December 31,
    2009.

Business
    Overview

General

Our general business objectives are: (1) grow revenue and
    profitability, (2) grow key fee businesses (existing and
    new), (3) improve credit quality, including lower NCOs and
    NPAs, (4) improve cross-sell and

share-of-wallet

across all business segments, (5) reduce CRE noncore
    exposure, and (6) continue to improve our overall
    management of risk.

As further described below, our main challenge to accomplishing
    our primary objectives results from an economy, that while more
    stable than a year ago, remains fragile. This impairs our
    ability to grow loans as customers continue to reduce their debt
    and / or remain cautious about increasing debt until
    they have a higher degree of confidence in a meaningful
    sustainable economic recovery. However, growth in our automobile
    loan portfolio continued with 2010 originations of
    $3.4 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion compared to
    2009. Strong growth in originations reflected increases in all
    of our markets, as well as the recent expansion of our
    automobile lending business into Eastern Pennsylvania and five
    New England states. We expect our growth in the newly entered
    markets to become more evident over time as we further develop
    our dealership base. Although our residential real estate
    portfolio declined slightly from 2009, our mortgage originations
    increased $214 million, or 4%, from the prior year. Our CRE
    portfolio declined throughout the year as a result of our
    on-going strategy to reduce our CRE exposure. The decline was
    primarily a result of continuing paydowns in the noncore CRE
    portfolio.

We face strong competition from other banks and financial
    service firms in our markets. As such, we have placed strategic
    emphasis on, and continue to develop and expand resources
    devoted to, improving cross-sell performance with our core
    customer base. One example of this emphasis was our recent
    agreement with Giant Eagle supermarkets to be its exclusive
    in-store bank in Ohio. During the 2010 fourth quarter, we opened
    four such in-store branches. When fully implemented, the
    partnership will give us an additional 100 branches, which in
    the aggregate will be nearly 500 branches in Ohio, providing us
    with the largest branch presence among Ohio banks, based on
    current data. In-store branches have a strong record for
    checking account acquisition and are expected to increase the
    number of households served and drive revenue. Additionally, it
    will give customers the convenience of operating seven days per
    week and extended hours banking.



Economy

The weak residential real estate market and U.S. economy
    has had a significant adverse impact on the financial services
    industry as a whole, and specifically on our financial results.
    In addition, the U.S. recession during 2008 and 2009 and
    continued high Midwest unemployment have hindered any
    significant economic recovery. However, some indications of
    recovery are beginning to take hold. Following is a discussion
    of certain economic trends in our market area, particularly Ohio
    and Michigan.

The median home prices in the Midwest market have been
    directionally consistent with the nationwide averages. In the
    years preceding the economic crisis, home prices in Michigan and
    Ohio did not increase as rapidly as the national trend and
    became more in line with the national averages during the
    crisis. Therefore, when real estate prices began to decline in
    2008, the impact in our Midwest markets was reduced because
    pre-crisis originations were not based on values that were as
    inflated as in other parts of the country. Home prices in the
    Midwest are generally expected to follow the national growth
    rates over the next two years. Residential real estate sales in
    the Midwest have been consistent with national averages. Single
    family home building permits are expected to increase both
    nationally and in the Midwest through 2013.

Year-over-year

changes in median household income in the Midwest have been
    consistent with national averages and directionally similar with
    national trends. Both the U.S. and Midwest are expected to
    have slight, but positive, income growth over the next two
    years. Unemployment in the Midwest has been consistently higher
    than the national average for most of the past decade. However,
    the relative difference is expected to narrow over the next two
    years, with the Midwest unemployment rate converging to the
    U.S. average. The exception is Michigan, which has the
    second highest unemployment level in the country. From October
    2009 through October 2010, Indiana’s employment growth of
    1.1% was among the strongest in the country. Over this same time
    period, Ohio’s manufacturing employment grew 1.4%, which
    was significantly higher than the 0.8% national average.
    Cleveland’s overall employment growth of 1.0% exceeded the
    national growth rate of 0.6%.

According to the FRB-Cleveland Beige Book in December 2010,
    manufacturers in our footprint indicated that new orders and
    production were stable or rose slightly during the last two
    months of 2010. Inventory levels were balanced with incoming
    order demand and capacity utilization trending up for some
    manufacturers and steel producers. Overall, manufacturers were
    cautiously optimistic and expect at least modest growth during
    2011.

Partially resulting from these economic conditions in our
    footprint, we experienced higher than historical levels of loan
    delinquencies and NCOs during 2009 and 2010. The pronounced
    downturn in the residential real estate market that began in
    early 2007 resulted in lower residential real estate values and
    higher delinquencies and NCOs, not only in consumer mortgage
    loans but also in commercial loans to builders and developers of
    residential real estate. The value of our investment securities
    backed by residential and commercial real estate was also
    negatively impacted by a lack of liquidity in the financial
    markets and anticipated credit losses. Commercial real estate
    loans for retail businesses were also challenged by the
    difficult consumer economic conditions over this period.
    However, as further discussed in the

Credit Risk

section,
    we experienced significant improvement in credit performance
    during 2010.

Legislative
    and Regulatory

Legislative and regulatory reforms continue to be adopted which
    impose additional restrictions on current business practices.
    Recent actions affecting us included an amendment to
    Regulation E relating to certain overdraft fees for
    consumer deposit accounts and the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act.

Effective July 1, 2010, the Federal Reserve Board amended
    Regulation E to prohibit charging overdraft fees for ATM or

point-of-sale

debit card transactions that overdraw the customer’s
    account unless the customer opts-in to the discretionary
    overdraft service. For us, such fees were approximately
    $90 million per year prior to the amendment. This change in
    Regulation E requires us to alert our consumer customers we
    can no longer allow an overdraft unless they opt-in to our
    discretionary overdraft service. To date, the number of
    customers choosing to opt-in has been higher than our
    expectations. Also, during the second half of 2010, we
    voluntarily



reduced certain overdraft fees and introduced

24-Hour

on overdrafts as part of our Fair Play banking philosophy
    designed to build on our foundation of service excellence. We
    expect our

service to accelerate acquisition of new checking customers,
    while improving retention of existing customers.

The recently passed Dodd-Frank Act is complex and we continue to
    assess how this legislation and subsequent rule-making will
    affect us. As hundreds of regulations are promulgated, we will
    continue to evaluate impacts such as changes in regulatory costs
    and fees, modifications to consumer products or disclosures
    required by the CFPB, and the requirements of the enhanced
    supervision provisions, among others. Two areas where we are
    focusing on the financial impact are: interchange fees and the
    exclusion of trust-preferred securities from our Tier I
    regulatory capital.

Currently, interchange fees are approximately $90 million
    per year. In the future, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the Federal
    Reserve, and no longer the banks or system owners, the ability
    to set the interchange rate charged to merchants for the use of
    debit cards. The ultimate impact to us will depend on rules yet
    to be issued by the Federal Reserve. Proposed rules were issued
    on December 28, 2010, and the Dodd-Frank Act requires final
    interchange rules to be issued by April 21, 2011, and
    effective no later than July 21, 2011. Based on the Federal
    Reserve’s proposed rules, a maximum interchange rate of
    $0.07 would reduce our annual interchange fees by approximately
    85%. A maximum interchange rate of $0.12 would reduce our annual
    interchange fees by approximately 75%.

At December 31, 2010, we had $569.9 million of
    outstanding trust-preferred securities that, if disallowed,
    would reduce our regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio
    by approximately 130 basis points. Even with this
    reduction, our capital ratios would remain above
    Well-capitalized levels. There is a three year phase-in period
    beginning on January 1, 2013, that we believe will provide
    sufficient time to evaluate and address the impacts of this new
    legislation on our capital structure. Accordingly, we do not
    anticipate this potential change will have a significant impact
    to our business.

During the 2010 third quarter, the Basel Committee on Banking
    Supervision revised the Capital Accord (Basel III), which
    narrows the definition of capital and increases capital
    requirements for specific exposures. The new capital
    requirements will be phased-in over six years beginning in 2013.
    If these revisions were adopted currently, we estimate they
    would have a negligible impact on our regulatory capital ratios
    based on our current understanding of the revisions to capital
    qualification. We await clarification from our banking
    regulators on their interpretation of Basel III and any
    additional requirements to the stated thresholds. The FDIC has
    approved issuance of an interagency proposed rulemaking to
    implement certain provisions of Section 171 of the
    Dodd-Frank Act (Section 171). Section 171 provides
    that the capital requirements generally applicable to insured
    banks shall serve as a floor for other capital requirements the
    agencies establish. The FDIC noted that the advanced approaches
    of Basel III allow for reductions in risk-based capital
    requirements below those generally applicable to insured banks
    and, accordingly, need to be modified to be consistent with
    Section 171.

Recent
    Industry Developments

Foreclosure Documentation

— We evaluated our
    foreclosure documentation procedures given the recent
    announcements made by other financial institutions regarding
    problems associated with their foreclosure activities. As a
    result of our review, we have determined that we do not have any
    significant issues relating to so-called
    “robo-signing,” foreclosure affidavits were completed
    and signed by employees with personal knowledge of the contents
    of the affidavits, and there is no reason to conclude that
    foreclosures were filed that should not have been filed.
    Additionally, we have identified and are implementing process
    and control enhancements to ensure that affidavits continue to
    be prepared in compliance with applicable state law. We are
    consulting with local foreclosure counsel as necessary with
    respect to additional requirements imposed by the courts in
    which foreclosure proceedings are pending, which could impact
    our foreclosure actions.

Representation and Warranty Reserve

— We
    primarily conduct our loan sale and securitization activity with
    Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In connection with these and other
    sale and securitization transactions, we make certain
    representations and warranties that the loans meet certain
    criteria, such as collateral type and underwriting standards. In
    the future, we may be required to repurchase individual loans
    and / or indemnify



these organizations against losses due to material breaches of
    these representations and warranties. At December 31, 2010,
    we have a reserve for such losses of $20.2 million, which
    is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities.

    Expectations

Borrower and consumer confidence remains a major factor
    impacting growth opportunities for 2011. We continue to believe
    that the economy will remain relatively stable throughout 2011,
    with the potential for improvement in the latter half.
    Challenges to earnings growth include (1) revenue headwinds
    as a result of regulatory and legislative actions,
    (2) anticipated higher interest rates as we enter 2011,
    which is expected to reduce mortgage banking income, and
    (3) continued investments in growing our businesses.

Reflecting these factors, pre-tax, pre-provision income levels
    are expected to remain in line with 2010 second half
    performance. Nevertheless, net income growth from the 2010
    fourth quarter level is anticipated throughout the year. This
    will primarily reflect on-going reductions in credit costs. We
    expect the absolute levels of NCOs, NPAs, and Criticized loans
    will continue to decline, resulting in lower levels of provision
    expense. Given the significant credit-related improvements in
    2010, coupled with our expectation for continued improvement,
    our return to more normalized levels of credit costs could occur
    earlier than previously expected.

The net interest margin is expected to be flat or increase
    slightly from the 2010 fourth quarter. We anticipate continued
    benefit from lower deposit pricing. In addition, the absolute
    growth in loans compared with deposits is anticipated to be more
    comparable, thus reducing the absolute growth in lower yield
    investment securities.

The automobile loan portfolio is expected to continue its strong
    growth, and we anticipate continued growth in C&I loans.
    Home equity and residential mortgages are likely to show only
    modest growth. CRE loans are expected to continue to decline,
    but at a slower rate.

Core deposits are expected to show continued growth. Further, we
    expect the shift toward lower-cost demand deposit accounts will
    continue.

Fee income, compared with the 2010 fourth quarter, will be
    negatively impacted by lower interchange fees due to regulatory
    fee change and a decline in mortgage banking revenues due to a
    higher interest rate environment as we enter 2011. With regard
    to interchange fees, if enacted as recently outlined, the
    Federal Reserve’s proposed interchange fee structure will
    significantly lower interchange revenue. Other fee categories
    are expected to grow, reflecting the impact of our cross-sell
    initiatives throughout the Company, as well as the positive
    impact from strategic initiatives. Over time, we anticipate more
    than offsetting revenue challenges with revenue we expect to
    generate by accelerating customer growth and cross-sell results.
    Expense levels early in the year should be up modestly from 2010
    fourth quarter performance, with increases later in the year due
    to continued investments to grow the business.

DISCUSSION
    OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This section provides a review of financial performance from a
    consolidated perspective. It also includes a Significant Items
    section that summarizes key issues important for a complete
    understanding of performance trends. Key consolidated balance
    sheet and income statement trends are discussed. All earnings
    per share data is reported on a diluted basis. For additional
    insight on financial performance, please read this section in
    conjunction with the Item 7: Business Segment Discussion.

Significant
    Items

Definition
    of Significant Items

From

time-to-time,

revenue, expenses, or taxes, are impacted by items judged by us
    to be outside of ordinary banking activities and / or
    by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary
    banking activities, are so unusually large that their outsized
    impact is believed by us at that time to be infrequent or
    short-term in nature. We refer to such items as Significant
    Items. Most often, these Significant Items result from factors
    originating outside the Company; e.g., regulatory
    actions / assessments, windfall gains, changes in
    accounting principles, one-time tax
    assessments / refunds, etc. In other cases they may
    result from our decisions associated with significant corporate
    actions out of the ordinary course of business; e.g.,
    merger / restructuring charges, recapitalization
    actions, goodwill impairment, etc.

Even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally
    subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market
    and economic environment conditions, as a general rule
    volatility alone does not define a Significant Item. For
    example, changes in the provision for credit losses,
    gains / losses from investment activities, asset
    valuation writedowns, etc., reflect ordinary banking activities
    and are, therefore, typically excluded from consideration as a
    Significant Item.

We believe the disclosure of Significant Items in results
    provides a better understanding of our performance and trends to
    ascertain which of such items, if any, to include or exclude
    from an analysis of our performance; i.e., within the context of
    determining how that performance differed from expectations, as
    well as how, if at all, to adjust estimates of future
    performance accordingly. To this end, we adopted a practice of
    listing Significant Items in our external disclosure documents
    (e.g., earnings press releases, investor presentations,

Forms 10-Q

and

10-K).

Significant Items for any particular period are not intended to
    be a complete list of items that may materially impact current
    or future period performance.

Significant
    Items Influencing Financial Performance
    Comparisons

Earnings comparisons among the three years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 were impacted by a number
    of significant items summarized below.

1.

TARP Capital Purchase Program
    Repurchase.

During the 2010 fourth quarter, we
    issued $920.0 million of our common stock and
    $300.0 million of subordinated debt. The net proceeds,
    along with other available funds, were used to repurchase all
    $1.4 billion of TARP Capital that we issued to the Treasury
    under its TARP Capital Purchase Program in 2008. As part of this
    transaction, there was a deemed dividend that did not impact net
    income, but resulted in a negative impact of $0.08 per common
    share for 2010.



2.

Goodwill Impairment.

The impacts of
    goodwill impairment on our reported results were as follows:

•

During the 2009 first quarter, bank stock prices, including
    ours, experienced a steep decline. Our stock price declined 78%
    from $7.66 per share at December 31, 2008, to $1.66 per
    share at March 31, 2009. Given this significant decline, we
    conducted an interim test for goodwill impairment. As a result,
    we recorded a noncash $2,602.7 million ($4.88 per common
    share) pretax charge.

(See Goodwill discussion located within
    the Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant
    Estimates section for additional information.)

•

During the 2009 second quarter, a pretax goodwill impairment of
    $4.2 million ($0.01 per common share) was recorded relating
    to the sale of a small payments-related business in July 2009.

3.

Franklin Relationship.

Our
    relationship with Franklin was acquired in the Sky Financial
    acquisition in 2007. Significant events relating to this
    relationship, and the impacts of those events on our reported
    results, were as follows:

•

On March 31, 2009, we restructured our relationship with
    Franklin. As a result of this restructuring, a nonrecurring net
    tax benefit of $159.9 million ($0.30 per common share) was
    recorded in the 2009 first quarter. Also, and although earnings
    were not significantly impacted, commercial NCOs increased
    $128.3 million as the previously established
    $130.0 million Franklin-specific ALLL was utilized to
    writedown the acquired mortgages and OREO collateral to fair
    value.

•

During the 2010 first quarter, a $38.2 million ($0.05 per
    common share) net tax benefit was recognized, primarily
    reflecting the increase in the net deferred tax asset relating
    to the assets acquired from the March 31, 2009
    restructuring.

•

During the 2010 second quarter, the portfolio of
    Franklin-related loans ($333.0 million of residential
    mortgages and $64.7 million of home equity loans) was
    transferred to loans held for sale. At the time of the transfer,
    the loans were marked to the lower of cost or fair value less
    costs to sell of $323.4 million, resulting in
    $75.5 million of charge-offs, and the provision for credit
    losses commensurately increased $75.5 million ($0.07 per
    common share).

•

During the 2010 third quarter, the remaining Franklin-related
    residential mortgage and home equity loans were sold at
    essentially book value.

4.

Early Extinguishment of Debt.

The
    positive impacts relating to the early extinguishment of debt on
    our reported results were: $141.0 million ($0.18 per common
    share) in 2009 and $23.5 million ($0.04 per common share)
    in 2008. These amounts were recorded to noninterest expense.

5.

Preferred Stock Conversion.

During the
    2009 first and second quarters, we converted 114,109 and
    92,384 shares, respectively, of Series A 8.50%
    Non-cumulative Perpetual Preferred (Series A Preferred
    Stock) stock into common stock. As part of these transactions,
    there was a deemed dividend that did not impact net income, but
    resulted in a negative impact of $0.11 per common share for
    2009.

(See Capital discussion located within the Risk
    Management and Capital section for additional information.)

Pretax,
    Pre-provision Income Trends

One non-GAAP performance measurement that we believe is useful
    in analyzing underlying performance trends, particularly in
    times of economic stress, is pretax, pre-provision income. This
    is the level of earnings adjusted to exclude the impact of:
    (1) provision expense, which is excluded because its
    absolute level is elevated and volatile in times of economic
    stress, (2) investment securities gains/losses, which are
    excluded because securities market valuations may also become
    particularly volatile in times of economic stress,
    (3) amortization of intangibles expense, which is excluded
    because the return on tangible equity common equity is a key
    measurement that we use to gauge performance trends, and
    (4) certain other items identified by us

(see
    Significant Items above)

that we believe may distort our
    underlying performance trends.

    the three years ended December 31, 2010:

Pretax, pre-provision income is a non-GAAP financial measure.
    Any ratio utilizing this financial measure is also non-GAAP.
    This financial measure has been included as it is considered to
    be an important metric with which to analyze and evaluate our
    results of operations and financial strength. Other companies
    may calculate this financial measure differently.

As discussed in more detail in the sections that follow, the
    increase from 2009 primarily reflected improved revenue,
    including higher net interest income, partially offset by higher
    noninterest expense, including personnel costs and marketing.

Net
    Interest Income / Average Balance Sheet

Our primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is
    the difference between interest income from earning assets
    (primarily loans, securities, and direct financing leases), and
    interest expense of funding sources (primarily interest-bearing
    deposits and borrowings). Earning asset balances and related
    funding sources, as well as changes in the levels of interest
    rates, impact net interest income. The difference between the
    average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for
    interest-bearing liabilities is the net interest spread.
    Noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits
    and shareholders’ equity, also support earning assets. The
    impact of the noninterest-bearing sources of funds, often
    referred to as “free” funds, is captured in the net
    interest margin, which is calculated as net interest income
    divided by average earning assets. Both the net interest margin
    and net interest spread are presented on a fully-taxable
    equivalent basis, which means that tax-free interest income has
    been adjusted to a pretax equivalent income, assuming a 35% tax
    rate.



The following table shows changes in fully-taxable equivalent
    interest income, interest expense, and net interest income due
    to volume and rate variances for major categories of earning
    assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

    versus 2009

Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income for 2010 increased
    $194.1 million, or 14%, from 2009. This reflected the
    favorable impact of a $1.3 billion, or 3%, increase in
    average earning assets, due to a $2.9 billion, or 45%,
    increase in average total investment securities, which was
    partially offset by a $1.4 billion, or 4%, decrease in
    average total loans and leases. Also contributing to the
    increase in net interest income was a 33 basis point
    increase in the fully-taxable net interest margin to 3.44% from
    3.11% in 2009.

The $1.4 billion, or 4%, decrease in average total loans
    and leases primarily reflected:

•

$2.6 billion, or 12%, decline in average total commercial
    loans. The decline in average CRE loans reflected our planned
    efforts to shrink this portfolio through payoffs and paydowns,
    as well as the impact of NCOs. The decline in average C&I
    loans reflected a general decrease in borrowing as evidenced by
    a decline in

line-of-credit

utilization, NCO activity, and the reclassification in the 2010
    first quarter of variable rate demand notes to municipal
    securities.

Partially offset by:

•

$1.2 billion, or 7%, increase in average total consumer
    loans. This growth reflected a $1.3 billion, or 38%,
    increase in average automobile loans and leases. On
    January 1, 2010, we adopted the new accounting standard
    ASC — 810 Consolidation, resulting in the
    consolidation of an off balance sheet securitization and
    increasing our automobile loan portfolio by $0.5 billion at
    December 31, 2010. Underlying growth in automobile loans
    continued to be strong, reflecting a significant increase in
    loan originations in 2010 as compared to 2009 in all of our
    markets. Our recent expansion into Eastern Pennsylvania and the
    five New England states also began to have a positive impact on
    our volume.

Total average investment securities increased $2.9 billion,
    or 45%, reflecting the deployment of the cash from core deposit
    growth and loan runoff over this period, as well as the proceeds
    from 2009 capital actions.



The $1.3 billion, or 3%, increase in average total deposits
    reflected:

•

$3.1 billion, or 9%, growth in total core deposits. The
    primary driver of this growth was a 63% increase in average
    money market deposits. Partially offsetting this growth was a
    23% decline in average core certificates of deposit.

Partially offset by:

•

$1.7 billion, or 39%, decline in average noncore deposits,
    reflecting a managed decline in public fund deposits as well as
    planned efforts to reduce our reliance on noncore funding
    sources.

    versus 2008

Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income for 2009 decreased
    $116.2 million, or 7%, from 2008. This reflected the
    unfavorable impact of a $1.7 billion, or 4%, decrease in
    average earning assets, which included a $2.3 billion
    decrease in average loans and leases. Also contributing to the
    decline in net interest income was a 14 basis point decline
    in the fully-taxable net interest margin to 3.11%, primarily due
    to the unfavorable impact of our stronger liquidity position and
    an increase in NALs.

The $2.3 billion, or 6%, decrease in average total loans
    and leases primarily reflected:

•

$1.0 billion, or 4%, decline in average total commercial
    loans. The decline in average CRE loans reflected our planned
    efforts to shrink this portfolio through payoffs and paydowns,
    as well as the impact of NCOs and the 2009 reclassifications of
    CRE loans to C&I loans

(see Commercial Credit
    section)

. The decline in average C&I loans reflected
    paydowns, the Franklin restructuring, and a



reduction in the

line-of-credit

utilization in our automobile dealer floorplan exposure,
    partially offset by the 2009 reclassifications.

•

$1.0 billion, or 22%, decline in average automobile loans
    and leases due to the 2009 securitization of $1.0 billion
    of automobile loans, as well as the continued runoff of the
    automobile lease portfolio.

•

$0.5 billion, or 9%, decline in residential mortgages
    reflecting the impact of loan sales, as well as the continued
    refinance of portfolio loans. The majority of this refinance
    activity was fixed-rate loans, which we typically sell in the
    secondary market.

Partially offset by:

•

$0.2 billion, or 3%, increase in average home equity loans
    reflecting higher utilization of existing lines resulting from
    higher quality borrowers taking advantage of the current
    relatively lower interest rate environment, as well as a
    slowdown in runoff.

Total average investment securities increased $1.7 billion,
    or 38%, as the cash proceeds from core deposit growth and the
    capital actions initiated during 2009 were deployed. This
    increase was partially offset by a $0.9 billion, or 87%,
    decline in trading account securities due to the reduction in
    the use of these securities to hedge MSRs.

The $1.6 billion, or 4%, increase in average total deposits
    reflected:

•

$2.9 billion, or 9%, growth in total core deposits,
    primarily reflecting increased sales efforts and initiatives for
    deposit accounts.

Partially offset by:

•

$1.4 billion, or 24%, decline in average noncore deposits,
    reflecting a managed decline in public fund deposits as well as
    planned efforts to reduce our reliance on noncore funding
    sources.

Provision
    for Credit Losses

(This section should be read in conjunction with Significant
    Item 3, and the Credit Risk section.)

The provision for credit losses is the expense necessary to
    maintain the ALLL and the AULC at levels adequate to absorb our
    estimate of probable inherent credit losses in the loan and
    lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded loan commitments
    and letters of credit.

The provision for credit losses in 2010 was $634.5 million,
    down $1,440.1 million from 2009. The decrease from 2009
    primarily reflected the improved credit quality in our loan
    portfolios including lower NCOs, NALs, and NPAs.

The provision for credit losses in 2009 was
    $2,074.7 million, up $1,017.2 million from 2008, and
    exceeded NCOs by $598.1 million. The increase in 2009 from
    2008 primarily reflected the continued economic weakness across
    all our regions and all our loan portfolios, although our
    commercial loan portfolios were the most affected.

The following table details the Franklin-related impact to the
    provision for credit losses for each of the past four years.

    versus 2009

Noninterest income increased $36.2 million, or 4%, from the
    prior year, primarily reflecting:

•

$63.5 million, or 57%, increase in mortgage banking income.
    Net MSR hedging-related activities contributed a
    $45.4 million net increase. We use an independent outside
    third party to monitor our MSR asset valuation and assumptions.
    During 2010, interest rates were volatile and generally lower
    than 2009 rates resulting in higher prepayment speeds and lower
    MSR valuation, which was economically hedged and offset by
    hedging gains. However, the negative MSR valuation adjustment
    was partially offset by model assumption updates. Based on
    updated market data and trends, the prepayment assumptions were
    lowered, which increased the value of the MSR. The increase also
    reflected a $22.7 million increase in origination and
    secondary marketing income as loan sales and loan originations
    were substantially higher

(see Table 12). (See MSR section
    located within Market Risk for additional information.)

•

$10.1 million, or 10%, increase in electronic banking,
    reflecting increased debit card transaction volume.

•

$10.0 million benefit from lower securities losses.

•

$8.9 million, or 9%, increase in trust services income,
    with 50% of the increase due to increases in asset market
    values, and the remainder reflecting growth in new business.

•

$6.2 million, or 11%, increase in insurance benefits
    associated with bank owned life insurance.

•

$4.0 million, or 6%, increase in brokerage income,
    primarily reflecting an increase in title insurance income due
    to higher mortgage refinance activity, and to a lesser degree an
    increase in fixed income product sales, partially offset by
    lower annuity income.

Partially offset by:

•

$35.8 million, or 12%, decrease in service charges on
    deposit accounts. This decline represented a decrease in
    personal NSF / OD service charges and reflected a
    combination of factors. These included the implementation of
    changes to Regulation E and the introduction of our Fair Play
    banking philosophy during the 2010 third quarter, as well as the
    continued underlying decline in activity as customers better
    manage their account balances. As part of our Fair Play banking
    philosophy, we voluntary reduced certain NSF / OD fees
    and implemented our

24-Hour

Grace

tm

overdraft policy. The goal of our Fair Play banking philosophy
    is to introduce more customer friendly fee structures with the
    objective of accelerating the acquisition and retention of
    customers.

•

$27.9 million, or 18%, decline in other income. 2009
    included a $31.4 million gain from the sale of
    Visa

®

Class B stock.

    versus 2008

Noninterest income increased $298.5 million, or 42%, from
    2008, primarily reflecting:

•

$103.3 million increase in mortgage banking income,
    reflecting a $57.5 million increase in origination and
    secondary marketing income as loans sales and loan originations
    were substantially higher, and a $27.1 million improvement
    in MSR hedging

(see Table 12)

.

•

$187.1 million, or 95%, reduction in securities losses as
    2008 included $197.1 million of OTTI adjustments compared
    with $10.2 million in 2009.

•

$12.0 million, or 30%, increase in automobile operating
    lease income, reflecting a 21% increase in average operating
    lease balances as lease originations since the 2007 fourth
    quarter were recorded as operating leases. However, during the
    2008 fourth quarter, we exited the automobile leasing business.



•

$13.4 million, or 10%, increase in other income, reflecting
    the net impact of a $22.4 million change in the fair value
    of derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting,
    partially offset by a $4.7 million decline in mezzanine
    lending income and a $4.1 million decline in customer
    derivatives income.

•

$9.9 million, or 11%, increase in electronic banking,
    reflecting increased transaction volumes and additional third
    party processing fees.

Partially offset by:

•

$22.3 million, or 18%, decline in trust services income,
    reflecting the impact of reduced market values on asset
    management revenues, as well as lower yields on proprietary
    money market funds.

    versus 2009

As shown in the above table, noninterest expense decreased
    $2,359.6 million from the year-ago period. Excluding the
    2009 goodwill impairment of $2,606.9 million, noninterest
    expense increased $247.3 million and primarily reflected:

•

The absence of $147.4 million in gains on early
    extinguishment of debt in 2009.



•

$98.5 million, or 14%, increase in personnel costs,
    primarily reflecting a 10% increase in full-time equivalent
    staff in support of strategic initiatives, as well as higher
    commissions and other incentive expenses, and the reinstatement
    of certain employee benefits such as 401(k) plan matching
    contribution, merit increases, and bonuses.

•

$32.9 million, or 99%, increase in marketing expense,
    reflecting increases in branding and product advertising
    activities in support of strategic initiatives.

•

$24.8 million, or 23%, increase in other expense,
    reflecting $13.1 million increase associated with the
    provision for repurchase losses related to representations and
    warranties made on mortgage loans sold, as well as increased
    travel and miscellaneous fees.

Partially offset by:

•

$54.9 million, or 58%, decline in OREO and foreclosure
    expense.

•

$16.3 million, or 14%, decrease in deposit and other
    insurance expense. This decrease was comprised of two
    components: (1) $23.6 million FDIC special assessment
    during the 2009 second quarter, and (2) increased
    assessments due to higher levels of deposits.

    versus 2008

Noninterest expense increased $2,556.1 million from 2008,
    and primarily reflected:

•

$2,606.9 million of goodwill impairment recorded in 2009.
    The majority of the goodwill impairment, $2,602.7 million,
    was recorded during the 2009 first quarter. The remaining
    $4.2 million of goodwill impairment was recorded in the
    2009 second quarter, and was related to the sale of a small
    payments-related business in July 2009.

(See Goodwill
    discussion located within the Critical Account Policies and Use
    of Significant Estimates for additional information).

•

$91.4 million increase in deposit and other insurance
    expense. This increase was comprised of two components: (1)
    $23.6 million FDIC special assessment during the 2009
    second quarter, and (2) $67.8 million increase related
    to our 2008 FDIC assessments being significantly reduced by a
    nonrecurring deposit assessment credit provided by the FDIC that
    was depleted during the 2008 fourth quarter. This deposit
    insurance credit offset substantially all of our assessment in
    2008. Higher levels of deposits also contributed to the increase.

•

$60.4 million increase in OREO and foreclosure expense,
    reflecting higher levels of problem assets, as well as loss
    mitigation activities.

•

$26.8 million, or 54%, increase in professional services,
    reflecting higher consulting and collection-related expenses.

•

$17.9 million, or 14%, increase in outside data processing
    and other services, primarily reflecting portfolio servicing
    fees paid to Franklin resulting from the 2009 first quarter
    restructuring of this relationship.

•

$12.1 million, or 39%, increase in automobile operating
    lease expense, primarily reflecting a 21% increase in average
    operating leases. However, we exited the automobile leasing
    business during the 2008 fourth quarter.

Partially offset by:

•

$123.9 million positive impact related to gains on early
    extinguishment of debt.

•

$83.1 million, or 11%, decline in personnel expense,
    reflecting a decline in salaries, and lower benefits and
    commission expense. Full-time equivalent staff declined 6% from
    the comparable year-ago period.

•

$30.2 million, or 22%, decline in other noninterest expense
    primarily reflecting lower automobile lease residual value
    expense as used vehicle prices improved.



•

$10.8 million, or 12%, decline in equipment costs,
    reflecting lower depreciation costs, as well as lower repair and
    maintenance costs.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

(This section should be read in conjunction with Significant
    Items 3 and 7, and Note 17 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.)

    versus 2009

The provision for income taxes was $40.0 million for 2010
    compared with a benefit of $584.0 million in 2009. Both
    years included the benefits from tax-exempt income,
    tax-advantaged investments, and general business credits. In
    2010, we entered into an asset monetization transaction that
    generated a tax benefit of $63.6 million. Also, in 2010,
    undistributed previously reported earnings of a foreign
    subsidiary of $142.3 million were distributed and an
    additional $49.8 million of tax expense was recorded. State
    tax reserves of $28.8 million ($18.7 million net of
    federal benefit) for 2010 were recorded.

The Franklin restructuring in 2009 resulted in a
    $159.9 million net deferred tax asset equal to the amount
    of income and equity that was included in our operating results
    for 2009. During 2010, a $43.6 million net tax benefit was
    recognized, primarily reflecting the increase in the net
    deferred tax asset relating to the assets acquired from the
    March 31, 2009 Franklin restructuring.

The IRS completed the audit of our consolidated federal income
    tax returns for tax years through 2007. In addition, various
    state and other jurisdictions remain open to examination,
    including Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, West
    Virginia and Illinois. Both the IRS and state tax officials,
    including Ohio and Kentucky, have proposed adjustments to our
    previously filed tax returns. We believe that our tax positions
    related to such proposed adjustments are correct and supported
    by applicable statutes, regulations, and judicial authority, and
    intend to vigorously defend them. It is possible that the
    ultimate resolution of the proposed adjustments, if unfavorable,
    may be material to the results of operations in the period it
    occurs. However, although no assurance can be given, we believe
    that the resolution of these examinations will not, individually
    or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position.

    versus 2008

The provision for income taxes was a benefit of
    $584.0 million for 2009 compared with a benefit of
    $182.2 million in 2008. The tax benefit for both years
    included the benefits from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged
    investments, and general business credits. The tax benefit in
    2009 was impacted by the pretax loss combined with the favorable
    impacts of the Franklin restructuring in 2009 and the reduction
    of the capital loss valuation reserve, offset by the
    nondeductible portion of the 2009 goodwill impairment.

RISK
    MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL

Risk awareness, identification, reporting, and active management
    are key elements in overall risk management. We manage risk to
    an aggregate

moderate-to-low

risk profile strategy through a control framework and by
    monitoring and responding to potential risks. Controls include,
    among others, effective segregation of duties, access,
    authorization and reconciliation procedures, as well as staff
    education and a disciplined assessment process.

As a strategy, we have identified sources of risks and primary
    risks in coordination with each business unit. We utilize Risk
    and Control Self-Assessments (RCSA) to identify exposure risks.
    Through this RCSA process, we continually assess the
    effectiveness of controls associated with the identified risks,
    regularly monitor risk profiles and material exposure to losses,
    and identify stress events and scenarios to which we may be
    exposed. Our chief risk officer is responsible for ensuring that
    appropriate systems of controls are in place for managing and
    monitoring risk across the Company. Potential risk concerns are
    shared with the Risk Management Committee and the board of
    directors, as appropriate. Our internal audit department
    performs on-going independent reviews of the risk management
    process and ensures the adequacy of documentation. The results
    of these reviews are reported regularly to the audit committee
    of the board of directors.



We believe our primary risk exposures are credit, market,
    liquidity, operational, and compliance risk.

Credit risk

is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in our
    borrowers’ ability to meet their financial obligations
    under agreed upon terms.

Market risk

represents the risk
    of loss due to changes in the market value of assets and
    liabilities due to changes in interest rates, exchange rates,
    and equity prices.

Liquidity risk

arises from the
    possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current
    or future obligations resulting from external macro market
    issues, investor perception of financial strength, and events
    unrelated to us such as war, terrorism, or financial institution
    market specific issues.

Operational risk

arises from our
    inherent

day-to-day

operations that could result in losses due to human error,
    inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, and external
    events.

Compliance risk

exposes us to money penalties,
    enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result of
    nonconformance with laws, rules, and regulations that apply to
    the financial services industry.

Some of the more significant processes used to manage and
    control credit, market, liquidity, operational, and compliance
    risks are described in the following paragraphs.

Credit
    Risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is
    not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial
    obligation. The majority of our credit risk is associated with
    lending activities, as the acceptance and management of credit
    risk is central to profitable lending. We also have significant
    credit risk associated with our investment securities portfolio

(see Investment Securities Portfolio discussion)

. While
    there is credit risk associated with derivative activity, we
    believe this exposure is minimal. The significant change in the
    economic conditions and the resulting changes in borrower
    behavior over the past several years resulted in our focusing
    significant resources to the identification, monitoring, and
    managing of our credit risk. In addition to the traditional
    credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and
    processes, market risk management activities, and portfolio
    diversification, we added more quantitative measurement
    capabilities utilizing external data sources, enhanced use of
    modeling technology, and internal stress testing processes.

The maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit
    borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived
    risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers. All
    authority to grant commitments is delegated through the
    independent credit administration function and is closely
    monitored and regularly updated. Concentration risk is managed
    through limits on loan type, geography, industry, and loan
    quality factors. We continue to focus predominantly on extending
    credit to retail and commercial customers with existing or
    expandable relationships within our primary banking markets,
    although we will consider lending opportunities outside our
    primary markets if we believe the associated risks are
    acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives. We continue
    to add new borrowers that meet our targeted risk and
    profitability profile. Although we offer a broad set of
    products, we continue to develop new lending products and
    opportunities. Each of these new products and opportunities goes
    through a rigorous development and approval process prior to
    implementation to ensure our overall objective of maintaining an
    aggregate

moderate-to-low

risk portfolio profile.

The checks and balances in the credit process and the
    independence of the credit administration and risk management
    functions are designed to appropriately assess the level of
    credit risk being accepted, facilitate the early recognition of
    credit problems when they occur, and to provide for effective
    problem asset management and resolution. For example, we do not
    extend additional credit to delinquent borrowers except in
    certain circumstances that substantially improve our overall
    repayment or collateral coverage position.

Asset quality metrics improved significantly in 2010, reflecting
    our proactive portfolio management initiatives as well as some
    stabilization in a still relatively weak economy. The
    improvements in the asset quality metrics, including lower
    levels of NPAs, Criticized and Classified assets, and
    delinquencies have all been achieved through these policies and
    commitments. Our portfolio management policies demonstrate our
    commitment to maintaining an aggregate

moderate-to-low

risk profile. To that end, we continue to expand resources in
    our risk management areas.

The weak residential real estate market and U.S. economy
    continued to have significant impact on the financial services
    industry as a whole, and specifically on our financial results.
    A pronounced downturn in the residential real estate market that
    began in early 2007 has resulted in significantly lower
    residential real estate



values and higher delinquencies and NCOs, including loans to
    builders and developers of residential real estate. In addition,
    continued high unemployment, among other factors, throughout
    2010, has slowed any significant recovery from the
    U.S. recession during 2008 and 2009. As a result, we
    experienced higher than historical levels of delinquencies and
    NCOs in our loan portfolios during 2009 and 2010. The value of
    our investment securities backed by residential and commercial
    real estate was also negatively impacted by a lack of liquidity
    in the financial markets and anticipated credit losses.

Loan
    and Lease Credit Exposure Mix

At December 31, 2010, our loans and leases totaled
    $38.1 billion, representing a 4% increase from
    December 31, 2009. The composition of the portfolio has
    changed significantly over the past 12 months. From
    December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2010, the consumer
    loan portfolio increased $2.2 billion, or 13%, primarily
    driven by the automobile loan portfolio. In 2010, our indirect
    automobile finance business generated significant levels of high
    credit-quality loan originations, and we also adopted a new
    accounting standard resulting in the consolidation of a
    $0.8 billion automobile loan securitization. At
    December 31, 2010, these securitized loans had a remaining
    balance of $522.7 million. These increases were partially
    offset by a $0.9 billion, or 4%, decline in the commercial
    loan portfolio, primarily as a result of a planned strategy to
    reduce the concentration of our noncore CRE portfolio.

At December 31, 2010, commercial loans totaled
    $19.7 billion, and represented 52% of our total credit
    exposure. Our commercial loan portfolio is diversified along
    product type, size, and geography within our footprint, and is
    comprised of the following (

see Commercial Credit
    discussion)

:

C&I loans

— C&I loans are made to
    commercial customers for use in normal business operations to
    finance working capital needs, equipment purchases, or other
    projects. The majority of these borrowers are customers doing
    business within our geographic regions. C&I loans are
    generally underwritten individually and secured with the assets
    of the company

and/or

the
    personal guarantee of the business owners. The financing of
    owner-occupied facilities is considered a C&I loan even
    though there is improved real estate as collateral. This
    treatment is a function of the credit decision process, which
    focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay
    the debt. The operation, sale, rental, or refinancing of the
    real estate is not considered the primary repayment source for
    these types of loans. As we look to expand C&I loan growth,
    we have further developed our ABL capabilities by adding
    experienced ABL professionals to take advantage of market
    opportunities resulting in better leveraging of the
    manufacturing base in our primary markets. We have also added a
    national banking group with sufficient resources to ensure we
    appropriately recognize and manage the risks associated with
    this type of lending.

CRE loans

— CRE loans consist of loans for
    income-producing real estate properties, real estate investment
    trusts, and real estate developers. We mitigate our risk on
    these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan
    amount and underwriting the loan with projected cash flow in
    excess of the debt service requirement. These loans are made to
    finance properties such as apartment buildings, office and
    industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers; and are
    repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale, or
    refinance of the property.

Construction CRE loans

— Construction CRE loans
    are loans to individuals, companies, or developers used for the
    construction of a commercial or residential property for which
    repayment will be generated by the sale or permanent financing
    of the property. Our construction CRE portfolio primarily
    consists of retail, residential (land, single family, and
    condominiums), office, and warehouse product types. Generally,
    these loans are for construction projects that have been
    presold, preleased, or have secured permanent financing, as well
    as loans to real estate companies with significant equity
    invested in each project. These loans are underwritten and
    managed by a specialized real estate lending group that actively
    monitors the construction phase and manages the loan
    disbursements according to the predetermined construction
    schedule.



Total consumer loans were $18.4 billion at
    December 31, 2010, and represented 48% of our total credit
    exposure. The consumer portfolio was diversified among home
    equity loans, residential mortgages, and automobile loans and
    leases

(see Consumer Credit discussion)

.

Automobile loans/leases

— Automobile
    loans/leases are primarily comprised of loans made through
    automotive dealerships and includes exposure in selected states
    outside of our primary banking markets. In 2009, we exited
    several states, including Florida, Arizona, and Nevada. In 2010,
    we expanded into eastern Pennsylvania and five New England
    states. The recent expansions included hiring experienced
    colleagues with existing dealer relationships in those markets.
    No state outside of our primary banking market represented more
    than 5% of our total automobile loan and lease portfolio at
    December 31, 2010. Our automobile lease portfolio
    represents an immaterial portion of the total portfolio as we
    exited the automobile leasing business during the 2008 fourth
    quarter.

Home equity

— Home equity lending includes both
    home equity loans and

lines-of-credit.

This type of lending, which is secured by a first- or second-
    lien on the borrower’s residence, allows customers to
    borrow against the equity in their home. Given the current low
    interest rate environment, many borrowers have utilized the

line-of-credit

home equity product as the primary source of financing their
    home. As a result, the proportion of first-lien loans has
    increased significantly in our portfolio over the past
    24 months. Real estate market values at the time of
    origination directly affect the amount of credit extended and,
    in the event of default, subsequent changes in these values may
    impact the severity of losses. We actively manage the amount of
    credit extended through

debt-to-income

policies and LTV policy limits.

Residential mortgages

— Residential mortgage
    loans represent loans to consumers for the purchase or refinance
    of a residence. These loans are generally financed over a 15- to
    30- year term, and in most cases, are extended to borrowers to
    finance their primary residence. Generally, our practice is to
    sell a significant portion of our fixed-rate originations in the
    secondary market. As such, the majority of the loans in our
    portfolio are ARMs. These ARMs primarily consist of a fixed-rate
    of interest for the first 3 to 5 years, and then adjust
    annually. These loans comprised approximately 57% of our total
    residential mortgage loan portfolio at December 31, 2010.

Other consumer loans/leases

— Primarily
    consists of consumer loans not secured by real estate or
    automobiles, including personal unsecured loans.

The majority of our loans secured by real estate are discussed
    in detail in later sections.

Commercial
    Credit

The primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals
    are the financial strength of the borrower, assessment of the
    borrower’s management capabilities, cash flows from
    operations, industry sector trends, type



and sufficiency of collateral, type of exposure, transaction
    structure, and the general economic outlook. While these are the
    primary factors considered, there are a number of other factors
    that may be considered in the decision process. For all loans
    exceeding $5.0 million, we utilize a centralized senior
    loan committee, led by our chief credit officer. For loans less
    than $5.0 million, with the exception of small business
    loans, credit officers who understand each local region and are
    experienced in the industries and loan structures of the
    requested credit exposure are involved in all loan decisions and
    have the primary credit authority. For small business loans less
    than $5.0 million, we utilize a centralized loan approval
    process for standard products and structures. In this
    centralized decision environment, certain individuals who
    understand each local region may make credit-extension decisions
    to preserve our commitment to the communities we operate in. In
    addition to disciplined and consistent judgmental factors, a
    sophisticated credit scoring process is used as a primary
    evaluation tool in the determination of approving a loan within
    the centralized loan approval process.

In commercial lending, on-going credit management is dependent
    on the type and nature of the loan. We monitor all significant
    exposures on an on-going basis. All commercial credit extensions
    are assigned internal risk ratings reflecting the
    borrower’s

probability-of-default

and loss-given-default (severity of loss). This two-dimensional
    rating methodology provides granularity in the portfolio
    management process. The

probability-of-default

is rated and applied at the borrower level. The
    loss-given-default is rated and applied based on the type of
    credit extension and the underlying collateral. The internal
    risk ratings are assessed and updated with each periodic
    monitoring event. There is also extensive macro portfolio
    management analysis on an on-going basis. As an example, the
    retail properties class of the CRE portfolio has received more
    frequent evaluation at the individual loan level given the weak
    environment, portfolio concentration, and stressed performance
    trends

(see Retail Properties discussion)

. We continually
    review and adjust our risk-rating criteria based on actual
    experience, which provides us with the current risk level in the
    portfolio and is the basis for determining an appropriate ACL
    amount for this portfolio.

In addition to the initial credit analysis initiated during the
    approval process, the Credit Review group performs testing to
    provide an independent review and assessment of the quality
    and / or risk of the new loan production. This group
    is part of our Risk Management area, and conducts portfolio
    reviews on a risk-based cycle to evaluate individual loans,
    validate risk ratings, as well as test the consistency of credit
    processes. Similarly, to provide consistent oversight, a
    centralized portfolio management team monitors and reports on
    the performance of small business banking loans.

The commercial loan ratings described above are categorized as
    follows:

Pass:

Commercial loans categorized as Pass are
    higher quality loans that do not fit any of the other categories
    described below.

OLEM:

Commercial loans categorized as OLEM are
    potentially weak. The credit risk may be relatively minor yet
    represents a risk given certain specific circumstances. If the
    potential weaknesses are not monitored or mitigated, the asset
    may weaken or inadequately protect our position in the future.

Substandard:

Commercial loans categorized as
    Substandard are inadequately protected by the borrower’s
    ability to repay, equity,

and/or

the
    collateral pledged to secure the loan. These loans have
    identified weaknesses that could hinder normal repayment or
    collection of the debt. It is likely that we will sustain some
    loss if any identified weaknesses are not mitigated.

Doubtful:

Commercial loans categorized as
    Doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those loans
    classified as Substandard, with the added elements that the full
    collection of the loan is improbable and the possibility of loss
    is high.

Commercial loans rated as OLEM, Substandard, or Doubtful are
    considered Criticized. Commercial loans rated as Substandard or
    Doubtful are considered Classified. Commercial loans may be
    designated as Criticized when warranted by individual borrower
    performance or by industry and environmental factors. Commercial
    Criticized loans are subjected to additional monthly reviews to
    adequately assess the borrower’s credit status and develop
    appropriate action plans. We re-evaluate the risk-rating of
    these Criticized commercial loans as conditions change,
    potentially resulting in a further rating adjustment. Changes in
    the rating can be impacted by borrower performance, external
    factors such as industry and economic changes, as well as
    structural



changes to the loan arrangements including, but not limited to,
    amortization, collateral, guarantees, and covenants.

All Classified commercial loans are managed by our SAD. The SAD
    is a specialized credit group that handles the

day-to-day

management of workouts, commercial recoveries, and problem loan
    sales. Its responsibilities include developing action plans,
    assessing risk ratings, and determining the adequacy of the
    reserve, the accrual status, and the ultimate collectability of
    the Classified loan portfolio.

Our commercial loan portfolio, including CRE loans, is
    diversified by customer size, as well as geographically
    throughout our footprint. During 2009, we engaged in a large
    number of enhanced portfolio management initiatives, including a
    review to ensure the appropriate classification of CRE loans.
    The results of this initiative included reclassifications in
    2009 totaling $1.4 billion that increased C&I loan
    balances, and correspondingly decreased CRE loan balances,
    primarily representing owner-occupied properties. We believe the
    changes provide improved visibility and clarity to us and our
    investors. We have continued this active portfolio management
    process throughout 2010, primarily focusing on improving our
    ability to identify changing conditions at the borrower level,
    which in most cases, significantly improved the outcome. This
    process allows us to provide clarity regarding the credit trends
    in our portfolios.

Certain segments of our commercial loan portfolio are discussed
    in further detail below:

C&I
    PORTFOLIO

The C&I portfolio is comprised of loans to businesses where
    the source of repayment is associated with the on-going
    operations of the business. Generally, the loans are secured
    with the financing of the borrower’s assets, such as
    equipment, accounts receivable, or inventory. In many cases, the
    loans are secured by real estate, although the operation, sale,
    or refinancing of the real estate is not a primary source of
    repayment for the loan. For loans secured by real estate,
    appropriate appraisals are obtained at origination and updated
    on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory requirements.

There were no outstanding commercial loans considered an
    industry or geographic concentration of lending. Currently,
    higher-risk segments of the C&I portfolio include loans to
    borrowers supporting the home building industry, contractors,
    and automotive suppliers. We manage the risks inherent in this
    portfolio through origination policies, concentration limits,
    on-going loan level reviews, recourse requirements, and
    continuous portfolio risk management activities. Our origination
    policies for this portfolio include loan product-type specific
    policies such as LTV and debt service coverage ratios, as
    applicable.

C&I borrowers have been challenged by the weak economy, and
    some borrowers may no longer have sufficient capital to
    withstand the extended stress. As a result, these borrowers may
    not be able to comply with the original terms of their credit
    agreements. We continue to focus attention on the portfolio
    management process to proactively identify borrowers that may be
    facing financial difficulty to assess all potential solutions.
    The impact of the economic environment is further evidenced by
    the level of

line-of-credit

activity, as borrowers continued to maintain relatively low
    utilization percentages over the past 12 months.

As shown in the following table, C&I loans totaled
    $13.1 billion at December 31, 2010:

The differences in the composition between the commitments and
    loans outstanding results from the owner-occupied class
    consisting almost entirely of term loans, while the remainder of
    the C&I portfolio contains a significant amount of working
    capital

lines-of-credit.

The funding percentage associated with the

lines-of-credit

has been a significant indicator of credit quality, as
    businesses have reduced their borrowings. Generally, borrowers
    that fully utilize their

line-of-credit

consistently, over time, have a higher risk profile. This
    represents one of many credit risk factors we utilize in
    assessing the credit risk portfolio of individual borrowers and
    the overall portfolio.

CRE
    PORTFOLIO

We manage the risks inherent in this portfolio the same as the
    C&I portfolio, with the addition of preleasing
    requirements, as applicable. Generally, we: (1) limit our
    loans to 80% of the appraised value of the commercial real
    estate, (2) require net operating cash flows to be 125% of
    required interest and principal payments, and (3) if the
    commercial real estate is non-owner-occupied, require that at
    least 50% of the space of the project be pre-leased.

Dedicated real estate professionals originated the majority of
    the portfolio, with the remainder obtained from prior bank
    acquisitions. Appraisals are obtained from approved vendors, and
    are reviewed by an internal appraisal review group comprised of
    certified appraisers to ensure the quality of the valuation used
    in the underwriting process. The portfolio is diversified by
    project type and loan size, and this diversification represents
    a significant portion of the credit risk management strategies
    employed for this portfolio. Subsequent to the origination of
    the loan, the Credit Review group performs testing to provide an
    independent review and assessment of the quality of the
    underwriting

and/or

risk
    of the new loan production.

Appraisal values are obtained in conjunction with all
    originations and renewals, and on an as needed basis, in
    compliance with regulatory requirements. Given the stressed
    environment for some loan types, we perform on-going portfolio
    level reviews of certain loan classes such as the retail
    properties class within the CRE portfolio

(see Retail
    Properties discussion)

. These reviews generate action plans
    based on occupancy levels or sales volume associated with the
    projects being reviewed. The results of these reviews indicate
    that some additional stress is likely due to the continued weak
    economic conditions. Property values are updated using
    appraisals on a regular basis to ensure appropriate decisions
    regarding the on-going management of the portfolio reflect the
    changing market conditions. This highly individualized process
    requires working closely with all of our borrowers, as well as
    an in-depth knowledge of CRE project lending and the market
    environment.

We actively monitor the concentrations and performance metrics
    of all CRE loan types, with a focus on higher risk classes.
    Macro-level stress-test scenarios based on retail sales and
    home-price depreciation trends for the classes are embedded in
    our performance expectations, and

lease-up

and
    absorption scenarios are assessed.

Each CRE loan is classified as either core or noncore. We
    separated the CRE portfolio into these categories in order to
    provide more clarity around our portfolio management strategies
    and to provide additional clarity for us and our investors. We
    believe segregating the noncore CRE from core CRE improves our
    ability to understand the nature, performance prospects, and
    problem resolution opportunities of these segments, thus
    allowing us to continue to deal proactively with any emerging
    credit issues.

A CRE loan is generally considered core when the borrower is an
    experienced, well-capitalized developer in our Midwest
    footprint, and has either an established meaningful relationship
    with the borrower generating an acceptable return on capital or
    demonstrates the prospect of becoming one. The core CRE
    portfolio was $4.0 billion at December 31, 2010,
    representing 61% of total CRE loans. The performance of the core
    portfolio met our expectations based on the consistency of the
    asset quality metrics within the portfolio. Based on our
    extensive project level assessment process, including
    forward-looking collateral valuations, we continue to believe
    the credit quality of the core portfolio is stable.

A CRE loan is generally considered noncore based on the lack of
    a substantive relationship outside of the loan product, with no
    immediate prospects for meeting the core relationship criteria.
    The noncore CRE



portfolio declined from $3.7 billion at December 31,
    2009, to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2010, and
    represented 39% of total CRE loans. Of the loans in the noncore
    portfolio at December 31, 2010, 49% were classified as
    Pass, 95% had guarantors, 99% were secured, and 93% were located
    within our geographic footprint. However, it is within the
    noncore portfolio where most of the credit quality challenges
    exist. For example, $0.3 billion, or 13%, of related
    outstanding balances, are classified as NALs. SAD administered
    $1.4 billion, or 54%, of total noncore CRE loans at
    December 31, 2010. We expect to exit the majority of
    noncore CRE relationships over time through normal repayments,
    possible sales should economically attractive opportunities
    arise, or the reclassification to a core CRE relationship if it
    expands to meet the core criteria.

As shown in the above table, the ending balance of the CRE
    portfolio at December 31, 2010, declined $1.0 billion
    compared with December 31, 2009. This decline was entirely
    centered in the noncore segment of the portfolio and was a
    result of payoffs and NCOs as we actively focus on the noncore
    portfolio to reduce our overall CRE exposure. This reduction
    occurred in a very difficult market, and demonstrates our
    commitment to maintaining a

moderate-to-low

risk profile. We anticipate further noncore CRE declines in
    future periods based on our overall strategy to reduce our
    overall CRE exposure.

Also as shown above, substantial reserves for the noncore
    portfolio have been established. At December 31, 2010, the
    ACL related to the noncore portfolio was 16.63%. The combination
    of the existing ACL and prior NCOs represents the total credit
    actions taken on each segment of the portfolio. From this data,
    we calculate a credit mark that provides a consistent
    measurement of the cumulative credit actions taken against a
    specific portfolio segment. We believe the combined credit
    activity is appropriate for each of the CRE segments.

Within the CRE portfolio, the retail properties and single
    family home builder classes continue to be stressed as a result
    of the continued decline in the housing markets and general
    economic conditions and are discussed below.

Retail
    Properties

Our portfolio of CRE loans secured by retail properties totaled
    $1.8 billion, or approximately 5% of total loans and
    leases, at December 31, 2010. Loans within this portfolio
    segment declined $0.4 billion, or 17%, from
    $2.1 billion at December 31, 2009. Credit approval in
    this portfolio segment is generally dependent on preleasing
    requirements, and net operating income from the project must
    cover debt service by specified percentages when the loan is
    fully funded.

The weakness of the economic environment in our geographic
    regions continued to impact the projects that secure the loans
    in this portfolio segment. Lower occupancy rates, reduced rental
    rates, and the expectation these levels will remain stressed for
    the foreseeable future may adversely affect some of our
    borrowers’ ability to repay these loans. We have increased
    the level of credit risk management activity on this portfolio
    segment, and we analyze our retail property loans in detail by
    combining property type, geographic location, and other data, to
    assess and manage our credit concentration risks. We review the
    majority of this portfolio segment on a monthly basis.

Single
    Family Home Builders

At December 31, 2010, we had $0.6 billion of CRE loans
    to single family home builders. Such loans represented 1% of
    total loans and leases. The $0.6 billion represented a
    $0.3 billion, or 35%, decrease compared with
    $0.9 billion at December 31, 2009. The decrease
    primarily reflected runoff activity as few new loans have been
    originated since 2008, property sale activity, and NCOs. Based
    on portfolio management processes over the past three years,
    including NCO activity, we believe we have substantially
    addressed the credit issues in this portfolio. We do not
    anticipate any future significant credit impact from this
    portfolio segment.

FRANKLIN
    RELATIONSHIP

In 2010, we sold our portfolio of Franklin-related loans to
    unrelated third parties. Also, we recorded $87.0 million of
    Franklin-related NCOs, of which $75.5 million related to
    the loan sales. The 2010 provision for credit losses included
    $87.0 million related to Franklin, with $75.5 million
    related to the loan sales. At December 31, 2010, the only
    Franklin-related nonperforming assets remaining were
    $9.5 million of OREO properties, which were marked to the
    lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell.

Consumer
    Credit

Consumer credit approvals are based on, among other factors, the
    financial strength and payment history of the borrower, type of
    exposure, and the transaction structure. Consumer credit
    decisions are generally made



in a centralized environment utilizing decision models.
    Importantly, certain individuals who understand each local
    region have the authority to make credit extension decisions to
    preserve our focus on the local communities we operate in. Each
    credit extension is assigned a specific

probability-of-default

and loss-given-default. The

probability-of-default

is generally based on the borrower’s most recent credit
    bureau score (FICO), which we update quarterly, while the
    loss-given-default is related to the type of collateral and the
    LTV ratio associated with the credit extension.

In consumer lending, credit risk is managed from a loan type and
    vintage performance analysis. All portfolio segments are
    continuously monitored for changes in delinquency trends and
    other asset quality indicators. We make extensive use of
    portfolio assessment models to continuously monitor the quality
    of the portfolio, which may result in changes to future
    origination strategies. The on-going analysis and review process
    results in a determination of an appropriate ALLL amount for our
    consumer loan portfolio. The independent risk management group
    has a consumer process review component to ensure the
    effectiveness and efficiency of the consumer credit processes.

Collection action is initiated as needed through a centrally
    managed collection and recovery function. The collection group
    employs a series of collection methodologies designed to
    maintain a high level of effectiveness while maximizing
    efficiency. In addition to the consumer loan portfolio, the
    collection group is responsible for collection activity on all
    sold and securitized consumer loans and leases.

AUTOMOBILE
    LOANS AND LEASES PORTFOLIO

The performance of the automobile loan and lease portfolio
    improved in 2010, despite the continued economic conditions that
    have adversely affected the residential mortgage and home equity
    portfolios

(discussed below).

Our strategy in the
    automobile loan and lease portfolio continued to focus on high
    quality borrowers as measured by both FICO and internal custom
    scores, combined with appropriate LTV’s, terms, and a
    reasonable level of profitability. This strategy resulted in a
    significant improvement in performance metrics in 2010 compared
    to 2009, and provides us with substantial confidence for future
    performance of this portfolio.

In 2010, we continued to consistently execute our value
    proposition and took advantage of market opportunities that
    allowed us to grow our automobile loan portfolio. The
    significant growth in the portfolio was accomplished while
    maintaining high credit quality metrics. As we further execute
    our strategies and take advantage of these opportunities, we are
    developing alternative plans to address any growth in excess of
    our established portfolio concentration limits, including both
    securitizations and loan sales. The automobile sales market
    expanded in 2010 and by entering into eastern Pennsylvania and
    five New England states, we are positioned to take advantage of
    a continued expansion in 2011.

Our strategy and operational capabilities allow us to
    appropriately manage the origination quality across the entire
    portfolio, including our newer markets. Although increased
    origination volume and the entering new markets can be
    associated with increased risk levels, we believe our strategy
    and operational capabilities significantly mitigate these risks.

RESIDENTIAL-SECURED
    PORTFOLIOS

The residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are
    primarily located throughout our footprint. The continued
    slowdown in the housing market negatively impacted the
    performance of our residential mortgage and home equity
    portfolios. While the degree of price depreciation varied across
    our markets, all regions throughout our footprint were affected.

Home
    Equity Portfolio

Our home equity portfolio (loans and

lines-of-credit)

consists of both first- and second- mortgage loans with
    underwriting criteria based on minimum credit scores,

debt-to-income

ratios, and LTV ratios. We offer closed-end home equity loans
    which are generally fixed-rate with principal and interest
    payments, and variable-rate interest-only home equity

lines-of-credit

which do not require payment of principal during the

10-year

revolving period of the

line-of-credit.

At December 31, 2010, approximately 40% of our home equity
    portfolio was secured by first-mortgage liens. The credit risk
    profile is substantially reduced when we hold a first-mortgage
    lien position. During 2010, more than 65% of our home equity
    portfolio originations were secured by a first-mortgage lien. We
    focus on high-quality borrowers primarily located within our
    footprint. The majority of our home equity

line-of-credit

borrowers consistently pay more than the required interest-only
    amount. Additionally, since we focus on developing complete
    relationships with our customers, many of our home equity
    borrowers are utilizing other products and services.

We believe we have underwritten credit conservatively within
    this portfolio. We have not originated “stated income”
    home equity loans or

lines-of-credit

that allow negative amortization. Also, we have not originated
    home equity loans or

lines-of-credit

with an LTV at origination greater than 100%, except for
    infrequent situations with high-quality borrowers. However,
    continued declines in housing prices have likely decreased the
    value of the collateral for this portfolio and it is likely some
    loans with an original LTV ratio of less than 100% currently
    have an LTV ratio greater than 100%.

For certain home equity loans and

lines-of-credit,

we may utilize an automated valuation model (AVM) or other
    model-driven value estimate during the credit underwriting
    process. We utilize a series of credit parameters to determine
    the appropriate valuation methodology. While we believe an AVM
    estimate is an appropriate valuation source for a portion of our
    home equity lending activities, we continue to re-evaluate all
    of our policies on an on-going basis. Regardless of the estimate
    methodology, we supplement our underwriting with a third party
    fraud detection system to limit our exposure to
    “flipping,” and outright fraudulent



transactions. We update values as we believe appropriate, and in
    compliance with applicable regulations, for loans identified as
    higher risk. Loans are identified as higher risk based on
    performance indicators and the updated values are utilized to
    facilitate our portfolio management, as well as our workout and
    loss mitigation functions.

We continue to make origination policy adjustments based on our
    assessment of an appropriate risk profile, as well as industry
    actions. In addition to origination policy adjustments, we take
    actions, as necessary, to manage the risk profile of this
    portfolio.

Residential
    Mortgages Portfolio

We focus on higher-quality borrowers and underwrite all
    applications centrally, often through the use of an automated
    underwriting system. We do not originate residential mortgage
    loans that allow negative amortization or allow the borrower
    multiple payment options.

All residential mortgage loans are originated based on a
    completed appraisal during the credit underwriting process.
    Additionally, we supplement our underwriting with a third party
    fraud detection system to limit our exposure to
    “flipping” and outright fraudulent transactions. We
    update values on a regular basis in compliance with applicable
    regulations to facilitate our portfolio management, as well as
    our workout and loss mitigation functions.

Also, it is important to note the recent issuance of new
    regulatory guidelines regarding real estate valuations, the
    intent of which is to ensure there is complete independence in
    the requesting and review of real estate valuations associated
    with loan decisions. We have been committed to appropriate
    valuations for all of our real estate lending, and do not
    anticipate significant impacts to our loan decision process as a
    result of these new guidelines.

Several government actions were enacted that impacted the
    residential mortgage portfolio, including various refinance
    programs which positively affected the availability of credit
    for the industry. We are utilizing these programs to enhance our
    existing strategies of working closely with our customers.

Credit
    Quality

We believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit
    quality performance for 2010 is through an analysis of credit
    quality performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of
    most of the discussion in the sections immediately following:
    NPAs and NALs, TDRs, ACL, and NCOs. In addition, we utilize
    delinquency rates, risk distribution and migration patterns, and
    product segmentation in the analysis of our credit quality
    performance.

Credit quality performance in 2010 improved significantly
    compared with 2009. While NCOs remain elevated compared with
    long-term expectations, 2010 continued to show improvement
    across the portfolio, and delinquency trends improved as well.
    OREO also declined significantly in 2010. We do not believe
    there will be a meaningful improvement in property values in the
    near term, and believe it prudent to dispose of the OREO
    properties instead of incurring the on-going expenses associated
    with maintaining the properties. As such, the decrease in the
    OREO balances resulted from an active selling strategy, as well
    as a lower level of inflows associated with residential
    properties due to our active loss mitigation and short-sale
    strategies.

The economic environment remained challenging. Yet, reflecting
    the benefit of our focused credit actions of 2009 and 2010, we
    experienced declines in total NPAs, new NPAs, and commercial
    Criticized loans. Our ACL declined $240.2 million to
    $1,291.1 million, or 3.39% of period-end loans and leases
    from $1,531.4 million, or 4.16% at 2009. Importantly, our
    ACL as a percent of period-end NALs increased to 166% from 80%,
    and coverage ratios associated with NPAs and Criticized assets
    also increased. These improved coverage ratios indicated a
    strengthening of our reserve position relative to troubled
    assets from the prior year end. These coverage ratios are a key
    component of our internal adequacy assessment process and
    provide an important consideration in the determination of the
    adequacy of the ACL.



NPAs,
    NALs, AND TDRs

(This
    section should be read in conjunction with Significant
    Item 3.)

NPAs
    AND NALs

NPAs consist of (1) NALs, which represent loans and leases
    no longer accruing interest, (2) impaired loans held for
    sale, (3) OREO properties, and (4) other NPAs. A
    C&I or CRE loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status
    when collection of principal or interest is in doubt or when the
    loan is

90-days

past
    due. Residential mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual status
    at

180-days

past due, and a charge-off recorded if it is determined that
    insufficient equity exists in the collateral property to support
    the entire outstanding loan amount. A home equity loan is placed
    on nonaccrual status at

180-days

past due, and a charge-off recorded if it is determined there is
    not sufficient equity in the collateral property to cover our
    position. For loans secured by residential real estate, the
    collateral equity position is determined by a current property
    valuation based on an expected marketing time period consistent
    with the market. When interest accruals are suspended, accrued
    interest income is reversed with current year accruals charged
    to earnings and prior-year amounts generally charged-off as a
    credit loss. When, in our judgment, the borrower’s ability
    to make required interest and principal payments has resumed and
    collectability is no longer in doubt, the loan or lease is
    returned to accrual status.

Table 20 reflects period-end NALs and NPAs detail for each of
    the last five years. Table 21 details the Franklin-related
    impacts to NALs and NPAs for each of the last five years. There
    were no Franklin-related NALs or NPAs at December 31, 2006.

NALs were $777.9 million at December 31, 2010,
    compared with $1,917.0 million at December 31, 2009.
    The decrease of $1,139.0 million primarily reflected:

•

$572.1 million decrease in CRE NALs, primarily reflecting
    both NCO activity and problem loan resolutions including
    borrower payments and pay-offs. Payments and pay-offs received
    were substantial and are a direct result of our commitment to
    the on-going proactive management of these problem loans by our
    SAD. Also, inflow levels were significantly lower in 2010
    compared to 2009. The level of inflows, or migration, is an
    important indicator of the future trend for this portfolio.

•

$317.6 million decrease in residential mortgage NALs,
    primarily reflecting the Franklin-related loan sales in 2010.

•

$231.7 million decrease in C&I NALs, primarily
    reflecting both NCO activity and problem loan resolutions,
    including pay-offs. The decline was associated with loans
    throughout our footprint, with no specific geographic or
    industry concentration.

•

$17.6 million decrease in home equity NALs, primarily
    reflecting the Franklin-related loans sales in 2010.

Also, of the $710.4 million of CRE and C&I-related
    NALs at December 31, 2010, $183.4 million, or 26%,
    represented loans that were less than 30 days past due,
    demonstrating our commitment to proactive credit risk management.

NPAs, which include NALs, were $844.8 million at
    December 31, 2010, and represented 2.21% of related assets.
    This compared with $2,058.1 million, or 5.57%, at
    December 31, 2009. The $1,213.3 million decrease
    reflected:

•

$1,139.0 million decrease to NALs, discussed above.

•

$73.3 million decrease to OREO. This reflected a focused
    effort to reduce our level of OREO properties through active
    selling strategies during the year, as well as lower levels of
    new OREO properties resulting from an increase in loss
    mitigation activity and short sales prior to foreclosure. We do
    not believe there will be a meaningful improvement in property
    values in the near term, and believe it prudent to dispose of
    the property instead of incurring the on-going expenses
    associated with maintaining the property.

NPA activity for each of the past five years was as follows:

The activity above excludes the 2007 impact of the placement of
    the loans to Franklin on nonaccrual status and their return to
    accrual status upon the restructuring of these loans. At
    2007 year-end, the loans to



Franklin were not included in the nonperforming assets total. At
    2008 year-end, the loans to Franklin were reported as
    nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans. At
    2009 year-end, nonaccrual Franklin loans were reported as
    residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, and other real
    estate owned. The 2009 impact primarily reflects loan and lease
    losses, as well as payments.

TDR
    Loans

TDRs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a
    borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Loan modifications
    are considered TDRs when the concession provided is not
    available to the borrower through either normal channels or
    other sources. However, not all loan modifications are TDRs. Our
    standards relating to loan modifications consider, among other
    factors, minimum verified income requirements, cash flow
    analysis, and collateral valuations. However, each potential
    loan modification is reviewed individually and the terms of the
    loan are modified to meet a borrower’s specific
    circumstances at a point in time. All loan modifications,
    including those classified as TDRs, are reviewed and approved.
    Our ALLL is largely driven by updated risk ratings to commercial
    loans, updated borrower credit scores on consumer loans, and
    borrower delinquency history in both the commercial and consumer
    loan portfolios. As such, the provision for credit losses is
    impacted primarily by changes in borrower payment performance
    rather than the TDR classification.

TDRs can be classified as either accrual or nonaccrual loans.
    Nonaccrual TDRs are included in NALs whereas accruing TDRs are
    excluded because the borrower remains contractually current. The
    table below provides a summary of our TDRs (both accrual and
    nonaccrual) by loan type at December 31, 2010 and 2009:

In the workout of a problem loan, there are many factors
    considered when determining the most favorable resolution. For
    consumer loans, we evaluate the ability and willingness of the
    borrower to make contractual or reduced payments, the value of
    the underlying collateral, and the costs associated with the
    foreclosure or repossession, and remarketing of the collateral.
    For commercial loans, we consider similar criteria and also
    evaluate the borrower’s business prospects.

Residential Mortgage loan TDRs

—
    Residential mortgage TDRs represent loan modifications
    associated with traditional first-lien mortgage loans in which a
    concession has been provided to the borrower. Residential
    mortgages identified as TDRs involve borrowers who are unable to
    refinance their mortgages through our normal mortgage
    origination channels or through other independent sources. Some,
    but not all, of the loans may be delinquent. Modifications can
    include adjustments to rates

and/or

principal. Modified loans identified as TDRs are aggregated into
    pools for analysis. Cash flows and weighted average interest
    rates are used to calculate impairment at the pooled-loan level.
    Once the loans are aggregated into the pool, they continue to be



classified as TDRs until contractually repaid or charged-off. No
    consideration is given to removing individual loans from the
    pools.

Residential mortgage loans not guaranteed by a
    U.S. government agency such as the FHA, VA, and the USDA,
    including restructured loans, are reported as accrual or
    nonaccrual based upon delinquency status. NALs are those that
    are greater than 180 days contractually past due. Loans
    guaranteed by U.S. government organizations continue to
    accrue interest upon delinquency.

Residential mortgage loan TDR classifications resulted in an
    impairment adjustment of $6.6 million in 2010. Prior to the
    TDR classification, residential mortgage loans individually had
    minimal ALLL associated with them because the ALLL is calculated
    on a total portfolio pooled basis.

Other Consumer loan TDRs

— Generally,
    these are TDRs associated with home equity borrowings and
    automobile loans. We make similar interest rate, term, and
    principal concessions as with residential mortgage loan TDRs.
    The TDR classification for these other consumer loans resulted
    in an impairment adjustment of $1.3 million in 2010.

Commercial loan TDRs

— Commercial
    accruing TDRs represent loans in which a loan rated as
    Classified is current on contractual principal and interest but
    undergoes a loan modification. Accruing TDRs often result from
    loans rated as Classified receiving an extension on the maturity
    of their loan, for example, to allow additional time for the
    sale or lease of underlying CRE collateral. Often, it is prudent
    to extend the maturity rather than foreclose on a commercial
    loan, particularly for borrowers who are generating cash flows
    to support contractual interest payments. These borrowers cannot
    obtain the modified loan through other independent sources
    because of their current financial circumstances, therefore a
    concession is provided and the modification is classified as a
    TDR. The TDR remains in accruing status as long as the customer
    is current on payments and no loss is probable.

Commercial nonaccrual TDRs result from either workouts where an
    existing commercial NAL is restructured into multiple new loans,
    or from an accruing commercial TDR being placed on nonaccrual
    status. At December 31, 2010, approximately
    $19.9 million of our commercial nonaccrual TDRs resulted
    from such workouts. The remaining $12.0 million represented
    the reclassifications of accruing TDRs to NALs.

For certain loan workouts, we create two or more new notes. The
    senior note is underwritten based upon our normal underwriting
    standards at current market rates and is sized so projected cash
    flows are sufficient to repay contractual principal and
    interest. The terms on the subordinate note(s) vary by
    situation, but often defer interest payments until after the
    senior note is repaid. Creating two or more notes often allows
    the borrower to continue a project or weather a temporary
    economic downturn and allows us to right-size a loan based upon
    the current expectations for a project performance. The senior
    note is considered for return to accrual status if the borrower
    has sustained sufficient cash flows for a six-month period of
    time and we believe no loss is probable. This six-month period
    could extend before or after the restructure date. Subordinated
    notes created in the workout are charged-off immediately. Any
    interest or principal payments received on the subordinated
    notes are applied to the principal of the senior note first
    until the senior note is repaid. Further payments are recorded
    as recoveries on the subordinated note.

As the loans are already considered Classified, an adequate ALLL
    has been recorded when appropriate. Consequently, a TDR
    classification on commercial loans does not usually result in
    significant additional reserves. We consider removing the TDR
    status on commercial loans if the loan is at a market rate of
    interest and after the loan has performed in accordance with the
    restructured terms for a sustained period of time, generally one
    year.

    due loans and leases detail for each of the last five years:

Franklin loans were reported as commercial accruing restructured
    loans at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008,
    Franklin loans were reported as nonaccrual commercial and
    industrial loans. At December 31, 2009, nonaccrual Franklin
    loans were reported as residential mortgage loans, home equity
    loans, and other real estate owned.

The over

90-day

delinquency ratio for total loans not guaranteed by a
    U.S. government agency was 0.23% at December 31, 2010,
    representing a 17 basis point decline compared with
    December 31, 2009. This decrease primarily reflected
    continued improvement in our core performance, as well as the
    impact of the sale of certain underperforming loans in 2010.

The increase in accruing TDRs primarily reflects our loss
    mitigation efforts to proactively work with borrowers having
    difficulty making their payments.



ACL

(This section should be read in conjunction with Significant
    Item 3, and Notes 1 and 6 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.)

We maintain two reserves, both of which in our judgment are
    adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease
    portfolio: the ALLL and the AULC. Combined, these reserves
    comprise the total ACL. Our credit administration group is
    responsible for developing the methodology assumptions and
    estimates used in the calculation, as well as determining the
    adequacy of the ACL. The ALLL represents the estimate of
    probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the reported
    date. Additions to the ALLL result from recording provision
    expense for loan losses or increased risk levels resulting from
    loan risk-rating downgrades, while reductions reflect
    charge-offs, recoveries, decreased risk levels resulting from
    loan risk-rating upgrades, or the sale of loans. The AULC is
    determined by applying the transaction reserve process to the
    unfunded portion of the loan exposures adjusted by an applicable
    funding expectation.

A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the ACL to
    the level we have determined to be adequate to absorb credit
    losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio. The provision
    for credit losses in 2010 was $634.5 million, compared with
    $2,074.7 million in 2009, primarily reflecting
    significantly lower NCOs in 2010 compared with 2009, and
    improved credit quality metrics. While credit quality metrics
    have significantly improved during 2010, provision expense since
    2007 has been higher than historical levels, reflecting the
    pronounced downturn in the U.S. economy, as well as
    significant deterioration in the residential real estate market
    that began in early 2007. Declining real estate valuations and
    higher levels of delinquencies and NCOs have negatively affected
    the quality of our loans secured by real estate. Portions of the
    residential portfolio, as well as the single family home builder
    and developer loans in the commercial portfolio, experienced the
    majority of the credit issues related to the residential real
    estate market.

We regularly assess the adequacy of the ACL by performing
    on-going evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio, including
    such factors as the differing economic risks associated with
    each loan category, the financial condition of specific
    borrowers, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any
    collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any
    guarantees or other documented support. We evaluate the impact
    of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on
    the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations
    when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the
    adequacy of our ACL at each reporting date. In addition to
    general economic conditions and the other factors described
    above, we also consider the impact of declining residential real
    estate values and the diversification of CRE loans, particularly
    loans secured by retail properties.

Our ACL assessment process includes the on-going assessment of
    credit quality metrics, and a comparison of certain ACL adequacy
    benchmarks to current performance. While the total ACL balance
    declined in 2010 compared with 2009, all of the relevant
    benchmarks improved as a result of the asset quality
    improvement. The coverage ratios of NALs, Criticized and
    Classified loans all showed significant improvement in 2010
    despite the decline in the ACL level.

Table 25 reflects activity in the ALLL and ACL for each of the
    last five years. Table 26 displays the Franklin-related impacts
    to the ALLL and ACL for each of the last five years. There were
    not any Franklin-related impacts to either the ALLL or ACL at
    December 31, 2010 or 2006.

The reduction in the ACL, compared with December 31, 2009,
    reflected a decline in the commercial portfolio ALLL as a result
    of NCOs on loans with specific reserves, and an overall
    reduction in the level of commercial Criticized loans.
    Commercial Criticized loans are commercial loans rated as OLEM,
    Substandard, Doubtful, or Loss

(refer to the Commercial
    Credit section for additional information regarding loan risk
    ratings).

As shown in the table below, commercial Criticized
    loans declined $1.9 billion, or 38%, from December 31,
    2009, reflecting upgrade and payment activity.

Compared with December 31, 2009, the AULC declined
    $6.8 million as a result of a substantive reduction in the
    level of unfunded loan commitments in the commercial portfolio.
    A concerted effort was made to reduce potential exposure
    associated with unfunded lines and to generate an appropriate
    level of return on those that remain in place. In addition,
    borrowers continued to reassess their borrowing needs and
    reduced their desired funding capacity.

The ACL coverage ratio associated with NALs was 166% at
    December 31, 2010, representing a significant improvement
    compared with 80% at December 31, 2009. This improvement
    reflected substantial reductions in C&I and CRE NALs.

Although credit quality asset metrics and trends, including
    those mentioned above, improved during 2010, the economic
    environment in our markets remained weak and uncertain as
    reflected by continued stressed residential values, continued
    weakness in industrial employment in northern Ohio and southeast
    Michigan, and the significant subjectivity involved in
    commercial real estate valuations for properties located in
    areas with limited sale or refinance activities. Residential
    real estate values continued to be negatively impacted by high
    unemployment, increased foreclosure activity, and the
    elimination of home-buyer tax credits. In the near-term, we
    believe these factors will result in continued stress in our
    portfolios secured by residential real estate and an elevated
    level of NCOs compared to historic levels. During 2010, the
    inflows of both new commercial Criticized loans and new NPAs
    declined significantly compared with 2009 levels, however both
    have shown volatility during 2010. In the 2010 third quarter,
    inflows of both new commercial Criticized loans and NPAs
    increased compared to the prior quarter. Although both of these
    levels declined in the 2010 fourth quarter from the 2010 third
    quarter, we believe this volatility evidences a fragile economic
    environment. Further, concerns continue to exist regarding the
    economic conditions in both national and international markets,
    the state of financial and credit markets, the unemployment
    rate, the impact of the Federal Reserve monetary policy, and
    continued uncertainty regarding federal, state, and local
    government budget deficits. We do not anticipate any meaningful
    change in the overall economy in the near-term. All of these
    factors are impacting consumer confidence, as well as business
    investments and acquisitions. Given the combination of these
    factors, we believe that our ACL coverage levels are appropriate.



The table below reflects the allocation of our ACL among our
    various loan categories during each of the past five years:

2007 includes charge-offs totaling $397.0 million
    associated with the Franklin restructuring. These charge-offs
    were reduced by the unamortized discount associated with the
    loans, and by other amounts received by Franklin totaling
    $88.5 million, resulting in net charge-offs of
    $308.5 million.

In assessing NCO trends, it is helpful to understand the process
    of how loans are treated as they deteriorate over time. Reserves
    for loans are established at origination consistent with the
    level of risk



associated with the original underwriting. If the quality of a
    loan subsequently deteriorates, it migrates to a lower quality
    risk rating through our on-going portfolio management process,
    and a higher reserve amount is assigned. As a part of our
    on-going portfolio management process for commercial loans, the
    loan is reviewed and reserves are increased or decreased as
    warranted. Charge-offs, if necessary, are generally recognized
    in a period after the reserves were established. If the
    previously established reserves exceed that needed to
    satisfactorily resolve the problem loan, a reduction in the
    overall level of the reserve could be recognized. In summary, if
    loan quality deteriorates, the typical credit sequence is
    periods of reserve building, followed by periods of higher NCOs
    as previously established reserves are utilized. Additionally,
    increases in reserves either precede or are in conjunction with
    increases in NALs. When a loan is classified as NAL, it is
    evaluated for specific reserves or charge-off. As a result, an
    increase in NALs may not necessarily result in an increase in
    reserves or an expectation of higher future NCOs.

The significant $602.1 million decline in total NCOs
    reflected a combination of some economic stabilization, as well
    as the proactive credit management practices begun in 2009.
    These practices continued in 2010, and remain on-going.

The $113.1 million decrease in non-Franklin-related
    C&I NCOs reflected improvement in the overall credit
    quality of the portfolio compared with 2009.

The $407.2 million decrease in CRE NCOs primarily reflected
    our proactive credit management practices begun in 2009. These
    practices continued in 2010, and remain on-going.

The $29.8 million decline in automobile loans and leases
    reflected our consistent high quality of originations since the
    beginning of 2008. The focus on origination quality has been the
    primary driver for the improvement in this portfolio compared
    with the 2009. We believe the quality of the loans originated in
    2010 will result in industry-standard levels of NCOs going
    forward as well.

Non-Franklin-related home equity NCOs increased
    $12.2 million reflecting the continuing stress to our
    borrowers associated with the fragile economy and the
    significant reduction of collateral equity since 2006.
    Delinquencies continued to be driven by lower income resulting
    from job loss or reduced revenues for borrowers that are
    self-employed. Frequently, first-lien loans can be refinanced,
    however, there are limited financing options for second-lien
    loans, particularly in situations when the collateral equity has
    lost value. While we charge-off loans in these situations, we
    generally do not forgive the debt, resulting in longer-term
    opportunities for recoveries. Although 2010 NCOs were higher
    compared with 2009, early-stage delinquency levels in the home
    equity

line-of-credit

portfolio declined, supporting our longer-term positive view for
    the performance of the home equity portfolio. We have been
    successful in originating new loans to higher quality borrowers,
    as evidenced by our 2010 home equity

line-of-credit

originations were 100% current as of December 31, 2010.

Non-Franklin-related residential mortgage NCOs declined
    $27.0 million. This decline reflected a $48.1 million
    sale of certain underperforming residential mortgage loans in
    2010 that resulted in $16.4 million of NCOs, compared with
    a 2009 sale of $44.8 million of similar loans resulting in
    $17.6 million of NCOs. The remaining decrease in the
    non-Franklin-related residential mortgage NCOs compared with the
    prior year primarily reflected a combination of a general
    stabilization of home prices, as well as an increase in active
    loss mitigation activity. The 2010 loan sale resulted in the
    elimination of loans with potential future credit losses and
    foreclosure expenses. As we believe there will be no meaningful
    improvement in home prices in the foreseeable future, the
    selective reduction of underperforming loans is consistent with
    our

moderate-to-low

risk profile strategy.

AND OTHER SECURITIES PORTFOLIO

(This section should be read in conjunction with the Critical
    Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates discussion,
    and Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.)

Our

available-for-sale

and other securities portfolio is evaluated under established
    asset/liability management objectives. Changing market
    conditions could affect the profitability of the portfolio, as
    well as the level of interest rate risk exposure.



Our

available-for-sale

and other securities portfolio is comprised of various financial
    instruments. At December 31, 2010, our

available-for-sale

and other securities portfolio totaled $9.9 billion, an
    increase of $1.3 billion from 2009. The duration of the
    portfolio increased by 0.6 years as a result of the
    purchase of additional structured mortgage, municipal and
    corporate debt securities. Municipal securities comprise 4.5% of
    the portfolio and consist primarily of general obligation and
    revenue bonds for essential services from 18 different states.
    The composition and maturity of the portfolio is presented on
    the following two tables.

Weighted average yields were calculated using amortized cost on
    a fully-taxable equivalent basis, assuming a 35% tax rate.

Declines in the fair value of

available-for-sale

and other securities are recorded as temporary impairment,
    noncredit OTTI, or credit OTTI adjustments.

Temporary impairment adjustments are recorded when the fair
    value of a security declines below its historical cost.
    Temporary impairment adjustments are recorded in OCI, and reduce
    equity. Temporary impairment adjustments do not impact net
    income or risk-based capital. A recovery of

available-for-sale

security prices also is recorded as an adjustment to OCI for
    securities that were previously temporarily impaired and results
    in an increase to equity.

Because the

available-for-sale

and other securities portfolio is recorded at fair value, the
    determination that a security’s decline in value is

other-than-temporary

does not significantly impact equity, as the amount of any of
    temporary adjustment has already been reflected in OCI. A
    recovery in the value of an

other-than-temporarily

impaired security is recorded as additional interest income over
    the remaining life of the security.

During 2010, we recorded $13.7 million of credit OTTI
    losses. This amount was comprised of $4.9 million related
    to pooled-trust-preferred securities, $7.1 million related
    to CMO securities, and $1.6 million related to Alt-A
    securities. Given the continued disruption in the housing and
    financial markets, we may be required to recognize additional
    credit OTTI losses in future periods with respect to our

available-for-sale

and other securities portfolio. The amount and timing of any
    additional credit OTTI will depend on the decline in the



underlying cash flows of the securities. If our intent to hold
    temporarily impaired securities changes in future periods, we
    may be required to recognize noncredit OTTI through income,
    which will negatively impact earnings.

Alt-A,
    Pooled-Trust-Preferred, and Private-Label CMO
    Securities

Our three highest risk segments of our investment portfolio are
    the Alt-A mortgage backed, pooled-trust-preferred, and
    private-label CMO portfolios. The Alt-A mortgage-backed
    securities and pooled-trust-preferred securities are located
    within the asset-backed securities portfolio. The performance of
    the underlying securities in each of these segments continued to
    reflect the stressed economic environment. Each of these
    securities in these three segments is subjected to a rigorous
    review of their projected cash flows. These reviews are
    supported with analysis from independent third parties.

(See
    the Investment Securities section located within the Critical
    Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates section for
    additional information).

Credit ratings reflect the lowest current rating assigned by a

Negative changes to the above credit ratings would generally
    result in an increase of our risk-weighted assets, which could
    result in a reduction to our regulatory capital ratios.

Market
    Risk

Market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market
    values of assets and liabilities. We incur market risk in the
    normal course of business through exposures to market interest
    rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, credit spreads,
    and expected lease residual values. We have identified two
    primary sources of market risk: interest rate risk and price
    risk.

Interest
    Rate Risk

OVERVIEW

Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings and value arising
    from changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk arises
    from timing differences in the repricings and maturities of
    interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities
    (reprice risk), changes in the expected maturities of assets and
    liabilities arising from



embedded options, such as borrowers’ ability to prepay
    residential mortgage loans at any time and depositors’
    ability to redeem certificates of deposit before maturity
    (option risk), changes in the shape of the yield curve where
    interest rates increase or decrease in a non-parallel fashion
    (yield curve risk), and changes in spread relationships between
    different yield curves, such as U.S. Treasuries and LIBOR
    (basis risk).

Our board of directors establishes broad policy limits with
    respect to interest rate risk. ALCO establishes specific
    operating guidelines within the parameters of the board of
    directors’ policies. In general, we seek to minimize the
    impact of changing interest rates on net interest income and the
    economic values of assets and liabilities. Our ALCO regularly
    monitors the level of interest rate risk sensitivity to ensure
    compliance with the board of directors’ approved risk
    limits.

Interest rate risk management is an active process that
    encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by
    investment and funding activities. Effective management of
    interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic
    characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the
    appropriate interest rate risk posture given business segment
    forecasts, management objectives, market expectations, and
    policy constraints.

An asset sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position
    in which an increase in short-term interest rates is expected to
    generate higher net interest income, as rates earned on our
    interest-earning assets would reprice upward more quickly than
    rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, thus expanding
    our net interest margin. Conversely, a liability sensitive
    position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase
    in short-term interest rates is expected to generate lower net
    interest income, as rates paid on our interest-bearing
    liabilities would reprice upward more quickly than rates earned
    on our interest-earning assets, thus compressing our net
    interest margin.

INCOME
    SIMULATION AND ECONOMIC VALUE ANALYSIS

Interest rate risk measurement is performed monthly. Two broad
    approaches to modeling interest rate risk are employed: income
    simulation and economic value analysis. An income simulation
    analysis is used to measure the sensitivity of forecasted net
    interest income to changes in market rates over a one-year time
    period. Although bank owned life insurance, automobile operating
    lease assets, and excess cash balances held at the Federal
    Reserve Bank are classified as noninterest earning assets, and
    the net revenue from these assets is recorded in noninterest
    income and noninterest expense, these portfolios are included in
    the interest sensitivity analysis because they have attributes
    similar to interest-earning assets. EVE analysis is used to
    measure the sensitivity of the values of period-end assets and
    liabilities to changes in market interest rates. EVE analysis
    serves as a complement to income simulation modeling as it
    provides risk exposure estimates for time periods beyond the
    one-year simulation period.

The models used for these measurements take into account
    prepayment speeds on mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities,
    and consumer installment loans, as well as cash flows of other
    assets and liabilities. Balance sheet growth assumptions are
    also considered in the income simulation model. The models
    include the effects of derivatives, such as interest rate swaps,
    caps, floors, and other types of interest rate options.

The baseline scenario for income simulation analysis, with which
    all other scenarios are compared, is based on market interest
    rates implied by the prevailing yield curve as of the
    period-end. Alternative interest rate scenarios are then
    compared with the baseline scenario. These alternative interest
    rate scenarios include parallel rate shifts on both a gradual
    and an immediate basis, movements in interest rates that alter
    the shape of the yield curve (e.g., flatter or steeper yield
    curve), and no changes in current interest rates remaining
    unchanged for the entire measurement period. Scenarios are also
    developed to measure short-term repricing risks, such as the
    impact of LIBOR-based interest rates rising or falling faster
    than the prime rate.

The simulations for evaluating short-term interest rate risk
    exposure are scenarios that model gradual +/-100 and
    +/-200 basis points parallel shifts in market interest
    rates over the next one-year period beyond the interest rate
    change implied by the current yield curve. We assumed market
    interest rates would not fall below 0% over the next one-year
    period for the scenarios that used the -100 and -200 basis
    points parallel shift in



market interest rates. The table below shows the results of the
    scenarios as of December 31, 2010, and December 31,
    2009. All of the positions were within the board of
    directors’ policy limits.

The net interest income at risk reported as of December 31,
    2010 for the +200 basis points scenario shows a change to a
    neutral near-term interest rate risk position compared with
    December 31, 2009. The primary factors contributing to this
    change are the decline in market interest rates over the course
    of 2010 along with growth in deposits and net free funds, offset
    by increases in fixed-rate loans and securities and updated
    model assumptions.

The following table shows the income sensitivity of select
    portfolios to changes in market interest rates. A portfolio with
    100% sensitivity would indicate that interest income and expense
    will change with the same magnitude and direction as interest
    rates. A portfolio with 0% sensitivity is insensitive to changes
    in interest rates. For the +200 basis points scenario,
    total interest sensitive income is 34.6% sensitive to changes in
    market interest rates, while total interest sensitive expense is
    43.8% sensitive to changes in market interest rates. However,
    net interest income at risk for the +200 basis points
    scenario has a neutral near-term interest rate risk position
    because of the larger base of total interest sensitive income
    relative to total interest sensitive expense.

The EVE at risk reported as of December 31, 2010 for the
    +200 basis points scenario shows a change to a slightly
    lower long-term liability sensitive position compared with
    December 31, 2009. The primary factors contributing to the
    change are the decline in market interest rates over the course
    of 2010 along with growth in deposits and net free funds, offset
    by increases in fixed-rate loans, securities, and interest rate
    swaps used for asset-liability management purposes.

The following table shows the economic value sensitivity of
    select portfolios to changes in market interest rates. The
    change in economic value for each portfolio is measured as the
    percent change from the base economic value for that portfolio.
    For the +200 basis points scenario, total net tangible
    assets decreased in value 3.4% to changes in market interest
    rates, while total net tangible liabilities increased in value
    2.5% to changes in market interest rates. EVE at risk for the
    +200 basis points scenario is liability sensitive because
    of the decrease in economic value of total net tangible assets,
    which reduces the EVE, and the increase in economic value of
    total net tangible liabilities, which also reduces the EVE.

MSR

(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 5
    of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)

At December 31, 2010, we had a total of $196.2 million
    of capitalized MSRs representing the right to service
    $15.9 billion in mortgage loans. Of this
    $196.2 million, $125.7 million was recorded using the
    fair value method, and $70.5 million was recorded using the
    amortization method. If we actively engage in hedging, the MSR
    asset is carried at fair value.

MSR fair values are very sensitive to movements in interest
    rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the
    projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying
    loans, which can be greatly reduced by prepayments. Prepayments
    usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and
    decrease when mortgage interest rates rise. We have employed
    strategies to reduce the risk of MSR fair value changes or



impairment. In addition, we engage a third party to provide
    valuation tools and assistance with our strategies with the
    objective to decrease the volatility from MSR fair value
    changes. However, volatile changes in interest rates can
    diminish the effectiveness of these hedges. We typically report
    MSR fair value adjustments net of hedge-related trading activity
    in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income.
    Changes in fair value between reporting dates are recorded as an
    increase or a decrease in mortgage banking income.

MSRs recorded using the amortization method generally relate to
    loans originated with historically low interest rates, resulting
    in a lower probability of prepayments and, ultimately,
    impairment. MSR assets are included in other assets and
    presented in Table 12.

Price
    Risk

Price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse
    movements in the prices of financial instruments that are
    carried at fair value and subject to fair value accounting. We
    have price risk from trading securities, securities owned by our
    broker-dealer subsidiaries, foreign exchange positions, equity
    investments, investments in mortgage-backed securities, and
    marketable equity securities held by our insurance subsidiaries.
    We have established loss limits on the trading portfolio, the
    amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained, and
    the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held by
    the insurance subsidiaries.

Liquidity
    Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk of loss due to the possibility that
    funds may not be available to satisfy current or future
    commitments resulting from external macro market issues,
    investor and customer perception of financial strength, and
    events unrelated to us, such as war, terrorism, or financial
    institution market specific issues. We manage liquidity risk at
    both the Bank and the parent company.

The overall objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure
    that we can obtain cost-effective funding to meet current and
    future obligations, and can maintain sufficient levels of
    on-hand liquidity, under both normal business as usual and
    unanticipated stressed circumstances. The ALCO was appointed by
    our Board Risk Oversight Committee to oversee liquidity risk
    management and establish policies and limits based upon analyses
    of the ratio of loans to deposits, liquid asset coverage ratios,
    the percentage of assets funded with noncore or wholesale
    funding, net cash capital, liquid assets, and emergency
    borrowing capacity. In addition, operating guidelines are
    established to ensure that bank loans included in the business
    segments are funded with core deposits. These operating
    guidelines also ensure diversification of noncore funding by
    type, source, and maturity and provide sufficient liquidity to
    cover 100% of wholesale funds maturing within a six-month
    period. A contingency funding plan is in place, which includes
    forecasted sources and uses of funds under various scenarios in
    order to prepare for unexpected liquidity shortages, including
    the implications of any credit rating changes and / or
    other trigger events related to financial ratios, deposit
    fluctuations, debt issuance capacity, stock performance, or
    negative news related to us or the banking industry. Liquidity
    risk is reviewed monthly for the Bank and the parent company, as
    well as its subsidiaries. In addition, liquidity working groups
    meet regularly to identify and monitor liquidity positions,
    provide policy guidance, review funding strategies, and oversee
    the adherence to, and maintenance of, the contingency funding
    plans. A Contingency Funding Working Group monitors daily cash
    flow trends, branch activity, unfunded commitments, significant
    transactions, and parent company subsidiary sources and uses of
    funds in order to identify areas of concern and establish
    specific funding strategies. This group works closely with the
    ALCO and our communication team in order to identify issues that
    may require a more proactive communication plan to shareholders,
    employees, and customers regarding specific events or issues
    that could have an impact on our liquidity position.

In the normal course of business, in order to better manage
    liquidity risk, we perform stress tests to determine the effect
    that a potential downgrade in our credit ratings or other market
    disruptions could have on liquidity over various time periods.
    These credit ratings have a direct impact on our cost of funds
    and ability to raise funds under normal, as well as adverse,
    circumstances. The results of these stress tests indicate that
    at December 31, 2010, sufficient sources of funds were
    available to meet our financial obligations and fund our
    operations for 2011. The stress test scenarios include testing
    to determine the impact of an interruption to our access to the
    national markets for funding, a significant run-off in core
    deposits and liquidity triggers inherent



in other financial agreements. To compensate for the effect of
    these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative
    sources of liquidity over different time periods to project how
    funding needs would be managed. The specific alternatives for
    enhancing liquidity include generating client deposits,
    securitizing or selling loans, selling or maturing of
    securities, and extending the level or maturity of wholesale
    borrowings.

Most credit markets in which we participate and rely upon as
    sources of funding were significantly disrupted in mid-2007
    through 2009 with an improving trend during 2010. Throughout
    2008 and 2009, we strengthened our liquidity position by
    significantly reducing noncore funds and wholesale borrowings,
    increasing liquid assets, and shifting from a net purchaser of
    overnight federal funds to holding an excess reserve position at
    the Federal Reserve Bank. The percentage of assets funded with
    noncore or wholesale funding declined to 16% by the end of 2010
    from 25% at 2008 year-end. During 2010, the economy
    continued to stabilize and financial credit spreads tightened,
    resulting in a more liquid secondary market for our debt. In
    addition, all three major rating agencies upgraded both the
    Bank’s and the parent company’s credit ratings and /or
    outlook resulting in a significantly lower rate on the
    $300.0 million of subordinated debt issued in December of
    2010.

Bank
    Liquidity and Sources of Liquidity

Our primary sources of funding for the Bank are retail and
    commercial core deposits. As of December 31, 2010, these
    core deposits funded 73% of total assets. At December 31,
    2010, total core deposits represented 93% of total deposits, an
    increase from 92% at the prior year-end.

Core deposits are comprised of interest-bearing and
    noninterest-bearing demand deposits, money market deposits,
    savings and other domestic deposits, consumer certificates of
    deposit both over and under $250,000, and nonconsumer
    certificates of deposit less than $250,000. Noncore deposits
    consist of brokered money market deposits and certificates of
    deposit, foreign time deposits, and other domestic deposits of
    $250,000 or more comprised primarily of public fund certificates
    of deposit more than $250,000.

Core deposits may increase our need for liquidity as
    certificates of deposit mature or are withdrawn before maturity
    and as nonmaturity deposits, such as checking and savings
    account balances, are withdrawn. We voluntarily began
    participating in the FDIC’s TAGP in October of 2008. Under
    this program, all noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing
    transaction accounts with a rate of less than 0.50% were fully
    guaranteed by the FDIC for a customer’s entire account
    balance.

In April of 2010, the FDIC adopted an interim rule extending the
    TAGP through December 31, 2010, for financial institutions
    that desired to continue participating in the TAGP. On
    April 30, 2010, we notified the FDIC of our decision to
    opt-out of the TAGP extension effective July 1, 2010.

Demand deposit overdrafts that have been reclassified as loan
    balances were $13.1 million and $40.4 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Other domestic time deposits of $250,000 or more and brokered
    deposits and negotiable CDs totaled $2.2 billion at the end
    of 2010 and $2.7 billion at the end of 2009. The
    contractual maturities of these deposits at December 31,
    2010, were as follows: $0.8 billion in three months or
    less, $0.3 billion in three months through six months,
    $0.5 billion in six months through twelve months, and
    $0.6 billion after twelve months.

To the extent we are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity
    through core deposits, we may meet our liquidity needs through
    wholesale funding. These sources include other domestic deposits
    of $250,000 or more, brokered deposits and negotiable CDs,
    deposits in foreign offices, short-term borrowings, FHLB
    advances, other long-term debt, and subordinated notes. At
    December 31, 2010, total wholesale funding was
    $8.4 billion, an increase from $7.8 billion at
    December 31, 2009. The $8.4 billion portfolio at
    December 31, 2010, had a weighted average maturity of
    4.2 years.

The Bank has access to the Federal Reserve Bank’s discount
    window. These borrowings are secured by commercial loans and
    home equity

lines-of-credit.

The Bank is also a member of the FHLB, and as such, has access
    to advances from this facility. These advances are generally
    secured by residential mortgages, other mortgage-related loans,
    and

available-for-sale

securities. Information regarding amounts pledged, for the
    ability



to borrow if necessary, and unused borrowing capacity at both
    the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB is outlined in the
    following table:

We can also obtain funding through other methods including:

    under repurchase agreements, (3) selling or maturity of
    investment securities, (4) selling or securitization of
    loans, (5) selling of national market certificates of
    deposit, (6) the relatively shorter-term structure of our
    commercial loans

(see tables below)

and automobile loans,
    and (7) issuing of common and preferred stock.

At December 31, 2010, we believe the Bank had sufficient
    liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations for the foreseeable
    future.

At December 31, 2010, the fair value of our portfolio of
    investment securities was $9.9 billion, of which
    $4.7 billion was pledged to secure public and trust
    deposits, interest rate swap agreements, U.S. Treasury
    demand notes, and securities sold under repurchase agreements.
    The composition and maturity of these securities were presented
    in Table 32.

Parent
    Company Liquidity

The parent company’s funding requirements consist primarily
    of dividends to shareholders, debt service, income taxes,
    operating expenses, funding of nonbank subsidiaries, repurchases
    of our stock, and acquisitions. The parent company obtains
    funding to meet obligations from dividends received from direct
    subsidiaries, net taxes collected from subsidiaries included in
    the federal consolidated tax return, fees for services provided
    to subsidiaries, and the issuance of debt securities.

During the 2010 fourth quarter, we completed a public offering
    and sale of 146.0 million shares of common stock at a price
    of $6.30 per share, or $920.0 million in aggregate gross
    proceeds. Also during the 2010 fourth quarter, we completed the
    public offering and sale of $300.0 million aggregate
    principal amount



of 7.00% Subordinated Notes due 2020. We used the net
    proceeds from these transactions to repurchase our TARP Capital
    (

see Capital section

). On January 19, 2011, we
    repurchased the warrant the Company had issued to the Treasury
    at an agreed upon purchase price of $49.1 million. The
    warrant had entitled the Treasury to purchase 23.6 million
    shares of common stock.

During 2010, the parent company contributed $0.4 billion of
    capital to the Bank, which increased the Bank’s regulatory
    capital levels above its already Well-capitalized levels.

At December 31, 2010, the parent company had
    $0.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, compared with
    $1.4 billion at December 31, 2009. The decrease
    primarily reflected the net impact of the equity and debt public
    offerings, the repurchase of our TARP Capital, additional
    capital contributions made by the parent company to the Bank,
    and dividend payments on our common and preferred stock.
    Appropriate limits and guidelines are in place to ensure the
    parent company has sufficient cash to meet operating expenses
    and other commitments during 2011 without relying on
    subsidiaries or capital markets for funding.

Based on the current dividend of $0.01 per common share, cash
    demands required for common stock dividends are estimated to be
    approximately $8.6 million per quarter. Based on the
    current dividend, cash demands required for Series A
    Preferred Stock are estimated to be approximately
    $7.7 million per quarter.

Based on a regulatory dividend limitation, the Bank could not
    have declared and paid a dividend to the parent company at
    December 31, 2010, without regulatory approval. We do not
    anticipate that the Bank will request regulatory approval to pay
    dividends in the near future as we continue to build Bank
    regulatory capital above its already Well-capitalized level. To
    help meet any additional liquidity needs, we have an open-ended,
    automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with
    the SEC, which permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt
    or equity securities.

With the exception of the common and preferred dividends
    previously discussed, the parent company does not have any
    significant cash demands. There are no maturities of parent
    company obligations until 2013, when a debt maturity of
    $50.0 million is payable.

Considering the factors discussed above, and other analyses that
    we have performed, we believe the parent company has sufficient
    liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations for the foreseeable
    future.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

In the normal course of business, we enter into various
    off-balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include
    financial guarantees contained in standby letters of credit
    issued by the Bank and commitments by the Bank to sell mortgage
    loans.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to
    guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These
    guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private
    borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond
    financing, and similar transactions. Most of these arrangements
    mature within two years and are expected to expire without being
    drawn upon. Standby letters of credit are included in the
    determination of the amount of risk-based capital that the
    parent company and the Bank are required to hold.

Through our credit process, we monitor the credit risks of
    outstanding standby letters of credit. When it is probable that
    a standby letter of credit will be drawn and not repaid in full,
    losses are recognized in the provision for credit losses. At
    December 31, 2010, we had $0.6 billion of standby
    letters of credit outstanding, of which 73% were collateralized.
    Included in this $0.6 billion total are letters of credit
    issued by the Bank that support securities that were issued by
    our customers and remarketed by the Huntington Investment
    Company, our broker-dealer subsidiary.

We enter into forward contracts relating to the mortgage banking
    business to hedge the exposures we have from commitments to
    extend new residential mortgage loans to our customers and from
    our mortgage loans held for sale. At December 31, 2010, and
    December 31, 2009, we had commitments to sell residential
    real estate loans of $998.7 million and
    $662.9 million, respectively. These contracts mature in
    less than one year.



Effective January 1, 2010, we consolidated an automobile
    loan securitization that previously had been accounted for as an
    off-balance sheet transaction. We elected to account for the
    automobile loan receivables and the associated notes payable at
    fair value per accounting guidance supplied in
    ASC 810 — Consolidation.

(See Note 2 and
    Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.)

We do not believe that off-balance sheet arrangements will have
    a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources.

Operational
    Risk

As with all companies, we are subject to operational risk.
    Operational risk is the risk of loss due to human error;
    inadequate or failed internal systems and controls; violations
    of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed
    practices, or ethical standards; and external influences such as
    market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, and
    security risks. We continuously strive to strengthen our system
    of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws, rules, and
    regulations, and to improve the oversight of our operational
    risk.

To mitigate operational risks, we have established a senior
    management Operational Risk Committee and a senior management
    Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance Committee. The
    responsibilities of these committees, among other duties,
    include establishing and maintaining management information
    systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential
    concerns, risks, or trends that may have a significant impact
    and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the
    identified issues. Both of these committees report any
    significant findings and recommendations to the Risk Management
    Committee. Additionally, potential concerns may be escalated to
    our Board Risk Oversight Committee, as appropriate.

The goal of this framework is to implement effective operational
    risk techniques and strategies, minimize operational and fraud
    losses, and enhance our overall performance.

Representation
    and Warranty Reserve

We primarily conduct our loan sale and securitization activity
    with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In connection with these and
    other securitization transactions, we make certain
    representations and warranties that the loans meet certain
    criteria, such as collateral type and underwriting standards. We
    may be required to repurchase individual loans
    and / or indemnify these organizations against losses
    due to a loan not meeting the established criteria. We have a
    reserve for such losses, which is included in accrued expenses
    and other liabilities. The reserves were estimated based on
    historical and expected repurchase activity, average loss rates,
    and current economic trends, including an increase in the amount
    of repurchase losses in recent quarters.



The table below reflects activity in the representations and
    warranties reserve for each of the last three years:

Foreclosure
    Documentation

In light of recent announcements regarding alleged
    irregularities in the mortgage loan foreclosure processes of
    certain high volume loan servicers, state law enforcement
    authorities, the United States Department of Justice, and other
    federal agencies have stated they are investigating mortgage
    servicers foreclosure practices, and private litigation over
    such practices has begun to appear in the courts. Those
    investigations, as well as any other governmental or regulatory
    scrutiny of foreclosure processes and private litigation, could
    result in fines, penalties, damages, or other equitable remedies
    and result in significant legal costs in responding to possible
    governmental investigations and litigation.

Compared to the high volume servicers, we service a relatively
    low volume of residential mortgage foreclosures, with
    approximately 3,100 foreclosure cases as of December 31,
    2010, in states that require foreclosures to proceed through the
    courts. In response to industry-wide issues involving mortgage
    loan foreclosure irregularities, we conducted a review in
    October 2010 of our residential foreclosure process, focusing on
    the accuracy of completed foreclosure affidavits in pending
    foreclosure proceedings and the steps taken by us to ensure this
    documentation was properly reviewed and validated prior to
    filing the affidavit in the foreclosure proceeding. As a result
    of our review, we have determined that we do not have any
    significant issues relating to so-called
    “robo-signing”, and that foreclosure affidavits were
    completed and signed by employees with personal knowledge of the
    contents of the affidavits. There is no reason to conclude that
    foreclosures were filed that should not have been filed.
    Additionally, we have identified and are strengthening processes
    and controls to ensure that affidavits are prepared in
    compliance with applicable state law. We consult with local
    foreclosure counsel, as necessary, with respect to additional
    requirements imposed by the courts in which foreclosure
    proceedings are pending.

Compliance
    Risk

Financial institutions are subject to a myriad of laws, rules
    and regulations emanating at both the Federal and State levels.
    These mandates cover a broad scope, including but not limited
    to, expectations on anti-money laundering, lending limits,
    client privacy, fair lending, community reinvestment and other
    important areas. Recently, the volume and complexity of
    regulatory changes adds to the overall compliance risk. At
    Huntington, we take these mandates seriously and have invested
    in people, processes and systems to help ensure we meet
    expectations. At the corporate level we have a team of
    compliance experts and lawyers dedicated to ensuring our
    conformance. We provide, and require, training for our
    colleagues on a number of broad-based laws and regulations. For
    example, all of our employees are expected to take, and pass,
    courses on anti-money laundering and customer privacy. Those who
    are engaged in lending activities must also take training
    related to flood disaster protection, equal credit opportunity,
    fair lending and / or a variety of other courses
    related to the extension of credit. We set a high standard of
    expectation for adherence to compliance management and seek to
    continuously enhance our performance in this regard.



Capital

(This section should be read in conjunction with Significant
    Items 1 and 5, and Notes 12 and 14 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Capital is managed both at the Bank and on a consolidated basis.
    Capital levels are maintained based on regulatory capital
    requirements and the economic capital required to support
    credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks inherent in our
    business, and to provide the flexibility needed for future
    growth and new business opportunities.

Shareholders’ equity totaled $5.0 billion at
    December 31, 2010. This represented a $0.4 billion
    decrease compared with December 31, 2009, primarily
    reflecting the repurchase of all 1.4 million shares of TARP
    Capital held by the Treasury as part of our participation in the
    TARP CPP

,

offset by the $920.0 million common stock
    issuance and 2010 earnings.

We believe our current level of capital is adequate.

TARP
    Capital

During 2008, we received $1.4 billion of equity capital by
    issuing to the Treasury: (1) 1.4 million shares of
    TARP Capital and, (2) a ten-year warrant to purchase up to
    23.6 million shares of our common stock, par value $0.01
    per share, at an exercise price of $8.90 per share. Upon receipt
    of the TARP Capital in 2008, the proceeds were allocated to the
    preferred stock and additional

paid-in-capital.

During the period of time that we held the TARP Capital, the
    resulting discount was amortized which resulted in additional
    dilution to our earnings per share. The TARP Capital was not a
    component of Tier 1 common equity.

In the 2010 fourth quarter, we issued $920.0 million of
    common stock and $300.0 million of 7.00% subordinated
    notes due in 2020. The net proceeds of these issuances, along
    with other funds, were used to repurchase all $1.4 billion
    of the TARP Capital. The accretion of the remaining issuance
    discount on the TARP Capital was accelerated, and a
    corresponding reduction to retained earnings of
    $56.3 million was recorded. Subsequently, on
    January 19, 2011, we exited our TARP-related relationship
    by repurchasing the ten-year warrant we had issued to the
    Treasury as part of the TARP CPP for $49.1 million.

Tangible equity, Tier 1 common equity, tangible common
    equity, and tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures.
    Additionally, any ratios utilizing these financial measures are
    also non-GAAP. These financial measures have been included as
    they are considered to be critical metrics with which to analyze
    and evaluate financial condition and capital strength. Other
    companies may calculate these financial measures differently.

Our consolidated TCE ratio was 7.56% at December 31, 2010,
    an increase from 5.92% at December 31, 2009. The
    significant increase from December 31, 2009, primarily
    reflected the increased capital resulting from our
    $920.0 million common stock issuance during the 2010 fourth
    quarter, and to a lesser extent, 2010 earnings.



Regulatory
    Capital

Regulatory capital ratios are the primary metrics used by
    regulators in assessing the safety and soundness of banks. We
    intend to maintain both our and the Bank’s risk-based
    capital ratios at levels at which both would be considered
    Well-capitalized by regulators. The Bank is primarily supervised
    and regulated by the OCC, which establishes regulatory capital
    guidelines for banks similar to those established for bank
    holding companies by the Federal Reserve Board.

Regulatory capital primarily consists of Tier 1 capital and
    Tier 2 capital. The sum of Tier 1 capital and
    Tier 2 capital equals our total risk-based capital. The
    following table reflects changes and activity to the various
    components utilized in the calculation of our consolidated
    Tier 1, Tier 2, and total risk-based capital amounts
    during 2010.

Our consolidated Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios at
    December 31, 2010, declined from 2009, primarily reflecting
    a reduction in Tier 1 capital. The primary drivers of the
    decline in Tier 1 Capital were the $1.4 billion
    repurchase of TARP Capital, offset by the $0.9 billion
    common stock issuance and $0.3 billion of earnings in 2010.
    Our total risk-based capital ratio was little changed as the
    decline in Tier 1 capital was offset by an increase in
    Tier 2 capital. The change in Tier 2 capital primarily
    reflected our $0.3 billion subordinated debt issuance.

The Bank’s Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios improved,
    reflecting an increase in Tier 1 capital, primarily due to
    an increase in retained earnings (see Parent Company Liquidity
    discussion). The repurchase of the TARP Capital did not affect
    the Bank’s capital ratios.

At December 31, 2010, our Tier 1 and total risk-based
    capital in excess of the minimum level required to be considered
    Well-capitalized were $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion,
    respectively. The Bank had Tier 1 and Total risk-based
    capital in excess of the minimum level required to be considered
    Well-capitalized of $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion,
    respectively, at December 31, 2010.

Other
    Capital Matters

In 2010, shareholders passed a proposal to amend our charter
    resulting in an increase of authorized common stock to
    1.5 billion shares from 1.0 billion shares. No shares
    were repurchased during 2010.

BUSINESS
    SEGMENT DISCUSSION

Overview

For detail on each segment’s objectives, strategies, and
    priorities, please read this section in conjunction with the
    Item 1: Business section. This section reviews financial
    performance from a business segment perspective and should be
    read in conjunction with the Discussion of Results of
    Operations, Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, and other sections for a full understanding of our
    consolidated financial performance.

During the 2010 fourth quarter, we reorganized our business
    segments to better align certain business unit reporting with
    segment executives in order to accelerate cross-sell results and
    provide greater focus on the execution of strategic plans. We
    have four major business segments: Retail and Business Banking;
    Commercial Banking; Automobile Finance and Commercial Real
    Estate; and Wealth Advisors, Government Finance, and Home
    Lending. A Treasury / Other function includes our
    insurance business, and other unallocated assets, liabilities,
    revenue, and expense. All periods presented have been
    reclassified to conform to the current period classification.



Business segment results are determined based upon our
    management reporting system, which assigns balance sheet and
    income statement items to each of the business segments. The
    process is designed around our organizational and management
    structure and, accordingly, the results derived are not
    necessarily comparable with similar information published by
    other financial institutions.

Funds
    Transfer Pricing

We use an active and centralized FTP methodology to attribute
    appropriate net interest income to the business segments. The
    intent of the FTP methodology is to eliminate all interest rate
    risk from the business segments by providing matched duration
    funding of assets and liabilities. The result is to centralize
    the financial impact, management, and reporting of interest rate
    and liquidity risk in the Treasury / Other function
    where it can be centrally monitored and managed. The
    Treasury / Other function charges (credits) an
    internal cost of funds for assets held in (or pays for funding
    provided by) each business segment. The FTP rate is based on
    prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets
    (or liabilities), and includes an estimate for the cost of
    liquidity (liquidity premium). Deposits of an indeterminate
    maturity receive an FTP credit based on a combination of
    vintage-based average lives and replicating portfolio pool
    rates. Other assets, liabilities, and capital are charged
    (credited) with a four-year moving average FTP rate. The
    denominator in the net interest margin calculation has been
    modified to add the amount of net funds provided by each
    business segment for all periods presented.

Revenue
    Sharing

Revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the
    related product or service. Fee sharing is recorded to allocate
    portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in
    selling to, or providing service to, customers. The most
    significant revenues for which fee sharing is allocated relate
    to customer derivatives and brokerage services, which are
    recorded by WGH and shared primarily with Retail and Business
    Banking and Commercial Banking. Results of operations for the
    business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations.

Expense
    Allocation

The management accounting process that develops the business
    segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation
    methodologies to measure the performance of the business
    segments. Expenses are allocated to business segments using a
    two-phase approach. The first phase consists of measuring and
    assigning unit costs (activity-based costs) to activities
    related to product origination and servicing. These
    activity-based costs are then extended, based on volumes, with
    the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the
    related products. The second phase consists of the allocation of
    overhead costs to all four business segments from
    Treasury / Other. We utilize a full-allocation
    methodology, where all Treasury / Other expenses,
    except those related to our insurance business, servicing
    Franklin-related assets, reported Significant Items (except for
    the goodwill impairment), and a small amount of other residual
    unallocated expenses, are allocated to the four business
    segments.

Treasury
    / Other

The Treasury / Other function includes revenue and
    expense related to our insurance business, and assets,
    liabilities, and equity not directly assigned or allocated to
    one of the four business segments. Assets include investment
    securities, bank owned life insurance, and the loans and OREO
    properties acquired through the 2009 first quarter Franklin
    restructuring. The financial impact associated with our FTP
    methodology, as described above, is also included.

Net interest income includes the impact of administering our
    investment securities portfolios and the net impact of
    derivatives used to hedge interest rate sensitivity. Noninterest
    income includes insurance income, miscellaneous fee income not
    allocated to other business segments, such as bank owned life
    insurance income and any investment security and trading asset
    gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes any
    insurance-related expenses, as well as certain corporate
    administrative, merger, and other miscellaneous expenses not



allocated to other business segments. The provision for income
    taxes for the business segments is calculated at a statutory 35%
    tax rate, though our overall effective tax rate is lower. As a
    result, Treasury / Other reflects a credit for income
    taxes representing the difference between the lower actual
    effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate used to allocate
    income taxes to the business segments.

    versus 2009

Retail and Business Banking reported net income of
    $131.0 million in 2010, compared with a net loss of
    $26.5 million in 2009. As discussed further below, the
    $157.5 million increase included a $312.2 million, or
    66%, decline in the provision for credit losses, partially
    offset by a $105.5 million, or 13%, increase in noninterest
    expense.

Net interest income increased $56.4 million, or 7%,
    primarily reflecting a $1.2 billion increase in average
    total deposits, a 19 basis point improvement in our deposit
    spread, and a 7% increase in the number of DDA households. These
    increases were the result of increased marketing initiatives in
    2010 and sales efforts throughout 2009 and 2010, particularly in
    our checking and money market deposit products.

The $0.6 billion, or 5%, decline in total average loans and
    leases primarily reflected small business and consumer loan
    sales.

Provision for credit losses declined $312.2 million, or
    66%, reflecting lower NCOs, a $0.6 billion decrease in
    related average loans and leases, and an improvement in
    delinquencies. NCOs declined $37.9 million, or 12%, and
    reflected a $102.5 million decline in total small business
    NCOs partially offset by



a $64.6 million, or 40%, increase in total consumer NCOs.
    The decrease in NCOs reflected a lower level of large dollar
    NCOs, an improvement in delinquencies, and an improved credit
    environment.

Noninterest income decreased $20.8 million, or 5%,
    reflecting a $35.7 million decline in deposit service
    charges resulting from the amendment to Reg E, the voluntary
    reduction or elimination of NSF / OD fees, a decline
    in the number of customers overdrafting their accounts, and our
    new

feature, reflecting our Fair Play banking philosophy. The
    decrease was partially offset by: (1) $9.9 million
    increase in electronic banking income, primarily reflecting an
    increased number of deposit accounts and transaction volumes,
    (2) $3.2 million increase in mortgage banking income,
    and (3) $2.0 million increase in brokerage and
    insurance income.

Noninterest expense increased $105.5 million, or 13%. This
    increase reflected: (1) $37.2 million of higher
    allocated expenses, (2) $31.4 million increase in
    marketing expense related to brand and product advertising,
    direct mail, and branch refurbishments,
    (3) $29.9 million increase in personnel expense,
    reflecting a 12% increase in full-time equivalent employees
    associated with strategic initiatives, the re-instatement of
    certain employee benefits such as a 401(k) plan matching
    contribution, merit increases, and bonus compensation, and
    (4) $18.8 million increase in deposit and other
    insurance expense reflecting increased premiums due to higher
    assessment rates and higher deposit balances. These increases
    were partially offset by a $9.8 million improvement in OREO
    losses.

    versus 2008

Retail and Business Banking reported a net loss of
    $26.5 million in 2009, compared with net income of
    $257.8 million in 2008. The $284.3 million decline
    reflected a $273.9 million increase to the provision for
    credit losses. This increase reflected a $191.1 million
    increase in NCOs due to the impact of the overall weakened
    economy across all of our regions. Also contributing to the
    decline in net income was: (1) $48.8 million reduction
    in net interest income, primarily reflecting a 39 basis
    point decline in net interest margin, and
    (2) $121.0 million increase in noninterest expense
    primarily resulting from an increase in deposit and other
    insurance expense, as well as OREO and foreclosure expense.

    versus 2009

Commercial Banking reported net income of $38.5 million in
    2010, compared with a net loss of $158.7 million in 2009.
    This $197.2 million improvement reflected a
    $289.3 million decline in provision for credit losses. The
    increased earnings also reflected significant improvement in our
    net interest income and noninterest income due to the successful
    execution of our strategic initiatives. This investment is
    reflected in higher noninterest expense and an increased number
    of employees within the segment.

Net interest income increased $20.6 million, or 11%,
    primarily reflecting a 43 basis point increase in the net
    interest margin, partially offset by a $0.7 billion, or 9%,
    decline in average total loans. This increase in the net
    interest margin was almost entirely reflective of the
    35 basis point improvement in our commercial loan spread as
    a result of strategic pricing decisions.

Average total loans declined $0.7 billion, or 9%, primarily
    reflecting paydowns, lower

line-of-credit

utilization. We have experienced higher runoff in our commercial
    loan portfolio as many customers have actively reduced their
    leverage position. Although this has resulted in a decline in
    our average total loans for the year, originations increased in
    the 2010 fourth quarter. The increased originations have been
    the result of our investments in new markets and in new vertical
    strategies (i.e. New England market and equipment finance
    verticals).

Total average deposits increased $0.1 billion, or 5%,
    reflecting a $0.6 billion increase in core deposits, offset
    by a $0.5 billion decline in noncore deposits. The increase
    in core deposits primarily reflected (1) $0.2 billion
    increase in commercial demand deposits, and
    (2) $0.3 billion increase in commercial savings and
    money market deposits. These increases were primarily a result
    of strategic efforts to improve our sales and servicing
    functions, as well as initiatives designed to deepen customer
    relationships. The decrease in noncore deposits primarily
    reflected a $0.3 billion reduction in brokered and
    negotiable deposits due to continued planned portfolio runoff.

Provision for credit losses declined $289.3 million, or
    73%, reflecting the lower level of related loan balances, as
    well as a $196.6 million decline in NCOs. Expressed as a
    percentage of related average balances, NCOs decreased to 0.89%
    from 3.24%. The decline in NCOs was primarily driven by
    $158.3 million lower C&I NCOs and $38.6 million
    lower CRE NCOs. The overall decline in NCOs was the result of
    aggressive treatment of the portfolio over the past
    18 months, an improved credit environment, and an increase
    in recoveries.

Noninterest income increased $15.5 million, or 16%, and
    primarily reflected: (1) $5.8 million in trading and
    derivative revenue, (2) $4.8 million in foreign
    exchange income resulting from strategic investments over the
    past year in foreign exchange products and services,
    (3) $4.7 million increase in loan commitment fee
    income primarily due to our higher originations and execution of
    key strategic initiatives, and (4) $2.9 million
    increase of loan-related fees relating to the improved
    collection of such fees from customers. These increases were
    partially offset by a $4.0 million decline in equipment
    operating lease income as lease originations were structured as
    direct finance leases beginning in the 2009 second quarter.

Noninterest expense increased $22.0 million, or 16%, and
    reflected: (1) $20.7 million increase in personnel
    expense reflecting a 15% increase in full-time equivalent
    employees, due to investments in strategically focused growth
    markets, vertical strategies, and product capabilities,
    (2) $1.4 million of higher allocated expenses, and
    (3) $1.9 million increase in deposit and other
    insurance expense reflecting increased premiums due to higher
    assessment rates and higher deposit balances. These increases
    were partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease in
    equipment operating lease expense reflecting the change in
    structuring of lease obligations effective with the 2009 second
    quarter.

    versus 2008

Commercial Banking reported a net loss of $158.7 million in
    2009, compared with net income of $80.3 million in 2008.
    The decline reflected a $291.4 million increase to the
    provision for credit losses. This increase to the provision for
    credit losses reflected: (1) the continued economic
    weaknesses in our markets, (2) an increase of commercial
    reserves resulting from credit actions taken during 2009, and
    (3) $187.2 million



increase in NCOs. Also contributing to the decline in net income
    was a $88.1 million reduction in net interest income,
    primarily reflecting a 105 basis point decline in the net
    interest margin.

    vs. 2009

AFCRE reported net income of $46.5 million in 2010,
    compared with a net loss of $588.2 million in 2009. Net
    income for the automobile finance business was
    $76.9 million in 2010 compared to $10.7 million in
    2009 while the commercial real estate business incurred a net
    loss of $30.4 million in 2010 compared to a net loss of
    $598.9 million in 2009. The $634.6 million increase in
    net income reflected a $911.3 million decline in the
    provision for credit losses, primarily due to a reduction in
    reserves as the underlying credit quality of the loan portfolios
    continues to improve and / or stabilize. The
    comparable year-ago period included higher provisions for credit
    losses to increase reserves due to economic and commercial real
    estate and automobile-industry-related weaknesses in our
    markets. Total NCOs declined $320.5 million, or 48%,
    including a $323.1 million decline in CRE loan NCOs and a
    $29.5 million decline in automobile loan and lease related
    NCOs. This was partially offset by an increase in C&I NCOs
    of $33.5 million.



Net interest income increased $60.9 million, or 22%,
    reflecting a 47 basis point increase in the net interest
    margin. Average total loans were essentially unchanged. The net
    interest margin increase primarily reflected the implementation
    of a risk-based pricing strategy in CRE portfolio lending that
    began in early 2009. Average total loans reflected a
    $1.6 billion increase in average consumer automobile loans
    that resulted from record loan origination levels, as well as
    the consolidation of previously unconsolidated automobile loan
    trust (see below). These increases were partially offset by a
    $1.2 billion decline in average CRE loans resulting from
    the aggressive management of this portfolio and our on-going
    commitment to reducing our noncore CRE portfolio.

On January 1, 2010, we adopted a new accounting standard to
    consolidate a previously off-balance sheet automobile loan
    securitization transaction. At the end of the 2009 first
    quarter, we transferred $1.0 billion of automobile loans to
    a trust in a securitization transaction that was part of a
    funding strategy. At the time of the consolidation, the trust
    was holding $0.8 billion of loans and we elected to account
    for these loans, as well as the underlying debt, at fair value.
    At December 31, 2010, these loans had a remaining balance
    of $0.5 billion.

Average total deposits increased $0.1 billion, or 21%,
    reflecting our commitment to strengthening relationships with
    core customers and prospects, as well as new commercial
    automobile dealer relationships developed in 2010.

Noninterest income, excluding operating lease income, increased
    $15.9 million. Results for 2009 included a
    $5.9 million nonrecurring loss from the securitization
    transaction and a $0.7 million nonrecurring gain from the
    sale of related securities. In addition, results for 2010
    included a $4.0 million net gain resulting from valuation
    adjustments of the loans and associated notes payable held by
    the consolidated trust discussed above, a $5.7 million
    improvement in fee income from derivative trading activities,
    and a $3.1 million increase in CRE loan fees. Partially
    offsetting these increases was a $3.9 million decrease in
    servicing income also attributed to the automobile
    securitization trust consolidation.

Noninterest expense, excluding operating lease expense,
    increased $12.1 million. This increase reflected a
    $6.6 million increase in personnel expense, much of which
    related to increased loan origination activities, including the
    rebuilding of the commercial real estate team, and a
    $1.4 million increase in allocated costs primarily related
    to higher production and other activity levels. Also, commercial
    real estate credit-related expenses (e.g. appraisals, loan
    collections, taxes, and OREO expenses) increased
    $6.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a
    $4.7 million decrease in losses associated with sales of
    vehicles returned at the end of their lease terms, as used
    vehicle values throughout 2010 have been at higher relative
    levels and the number of vehicles being returned has declined
    compared to the year-ago period.

Net automobile operating lease income increased
    $0.5 million, reflecting lower depreciation expense
    attributed to improvement in estimated vehicle residual values.
    Net automobile operating lease income is expected to decline in
    future periods as a result of the discontinuation of all lease
    origination activities in 2008 and the resulting continued
    runoff of the automobile operating lease portfolio.

    vs. 2008

AFCRE reported a net loss of $588.2 million in 2009,
    compared with a net loss of $14.2 million in 2008. The
    provision for credit losses increased $811.3 million
    reflecting: (1) economic weaknesses in our markets,
    (2) an increase in commercial reserves resulting from
    credit actions taken during 2009, and (3) a
    $566.4 million increase in NCOs, also reflecting the impact
    of economic conditions on our borrowers. Net interest income
    declined $74.9 million reflecting both a decline in average
    loan balances and a 47 basis point decrease in the net
    interest margin. The decrease in the net interest margin
    resulted from changes in funding cost allocation methodologies
    as well as the impact of increased NALs. The decline in loan
    balances was primarily due to the 2009 securitization
    transaction.

Noninterest income (excluding operating lease income of
    $51.8 million during 2009 and $39.8 million in
    2008) decreased $12.2 million reflecting a
    $5.9 million nonrecurring loss from the 2009 securitization
    transaction as well as declines in various other fee generating
    activities, much of which was attributed to adverse market
    conditions. Noninterest expense (excluding operating lease
    expense of $43.4 million in 2009



and $31.3 million in 2008) decreased
    $15.4 million primarily reflecting a $22.4 million
    reduction in losses associated with the sale of vehicles
    returned at the end of their lease terms. Also, personnel and
    various other expenses declined as a result of expense reduction
    initiatives. These declines were offset in part by an increase
    in allocated corporate and other overhead expenses due to
    changes in allocation methodologies.

    vs. 2009

WGH reported net income of $34.8 million in 2010, compared
    with net income of $1.7 million in 2009. The
    $33.1 million improvement reflected a $50.9 million
    increase in pretax income, partially offset by a
    $17.8 million increase in income taxes. The primary reason
    for the increase in pretax income was a $33.0 million lower
    provision for credit losses in 2010 driven mostly by
    $22.6 million lower NCOs. Mortgage banking income increased
    by $57.8 million due to both an improved market for
    mortgage loan originations and sales in 2010, and to favorable
    results from WGH’s MSR hedging activities. Trust services
    and brokerage income increased by $9.4 million and
    $5.5 million reflecting higher levels of sales. Increased
    noninterest income of $70.9 million was partially offset by
    $57.9 million higher noninterest expenses due to
    investments in strategic initiatives and a higher level of FDIC
    deposit insurance premiums due to higher assessment rates and
    higher deposit balances.

Average total deposits increased $1.1 billion, or 19%. A
    substantial portion of the deposit growth resulted from the
    introduction of three deposit products during 2009 and a fourth
    during 2010 designed as alternative options for lower yielding
    money market mutual funds. The new deposit products were:
    (1) the Huntington



Conservative Deposit Account, (2) the Huntington Protected
    Deposit Account, (3) the Collateral Backed Deposit Account,
    and (4) the Bank Deposit Sweep Product. These four deposit
    products had balances in excess of $1.2 billion at
    December 31, 2010.

    vs. 2008

WGH reported net income of $1.7 million in 2009, a
    $41.3 million decline compared with 2008. The provision for
    credit losses increased by $92.6 million, reflecting an
    $81.4 million increase in NCOs, including a
    $58.3 million increase in residential mortgage NCOs. Credit
    quality was stressed during 2009 consistent with economic
    conditions in the Company’s markets. Mortgage banking
    income increased $100.5 million due to more favorable
    lending conditions in the first half of 2009. Partially
    offsetting that increase, trust services declined
    $21.4 million, net interest income was $24.9 million
    lower, and noninterest expense was $27.0 million higher.

Average total loans decreased $0.5 billion, or 9%,
    primarily reflecting residential mortgage sales during 2009.

Net
    Interest Income / Average Balance Sheet

FTE net interest income increased $42.4 million, or 11%,
    from the year-ago quarter. This reflected the favorable impact
    of the significant increase in the net interest margin to 3.37%
    from 3.19%. This also reflected the benefit of a
    $2.4 billion, or 5%, increase in average total earning
    assets due to a $1.4 billion, or 15%, increase in average
    total investment securities, and a $0.7 billion, or 2%,
    increase in average total loans and leases.

The increase in average total loans and leases reflected:

•

$2.2 billion, or 66%, increase in average automobile loans
    and leases. In early 2009, we transferred automobile loans to a
    trust in a securitization transaction. With the adoption of
    ASC 810 — Consolidation, that trust was
    consolidated as of January 1, 2010. At December 31,
    2010, these securitized loans had a remaining balance of
    $0.5 billion. Underlying growth in automobile loans
    continued to be strong, reflecting a significant increase in
    loan originations compared to the year-ago period. The growth
    has come while maintaining our commitment to excellent credit
    quality and an appropriate return.

•

$0.1 billion, or 2%, increase in average home equity loans,
    reflecting slightly higher

line-of-credit

utilization and slower runoff experience, partially offset by
    lower origination volume.

•

$0.2 billion, or 2%, increase in average C&I loans,
    reflecting our efforts to expand our portfolio within our
    primary markets, and to a lesser degree the benefit of the 2009
    reclassifications of certain CRE loans, primarily owner occupied
    properties, to C&I loans. These benefits were partially
    offset by the reclassification in the 2010 first quarter of
    variable-rate demand notes to municipal securities. We continue
    to believe there are opportunities for C&I growth in the
    coming quarters.

Partially offset by:

•

$1.7 billion, or 20%, decrease in average CRE loans
    reflecting the impact of 2009 reclassifications of certain CRE
    loans, primarily representing owner occupied properties, to
    C&I loans, as well as our on-going commitment to lower our
    overall CRE exposure. We continue to effectively execute our
    plan to reduce the noncore CRE exposure while maintaining a
    commitment to our core CRE borrowers. The decrease in average
    balances is associated with the noncore portfolio, as we have
    maintained relatively consistent balances with good performance
    in the core portfolio.

The $1.4 billion, or 15%, increase in average total
    investment securities reflected the redeployment of cash
    generated from deposit growth.



The following table details the $1.5 billion, or 4%,
    increase in average total deposits.

The increase in average total deposits from the year-ago quarter
    reflected:

•

$2.2 billion, or 6%, growth in average total core deposits.
    The drivers of this change were a $3.9 billion, or 42%,
    growth in average money market deposits, and a
    $0.7 billion, or 11%, growth in average noninterest-bearing
    demand deposits. These increases were partially offset by a
    $2.2 billion, or 20%, decline in average core certificates
    of deposit and a $0.2 billion, or 3%, decrease in average
    interest-bearing demand deposits.

•

$0.8 billion, or 33%, decline in brokered deposits and
    negotiable CDs, primarily reflecting a reduction of noncore
    funding sources.

Provision
    for Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses in the 2010 fourth quarter was
    $87.0 million, down $807.0 million, or 90%, from the
    year-ago quarter. The 2010 fourth quarter provision for credit
    losses was $85.3 million less than total NCOs, reflecting
    the resolution of problem loans for which reserves had been
    previously established.

Noninterest
    Income

Noninterest income increased $19.7 million from the
    year-ago quarter.

The $19.7 million increase reflected:

•

$28.6 million, or 116%, increase in mortgage banking
    income. This reflected a $31.8 million increase in
    origination and secondary marketing income, as originations
    increased 62% from the year-ago quarter, partially offset by a
    $3.2 million increase in amortization of capitalized
    servicing expense.

•

$3.7 million, or 15%, increase in electronic banking
    income, reflecting an increase in debit card transaction volume.

•

$3.6 million, or 22%, increase in insurance income,
    primarily reflecting an increase in title insurance income due
    to higher mortgage refinance activity.

•

$2.5 million benefit from lower securities losses in the
    2010 fourth quarter compared with the year-ago quarter.

•

$2.1 million, or 15%, increase in bank owned life insurance
    income.

•

$2.1 million, or 8%, increase in trust services income,
    with 50% of the increase due to increases in asset market values
    and the remainder reflecting growth in new business.

Partially offset by:

•

$20.9 million, or 27%, decline in service charges on
    deposit accounts, reflecting lower personal service charges due
    to a combination of factors including the implementation of the
    amendment to Reg E, our Fair Play banking philosophy, and lower
    underlying activity levels.

•

$2.2 million, or 17%, decline in automobile operating lease
    income reflecting the impact of a declining portfolio, having
    exited that business in 2008.

Noninterest
    Expense

(This

•

$31.5 million, or 17%, increase in personnel costs,
    primarily reflecting a 10% increase in full-time equivalent
    staff in support of strategic initiatives, as well as higher
    commissions and other incentive expenses, and the re-instatement
    of our 401(k) plan matching contribution in 2010.

•

$11.2 million, or 41%, increase in other expense,
    reflecting $5.9 million associated with increases in
    repurchase reserves related to representations and warranties
    made on mortgage loans sold, as well as increased travel and
    miscellaneous fees.

•

$7.1 million, or 78%, increase in marketing expense,
    reflecting increases in branding and product advertising
    activities in support of strategic initiatives.

•

$4.1 million, or 11%, increase in outside data processing
    and other services, reflecting higher outside programming and
    other costs associated with the implementation of strategic

    servicing costs.

Partially offset by:

•

$8.0 million, or 43%, decline in OREO and foreclosure
    expense.

•

$4.1 million, or 16%, decrease in professional services,
    reflecting lower legal expenses.

•

    expense as that portfolio continued to runoff.

•

$2.0 million, or 12%, decrease in the amortization of
    intangibles expense.

Income
    Taxes

The provision for income taxes in the 2010 fourth quarter was
    $35.0 million and a benefit of $228.3 million in the
    fourth quarter 2009. The effective tax rate in the fourth
    quarter 2010 was 22.2% compared to a tax benefit of 38.2% in the
    fourth quarter 2009. At December 31, 2010 and 2009 we had a
    deferred tax asset of $538.3 million and
    $480.5 million, respectively. Based on both positive and
    negative



evidence and our level of forecasted future taxable income,
    there was no impairment of the deferred tax asset at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. The total disallowed deferred
    tax asset for regulatory capital purposes decreased to
    $161.3 million at December 31, 2010, from
    $260.1 million at December 31, 2009.

Credit
    Quality

Credit quality performance in the 2010 fourth quarter continued
    to show improvement. Total NCOs declined $272.5 million, or
    61%, compared with the year-ago quarter. The decline was largely
    centered in the CRE portfolio as CRE NCOs declined
    $213.2 million. This decline in the CRE portfolio was
    partially offset by an increase in residential mortgage NCOs,
    partially reflecting NCOs associated with loans sold during the
    current quarter. Other key credit quality measurements also
    showed improvement, including significant declines in NPAs and
    in the level of Criticized commercial loans. These declines
    reflected the positive impact of significant levels of loan
    restructures, upgrades, and payment activity. Notably, the level
    of new additions during the 2010 fourth quarter was more
    comparable to that in the first half of 2010 rather than the
    elevated 2010 third quarter level. The economic environment
    remains challenging. Yet, reflecting the benefit of our focused
    credit actions, we continue to expect declines in total NPAs and
    Criticized loans going forward.

Delinquency trends across the entire loan and lease portfolio
    continued to improve, with a significant opportunity for further
    improvement in the residential and home equity portfolios.
    Automobile loan delinquency rates continued to decline. Given
    the significant increase in new automobile origination volume,
    we use a lagged delinquency measure to ensure that the
    underlying portfolio performance is consistent with our
    expectations. Based on the lagged analysis and the origination
    quality, we remain comfortable with the on-going performance of
    our automobile loan portfolio.

The current quarter’s NCOs were primarily related to
    reserves established in prior periods. Our ACL declined
    $240.2 million to $1,291.1 million, or 3.39% of
    period-end total loans and leases at December 31, 2010,
    from $1,531.4 million, or 4.16%, at December 31, 2009.
    Importantly, our ACL as a percent of period-end NALs increased
    to 166% from 80%, along with improved coverage ratios associated
    with NPAs and Criticized assets. These improved coverage ratios
    indicate a strengthening of our reserves relative to troubled
    assets from the end of the prior year-ago quarter.

NCOs

(This
    section should be read in conjunction with Significant
    Item 3.)

Total NCOs for the 2010 fourth quarter were $172.3 million,
    or an annualized 1.82% of average total loans and leases. NCOs
    in the year-ago quarter were $444.7 million, or an
    annualized 4.80%.

Total C&I NCOs for the 2010 fourth quarter were
    $59.1 million, or an annualized 1.85%, down from
    $109.8 million, or an annualized 3.49% of related loans, in
    the year-ago quarter. The decline reflected improvement in the
    overall credit quality of the portfolio.

Current quarter CRE NCOs were $44.9 million, or an
    annualized 2.64%, down from $258.1 million, or an
    annualized 12.21% in the year-ago quarter. The decline was
    consistent with the improving asset quality metrics. NALs and
    Criticized loans at December 31, 2010, were at their lowest
    levels since 2008, and early stage delinquency continued to
    improve. The 2010 fourth quarter CRE NCOs continued to be
    centered in retail projects. The retail property portfolio
    remains the most susceptible to a continued decline in market
    conditions, but we believe that the combination of prior NCOs
    and existing reserves positions us well to make effective credit
    decisions in the future. While the office portfolio has
    experienced stress, we remain comfortable with this exposure.

Total consumer NCOs in the current quarter were
    $68.3 million, or an annualized 1.50%, down from
    $76.8 million, or an annualized 1.91% of average total
    consumer loans in the year-ago quarter. The 2010 fourth quarter
    results represented a continuation of our loss mitigation
    programs and active loss recognition processes. This included
    accounts in all stages of performance, including bankruptcy.



Residential mortgage NCOs were $26.8 million, or an
    annualized 2.42% of related average balances, an increase
    compared with $17.8 million, or an annualized 1.61% in the
    year-ago quarter. During the current quarter, we continued to
    see positive trends in early-stage delinquencies, indicating
    that even with the economic stress on our customers, losses are
    expected to remain manageable.

Home equity NCOs in the 2010 fourth quarter were
    $29.2 million, or an annualized 1.51%. This was down from
    $35.8 million, or an annualized 1.89%, in the year-ago
    quarter. We continued to manage the default rate through focused
    delinquency monitoring as virtually all defaults for second-lien
    home equity loans incur substantial losses given the reduced
    collateral equity. Our strategies focus on loss mitigation
    activity through early intervention and restructuring loan terms.

Automobile loan and lease NCOs were $7.0 million, or an
    annualized 0.51%, down from $12.9 million, or an annualized
    1.55%, in the year-ago quarter. Performance of this portfolio on
    both an absolute and relative basis continued to be consistent
    with our views regarding the underlying quality of the
    portfolio. During the 2010 fourth quarter, we originated
    $795.6 million of loans with an average FICO score of 764
    with a continued emphasis on lower LTV ratios.

NPAs
    and NALs

Total NALs were $777.9 million at December 31, 2010,
    and represented 2.04% of total loans and leases. This was down
    $1,139.0 million, or 59%, from $1,917.0 million, or
    5.21% ,of total loans and leases at the end of the year ago
    period. This decrease primarily reflected problem loan
    resolution activity and NCOs. This substantial decline is a
    direct result of our commitment to the on-going proactive
    management of these loans by our SAD. Also key to this
    improvement was the lower level of inflows. The level of
    inflows, or migration, is an important indicator of the future
    trend for the portfolio.

NPAs, which include NALs, were $844.8 million at
    December 31, 2010, and represented 2.21% of total loans and
    leases. This was significantly lower than $2,058.1 million,
    or 5.57% of related assets at the end of the year-ago period.
    The $1,213.3 million decrease in NPAs from the end of the
    year-ago period reflected a $1,139.0 million decrease in
    NALs.

The over

90-day

delinquent, but still accruing, ratio for total loans not
    guaranteed by a U.S. government agency, was 0.23% at
    December 31, 2010, representing a 17 basis point
    decline compared with December 31, 2009. This decrease
    primarily reflected continued improvement in our core
    performance, as well as the impact of the sale of certain
    underperforming loans in the 2010 fourth quarter.

ACL

(This
    section should be in read in conjunction with Note 1 and
    Note 6 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements).

At December 31, 2010, the ALLL was $1,249.0 million,
    down $233.5 million, or 16%, from $1,482.5 million at
    December 31, 2009. Expressed as a percent of period-end
    loans and leases, the ALLL ratio at December 31, 2010, was
    3.28%, a decline from 4.03% at December 31, 2009. The ALLL
    as a percent of NALs was 161% at December 31, 2010, a
    substantial improvement from 77% at 2009.

At December 31, 2010, the AULC was $42.1 million, down
    $6.8 million, or 14%, compared with December 31, 2009.

On a combined basis, the ACL as a percent of total loans and
    leases at December 31, 2010, was 3.39%, down from 4.16% at
    December 31, 2009. This reduction was centered in the CRE
    portfolio as a result of the reduction in the level of problem
    loans. The ACL as a percent of NALs was 166% at
    December 31, 2010, up from 80% at December 31, 2009,
    indicating additional strength in the reserve level relative to
    the level of problem loans.

ADDITIONAL
    DISCLOSURES

Forward-Looking
    Statements

This report, including MD&A, contains certain
    forward-looking statements, including certain plans,
    expectations, goals, projections, and statements, which are
    subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties.
    Statements that do not describe historical or current facts,
    including statements about beliefs and expectations, are
    forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are
    intended to be subject to the safe harbor provided by
    Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E
    of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Actual results could differ materially from those contained or
    implied by such statements for a variety of factors including:
    (1) worsening of credit quality performance due to a number
    of factors such as the underlying value of the collateral could
    prove less valuable than otherwise assumed and assumed cash
    flows may be worse than expected; (2) changes in economic
    conditions; (3) movements in interest rates;
    (4) competitive pressures on product pricing and services;
    (5) success, impact, and timing of our business strategies,
    including market acceptance of any new products or services
    introduced to implement our Fair Play banking philosophy;
    (6) changes in accounting policies and principles and the
    accuracy of our assumptions and estimates used to prepare our
    Consolidated Financial Statements; (7) extended disruption
    of vital



infrastructure; and (8) the nature, extent, and timing of
    governmental actions and reforms, including the Dodd-Frank Act,
    as well as future regulations which will be adopted by the
    relevant regulatory agencies, including the newly created CFPB,
    to implement the Dodd-Frank Act’s provisions.

All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they
    are made and are based on information available at that time. We
    assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements to
    reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the
    forward-looking statements were made or to reflect the
    occurrence of unanticipated events except as required by federal
    securities laws. As forward-looking statements involve
    significant risks and uncertainties, caution should be exercised
    against placing undue reliance on such statements.

Risk
    Factors

More information on risk is set forth under the heading Risk
    Factors included in Item 1A and incorporated by reference
    into this MD&A. Additional information regarding risk
    factors can also be found in the Risk Management and Capital
    discussion.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance
    with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
    with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make
    estimates that affect amounts reported in our Consolidated
    Financial Statements. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, which is incorporated by reference into
    this MD&A, describes the significant accounting policies we
    use in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

An accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about
    uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are made under
    facts and circumstances at a point in time, and changes in those
    facts and circumstances could produce results substantially
    different from those estimates. The most significant accounting
    policies and estimates and their related application are
    discussed below.

Total
    Allowance for Credit Losses

Our ACL of $1.3 billion at December 31, 2010,
    represents our estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan
    and lease portfolio and our unfunded loan commitments and
    letters of credit. We periodically review our ACL for adequacy.
    In doing so, we consider economic conditions and trends,
    collateral values, and credit quality indicators, such as past
    NCO experience, levels of past due loans, and NPAs. There is no
    certainty that our ACL will be adequate over time to cover
    losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes
    in the economy, market conditions, or events adversely affecting
    specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit
    quality of our customer base materially deteriorates, the risk
    profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes
    materially, or if the ACL is not adequate, our net income and
    capital could be materially adversely affected which, in turn,
    could have a material negative adverse affect on our financial
    condition and results of operations.

In addition, bank regulators periodically review our ACL and may
    require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses
    or loan charge-offs. Any increase in our ACL or loan charge-offs
    as required by these regulatory authorities could have a
    material adverse affect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

Fair
    Value Measurements

(This
    section should be read in conjunction with Note 19 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements)

The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the
    amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
    transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or
    liquidation sale. We estimate the fair value of a financial
    instrument using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial
    instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices,
    quoted market prices are used for fair value. We characterize
    active markets as those where transaction volumes are sufficient
    to provide objective pricing



information, with reasonably narrow bid / ask spreads,
    and where received quoted prices do not vary widely. When the
    financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable
    market inputs, such as quoted prices of securities with similar
    characteristics, may be used, if available, to determine fair
    value. Inactive markets are characterized by low transaction
    volumes, price quotations that vary substantially among market
    participants, or in which minimal information is released
    publicly. When observable market prices do not exist, we
    estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other
    financial modeling methods. Our valuation methods consider
    factors such as liquidity and concentration concerns and, for
    the derivatives portfolio, counterparty credit risk. Other
    factors such as model assumptions, market dislocations, and
    unexpected correlations can affect estimates of fair value.
    Changes in these underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates
    in any of these areas could materially impact the amount of
    revenue or loss recorded.

Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result
    in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Assets
    measured at fair value include mortgage loans held for sale,

available-for-sale

and other certain securities, certain securitized automobile
    loans, derivatives, certain MSRs, trading account securities,
    and certain securitization trust notes payable. At
    December 31, 2010, approximately $11.5 billion of our
    assets and $0.6 billion of our liabilities were recorded at
    fair value. In addition to the above mentioned on-going fair
    value measurements, fair value is also the unit of measure for
    recording business combinations.

FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements, establishes a
    framework for measuring the fair value of financial instruments
    that considers the attributes specific to particular assets or
    liabilities and establishes a three-level hierarchy for
    determining fair value based on the transparency of inputs to
    each valuation as of the fair value measurement date. The three
    levels are defined as follows:

•

Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) for
    identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

•

Level 2 — inputs include quoted prices for
    similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices
    of identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that
    are not active, and inputs that are observable for the asset or
    liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the
    full term of the financial instrument.

•

Level 3 — inputs that are unobservable and
    significant to the fair value measurement. Financial instruments
    are considered Level 3 when values are determined using
    pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar
    techniques, and at least one significant model assumption or
    input is unobservable.

At the end of each quarter, we assess the valuation hierarchy
    for each asset or liability measured. As necessary, assets or
    liabilities may be transferred within hierarchy levels due to
    changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure
    fair value at the measurement date.



The table below provides a description and the valuation
    methodologies used for financial instruments measured at fair
    value, as well as the general classification of such instruments
    pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. The fair values measured at
    each level of the fair value hierarchy, as well as additional
    discussion regarding fair value measurements, can be found in
    Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Financial Instrument(1)

Hierarchy

Valuation methodology

Mortgage loans held for sale

Level 2

Huntington elected to apply the fair value option for mortgage
    loans originated with the intent to sell which are included in
    loans held for sale. Mortgage loans held for sale are estimated
    using security prices for similar product types. At December 31,
    2010, mortgage loans held for sale had an aggregate fair value
    of $754.1 million and an aggregate outstanding principal balance
    of $750.0 million.  Interest income on these loans is recorded
    in interest and fee income - loans and leases.  Included in
    mortgage banking income were net gains resulting from
    origination and sale of these loans, including net realized
    gains of $109.2 million, $90.6 million, and $32.2 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008,
    respectively.  Of such gains, the change in fair value while
    held as loans were $(5.6) million, $(6.3) million and
    $6.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and
    2008, respectively.

Available-for-sale

Securities &

Trading Account Securities(2)

Level 1

Consist primarily of U.S. Treasury and money market mutual
    funds, which generally have quoted prices.

Level 2

Consist of U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed and other
    federal agency securities, municipal securities, and other
    securities for which an active market is not available.  Third
    party pricing services provide a fair value estimate based upon
    trades of similar financial instruments.

Level 3

Consist of certain asset-backed securities,
    pooled-trust-preferred securities, private-label CMOs, and
    municipal securities for which fair value is estimated.
    Assumptions used to determine the fair value of these securities
    have greater subjectivity due to the lack of observable market
    transactions. Generally, there are only limited trades of
    similar instruments and a discounted cash flow approach is used
    to determine fair value.

Automobile loans(3)

Level 3

Consists of automobile loan receivables measured at fair value.
    The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the
    automobile loan receivables included projections of expected
    losses and prepayment of the underlying loans in the portfolio
    and a market assumption of interest rate spreads. The net gains
    and losses, before tax, from fair value changes reflected in
    earnings for the year ended December 31, 2010 was a net loss of
    $2.3 million which is net of a $3.4 million net gain associated
    with instrument specific credit risk. Instrument specific credit
    risk was determined based on estimated credit losses inherent in
    the January 1, 2010 fair value calculation as compared to actual
    credit losses incurred in 2010 plus estimated credit losses
    inherent in the December 31, 2010 fair value calculation.

Hierarchy

Valuation methodology

MSRs(3)

Level 3

MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily
    observable prices. Although sales of MSRs do occur, the precise
    terms and conditions typically are not readily available. Fair
    value is determined on an income approach model based upon
    month-end interest rate curve and prepayment assumptions.

Derivatives(4)

Level 1

Consist of exchange traded options and forward commitments to
    deliver mortgage-backed securities which are valued using quoted
    prices.

Level 2

Consist of basic asset and liability conversion swaps and
    options, and interest rate caps. These derivative positions are
    valued using a discounted cash flow method that incorporates
    current market interest rates.

Level 3

Consist primarily of interest rate lock agreements related to
    mortgage loan commitments. The determination of fair value
    includes assumptions related to the likelihood that a commitment
    will ultimately result in a closed loan, which is a significant
    unobservable assumption.

Securitization trust notes payable(4)

Level 2

Consists of certain securitization trust notes payable related
    to the automobile loans measured at fair value. The notes
    payable are valued based on interest rates for similar financial
    instruments. The change in fair value for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 was $9.6 million.

(This
    section should be read in conjunction with the Investment
    Securities Portfolio discussion and Note 1 and Note 4
    in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Level 3
    Analysis on Certain Securities Portfolios

Our Alt-A, private label CMO, and pooled-trust-preferred
    securities portfolios are classified as Level 3, and as
    such, the significant estimates used to determine the fair value
    of these securities have greater subjectivity. The Alt-A and
    private label CMO securities portfolios are subjected to a
    monthly review of the projected cash flows, while the cash flows
    of our pooled-trust-preferred securities portfolio are reviewed
    quarterly. These reviews are supported with analysis from
    independent third parties, and are used as a basis for
    impairment analysis. These three portfolios, and the results of
    our impairment analysis for each portfolio, are discussed in
    further detail below:

Alt-A mortgage-backed / Private-label
    collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) securities

represent securities collateralized by first-lien residential
    mortgage loans. As the lowest level input that is significant to
    the fair value measurement of these securities in its entirety
    was a Level 3 input, we classified all securities within
    these portfolios as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
    The securities were priced with the assistance of an outside
    third party specialist using a discounted cash flow approach and
    the independent third party’s proprietary pricing model.
    The model used inputs such as estimated prepayment speeds,
    losses, recoveries, and default rates that were implied by the
    underlying performance of collateral in the structure or similar
    structures, discount rates that were implied by market prices
    for similar securities, collateral structure types, and housing
    price depreciation / appreciation rates that were
    based upon macroeconomic forecasts.



We analyzed both our Alt-A mortgage-backed and private-label CMO
    securities portfolios to determine if the securities in these
    portfolios were

other-than-temporarily

impaired. We used the analysis to determine whether we believed
    it was probable that all contractual cash flows would not be
    collected. All securities in these portfolios remained current
    with respect to interest and principal, except for one security
    which experienced a minor interest shortfall at
    December 31, 2010.

Our analysis indicated that, as of December 31, 2010, one
    Alt-A mortgage-backed security and seven private-label CMO
    securities could experience a loss of principal in the future.
    The future expected losses of principal on these

other-than-temporarily

impaired securities ranged from 4.2% to 38.5% of their par
    value. These losses were projected to occur anywhere from eight
    months to as many as 25 years in the future. We measured
    the amount of credit impairment on these securities using the
    cash flows discounted at each security’s effective rate. In
    2010, a total of $1.6 million of credit OTTI was recorded
    in our Alt-A mortgage- backed securities portfolio, and
    $7.1 million of credit OTTI was recorded in our
    private-label CMO securities portfolio. These OTTI adjustments
    negatively impacted our earnings.

Pooled-trust-preferred securities

represent CDOs
    backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial
    institutions. As the lowest level input that is significant to
    the fair value measurement of these securities in its entirety
    was a Level 3 input, we classified all securities within
    this portfolio as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The
    collateral generally consisted of trust-preferred securities and
    subordinated debt securities issued by banks, bank holding
    companies, and insurance companies. A full cash flow analysis
    was used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each
    security within this portfolio. Impairment was calculated as the
    difference between the carrying amount and the amount of cash
    flows discounted at each security’s effective rate. We
    engaged a third party specialist with direct industry experience
    in pooled-trust-preferred securities valuations to provide
    assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows
    for each security in this portfolio. Relying on cash flows was
    necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in
    the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for
    these securities were no longer able to provide a fair value.

The analysis was completed by evaluating the relevant credit and
    structural aspects of each

pooled-trust-preferred

security in the portfolio, including collateral performance
    projections for each piece of collateral in each security and
    terms of each security’s structure. The credit review
    included analysis of profitability, credit quality, operating
    efficiency, leverage, and liquidity using the most recently
    available financial and regulatory information for each
    underlying collateral issuer. We also reviewed historical
    industry default data and current / near term
    operating conditions. Using the results of our analysis, we
    estimated appropriate default and recovery probabilities for
    each piece of collateral and then estimated the expected cash
    flows for each security. No recoveries were assumed on issuers
    who are in default. The recovery assumptions on issuers who were
    deferring interest ranged from 10% to 55% with a cure assumed
    after the maximum deferral period. As a result of this testing,
    we believe we will likely experience a loss of principal or
    interest on nine securities and, as such, recorded credit OTTI
    of $1.5 million for one newly impaired and eight previously
    impaired pooled-trust-preferred securities in the 2010 fourth
    quarter. In 2010, $4.9 million of total OTTI was recorded
    for impairment of the pooled-trust-preferred securities. These
    OTTI adjustments negatively impacted our earnings.

Please refer to the Securities discussion and Note 1 and
    Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for additional information regarding OTTI.

Certain other assets and liabilities which are not financial
    instruments also involve fair value measurements. A description
    of these assets and liabilities, and the methodologies utilized
    to determine fair value are discussed below:

GOODWILL

Goodwill is an intangible asset representing the difference
    between the purchase price of an asset and its fair market value
    and is created when a company pays a premium to acquire the
    assets of another company. We test goodwill for impairment
    annually, as of October 1, using a two-step process that
    begins with an estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit.
    Goodwill impairment exists when a reporting unit’s carrying



value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Goodwill is
    also tested for impairment on an interim basis, using the same
    two-step process as the annual testing, if an event occurs or
    circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely
    than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its
    carrying amount.

In 2010, we performed interim evaluations of our goodwill
    balances at March 31 and June 30, as well as our annual
    goodwill impairment assessment as of October 1. The annual
    assessment was based on our reporting units at that time. No
    impairment was recorded in 2010. The 2010 interim and annual
    assessments were performed in a manner consistent with the 2009
    process as described in the next section. All assumptions were
    updated to reflect correct market conditions. Due to the current
    economic environment and other uncertainties, it is possible
    that our estimates and assumptions may adversely change in the
    future. If our market capitalization decreases or the liquidity
    discount on our loan portfolio improves significantly without a
    concurrent increase in market capitalization, we may be required
    to record goodwill impairment losses in future periods, whether
    in connection with our next annual impairment testing or prior
    to that time, if any changes constitute a triggering event.

Significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for
    impairment. This judgment includes developing cash flow
    projections, selecting appropriate discount rates, identifying
    relevant market comparables, incorporating general economic and
    market conditions, and selecting an appropriate control premium.
    The selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques
    may result in a higher or lower fair value. Judgment is applied
    in determining the weightings that are most representative of
    fair value.

    First Quarter Impairment Testing

During the 2009 first quarter, our stock price declined 78%,
    from $7.66 per common share at December 31, 2008, to $1.66
    per common share at March 31, 2009. Many peer banks also
    experienced similar significant declines in market
    capitalization during this same period. This decline primarily
    reflected the continuing economic slowdown and increased market
    concern surrounding financial institutions’ credit risks
    and capital positions, as well as uncertainty related to
    increased regulatory supervision and intervention. We determined
    that these changes would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair
    value of certain reporting units below their carrying amounts.
    Therefore, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test
    during the 2009 first quarter. An independent third party was
    engaged to assist with the impairment assessment.

The first step (Step 1) of impairment testing required a
    comparison of each reporting unit’s fair value to carrying
    value to identify potential impairment. For our impairment
    testing conducted during the 2009 first quarter, we identified
    four reporting units: Regional Banking, Private Financial Group
    (PFG), Insurance, and Automobile Finance and Dealer Services
    (AFDS).

Although Insurance was included within PFG for business segment
    reporting at that time, it was evaluated as a separate reporting
    unit for goodwill impairment testing because it had its own
    separately allocated goodwill resulting from prior acquisitions.
    The fair value of PFG (determined using the market approach as
    described below), excluding Insurance, exceeded its carrying
    value, and goodwill was determined to not be impaired for this
    reporting unit. There was no goodwill associated with AFDS and,
    therefore, it was not subject to impairment testing.

For Regional Banking, we utilized both the income and market
    approaches to determine fair value. The income approach was
    based on discounted cash flows derived from assumptions of
    balance sheet and income statement activity. An internal
    forecast was developed by considering several long-term key
    business drivers such as anticipated loan and deposit growth.
    The long-term growth rate used in determining the terminal value
    was estimated at 2.5%. The discount rate of 14% was estimated
    based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considered the
    risk-free interest rate

(20-year

Treasury Bonds), market-risk premium, equity-risk premium, and a
    company-specific risk factor. The company-specific risk factor
    was used to address the uncertainty of growth estimates and
    earnings projections of Management. For the market approach,
    revenue, earnings and market capitalization multiples of
    comparable public companies were selected and applied to the
    Regional Banking unit’s applicable metrics such as book and
    tangible book values. A 20% control premium was used in the
    market approach. The results of the income and market approaches
    were weighted 75% and



25%, respectively, to arrive at the final calculation of fair
    value. As market capitalization declined across the banking
    industry, we believed that a heavier weighting on the income
    approach was more representative of a market participant’s
    view. For the Insurance reporting unit, Management utilized a
    market approach to determine fair value. The aggregate fair
    market values were compared with market capitalization as an
    assessment of the appropriateness of the fair value
    measurements. As our stock price fluctuated greatly during the
    valuation period, we used our average stock price for the
    30 days preceding the valuation date to determine market
    capitalization. The aggregate fair market values of the
    reporting units compared with market capitalization indicated an
    implied premium of 27%. A control premium analysis indicated
    that the implied premium was within range of overall premiums
    observed in the market place. Neither the Regional Banking nor
    Insurance reporting units passed Step 1.

The second step (Step 2) of impairment testing is necessary
    only if the reporting unit does not pass Step 1. Step 2
    compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill
    with the carrying amount of the goodwill for the reporting unit.
    The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same
    manner as goodwill that is recognized in a business combination.
    Significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating
    the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting
    unit.

To determine the implied fair value of goodwill, the fair value
    of Regional Banking and Insurance (as determined in Step
    1) was allocated to all assets and liabilities of the
    reporting units including any recognized or unrecognized
    intangible assets. The allocation was done as if the reporting
    unit was acquired in a business combination, and the fair value
    of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the
    reporting unit. This allocation process is only performed for
    purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. The carrying values
    of recognized assets or liabilities (other than goodwill, as
    appropriate) were not adjusted nor were any new intangible
    assets recorded. Key valuations were the assessment of core
    deposit intangibles, the

mark-to-fair-value

of outstanding debt and deposits, and

mark-to-fair-value

on the loan portfolio. Core deposits were valued using a 15%
    discount rate. The marks on our outstanding debt and deposits
    were based upon observable trades or modeled prices using then
    current yield curves and market spreads. The valuation of the
    loan portfolio indicated discounts in the ranges of 9%-24%,
    depending upon the loan type. The estimated fair value of these
    loan portfolios was based on an exit price, and the assumptions
    used were intended to approximate those that a market
    participant would have used in valuing the loans in an orderly
    transaction, including a market liquidity discount. The
    significant market risk premium that is a consequence of the
    current distressed market conditions was a significant
    contributor to the valuation discounts associated with these
    loans. We believed these discounts were consistent with
    transactions currently occurring in the marketplace.

Upon completion of Step 2, we determined that the Regional
    Banking and Insurance reporting units’ goodwill carrying
    values exceeded their implied fair values of goodwill by
    $2,573.8 million and $28.9 million, respectively. As a
    result, we recorded a noncash pretax impairment charge of
    $2,602.7 million in the 2009 first quarter.

    Other Interim and Annual Impairment Testing

We recorded an impairment charge of $4.2 million in the
    2009 second quarter related to the sale of a small
    payments-related business completed in July 2009. No other
    goodwill impairment was required during the remainder of 2009.

FRANKLIN
    LOANS RESTRUCTURING TRANSACTION

(This
    section should be read in conjunction with Note 3 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

Franklin is a specialty consumer finance company primarily
    engaged in servicing performing, reperforming, and nonperforming
    residential mortgage loans. Prior to March 31, 2009,
    Franklin owned a portfolio of loans secured by first-lien and
    second-lien loans secured by residential properties. These loans
    generally fell outside the underwriting standards of Fannie Mae
    or Freddie Mac, and involved elevated credit risk as a result of
    the nature or absence of income documentation, limited credit
    histories, higher levels of consumer debt, and / or
    past credit difficulties (nonprime loans). At December 31,
    2008, our total commercial loans outstanding to Franklin were
    $650.2 million, all of which were placed on nonaccrual
    status. Additionally, the



specific allowance for loan and lease losses for the Franklin
    portfolio was $130.0 million, resulting in net exposure to
    Franklin at December 31, 2008, of $520.2 million.

On March 31, 2009, we entered into a transaction with
    Franklin whereby a Huntington wholly-owned REIT subsidiary
    (REIT) indirectly acquired an 83% ownership right in a trust
    which held all the underlying consumer loans and OREO properties
    that were formerly collateral for the Franklin commercial loans.
    The equity interests provided to Franklin by the REIT were
    pledged by Franklin as collateral for the Franklin commercial
    loans.

As a result of the restructuring, on a consolidated basis, the
    $650.2 million nonaccrual commercial loan to Franklin at
    December 31, 2008, was no longer reported. Instead, the
    loans were reported as secured by first-lien and second-lien
    mortgages on residential properties and OREO properties both of
    which had previously been assets of Franklin or its subsidiaries
    and were pledged to secure our loan to Franklin. At the time of
    the restructuring, these loans had a fair value of
    $493.6 million and the OREO properties had a fair value of
    $79.6 million. As a result of the restructuring, we
    reported $338.5 million mortgage-related NALs outstanding
    related to Franklin, representing first-lien and second-lien
    mortgages that were nonaccruing at December 31, 2009. Also,
    our specific allowance for loan and lease losses for the
    Franklin portfolio of $130.0 million was eliminated.
    However, no initial increase to the ALLL relating to the
    acquired mortgages was recorded as these assets were recorded at
    fair value.

In accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, we
    recorded a net deferred tax asset of $159.9 million related
    to the difference between the tax basis and the book basis of
    the acquired assets. Because the acquisition price, represented
    by the equity interests in our wholly-owned subsidiary, was
    equal to the fair value of the acquired 83% ownership right, no
    goodwill was created from the transaction. The recording of the
    net deferred tax asset was a bargain purchase under
    ASC 805, and was recorded as a tax benefit in the 2009
    first quarter.

During the 2010 second quarter, $397.7 million of
    Franklin-related loans ($333.0 million of residential
    mortgages and $64.7 million of home equity loans) at a
    value of $323.4 million were transferred to loans held for
    sale. At the time of the transfer to loans held for sale, the
    loans were marked to the lower of cost or fair value less
    anticipated selling costs. During the 2010 third quarter, the
    Franklin-related residential mortgages and home equity loans
    were sold at essentially book value. At December 31, 2010,
    the only Franklin-related assets remaining were
    $9.5 million of OREO properties, which have been marked to
    the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell.
    Additionally, the equity interests in the REIT held by Franklin
    remain outstanding and pledged as collateral for the Franklin
    commercial loans at December 31, 2010.

PENSION

Pension plan assets consist of mutual funds and our common
    stock. Investments are accounted for at cost on the trade date
    and are reported at fair value. Mutual funds are valued at
    quoted Net Asset Value. Our common stock is traded on a national
    securities exchange and is valued at the last reported sales
    price.

The discount rate and expected return on plan assets used to
    determine the benefit obligation and pension expense are both
    assumptions. Actual results may be materially different.

(See
    Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements).

OTHER
    REAL ESTATE OWNED

OREO property obtained in satisfaction of a loan is recorded at
    its estimated fair value less anticipated selling costs based
    upon the property’s appraised value at the date of
    transfer, with any difference between the fair value of the
    property and the carrying value of the loan charged to the ALLL.
    Subsequent declines in value are reported as adjustments to the
    carrying amount and are charged to noninterest expense. Gains or
    losses resulting from the sale of OREO are recognized in
    noninterest expense on the date of sale. At December 31,
    2010, OREO totaled $66.8 million, representing a 52%
    decrease compared with $140.1 million at December 31,
    2009.



Income
    Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets

INCOME
    TAXES

The calculation of our provision for income taxes is complex and
    requires the use of estimates and judgments. We have two
    accruals for income taxes: (1) our income tax payable
    represents the estimated net amount currently due to the
    federal, state, and local taxing jurisdictions, net of any
    reserve for potential audit issues, and is reported as a
    component of accrued expenses and other liabilities in our
    consolidated balance sheet; (2) our deferred federal income
    tax asset, reported as a component of accrued income and other
    assets, represents the estimated impact of temporary differences
    between how we recognize our assets and liabilities under GAAP,
    and how such assets and liabilities are recognized under the
    federal tax code.

In the ordinary course of business, we operate in various taxing
    jurisdictions and are subject to income and nonincome taxes. The
    effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretation of the
    relevant current tax laws. We believe the aggregate liabilities
    related to taxes are appropriately reflected in the consolidated
    financial statements. We review the appropriate tax treatment of
    all transactions taking into consideration statutory, judicial,
    and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax positions. In
    addition, we rely on various tax opinions, recent tax audits,
    and historical experience.

From

time-to-time,

we engage in business transactions that may affect our tax
    liabilities. Where appropriate, we have obtained opinions of
    outside experts and have assessed the relative merits and risks
    of the appropriate tax treatment of business transactions taking
    into account statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance in the
    context of the tax position. However, changes to our estimates
    of accrued taxes can occur due to changes in tax rates,
    implementation of new business strategies, resolution of issues
    with taxing authorities regarding previously taken tax
    positions, and newly enacted statutory, judicial, and regulatory
    guidance. Such changes could affect the amount of our accrued
    taxes and could be material to our financial position
    and / or results of operations.

(See
    Note


of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.)

DEFERRED
    TAX ASSETS

At December 31, 2010, we had a net federal deferred tax
    asset of $537.5 million and a net state deferred tax asset
    of $0.8 million. A valuation allowance is provided when it
    is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the deferred tax
    asset will not be realized. All available evidence, both
    positive and negative, was considered to determine whether,
    based on the weight of that evidence, impairment should be
    recognized. Our forecast process includes judgmental and
    quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change.
    If our forecast of taxable income within the carryforward
    periods available under applicable law is not sufficient to
    cover the amount of net deferred tax assets, such assets may be
    impaired. Based on our analysis of both positive and negative
    evidence and our ability to offset the net deferred tax assets
    against our forecasted future taxable income, there was no
    impairment of the deferred tax assets at December 31, 2010.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements and Developments

Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements discusses new
    accounting pronouncements adopted during 2010 and the expected
    impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet
    required to be adopted. To the extent the adoption of new
    accounting standards materially affect financial condition,
    results of operations, or liquidity, the impacts are discussed
    in the applicable section of this MD&A and the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT

The Management of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (Huntington
    or the Company) is responsible for the financial information and
    representations contained in the Consolidated Financial
    Statements and other sections of this report. The Consolidated
    Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
    In all material respects, they reflect the substance of
    transactions that should be included based on informed
    judgments, estimates, and currently available information.
    Management maintains a system of internal accounting controls,
    which includes the careful selection and training of qualified
    personnel, appropriate segregation of responsibilities,
    communication of written policies and procedures, and a broad
    program of internal audits. The costs of the controls are
    balanced against the expected benefits. During 2010, the audit
    committee of the board of directors met regularly with
    Management, Huntington’s internal auditors, and the
    independent registered public accounting firm,
    Deloitte & Touche LLP, to review the scope of the
    audits and to discuss the evaluation of internal accounting
    controls and financial reporting matters. The independent
    registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have
    free access to, and meet confidentially with, the audit
    committee to discuss appropriate matters. Also, Huntington
    maintains a disclosure review committee. This committee’s
    purpose is to design and maintain disclosure controls and
    procedures to ensure that material information relating to the
    financial and operating condition of Huntington is properly
    reported to its chief executive officer, chief financial
    officer, internal auditors, and the audit committee of the board
    of directors in connection with the preparation and filing of
    periodic reports and the certification of those reports by the
    chief executive officer and the chief financial officer.

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting for the
    Company, including accounting and other internal control systems
    that, in the opinion of Management, provide reasonable assurance
    that (1) transactions are properly authorized, (2) the
    assets are properly safeguarded, and (3) transactions are
    properly recorded and reported to permit the preparation of the
    Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States.
    Huntington’s Management assessed the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, Management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

. Based on that
    assessment, Management believes that, as of December 31,
    2010, the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting is effective based on those criteria. The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010 has been audited by Deloitte &
    Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
    stated in their report appearing on the next page, which
    expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Huntington Bancshares Incorporated

Columbus, Ohio

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    Huntington Bancshares Incorporated and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2010, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Report of Management’s
    Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 of the Company and our report dated
    February 18, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    financial statements.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Huntington Bancshares Incorporated

Columbus, Ohio

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Huntington Bancshares Incorporated and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and
    the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2010. These
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    Huntington Bancshares Incorporated and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 18, 2011 expressed
    an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations

— Huntington Bancshares
    Incorporated (Huntington or the Company) is a multi-state
    diversified financial holding company organized under Maryland
    law in 1966 and headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. Through its
    subsidiaries, including its bank subsidiary, The Huntington
    National Bank (the Bank), Huntington is engaged in providing
    full-service commercial, small business, and consumer banking
    services, mortgage banking services, automobile financing,
    equipment leasing, investment management, trust services,
    brokerage services, customized insurance service programs, and
    other financial products and services. Huntington’s banking
    offices are located in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Indiana,
    West Virginia, and Kentucky. Select financial services and other
    activities are also conducted in various states. International
    banking services are available through the headquarters office
    in Columbus and a limited purpose office located in Cayman
    Islands and another in Hong Kong.

Basis of Presentation

— The Consolidated
    Financial Statements include the accounts of Huntington and its
    majority-owned subsidiaries and are presented in accordance with
    GAAP. All intercompany transactions and balances have been
    eliminated in consolidation. Companies in which Huntington holds
    more than a 50% voting equity interest or are a VIE in which
    Huntington has the power to direct the activities of an entity
    that most significantly impact the entity’s economic
    performance or absorbs the majority of expected losses are
    consolidated. Huntington evaluates VIEs in which it holds a
    beneficial interest for consolidation. VIEs are legal entities
    with insubstantial equity, whose equity investors lack the
    ability to make decisions about the entity’s activities, or
    whose equity investors do not have the right to receive the
    residual returns of the entity if they occur. VIEs in which
    Huntington does not hold the power to direct the activities
    entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic
    performance or absorb the majority of expected losses are not
    consolidated. For consolidated entities where Huntington holds
    less than a 100% interest, Huntington recognizes minority
    interest liability (included in shareholders’ equity) for
    the equity held by others and minority interest expense
    (included in noninterest expense) for the portion of the
    entity’s earnings attributable to minority interests.
    Investments in companies that are not consolidated are accounted
    for using the equity method when Huntington has the ability to
    exert significant influence. Those investments in nonmarketable
    securities for which Huntington does not have the ability to
    exert significant influence are generally accounted for using
    the cost method and are periodically evaluated for impairment.
    Investments in private investment partnerships that are
    accounted for under the equity method or the cost method are
    included in accrued income and other assets and
    Huntington’s proportional interest in the equity
    investments’ earnings are included in other noninterest
    income.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
    requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that
    significantly affect amounts reported in the Consolidated
    Financial Statements. Huntington uses significant estimates and
    employs the judgments of Management in determining the amount of
    its allowance for credit losses and income tax accruals and
    deferrals, in its fair value measurements of investment
    securities, derivatives, mortgage loans held for sale, MSRs,
    certain loans and debt carried at fair value, and in the
    evaluation of impairment of loans, goodwill, investment
    securities, and fixed assets. As with any estimate, actual
    results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates
    are further discussed in the critical accounting policies
    included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

In preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements, subsequent
    events were evaluated through the time the financial statements
    were issued. Financial statements are considered issued when
    they are widely distributed to all shareholders and other
    financial statement users, or filed with the SEC. In conjunction
    with applicable accounting standards, all material subsequent
    events have been either recognized in the Consolidated Financial
    Statements or disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform
    to the current year’s presentation.



Securities

— Securities purchased with the
    intention of recognizing short-term profits or which are
    actively bought and sold are classified as trading account
    securities and reported at fair value. The unrealized gains or
    losses on trading account securities are recorded in other
    noninterest income, except for gains and losses on trading
    account securities used to hedge the fair value of MSRs, which
    are included in mortgage banking income. All other securities
    are classified as investment securities. Investment securities
    include

available-for-sale

securities and nonmarketable equity securities. Unrealized gains
    or losses on

available-for-sale

securities are reported as a separate component of accumulated
    OCI in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in
    Shareholders’ Equity. Declines in the value of debt and
    marketable equity securities that are considered

other-than-temporary

are recorded in noninterest income as securities losses.

Huntington evaluates its investment securities portfolio on a
    quarterly basis for indicators of OTTI. This determination
    requires significant judgment. Huntington assesses whether OTTI
    has occurred when the fair value of a debt security is less than
    the amortized cost basis at the balance sheet date. Under these
    circumstances, OTTI is considered to have occurred (1) if
    Huntington intends to sell the security; (2) if it is more
    likely than not Huntington will be required to sell the security
    before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) the
    expected cash flows are not sufficient to recover all
    contractually required principal and interest payments.
    Furthermore, securities which fail the criteria above (1-3) must
    be evaluated to determine what portion of the impairment is
    related to credit or noncredit OTTI. For securities that
    Huntington does not expect to sell or it is not more likely than
    not to be required to sell, the OTTI is separated into credit
    and noncredit components. The credit-related OTTI, represented
    by the expected loss in principal, is recognized in noninterest
    income, while noncredit-related OTTI is recognized in OCI.
    Noncredit-related OTTI results from other factors, including
    increased liquidity spreads and extension of the security. For
    securities which Huntington does expect to sell, all OTTI is
    recognized in earnings. Presentation of OTTI is made in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income on a gross basis with a
    reduction for the amount of OTTI recognized in OCI. Once an OTTI
    is recorded, when future cash flows can be reasonably estimated,
    future cash flows are re-allocated between interest and
    principal cash flows to provide for a level-yield on the
    security.

Securities transactions are recognized on the trade date (the
    date the order to buy or sell is executed). The carrying value
    plus any related OCI balance of sold securities is used to
    compute realized gains and losses. Interest and dividends on
    securities, including amortization of premiums and accretion of
    discounts using the effective interest method over the period to
    maturity, are included in interest income.

Nonmarketable equity securities include stock acquired for
    regulatory purposes, such as Federal Home Loan Bank stock and
    Federal Reserve Bank stock. These securities are accounted for
    at cost, evaluated for impairment, and included in

available-for-sale

and other securities.

Loans and Leases —

Loans and direct financing
    leases for which Huntington has the intent and ability to hold
    for the foreseeable future (at least 12 months), or until
    maturity or payoff, are classified in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets as loans and leases. Except for loans which are subject
    to fair value requirements, loans and leases are carried at the
    principal amount outstanding, net of unamortized deferred loan
    origination fees and costs and net of unearned income. Direct
    financing leases are reported at the aggregate of lease payments
    receivable and estimated residual values, net of unearned and
    deferred income. Interest income is accrued as earned using the
    interest method based on unpaid principal balances. Huntington
    defers the fees it receives from the origination of loans and
    leases, as well as the direct costs of those activities.
    Huntington also acquires loans at a premium and at a discount to
    their contractual values. Huntington amortizes loan discounts,
    loan premiums, and net loan origination fees and costs on a
    level-yield basis over the estimated lives of the related loans.

Loans that Huntington has the intent to sell or securitize are
    classified as loans held for sale. Loans held for sale
    (excluding loans originated or acquired with the intent to sell,
    which are carried at fair value) are carried at the lower of
    cost or fair value less cost to sell. The fair value option was
    elected for mortgage loans held for sale to facilitate hedging
    of the loans. Fair value is determined based on collateral value
    and prevailing market prices for loans with similar
    characteristics. Subsequent declines in fair value are
    recognized either as a charge-off or as noninterest income,
    depending on the length of time the loan has been recorded as
    loans held for sale. When a decision is made to sell a loan that
    was not originated or initially acquired with the intent to
    sell, the loan is reclassified into loans held for sale.



Huntington consolidates an automobile loan securitization in
    which the associated $522.7 million loan receivables and
    $356.1 million notes payable are held at fair value. The
    valuation of the loan receivables and notes payable are
    evaluated on a quarterly basis with any market value changes
    recorded in noninterest income. The key assumptions used to
    determine the fair value of the automobile loans included a
    projection of expected losses and prepayment of the underlying
    loans in the portfolio and a market assumption of interest rate
    spreads. The notes payable are valued based on interest rates
    for similar financial assets.

Residual values on leased automobiles and equipment are
    evaluated quarterly for impairment. Impairment of the residual
    values of direct financing leases is recognized by writing the
    leases down to fair value with a charge to other noninterest
    expense. Residual value losses arise if the expected fair value
    at the end of the lease term is less than the residual value
    recorded at the lease origination, net of estimated amounts
    reimbursable by the lessee. Future declines in the expected
    residual value of the leased equipment would result in expected
    losses of the leased equipment.

For leased equipment, the residual component of a direct
    financing lease represents the estimated fair value of the
    leased equipment at the end of the lease term. Huntington uses
    industry data, historical experience, and independent appraisals
    to establish these residual value estimates. Additional
    information regarding product life cycle, product upgrades, as
    well as insight into competing products are obtained through
    relationships with industry contacts and are factored into
    residual value estimates where applicable.

Sold Loans and Leases

— Gains and losses on the
    loans and leases sold and servicing rights associated with loan
    and lease sales are determined when the related loans or leases
    are sold to either a securitization trust or third party. For
    loan or lease sales with servicing retained, a servicing asset
    is recorded at fair value for the right to service the loans
    sold. To determine the fair value, Huntington uses an option
    adjusted spread cash flow analysis incorporating market implied
    forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of
    mortgage and market interest rates. The forward rates utilized
    are derived from the current yield curve for U.S. dollar
    interest rate swaps and are consistent with pricing of capital
    markets instruments. The current and projected mortgage interest
    rate influences the prepayment rate and, therefore, the timing
    and magnitude of the cash flows associated with the MSR.
    Expected mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are derived from a
    third party model. Management believes these prepayment
    assumptions are consistent with assumptions used by other market
    participants valuing similar MSRs. The servicing rights are
    recorded in accrued income and other assets in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. Servicing revenues on mortgage and automobile
    loans are included in mortgage banking income and other
    noninterest income, respectively.

Accrued Income and Mortgage Banking
    Activities

— Huntington recognizes the rights to
    service mortgage loans as separate assets, which are included in
    other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, only when
    purchased or when servicing is contractually separated from the
    underlying mortgage loans by sale or securitization of the loans
    with servicing rights retained.

At the time of initial capitalization, MSRs are grouped into one
    of two categories depending on whether Huntington intends to
    actively hedge the asset. MSR assets are recorded using the fair
    value method if the Company will engage in actively hedging the
    asset or recorded using the amortization method if no active
    hedging will be performed. Any change in the fair value of MSRs
    carried under the fair value method, as well as amortization and
    impairment of MSRs under the amortization method, during the
    period is recorded in mortgage banking income, which is
    reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Huntington
    hedges the value of MSRs using derivative instruments and
    trading account securities. Changes in fair value of these
    derivatives and trading account securities are reported as a
    component of mortgage banking income.

ACL

— Huntington maintains two reserves, both
    of which reflect Management’s judgment regarding the
    adequate level necessary to absorb credit losses inherent in our
    loan and lease portfolio: the ALLL and the AULC. Combined, these
    reserves comprise the total ACL. The determination of the ACL
    requires significant estimates, including the timing and amounts
    of expected future cash flows on impaired loans and leases,
    consideration of current economic conditions, and historical
    loss experience pertaining to pools of homogeneous loans and
    leases, all of which may be susceptible to change.



The adequacy of the ACL is based on Management’s current
    judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio. These
    judgments consider on-going evaluations of the loan and lease
    portfolio, including such factors as the differing economic
    risks associated with each loan category, the financial
    condition of specific borrowers, the level of delinquent loans,
    the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence
    of any guarantees or other documented support. Further,
    Management evaluates the impact of changes in interest rates and
    overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet
    their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to
    credit losses and assessing the adequacy of our ACL at each
    reporting date. In addition to general economic conditions and
    the other factors described above, additional factors also
    considered include: the impact of declining residential real
    estate values; the diversification of CRE loans, particularly
    loans secured by retail properties; and the amount of C&I
    loans to businesses in areas of Ohio and Michigan that have
    historically experienced less economic growth compared with
    other footprint markets. Also, the ACL assessment includes the
    on-going assessment of credit quality metrics, and a comparison
    of certain ACL adequacy benchmarks to current performance.
    Management’s determinations regarding the adequacy of the
    ACL are reviewed and approved by the Company’s board of
    directors.

The ACL is increased through a provision for credit losses that
    is charged to earnings, based on Management’s quarterly
    evaluation of the factors previously mentioned, and is reduced
    by charge-offs, net of recoveries, and the ACL associated with
    securitized or sold loans.

The ALLL consists of two components: (1) the transaction
    reserve, which includes specific reserves related to loans
    considered to be impaired and loans involved in troubled debt
    restructurings, and (2) the general reserve. The
    transaction reserve component includes both (1) an estimate
    of loss based on pools of commercial and consumer loans and
    leases with similar characteristics and (2) an estimate of
    loss based on an impairment review of each C&I and CRE loan
    greater than $1 million. For the C&I and CRE
    portfolios, the estimate of loss based on pools of loans and
    leases with similar characteristics is made through the use of a
    standardized loan grading system that is applied on an
    individual loan level and updated on a continuous basis. This
    loan grading system incorporates a

probability-of-default

(PD) factor and a loss-given-default (LGD) factor. The PD factor
    considers on-going reviews of the financial performance of the
    specific borrower, including cash flow, debt-service coverage
    ratio, earnings power, debt level, and equity position, in
    conjunction with an assessment of the borrower’s industry
    and future prospects. The LGD factor considers analysis of the
    type of collateral and the relative LTV ratio. These reserve
    factors are developed based on credit migration models that
    track historical movements of loans between loan ratings over
    time and a combination of long-term average loss experience of
    our own portfolio and external industry data.

In the case of more homogeneous portfolios, such as automobile
    loans, home equity loans, and residential mortgage loans, the
    determination of the transaction reserve also incorporates PD
    and LGD factors, however, the estimate of loss is based on pools
    of loans and leases with similar characteristics. The PD factor
    considers current credit scores unless the account is
    delinquent, in which case a higher PD factor is used. The LGD
    factor considers analysis of the type of collateral and the
    relative LTV ratio. Credit scores, models, analyses, and other
    factors used to determine both the PD and LGD factors are
    updated frequently to capture the recent behavioral
    characteristics of the subject portfolios, as well as any
    changes in loss mitigation or credit origination strategies, and
    adjustments to the reserve factors are made as needed.

The general reserve consists of economic reserve and
    risk-profile reserve components. The economic reserve component
    considers the potential impact of changing market and economic
    conditions on portfolio performance. The risk-profile component
    considers items unique to our structure, policies, processes,
    and portfolio composition, as well as qualitative measurements
    and assessments of the loan portfolios including, but not
    limited to, management quality, concentrations, portfolio
    composition, industry comparisons, and internal review functions.

NALs and Past Due Loans and Leases

— Loans are
    considered past due when the contractual amounts due with
    respect to principal and interest are not received within
    30 days of the contractual due date. With the exception of
    loans where the borrower has declared bankruptcy, all classes
    within the C&I and CRE portfolios are placed on nonaccrual
    status no later than when the loan is

90-days

past
    due. The residential mortgage portfolio and both classes of the
    home equity portfolio are placed on nonaccrual status at
    180 days, with the



exception of residential mortgages guaranteed by government
    organizations which continue to accrue interest. Automobile and
    other consumer loans are not placed on nonaccrual status, but
    are charged-off when the loan is

120-days

past due. Any loan in any portfolio may be placed on nonaccrual
    status prior to the policies described above when collection of
    principal or interest is in doubt. For all classes within all
    loan portfolios, when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, any
    accrued interest income is reversed with current year accruals
    charged to interest income, and prior year amounts charged-off
    as a credit loss.

Classes are generally disaggregations of a portfolio. For ACL
    purposes, the Company’s portfolios are: C&I, CRE,
    Automobile loans and leases, Residential mortgages, Home equity,
    and other consumer loans. The classes within the C&I
    portfolio are: owner occupied and nonowner occupied. The classes
    within the CRE portfolio are: Retail properties, Multi-family,
    Office, Industrial and Warehouse, and Other CRE. The classes
    within the home equity portfolio are: first-lien loans and
    second-lien loans. The automobile loans and leases, residential
    mortgage, and other consumer loan portfolios are not further
    segregated into classes.

For all classes within all loan portfolios, cash receipts
    received on NALs are applied entirely against principal until
    the loan or lease has been collected in full, after which time
    any additional cash receipts are recognized as interest income.

Regarding all classes within the C&I and CRE portfolios,
    when, in Management’s judgment, the borrower’s ability
    to make required principal and interest payments resumes and
    collectability is no longer in doubt, and the loan has been
    brought current with respect to principal and interest, the loan
    or lease is returned to accrual status. Regarding all classes
    within all consumer loan portfolios, a NAL is returned to
    accrual status when the loan has been brought to less than
    180 days past due with respect to principal and interest.

Charge-off of Uncollectible Loans

— C&I
    and CRE loans are either charged-off or written down to fair
    value at

90-days

past
    due. Automobile loans and other consumer loans are charged-off
    at

120-days

past due. Residential mortgages are either charged-off or
    written down to fair value when the loan has been foreclosed and
    the balance exceeds the market value of the collateral. Home
    equity loans are either charged-off or written down to fair
    value, when it is determined that there is not sufficient equity
    in the loan to cover our position. Any loan in any portfolio may
    be charged-off prior to the policies described above if a loss
    confirming event occurred. Loss confirming events include, but
    are not limited to, bankruptcy (unsecured), continued
    delinquency, or receipt of an asset valuation indicating a
    collateral deficiency and that asset is the sole source of
    repayment.

Impaired Loans

— For all classes within the
    C&I and CRE portfolios, all loans with an outstanding
    balance of $1 million or greater are evaluated on a
    quarterly basis for impairment. Generally, consumer loans within
    any class are not individually evaluated on a regular basis for
    impairment.

Once a loan has been identified for an assessment of impairment,
    the loan is considered impaired when, based on current
    information and events, it is probable that all amounts due
    according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will
    not be collected. This determination requires significant
    judgment and use of estimates, and the eventual outcome may
    differ significantly from those estimates.

When a loan in any class has been determined to be impaired, the
    amount of the impairment is measured using the present value of
    expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s or
    lease’s effective interest rate or, as a practical
    expedient, the observable market price of the loan or lease, or
    the fair value of the collateral if the loan or lease is
    collateral dependent. When the present value of expected future
    cash flows is used, the effective interest rate is the original
    contractual interest rate of the loan adjusted for any premium
    or discount. When the contractual interest rate is variable, the
    effective interest rate of the loan changes over time. A
    specific reserve is established as a component of the ALLL when
    a loan has been determined to be impaired. Subsequent to the
    initial measurement of impairment, if there is a significant
    change to the impaired loan’s expected future cash flows,
    or if actual cash flows are significantly different from the
    cash flows previously estimated, Huntington recalculates the
    impairment and appropriately adjusts the specific reserve.
    Similarly, if Huntington measures impairment based on the
    observable market price of an impaired loan or the fair value of
    the collateral of an impaired collateral-dependent loan,
    Huntington will adjust the specific reserve if there is a
    significant change in either of those bases.



When a loan within any class is impaired, interest income is
    recognized unless the receipt of principal and interest is in
    doubt when contractually due. If receipt of principal and
    interest is in doubt when contractually due, interest income is
    not recognized. Cash receipts received on nonaccruing impaired
    loans within any class are generally applied entirely against
    principal until the loan or lease has been collected in full,
    after which time any additional cash receipts are recognized as
    interest income. Cash receipts received on accruing impaired
    loans within any class are applied in the same manner as
    accruing loans that are not considered impaired.

OREO

— OREO is comprised principally of
    commercial and residential real estate properties obtained in
    partial or total satisfaction of loan obligations, and is
    carried at the lower of cost or fair value. OREO obtained in
    satisfaction of a loan is recorded at the estimated fair value
    less anticipated selling costs based upon the property’s
    appraised value at the date of foreclosure, with any difference
    between the fair value of the property and the carrying value of
    the loan recorded as a charge-off. Subsequent declines in value
    are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount and are
    recorded in noninterest expense. Gains or losses resulting from
    the sale of OREO are recognized in noninterest expense at the
    date of sale.

Resell and Repurchase Agreements —

Securities
    purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under
    agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financing
    transactions and are recorded at the amounts at which the
    securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. The fair
    value of collateral either received from or provided to a third
    party is continually monitored and additional collateral is
    obtained or is requested to be returned to Huntington as in
    accordance with the agreement.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets —

Under
    the acquisition method of accounting, the net assets of entities
    acquired by Huntington are recorded at their estimated fair
    value at the date of acquisition. The excess cost of the
    acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired is
    recorded as goodwill. Other intangible assets are amortized
    either on an accelerated or straight-line basis over their
    estimated useful lives. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on
    an annual basis at October 1st of each year or
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying value may not be recoverable. Other intangible assets
    are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may
    not be recoverable.

Premises and Equipment

— Premises and equipment
    are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
    amortization. Depreciation is computed principally by the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    related assets. Buildings and building improvements are
    depreciated over an average of 30 to 40 years and 10 to
    20 years, respectively. Land improvements and furniture and
    fixtures are depreciated over 10 years, while equipment is
    depreciated over a range of three to seven years. Leasehold
    improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset’s
    useful life or the lease term, including any renewal periods for
    which renewal is reasonably assured. Maintenance and repairs are
    charged to expense as incurred, while improvements that extend
    the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated over
    the remaining useful life. Premises and equipment is evaluated
    for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be
    recoverable.

Bank Owned Life Insurance —

Huntington’s
    bank owned life insurance policies are carried at their cash
    surrender value. Huntington recognizes tax-exempt income from
    the periodic increases in the cash surrender value of these
    policies and from death benefits. A portion of cash surrender
    value is supported by holdings in separate accounts. Huntington
    has also purchased insurance for these policies to provide
    protection of the value of the holdings within these separate
    accounts. The value of the underlying holdings in the separate
    accounts covered by these insurance policies exceeds the cash
    surrender value of the policies by approximately
    $0.5 million at December 31, 2010.

Derivative Financial Instruments —

A variety of
    derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate
    swaps, caps, floors, and collars, are used in asset and
    liability management activities to protect against the risk of
    adverse price or interest rate movements. These instruments
    provide flexibility in adjusting Huntington’s sensitivity
    to changes in interest rates without exposure to loss of
    principal and higher funding requirements.



Derivative financial instruments are recorded in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet as either an asset or a liability (in
    accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other
    liabilities, respectively) and measured at fair value, with
    changes to fair value recorded through earnings unless specific
    criteria are met to account for the derivative using hedge
    accounting.

Huntington also uses derivatives, principally loan sale
    commitments, in hedging its mortgage loan interest rate lock
    commitments and its mortgage loans held for sale. Mortgage loan
    sale commitments and the related interest rate lock commitments
    are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with
    changes in fair value reflected in mortgage banking revenue.
    Huntington also uses certain derivative financial instruments to
    offset changes in value of its MSRs. These derivatives consist
    primarily of forward interest rate agreements, and forward
    mortgage securities. The derivative instruments used are not
    designated as hedges. Accordingly, such derivatives are recorded
    at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in mortgage
    banking income.

For those derivatives to which hedge accounting is applied,
    Huntington formally documents the hedging relationship and the
    risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the
    hedge. This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the
    hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged,
    and, unless the hedge meets all of the criteria to assume there
    is no ineffectiveness, the method that will be used to assess
    the effectiveness of the hedging instrument and how
    ineffectiveness will be measured. The methods utilized to assess
    retrospective hedge effectiveness, as well as the frequency of
    testing, vary based on the type of item being hedged and the
    designated hedge period. For specifically designated fair value
    hedges of certain fixed-rate debt, Huntington utilizes the
    short-cut method when certain criteria are met. For other fair
    value hedges of fixed-rate debt, including certificates of
    deposit, Huntington utilizes the regression method to evaluate
    hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis. For fair value hedges
    of portfolio loans, the regression method is used to evaluate
    effectiveness on a daily basis. For cash flow hedges, the
    regression method is applied on a quarterly basis. For hedging
    relationships that are designated as fair value hedges, changes
    in the fair value of the derivative are, to the extent that the
    hedging relationship is effective, recorded through earnings and
    offset against changes in the fair value of the hedged item. For
    cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative
    are, to the extent that the hedging relationship is effective,
    recorded in OCI and subsequently recognized in earnings at the
    same time that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any
    portion of a hedge that is ineffective is recognized immediately
    in other noninterest income. When a cash flow hedge is
    discontinued because the originally forecasted transaction is
    not probable of occurring, any net gain or loss in OCI is
    recognized immediately in other noninterest income.

Like other financial instruments, derivatives contain an element
    of credit risk, which is the possibility that Huntington will
    incur a loss because a counterparty fails to meet its
    contractual obligations. Notional values of interest rate swaps
    and other off-balance sheet financial instruments significantly
    exceed the credit risk associated with these instruments and
    represent contractual balances on which calculations of amounts
    to be exchanged are based. Credit exposure is limited to the sum
    of the aggregate fair value of positions that have become
    favorable to Huntington, including any accrued interest
    receivable due from counterparties. Potential credit losses are
    mitigated through careful evaluation of counterparty credit
    standing, selection of counterparties from a limited group of
    high quality institutions, collateral agreements, and other
    contract provisions. Huntington considers the value of
    collateral held and collateral provided in determining the net
    carrying value of derivatives.

Advertising Costs —

Advertising costs are
    expensed as incurred and recorded as a marketing expense, a
    component of noninterest expense.

Income Taxes —

Income taxes are accounted for
    under the asset and liability method. Accordingly, deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are recognized for the future book and
    tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between
    the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
    liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
    and liabilities are determined using enacted tax rates expected
    to apply in the year in which those temporary differences are
    expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
    assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
    income at the time of enactment of such change in tax rates. Any
    interest or penalties due for payment of income taxes are
    included in the provision for income taxes. To the extent that
    we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax



asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is recorded. All
    positive and negative evidence is reviewed when determining how
    much of a valuation allowance is recognized on a quarterly
    basis. In determining the requirements for a valuation
    allowance, sources of possible taxable income are evaluated
    including future reversals of existing taxable temporary
    differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing
    temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in
    appropriate carryback years, and tax-planning strategies.
    Huntington applies a more likely than not recognition threshold
    for all tax uncertainties. Huntington reviews the tax positions
    quarterly.

Stock Repurchases —

Acquisitions of Huntington
    stock are recorded at cost. The re-issuance of shares is
    recorded at weighted-average cost.

Share-Based Compensation

— Huntington uses the
    fair value recognition concept relating to its share-based
    compensation plans. Compensation expense is recognized based on
    the fair value of unvested stock options and awards over the
    requisite service period.

Segment Results

— Accounting policies for the
    business segments are the same as those used in the preparation
    of the Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to
    activities specifically attributable to each business segment.
    However, the preparation of business segment results requires
    Management to establish methodologies to allocate funding costs
    and benefits, expenses, and other financial elements to each
    business segment. Changes are made in these methodologies
    utilized for certain balance sheet and income statement
    allocations performed by Huntington’s management reporting
    system, as appropriate.

Statement of Cash Flows

— Cash and cash
    equivalents are defined as Cash and due from banks which
    includes amounts on deposit with the Federal Reserve and federal
    funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements.

Fair Value Measurements

— The Company records
    certain of its assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value
    is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an
    asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
    principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability
    in an orderly transaction between market participants on the
    measurement date. Fair value measurements are classified within
    one of three levels in a valuation hierarchy based upon the
    transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability
    as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as
    follows:

Level 1

— inputs to the valuation
    methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets
    or liabilities in active markets.

Level 2

— inputs to the valuation
    methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and
    liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable
    for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for
    substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

Level 3

— inputs to the valuation
    methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value
    measurement.

A financial instrument’s categorization within the
    valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that
    is significant to the fair value measurement.

ACCOUNTING
    STANDARDS UPDATE

FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic
    810 — Consolidation (Statement No. 167,

Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46R) (ASC 810)

This accounting guidance was originally issued in June
    2009 and is now included in ASC 810. The guidance amends
    the consolidation guidance applicable for VIE. The guidance is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and
    interim periods beginning after November 15, 2009, and
    early adoption was prohibited. Huntington previously transferred
    automobile loans to a trust in a securitization transaction.
    With adoption of the amended guidance, the trust was
    consolidated as of January 1, 2010. Huntington elected the
    fair value option under ASC 825, Financial Instruments, for
    both the auto loans and the related debt obligations. Total
    assets increased $621.6 million, total liabilities
    increased $629.3 million, and a negative cumulative effect
    adjustment to OCI and retained earnings of $6.1 million was
    recorded. Based upon the current regulatory requirements, the
    consolidation of



the trust resulted in a slight decrease to risk weighted capital
    ratios. (See Note 21 for more information on the
    consolidation of the trust).

Accounting Standards Update (ASU)

2010-6 —

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820):
    Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements.

The ASU
    amends Subtopic

820-10

with
    new disclosure requirements and clarification of existing
    disclosure requirements. New disclosures required include the
    amount of significant transfers in and out of levels 1 and
    2 fair value measurements and the reasons for the transfers. In
    addition, the reconciliation for level 3 activity is
    required on a gross rather than net basis. The ASU provides
    additional guidance related to the level of disaggregation in
    determining classes of assets and liabilities and disclosures
    about inputs and valuation techniques. The amendments are
    effective for annual or interim reporting periods beginning
    after December 15, 2009, except for the requirement to
    provide the reconciliation for level 3 activity on a gross
    basis which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2010. (See Note 19).

Accounting Standards Update (ASU)

2010-20 —

Receivables (Topic 310): Disclosures about the Credit Quality of
    Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses.

The ASU requires expanded disclosure about the credit
    quality of the loan portfolio in the notes to financial
    statements, such as aging information and credit quality
    indicators. Both new and existing disclosures must be
    disaggregated by portfolio segment or class. The disaggregation
    of information is based on how Huntington develops its ACL and
    how it manages its credit exposure. The disclosures related to
    period-end balances are effective for annual or interim
    reporting periods ending after December 15, 2010 and the
    disclosures of activity that occurs during the reporting period
    are effective for annual or interim reporting periods beginning
    after December 15, 2010 (See Note 6).

    $0.1 billion in 2014; and $0.1 billion in 2015 and
    thereafter.

Franklin
    relationship

Franklin is a specialty consumer finance company primarily
    engaged in servicing residential mortgage loans. On
    March 31, 2009, Huntington entered into a transaction with
    Franklin whereby a Huntington wholly-owned REIT subsidiary
    (REIT) exchanged a noncontrolling amount of certain equity
    interests for a 100% interest in Franklin Asset Merger Sub, LLC
    (Merger Sub), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Franklin. This was
    accomplished by merging Merger Sub into a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of REIT. Merger Sub’s sole assets were two trust
    participation certificates evidencing 83% ownership rights in a
    newly created trust, Franklin Mortgage Asset

Trust 2009-A

(Franklin 2009 Trust) which held all the underlying consumer
    loans and OREO that were formerly collateral for the Franklin
    commercial loans. The equity interests provided to Franklin by
    REIT were pledged by Franklin as collateral for the Franklin
    commercial loans.

Franklin 2009 Trust is a variable interest entity and, as a
    result of Huntington’s 83% participation certificates,
    Franklin 2009 Trust was consolidated into Huntington’s
    financial results. The consolidation was recorded as a business
    combination with the fair value of the equity interests issued
    to Franklin representing the acquisition price.

ASC

310-30

provides guidance for accounting for acquired loans, such as
    these, that have experienced a deterioration of credit quality
    at the time of acquisition for which it is probable the investor
    will be unable to collect all contractually required payments.

The following table presents a rollforward of the accretable

Result of the reclassification of loans to nonaccrual status.

In 2010, we sold our portfolio of Franklin-related loans to
    third parties. During the year-ended December 31, 2010, we
    recorded $87.0 million of Franklin-related provision for
    credit losses and NCOs, of which $75.5 million related to
    the loan sales. At December 31, 2010, the only
    nonperforming Franklin-related assets remaining were
    $9.5 million of OREO properties, which have been marked to
    the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. At
    December 31, 2009, $338.5 million of nonperforming
    Franklin-related assets were outstanding. Additionally, the
    equity interests in the REIT held by Franklin remain outstanding
    and pledged as collateral for the Franklin commercial loans at
    December 31, 2010.

In accordance with ASC 805, at March 31, 2009,
    Huntington has recorded a net deferred tax asset of
    $159.9 million related to the difference between the tax
    basis and the book basis in the acquired assets. Because the
    acquisition price, represented by the equity interests in the
    Huntington wholly-owned subsidiary, was equal to the fair value
    of the 83% interest in the Franklin 2009 Trust participant
    certificate, no goodwill was created from the transaction. The
    recording of the net deferred tax asset resulted in a bargain
    purchase under ASC 805, and, therefore, was recorded as tax
    benefit in the 2009 first quarter. On March 31, 2010, the
    net deferred tax asset increased by $43.6 million as a
    result of the acquired assets no longer being subject to the
    limitations of Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 382. In
    general, the limitations under IRC Section 382 apply to bad
    debt deductions, but IRC Section 382 only applies to bad
    debt deductions recognized within one



year of acquisition. Any bad debt deductions recognized after
    March 31, 2010, would not be limited by IRC
    Section 382.

Pledged
    Loans and Leases

At December 31, 2010, $9.7 billion of commercial and
    industrial loans and home equity loans were pledged to secure
    potential discount window borrowings from the Federal Reserve
    Bank, and $7.8 billion of real estate loans were pledged to
    secure advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank.

Huntington adopted the current OTTI provisions of ASC Topic 320
    on April 1, 2009.

Huntington applied the related OTTI guidance as further
    described in Note 1 on the debt security types listed below.

Alt-A mortgage-backed and private-label CMO
    securities

represent securities collateralized by
    first-lien residential mortgage loans. The securities are valued
    by a third party specialist using a discounted cash flow
    approach and proprietary pricing model. The model used inputs
    such as estimated prepayment speeds, losses, recoveries, default
    rates that were implied by the underlying performance of
    collateral in the structure or similar structures, discount
    rates that were implied by market prices for similar securities,
    collateral structure types, and house price
    depreciation/appreciation rates that were based upon
    macroeconomic forecasts.

Pooled-trust-preferred securities

represent CDOs
    backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial
    institutions. The collateral generally consisted of
    trust-preferred securities and subordinated debt securities
    issued by banks, bank holding companies, and insurance
    companies. A full cash flow analysis was used to estimate fair
    values and assess impairment for each security within this
    portfolio. We engaged a third party specialist with direct
    industry experience in pooled-trust-preferred securities
    valuations to provide assistance in estimating the fair value
    and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio.
    Relying on cash flows is necessary because there was a lack of
    observable transactions in the market and many of the original
    sponsors or dealers for these securities are no longer able to
    provide a fair value that is compliant with ASC 820.



For the period ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
    following tables summarize by debt security type, total OTTI
    losses, OTTI losses included in OCI, and OTTI recognized in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income for securities evaluated for

Huntington adopted the updated OTTI provisions on April 1,
    2009. Amounts represent activity from adoption date through
    December 31, 2009.

The fair values of these assets have been impacted by various
    market conditions. The unrealized losses were primarily the
    result of wider liquidity spreads on asset-backed securities
    and, additionally, increased market volatility on nonagency
    mortgage and asset-backed securities that are collateralized by
    certain mortgage loans. In addition, the expected average lives
    of the asset-backed securities backed by trust-preferred
    securities have been extended, due to changes in the
    expectations of when the underlying securities would be repaid.
    The contractual terms

and/or

cash
    flows of the investments do not permit the issuer to settle the
    securities at a price less than the amortized cost. Huntington
    does not intend to sell, nor does it believe it will be required
    to sell these securities until the fair value is recovered,
    which may be maturity and, therefore, does not consider them to
    be

other-than-temporarily

impaired at December 31, 2010.

As of December 31, 2010, Management has evaluated all other
    investment securities with unrealized losses and all
    nonmarketable securities for impairment and concluded no
    additional OTTI is required.

5.

LOAN
    SALES AND SECURITIZATIONS

Residential
    Mortgage Loans

For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008,
    Huntington sold $3.9 billion, $4.3 billion, and
    $2.8 billion of residential mortgage loans with servicing
    retained, resulting in net pretax gains of $106.5 million,
    $87.2 million, and $27.8 million, respectively,
    recorded in other noninterest income.

A MSR is established only when the servicing is contractually
    separated from the underlying mortgage loans by sale or
    securitization of the loans with servicing rights retained. At
    initial recognition, the MSR asset is established at its fair
    value using assumptions consistent with assumptions used to
    estimate the fair value of existing MSRs carried at fair value
    in the portfolio. At the time of initial capitalization, MSRs
    are grouped into one of two categories depending on whether or
    not Huntington intends to actively hedge the asset. MSR assets
    are recorded using the fair value method if the Company will
    actively engage in hedging the asset and recorded using the
    amortization method if no active hedging will be performed. MSRs
    are included in accrued income and other assets. Any increase or
    decrease in the fair value of MSRs carried under the fair value
    method, as well as amortization or impairment of MSRs recorded
    using the amortization method, during the period is recorded as
    an increase or decrease in mortgage banking income, which is
    reflected in noninterest income in the consolidated statements
    of income.



The following tables summarize the changes in MSRs recorded
    using either the fair value method or the amortization method
    for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009:

MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily
    observable prices. While sales of MSRs occur, the precise terms
    and conditions are typically not readily available. Therefore,
    the fair value of MSRs is estimated using a discounted future
    cash flow model. The model considers portfolio characteristics,
    contractually specified servicing fees and assumptions related
    to prepayments, delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary
    revenues, costs to service, and other economic factors. Changes
    in the assumptions used may have a significant impact on the
    valuation of MSRs.

A summary of key assumptions and the sensitivity of the MSR
    value at December 31, 2010 to changes in these assumptions
    follows:

(2,791

MSR values are very sensitive to movements in interest rates as
    expected future net servicing income depends on the projected
    outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which
    can be greatly impacted by the level of prepayments. The Company
    hedges against changes in MSR fair value attributable to changes
    in interest rates through a combination of derivative
    instruments and trading securities.

Total servicing fees included in mortgage banking income
    amounted to $48.1 million, $48.5 million, and
    $45.6 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The
    unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage



loans serviced for third parties was $15.9 billion,
    $16.0 billion, and $15.8 billion at December 31,
    2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Automobile
    Loans and Leases

With the adoption of amended accounting guidance for the
    consolidation of VIEs on January 1, 2010, Huntington
    consolidated a trust containing automobile loans. As a result of
    this consolidation, total assets increased $621.6 million,
    total liabilities increased $629.3 million, and a negative
    cumulative effect adjustment to OCI and retained earnings of
    $6.1 million was recorded.

(See Note 21 for more
    information regarding the consolidation of the 2009 Trust)

Automobile loan servicing rights are accounted for under the
    amortization method. A servicing asset is established at fair
    value at the time of the sale using the following assumptions:
    actual servicing income of 0.55% — 1.00%, adequate
    compensation for servicing of 0.50% — 0.65%, other
    ancillary fees of approximately 0.37% — 0.50%, a
    discount rate of 2% — 10% and an estimated return on
    payments prior to remittance to investors. The servicing asset
    is then amortized against servicing income. Impairment, if any,
    is recognized when carrying value exceeds the fair value as
    determined by calculating the present value of expected net
    future cash flows. The primary risk characteristic for measuring
    servicing assets is payoff rates of the underlying loan pools.
    Valuation calculations rely on the predicted payoff assumption
    and, if actual payoff is quicker than expected, then future
    value would be impaired.

Changes in the carrying value of automobile loan servicing
    rights for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, and
    the fair value at the end of each period were as follows:

    assets, amounted to $2.5 million, $6.4 million and
    $6.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. The unpaid principal balance of
    automobile loans serviced for third parties was
    $0.1 billion, $1.1 billion, and $0.5 billion at
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

ALLOWANCE
    FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The Company maintains two reserves, both of which are available
    to absorb probable credit losses: the ALLL and the AULC. When
    summed together, these reserves constitute the ACL. A summary of
    the transactions in the ACL and details regarding impaired loans
    and leases follows for the three years ended December 31,

    greater than $1 million for business-banking loans, and
    $500,000 for all other loans. A loan is impaired when it is
    probable that Huntington will be unable to collect all amounts
    due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
    The recovery of the investment in impaired loans with no
    specific reserves generally is expected from the sale of
    collateral, net of costs to sell that collateral.

As a result of the troubled debt restructuring, the loans to
    Franklin of $0.7 billion are included in impaired loans at
    the end of 2008.

The credit quality indicator presented for all classes within
    the C&I and CRE portfolios is the UCS classification. This
    classification is a widely-used and standard system representing
    the degree of risk of nonpayment. The categories presented in
    the following table are:

Pass

= Commercial loans categorized as Pass are higher
    quality loans that do not fit any of the other categories
    described below.



OLEM

= Commercial loans categorized as OLEM are
    potentially weak. The credit risk may be relatively minor yet
    represent a risk given certain specific circumstances. If the
    potential weaknesses are not monitored or mitigated, the asset
    may weaken or inadequately protect the Company’s position
    in the future.

Substandard

= Commercial loans categorized as Substandard
    are inadequately protected by the borrower’s ability to
    repay, equity,

and/or

the
    collateral pledged to secure the loan. These loans have
    identified weaknesses that could hinder normal repayment or
    collection of the debt. It is likely that the Company will
    sustain some loss if any identified weaknesses are not mitigated.

Doubtful

= Commercial loans categorized as Doubtful have
    all of the weaknesses inherent in those loans classified as
    Substandard, with the added elements of the full collection of
    the loan is improbable and that the possibility of loss is high.

Commercial loans categorized as OLEM, Substandard, or Doubtful
    are considered Criticized. Commercial loans categorized as
    Substandard or Doubtful are considered Classified.

The indicator presented for all classes within the automobile
    loan, home equity, residential mortgage, and other consumer loan
    portfolios is the FICO credit bureau score. A FICO credit bureau
    score is a credit score developed by Fair Isaac Corporation
    based on data provided by the credit bureaus. The FICO credit
    bureau score is the world’s most used credit score and
    represents the standard measure of consumer credit risk used by
    lenders, regulators, rating agencies, and consumers. The higher
    the FICO credit bureau score, the better the odds of repayment
    and therefore, an indicator of lower credit risk.

    quality indicator as of December 31, 2010.

GOODWILL
    AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

During the second quarter of 2009, Huntington reorganized its
    internal reporting structure. The Regional Banking reporting
    unit, which through March 31, 2009 had been managed
    geographically, became managed on a product segment approach.
    Regional Banking was divided into Retail and Business Banking,
    Commercial Banking, and Commercial Real Estate segments.
    Regional Banking goodwill was assigned to the new reporting
    units affected using a relative fair value allocation.
    Automobile Finance and Dealer Services (AFDS), Private Financial
    Group (PFG), and Treasury / Other remained essentially
    unchanged.

In late 2010, Huntington again reorganized its internal
    reporting structure. Business segments are based on segment
    leadership structure, which reflects how segment performance is
    monitored and assessed. The primary changes to the business
    segments were: (1) the AFDS and Commercial Real Estate
    segments were combined into one segment, (2) the Home
    Lending area moved from the Retail and Business Banking segment
    to the PFG segment, (3) the PFG segment was renamed Wealth
    Advisors, Government Finance, and Home Lending (WGH), and
    (4) the insurance business area moved from WGH to
    Treasury / Other.

A rollforward of goodwill by business segment for the years
    ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, including the
    reallocation noted above, was as follows:

Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment on an
    annual basis at October 1st of each year or whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value may not be recoverable. In 2010, we performed interim
    evaluations of our goodwill balances at March 31 and
    June 30, as well as our annual goodwill impairment
    assessment as of October 1. The interim and annual
    assessments were based on our reporting units at that time. No
    impairment was recorded in 2010.

During the first quarter of 2009, Huntington experienced a
    sustained decline in its stock price, which was primarily
    attributable to the continuing economic slowdown and increased
    market concern surrounding financial institutions’ credit
    risks and capital positions as well as uncertainty related to
    increased regulatory supervision and intervention. Huntington
    determined that these changes would more likely than not reduce
    the fair value of certain reporting units below their carrying
    amounts. Therefore, Huntington performed a goodwill impairment
    test, which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of
    $2.6 billion in the 2009 first quarter. An impairment
    charge of $4.2 million was recorded in the 2009 second
    quarter related to a small payments-related business sold in
    July 2009. Huntington concluded that no other goodwill
    impairment was required during 2009.

Goodwill acquired during 2009 was the result of
    Huntington’s assumption of the deposits and certain assets
    of Warren Bank in October 2009. In 2010, Huntington transferred
    goodwill between business segments in response to organizational
    changes in its internal reporting structure.

FEDERAL
    HOME LOAN BANK ADVANCES

Huntington’s long-term advances from the Federal Home Loan
    Bank had weighted average interest rates of 0.56% and 0.88% at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These advances,
    which predominantly had variable interest rates, were
    collateralized by qualifying real estate loans. As of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, Huntington’s maximum
    borrowing capacity was $2.3 billion and $3.0 billion,
    respectively. The advances outstanding at December 31, 2010
    of $172.5 million mature as follows: $154.9 million in
    2011; none in 2012; $9.6 million in 2013; none in 2014; and
    $8.0 million in 2015 and thereafter.

Amounts above are net of unamortized discounts and adjustments
    related to hedging with derivative financial instruments. The
    derivative instruments, principally interest rate swaps, are
    used to hedge the fair values of certain fixed-rate debt by
    converting the debt to a variable rate. See Note 20 for
    more information regarding such financial instruments.



In 2010, approximately $92.1 million of municipal
    securities, $86.0 million in Huntington Preferred Capital,
    Inc. (Real Estate Investment Trust) Class E Preferred Stock
    and cash of $6.1 million were transferred to Tower Hill
    Securities, Inc., an unconsolidated entity, in exchange for
    $184.1 million of Common and Preferred Stock of Tower Hill
    Securities, Inc. The municipal securities and the REIT Shares
    will be used to satisfy $65.0 million of mandatorily
    redeemable securities issued by Tower Hill Securities, Inc. and
    are not available to satisfy the general debts and obligations
    of Huntington or any consolidated affiliates. The transfer did
    not meet the sale requirement of ASC 860 and therefore has
    been recorded as a secured financing on the Consolidated Balance
    Sheet of Huntington at December 31, 2010.

In the 2009 first quarter, the Bank issued $600 million of
    guaranteed debt through the TLGP with the FDIC. The majority of
    the resulting proceeds were used to repay unsecured other
    long-term debt obligations maturing in 2009.

Other long-term debt maturities for the next five years and
    thereafter are as follows:

and thereafter

1,027,270

These maturities are based upon the par values of the long-term
    debt.

The terms of the other long-term debt obligations contain
    various restrictive covenants including limitations on the
    acquisition of additional debt in excess of specified levels,
    dividend payments, and the disposition of subsidiaries. As of
    December 31, 2010, Huntington was in compliance with all
    such covenants.

Amounts above are net of unamortized discounts and adjustments
    related to hedging with derivative financial instruments. The
    derivative instruments, principally interest rate swaps, are
    used to match the funding rates on certain assets to hedge the
    interest rate values of certain fixed-rate debt by converting
    the debt to a variable rate. See Note 20 for more
    information regarding such financial instruments. All principal
    is due upon maturity of the note as described in the table above.

During 2009, Huntington repurchased $702.4 million of
    junior subordinated debentures, bank subordinated notes, and
    medium-term notes resulting in net pre-tax gains of
    $147.4 million. In 2008, $48.5 million of the junior
    subordinated debentures were repurchased resulting in net
    pre-tax gains of $23.5 million. These transactions have
    been recorded as gains on early extinguishment of debt, a
    reduction of noninterest expense in the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

SHAREHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

Repurchase
    of Outstanding TARP Capital and Warrant to Repurchase Common
    Stock

In 2008, Huntington received $1.4 billion of equity capital
    by issuing to the Treasury 1.4 million shares of
    Huntington’s 5.00% Series B Non voting Cumulative
    preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share with a liquidation
    preference of $1,000 per share (TARP Capital), and a ten-year
    warrant to purchase up to 23.6 million shares of
    Huntington’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at an
    exercise price of $8.90 per share. The proceeds received were
    allocated to the preferred stock and additional

paid-in-capital

for the warrant based on their relative fair values. The
    resulting discount on the preferred stock was amortized against
    retained earnings and was recorded in Huntington’s
    Consolidated Statements of Income as dividends on preferred
    shares, resulting in reduction to Huntington’s net income
    applicable to common shares.

As approved by the Federal Reserve Board, the Treasury, and our
    other banking regulators, on December 22, 2010, Huntington
    repurchased all 1.4 million shares of our TARP Capital held
    by the Treasury totaling $1.4 billion. Huntington used the
    net proceeds from the issuance of common stock discussed below
    and $300 million of 7.00% Subordinated Notes due 2020
    and other funds to redeem the TARP Capital. On January 19,
    2011, Huntington repurchased the warrant originally issued to
    the Treasury for a purchase price of $49.1 million.

In connection with the repurchase of the TARP Capital,
    Huntington accelerated the accretion of the remaining issuance
    discount on the TARP Capital and recorded a corresponding deemed
    dividend on preferred shares of $56.3 million. This
    resulted in a one-time, noncash reduction in net income
    attributable to common shareholders and related basic and
    diluted earnings per share. The total reduction in net income
    attributable to common shareholders from the TARP Capital
    issuance discount accretion was $73.1 million and
    $16.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2010
    and 2009, respectively.

For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, Huntington
    paid dividends of $77.1 million and $70.1 million,
    respectively, to the Treasury. This represents the total
    dividends paid to the Treasury while the TARP Capital was
    outstanding.

Issuance
    of Common Stock

During the past two years, Huntington completed several
    transactions to increase capital, in particular, common equity.

During the 2010 fourth quarter, Huntington completed an offering
    of 146.0 million shares of common stock at a price of $6.30
    per share, or $920.0 million in aggregate gross proceeds.

In 2009, Huntington completed an offering of 109.5 million
    shares of its common stock at a price of $4.20 per share, or
    $460.1 million in aggregate gross proceeds. Also, during
    2009, Huntington completed an offering of 103.5 million
    shares of its common stock at a price of $3.60 per share, or
    $372.6 million in aggregate gross proceeds.

Also, during 2009, Huntington completed three separate
    discretionary equity issuance programs. These programs allowed
    the Company to take advantage of market opportunities to issue a
    total of 92.7 million new shares of common stock worth a
    total of $345.8 million. Sales of the common shares were
    made through ordinary brokers’ transactions on the NASDAQ
    Global Select Market or otherwise at the prevailing market
    prices.

Change
    in Shares Authorized

During the second quarter of 2010, Huntington amended its
    charter to increase the number of authorized shares of common
    stock from 1.0 billion shares to 1.5 billion shares.



Conversion
    of Convertible Preferred Stock

In 2008, Huntington completed the public offering of
    569,000 shares of 8.50% Series A Non-Cumulative
    Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock (Series A Preferred
    Stock) with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share,
    resulting in an aggregate liquidation preference of
    $569 million.

During the 2009 first and second quarters, Huntington entered
    into agreements with various institutional investors exchanging
    shares of common stock for shares of the Series A Preferred
    Stock held by the institutional investors. In aggregate,
    0.2 million shares of Series A Preferred Stock were
    exchanged for 41.1 million shares of Huntington Common
    Stock. A deemed dividend of $56.0 million was recorded for
    common shares issued in excess of the stated conversion rate.

Each share of the Series A Preferred Stock is non-voting
    and may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder,
    into 83.668 shares of common stock of Huntington, which
    represents an approximate initial conversion price of $11.95 per
    share of common stock (for a total of approximately
    30.3 million shares at December 31, 2010). The
    conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to
    adjustments in certain circumstances. On or after April 15,
    2013, at the option of Huntington, any remaining Series A
    Preferred Stock will be subject to mandatory conversion into
    Huntington’s common stock at the prevailing conversion
    rate, if the closing price of Huntington’s common stock
    exceeds 130% of the conversion price for 20 trading days during
    any 30 consecutive trading day period.

Share
    Repurchase Program

Huntington did not repurchase any shares for the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. As a condition to participate
    in the TARP, Huntington could not repurchase any additional
    shares without prior approval from the Treasury.

15.

EARNINGS
    (LOSS) PER SHARE

Basic earnings (loss) per share is the amount of earnings (loss)
    (adjusted for dividends declared on preferred stock) available
    to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting
    period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is the amount of
    earnings (loss) available to each share of common stock
    outstanding during the reporting period adjusted to include the
    effect of potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially
    dilutive common shares include incremental shares issued for
    stock options, restricted stock units and awards, distributions
    from deferred compensation plans, and the conversion of the
    Company’s convertible preferred stock and warrants (See
    Note 14). Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded
    from the computation of diluted earnings per share in periods in
    which the effect would be antidilutive. For diluted earnings
    (loss) per share, net income (loss) available to common shares
    can be affected by the conversion of the Company’s
    convertible preferred stock. Where the effect of this conversion
    would be dilutive, net income (loss) available to common
    shareholders is adjusted by the associated preferred dividends
    and deemed dividend. The



calculation of basic and diluted (loss) earnings per share for
    each of the three years ended December 31 was as follows:

Due to the loss attributable to common shareholders for the
    years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, no potentially
    dilutive shares are included in loss per share calculation as
    including such shares in the calculation would reduce the
    reported loss per share. Approximately 18.5 million,
    23.7 million, and 26.3 million options to purchase
    shares of common stock outstanding at the end of 2010, 2009, and
    2008, respectively, were not included in the computation of
    diluted earnings per share because the effect would be
    antidilutive. The weighted average exercise price for these
    options was $18.05 per share, $19.71 per share, and $19.45 per
    share at the end of each respective period.

16.

SHARE-BASED
    COMPENSATION

Huntington sponsors nonqualified and incentive share based
    compensation plans. These plans provide for the granting of
    stock options and other awards to officers, directors, and other
    employees. Compensation costs are included in personnel costs on
    the Consolidated Statements of Income. Stock options are granted
    at the closing market price on the date of the grant. Options
    granted typically vest ratably over three years or when other
    conditions are met. Options granted prior to May 2004 have a
    term of ten years. All options granted after May 2004 have a
    term of seven years.

Huntington uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value
    share-based compensation expense. Forfeitures are estimated at
    the date of grant based on historical rates and reduce the
    compensation expense recognized. The risk-free interest rate is
    based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the
    date of grant. Expected volatility is based on the estimated
    volatility of Huntington’s stock over the expected term of
    the option. The expected dividend yield is based on the dividend
    rate and stock price at the date of the grant. The



following table illustrates the weighted average assumptions
    used in the option-pricing model for options granted in the
    three years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008.

    forfeiture rate.

The number of options expected to vest includes an estimate of
    expected forfeitures.

The aggregate intrinsic value represents the amount by which the
    fair value of underlying stock exceeds the

“in-the-money”

option exercise price. For the year ended December 31,
    2010, cash received for the exercises of stock options was
    $0.2 million. The tax benefit realized for the tax
    deductions from option exercises totaled less than
    $0.1 million in 2010. There were no exercises of stock
    options for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Huntington also grants restricted stock units and awards.
    Restricted stock units and awards are issued at no cost to the
    recipient, and can be settled only in shares at the end of the
    vesting period. Restricted stock awards provide the holder with
    full voting rights and cash dividends during the vesting period.
    Restricted stock units do not provide the holder with voting
    rights or cash dividends during the vesting period, but do
    accrue a dividend equivalent that is paid upon vesting, and are
    subject to certain service restrictions. The fair value of the
    restricted stock units and awards is the closing market price of
    the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant.

    to any requirement of future service. However, the shares are
    subject to restrictions regarding sale, transfer, pledge, or

The weighted-average grant date fair value of nonvested shares
    granted for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and

    2010, 2009, and 2008, was $3.0 million, $1.8 million,
    and $0.4 million, respectively. As of December 31,

    27.9 million were outstanding and 16.9 million were
    available for future grants. Huntington issues shares to fulfill
    stock option exercises and restricted stock unit and award
    vesting from available authorized shares. At December 31,
    2010, the Company believes there are adequate authorized shares
    to satisfy anticipated stock option exercises and restricted
    stock unit and award vesting in 2011.

INCOME
    TAXES

The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the
    U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state, city, and
    foreign jurisdictions. Federal income tax audits have been
    completed through 2007. Various state and other jurisdictions
    remain open to examination for tax years 2000 and forward.

The IRS and state tax officials from Ohio and Kentucky have
    proposed adjustments to the Company’s previously filed tax
    returns. Management believes the tax positions taken by the
    Company related to such proposed adjustments were correct and
    supported by applicable statutes, regulations, and judicial
    authority, and



intend to vigorously defend them. It is possible the ultimate
    resolution of the proposed adjustments, if unfavorable, may be
    material to the results of operations in the period it occurs.
    However, although no assurance can be given, Management believes
    the resolution of these examinations will not, individually or
    in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position.

Huntington accounts for uncertainties in income taxes in
    accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. At December 31,
    2010, Huntington had gross unrecognized tax benefits of
    $49.5 million in income tax liability related to tax
    positions. Due to the complexities of some of these
    uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment
    that is materially different from the current estimate of the
    tax liabilities. However, any ultimate settlement is not
    expected to be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    as a whole. Huntington does not anticipate the total amount of
    gross unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change within
    the next 12 months.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning
    and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits:

Any interest and penalties on income tax assessments or income
    tax refunds are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of
    Income as a component of provision for income taxes. Huntington
    recognized $2.2 million of interest for the year ended
    December 31, 2010. There were no significant amounts
    recognized for interest and penalties for the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008. Total interest accrued at
    December 31, 2010 amounted to $2.2 million. All of the
    gross unrecognized tax benefits would impact the Company’s
    effective tax rate if recognized.

At December 31, 2010, Huntington’s deferred tax asset
    related to loss and other carryforwards was $262.5 million.
    This was comprised of net operating loss carryforward of
    $174.6 million, which will begin expiring in 2023, an
    alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of
    $37.3 million, a general business credit carryover of
    $18.8 million which will expire in 2029, and a capital loss
    carryforward of $31.8 million, which will expire in 2015.
    In 2010, Huntington entered into an asset monetization
    transaction that generated a $263.0 million capital loss.
    As a result of this transaction, a capital loss carryforward of
    $31.8 million was generated, which will expire in 2015. A
    valuation allowance of $31.8 million has been established
    for the capital loss carryforward because Management believes it
    is more likely than not that the realization of this asset will
    not occur. The valuation allowance on this asset increased
    $30.9 million from 2009. In Management’s opinion, the
    results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable
    income to realize the net operating loss, alternative minimum
    tax credit carryforward, and general business credit
    carryforward. Consequently, Huntington determined that a
    valuation allowance for these deferred tax assets was not
    required as of December 31, 2010.

Health
    Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010

On March 23, 2010, the HCER Act was signed into law. The
    HCER Act includes a provision to repeal the deduction for
    employer subsidies for retiree drug coverage under Medicare
    Part D. Under prior law, an employer offering retiree
    prescription drug coverage that is at least as valuable as
    Medicare Part D was entitled to a subsidy. Employers were
    able to deduct the entire cost of providing prescription drug
    coverage,



even though a portion was offset by the subsidy. For taxable
    years beginning after December 31, 2012, the HCER Act
    repeals the current rule permitting the deduction of the portion
    of the expense that was offset by the Part D subsidy. As a
    result of this provision, the deferred tax asset associated with
    prescription drug coverage was reduced by $3.6 million.

18.

BENEFIT
    PLANS

Huntington sponsors the Huntington Bancshares Retirement Plan
    (the Plan or Retirement Plan), a non-contributory defined
    benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees hired
    or rehired prior to January 1, 2010. The Plan provides
    benefits based upon length of service and compensation levels.
    The funding policy of Huntington is to contribute an annual
    amount that is at least equal to the minimum funding
    requirements but not more than that deductible under the
    Internal Revenue Code. There was no minimum required
    contribution to the Plan in 2010.

In addition, Huntington has an unfunded defined benefit
    post-retirement plan that provides certain health care and life
    insurance benefits to retired employees who have attained the
    age of 55 and have at least 10 years of vesting service
    under this plan. For any employee retiring on or after
    January 1, 1993, post-retirement healthcare benefits are
    based upon the employee’s number of months of service and
    are limited to the actual cost of coverage. Life insurance
    benefits are a percentage of the employee’s base salary at
    the time of retirement, with a maximum of $50,000 of coverage.
    The employer paid portion of the post-retirement health and life
    insurance plan was eliminated for employees retiring on and
    after March 1, 2010. Eligible employees retiring on and
    after March 1, 2010, who elect retiree medical coverage,
    will pay the full cost of this coverage. The Company will not
    provide any employer paid life insurance to employees retiring
    on and after March 1, 2010. Eligible employees will be able
    to convert or port their existing life insurance at their own
    expense under the same terms that are available to all
    terminated employees.

Beginning January 1, 2010, there were changes to the way
    the future early and normal retirement benefit is calculated
    under the Retirement Plan for service on and after
    January 1, 2010. While these changes did not affect the
    benefit earned under the Retirement Plan through
    December 31, 2009, there was a reduction in future
    benefits. In addition, employees hired or rehired on and after
    January 1, 2010 are not eligible to participate in the
    Retirement Plan.

On January 1, 2008, Huntington transitioned to fiscal
    year-end measurement date of plan assets and benefit
    obligations. As a result, Huntington recognized a charge to
    beginning retained earnings of $4.7 million, representing
    the net periodic benefit costs for the last three months of
    2007, and a charge to the opening balance of accumulated other
    comprehensive loss of $3.8 million, representing the change
    in fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations for the
    last three months of 2007 (net of amortization included in net
    periodic benefit cost).



The following table shows the weighted-average assumptions used
    to determine the benefit obligation at December 31, 2010
    and 2009, and the net periodic benefit cost for the years then

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is an
    assumption reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on
    the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits
    included in the projected benefit obligation. The expected
    long-term rate of return is established at the beginning of the
    plan year based upon historical returns and projected returns on
    the underlying mix of invested assets.

Included in benefit costs are $1.0 million,
    $0.7 million, and $0.6 million of plan expenses that
    were recognized in the three years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009, and 2008. It is Huntington’s policy to recognize
    settlement gains and losses as incurred. Assuming no cash
    contributions are made to the Plan during 2011, Management
    expects net periodic pension cost, excluding any expense of
    settlements, to approximate $31.1 million for 2011. There
    will be no net periodic post-retirement benefits costs in 2010,
    as the postretirement medical and life subsidy was eliminated
    for anyone that retires on or after March 1, 2010.

The estimated transition obligation, prior service credit, and
    net actuarial loss for the plans that will be amortized from OCI
    into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year is less
    than $1.0 million, $6.8 million, and
    $22.8 million, respectively.



At December 31, 2010 and 2009, The Huntington National
    Bank, as trustee, held all Plan assets. The Plan assets
    consisted of investments in a variety of Huntington mutual funds

Investments of the Plan are accounted for at cost on the trade
    date and are reported at fair value. All of the Plan’s
    investments at December 31, 2010 are classified as
    Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. In general,
    investments of the Plan are exposed to various risks, such as
    interest rate risk, credit risk, and overall market volatility.
    Due to the level of risk associated with certain investments, it
    is reasonably possible that changes in the values of investments
    will occur in the near term and that such changes could
    materially affect the amounts reported in the Plan assets.

The investment objective of the Plan is to maximize the return
    on Plan assets over a long time horizon, while meeting the Plan
    obligations. At December 31, 2010, Plan assets were
    invested 72% in equity investments and 28% in bonds, with an
    average duration of 4 years on fixed income investments.
    The estimated life of benefit obligations was 11 years.
    Management believes that this mix is appropriate for the current
    economic environment. Although it may fluctuate with market
    conditions, Management has targeted a long-term allocation of
    Plan assets of 70% in equity investments and 30% in bond
    investments.

The number of shares of Huntington common stock held by the Plan
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was 3,919,986 for both years.
    The Plan has acquired and held Huntington common stock in
    compliance at all times with Section 407 of the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act of 1978.

Dividends and interest received by the Plan during 2010 and 2009
    were $7.5 million and $8.4 million, respectively.



At December 31, 2010, the following table shows when
    benefit payments, which include expected future service, as
    appropriate, were expected to be paid:

Although not required, Huntington may choose to make a cash
    contribution to the Plan up to the maximum deductible limit in
    the 2011 plan year. Expected contributions for 2011 to the
    post-retirement benefit plan are $3.8 million.

The assumed healthcare cost trend rate has an effect on the
    amounts reported. A one percentage point increase would decrease
    service and interest costs and the post-retirement benefit
    obligation by less than $1.0 million and $0.2 million,
    respectively. A one percentage point decrease would increase
    service and interest costs and the post-retirement benefit
    obligation by less than $1.0 million and $0.2 million,
    respectively.

The 2011 and 2010 healthcare cost trend rate was projected to be
    8.5% for pre-65 aged participants and 9.3% for post-65 aged
    participants. These rates are assumed to decrease gradually
    until they reach 4.5% for both pre-65 aged participants and
    post-65 aged participants in the year 2028 and remain at that
    level thereafter. Huntington updated the immediate healthcare
    cost trend rate assumption based on current market data and
    Huntington’s claims experience. This trend rate is expected
    to decline over time to a trend level consistent with medical
    inflation and long-term economic assumptions.

Huntington also sponsors other retirement plans, the most
    significant being the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and
    the Supplemental Retirement Income Plan. These plans are
    nonqualified plans that provide certain current and former
    officers and directors of Huntington and its subsidiaries with
    defined pension benefits in excess of limits imposed by federal
    tax law. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, Huntington has an
    accrued pension liability of $23.1 million and
    $22.8 million, respectively, associated with these plans.
    Pension expense for the plans was $1.8 million,
    $2.8 million, and $2.4 million in 2010, 2009, and
    2008, respectively.

The following table presents the amounts recognized in the
    consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2010 and 2009

Huntington has a defined contribution plan that is available to
    eligible employees. In the first quarter of 2009, the plan was
    amended to eliminate employer matching contributions effective
    on or after March 15, 2009. Prior to March 15, 2009,
    Huntington matched participant contributions, up to the first 3%
    of base pay contributed to the plan. Half of the employee
    contribution was matched on the 4th and 5th percent of
    base pay contributed to the plan. Effective May 1, 2010,
    Huntington reinstated the employer matching contribution to the
    defined contribution plan. The cost of providing this plan was
    $8.8 million in 2010, $3.1 million in 2009, and
    $15.0 million in 2008. The number of shares of Huntington
    common stock held by this plan was 14,945,498 at
    December 31, 2010, and 14,714,170 at December 31,
    2009. The market value of these shares was $102.7 million
    and $53.7 million at the same respective dates. Dividends
    received on shares of Huntington common stock by the plan were
    $5.6 million during 2010 and $5.1 million during 2009.

FAIR
    VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be
    received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit
    price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the
    asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants on the measurement date. A three-level valuation
    hierarchy was established for disclosure of fair value
    measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the
    transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability
    as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as
    follows:

Level 1

— inputs to the valuation
    methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets
    or liabilities in active markets.

Level 2

— inputs to the valuation
    methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and
    liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable
    for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for
    substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

Level 3

— inputs to the valuation
    methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value
    measurement. Financial instruments are considered Level 3
    when values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash
    flow methodologies, or similar techniques, and at least one
    significant model assumption or input is unobservable.

A financial instrument’s categorization within the
    valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that
    is significant to the fair value measurement.



Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used
    for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general
    classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation
    hierarchy.

Financial Instrument(1)

Hierarchy

Valuation methodology

Mortgage loans held for sale

Level 2

Huntington elected to apply the fair value option for mortgage
    loans originated with the intent to sell which are included in
    loans held for sale. Mortgage loans held for sale are estimated
    using security prices for similar product types. At December 31,
    2010, mortgage loans held for sale had an aggregate fair value
    of $754.1 million and an aggregate outstanding principal balance
    of $750.0 million.  Interest income on these loans is recorded
    in interest and fee income - loans and leases.  Included in
    mortgage banking income were net gains resulting from
    origination and sale of these loans, including net realized
    gains of $109.2 million, $90.6 million, and $32.2 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008,
    respectively.  Of such gains, the change in fair value while
    held as loans were $(5.6) million, $(6.3) million and
    $6.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and
    2008, respectively.

Available-for-sale

Securities & Trading Account Securities(2)

Level 1

Consist primarily of U.S. Treasury and money market mutual
    funds, which generally have quoted prices.

Level 2

Consist of U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed and other
    federal agency securities, municipal securities, and other
    securities for which an active market is not available.  Third
    party pricing services provide a fair value estimate based upon
    trades of similar financial instruments.

Level 3

Consist of certain asset-backed securities,
    pooled-trust-preferred securities, private-label CMOs, and
    municipal securities for which fair value is estimated.
    Assumptions used to determine the fair value of these securities
    have greater subjectivity due to the lack of observable market
    transactions. Generally, there are only limited trades of
    similar instruments and a discounted cash flow approach is used
    to determine fair value.



Financial Instrument(1)

Hierarchy

Valuation methodology

Automobile loans(3)

Level 3

Consists of automobile loan receivables measured at fair value.
    The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the
    automobile loan receivables included projections of expected
    losses and prepayment of the underlying loans in the portfolio
    and a market assumption of interest rate spreads. The net gains
    and losses, before tax, from fair value changes reflected in
    earnings for the year ended December 31, 2010 was a net loss of
    $2.3 million which is net of a $3.4 million net gain associated
    with instrument specific credit risk. Instrument specific credit
    risk was determined based on estimated credit losses inherent in
    the January 1, 2010 fair value calculation as compared to actual
    credit losses incurred in 2010 plus estimated credit losses
    inherent in the December 31, 2010 fair value calculation.

MSRs(3)

Level 3

MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily
    observable prices. Although sales of MSRs do occur, the precise
    terms and conditions typically are not readily available. Fair
    value is determined on an income approach model based upon
    month-end interest rate curve and prepayment assumptions.

Derivatives(4)

Level 1

Consist of exchange traded options and forward commitments to
    deliver mortgage-backed securities which are valued using quoted
    prices.

Level 2

Consist of basic asset and liability conversion swaps and
    options, and interest rate caps. These derivative positions are
    valued using a discounted cash flow method that incorporates
    current market interest rates.

Level 3

Consist primarily of interest rate lock agreements related to
    mortgage loan commitments. The determination of fair value
    includes assumptions related to the likelihood that a commitment
    will ultimately result in a closed loan, which is a significant
    unobservable assumption.

Securitization trust notes payable(4)

Level 2

Consists of certain securitization trust notes payable related
    to the automobile loans measured at fair value. The notes
    payable are valued based on interest rates for similar financial
    instruments. The change in fair value for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 was $9.6 million.

The tables below present a rollforward of the balance sheet
    amounts for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and
    2008 for financial instruments measured on a recurring basis and
    classified as Level 3. The classification of an item as
    Level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable
    inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However,
    Level 3 measurements may also include observable components
    of value that can be validated externally. Accordingly, the
    gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair
    value due in part to observable factors that are part of the
    valuation methodology. Transfers in and out of Level 3 are
    presented in the tables below at fair value at the beginning of

Assets
    and Liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring
    basis

Certain assets and liabilities may be required to be measured at
    fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to
    their initial recognition. These assets and liabilities are not
    measured at fair value on an ongoing basis; however, they are
    subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such
    as when there is evidence of impairment. For the year ended
    December 31, 2010, assets measured at fair value on a
    nonrecurring basis were as follows:

Periodically, Huntington records nonrecurring adjustments of
    collateral-dependent loans measured for impairment when
    establishing the allowance for credit losses. Such amounts are
    generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral
    supporting the loan. Appraisals are generally obtained to
    support the fair value of the collateral and incorporate
    measures such as recent sales prices for comparable properties
    and cost



of construction. In cases where the carrying value exceeds the
    fair value of the collateral, an impairment charge is
    recognized. During the year ended December 31, 2010,
    Huntington identified $80.4 million of impaired loans for
    which the fair value is recorded based upon collateral value.
    For the year ended December 31, 2010, nonrecurring fair
    value losses of $39.6 million were recorded within the
    provision for credit losses.

Other real estate owned properties are valued based on
    appraisals and third party price opinions, less estimated
    selling costs. During the year ended December 31, 2010,
    Huntington recorded $66.8 million of OREO assets at fair
    value and recognized losses of $6.9 million, recorded
    within noninterest expense.

The short-term nature of certain assets and liabilities result
    in their carrying value approximating fair value. These include
    trading account securities, customers’ acceptance
    liabilities, short-term borrowings, bank acceptances
    outstanding, FHLB advances, and cash and short-term assets,
    which include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits
    in banks, and federal funds sold and securities purchased under
    resale agreements. Loan commitments and letters of credit
    generally have short-term, variable-rate features and contain
    clauses that limit Huntington’s exposure to changes in
    customer credit quality. Accordingly, their carrying values,
    which are immaterial at the respective balance sheet dates, are
    reasonable estimates of fair value. Not all the financial
    instruments listed in the table above are subject to the
    disclosure provisions of ASC Topic 820.

Certain assets, the most significant being operating lease
    assets, bank owned life insurance, and premises and equipment,
    do not meet the definition of a financial instrument and are
    excluded from this disclosure. Similarly, mortgage and
    nonmortgage servicing rights, deposit base, and other customer
    relationship intangibles are not considered financial
    instruments and are not included above. Accordingly, this fair
    value information is not intended to, and does not, represent
    Huntington’s underlying value. Many of the assets and
    liabilities subject to the disclosure requirements are not
    actively traded, requiring fair values to be estimated by
    Management. These estimations necessarily involve the use of
    judgment about a wide variety of factors,



including but not limited to, relevancy of market prices of
    comparable instruments, expected future cash flows, and
    appropriate discount rates.

The following methods and assumptions were used by Huntington to
    estimate the fair value of the remaining classes of financial
    instruments:

Loans and
    Direct Financing Leases

Variable-rate loans that reprice frequently are based on
    carrying amounts, as adjusted for estimated credit losses. The
    fair values for other loans and leases are estimated using
    discounted cash flow analyses and employ interest rates
    currently being offered for loans and leases with similar terms.
    The rates take into account the position of the yield curve, as
    well as an adjustment for prepayment risk, operating costs, and
    profit. This value is also reduced by an estimate of probable
    losses and the credit risk associated in the loan and lease
    portfolio. The valuation of the loan portfolio reflected
    discounts that Huntington believed are consistent with
    transactions occurring in the market place.

Deposits

Demand deposits, savings accounts, and money market deposits
    are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand. The
    fair values of fixed-rate time deposits are estimated by
    discounting cash flows using interest rates currently being
    offered on certificates with similar maturities.

Debt

Fixed-rate, long-term debt is based upon quoted market prices,
    which are inclusive of Huntington’s credit risk. In the
    absence of quoted market prices, discounted cash flows using
    market rates for similar debt with the same maturities are used
    in the determination of fair value.

DERIVATIVE
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Derivative financial instruments are recorded in the
    consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or a liability (in
    accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other
    liabilities, respectively) and measured at fair value.

Derivatives
    used in Asset and Liability Management Activities

A variety of derivative financial instruments, principally
    interest rate swaps, cap, floors, and collars, are used in asset
    and liability management activities to protect against the risk
    of adverse price or interest rate movements. These instruments
    provide flexibility in adjusting Huntington’s sensitivity
    to changes in interest rates without exposure to loss of
    principal and higher funding requirements. Huntington records
    derivatives at fair value, as further described in Note 19.
    Collateral agreements are regularly entered into as part of the
    underlying derivative agreements with Huntington’s
    counterparties to mitigate counter party credit risk. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, aggregate credit risk
    associated with these derivatives, net of collateral that has
    been pledged by the counterparty, was $39.9 million and
    $20.3 million, respectively. The credit risk associated
    with derivatives used in asset and liability management
    activities is calculated after considering master netting
    agreements.

At December 31, 2010, Huntington pledged
    $203.4 million of investment securities and cash collateral
    to counterparties, while other counterparties pledged
    $85.2 million of investment securities and cash collateral
    to Huntington to satisfy collateral netting agreements. In the
    event of credit downgrades, Huntington could be required to
    provide an additional $5.3 million in collateral.

These derivative financial instruments were entered into for the
    purpose of managing the interest rate risk of assets and
    liabilities. Consequently, net amounts receivable or payable on
    contracts hedging either interest earning assets or interest
    bearing liabilities were accrued as an adjustment to either
    interest income or interest expense. The net amounts resulted in
    an increase to net interest income of $192.2 million,
    $167.9 million, and $10.5 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

In connection with securitization activities, Huntington
    purchased interest rate caps with a notional value totaling
    $1.0 billion. These purchased caps were assigned to the
    securitization trust for the benefit of the security holders.
    Interest rate caps were also sold totaling $1.0 billion
    outside the securitization structure. Both the purchased and
    sold caps are marked to market through income.

In connection with the sale of Huntington’s Class B
    Visa

®

shares, Huntington entered into a swap agreement with the
    purchaser of the shares. The swap agreement adjusts for dilution
    in the conversion ratio of Class B shares resulting from
    the
    Visa

®

litigation. At December 31, the fair value of the swap
    liability of $0.4 million is an estimate of the exposure
    liability based upon Huntington’s assessment of the
    potential
    Visa

®

litigation losses.

    obligations to floating rate. The changes in fair value of the
    derivative are, to the extent that the hedging relationship is
    effective, recorded through earnings and offset against changes
    in the fair value of the hedged item.

The following table presents the change in fair value for
    derivatives designated as fair value hedges as well as the

For cash flow hedges, interest rate swap contracts were entered
    into that pay fixed-rate interest in exchange for the receipt of
    variable-rate interest without the exchange of the
    contract’s underlying notional amount, which effectively
    converts a portion of its floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate
    debt. This reduces the



potentially adverse impact of increases in interest rates on
    future interest expense. Other LIBOR-based commercial and
    industrial loans were effectively converted to fixed-rate by
    entering into contracts that swap certain variable-rate interest
    payments for fixed-rate interest payments at designated times.

To the extent these derivatives are effective in offsetting the
    variability of the hedged cash flows, changes in the
    derivatives’ fair value will not be included in current
    earnings but are reported as a component of OCI in the
    Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity. These
    changes in fair value will be included in earnings of future
    periods when earnings are also affected by the changes in the
    hedged cash flows. To the extent these derivatives are not
    effective, changes in their fair values are immediately included
    in interest income.

The following table presents the gains and (losses) recognized
    in OCI and the location in the Consolidated Statements of Income

Derivatives
    used in trading activities

Various derivative financial instruments are offered to enable
    customers to meet their financing and investing objectives and
    for their risk management purposes. Derivative financial
    instruments used in trading activities consisted predominantly
    of interest rate swaps, but also included interest rate caps,
    floors, and futures, as well as foreign exchange options.
    Interest rate options grant the option holder the right to buy
    or sell an underlying financial instrument for a predetermined
    price before the contract expires. Interest rate futures are
    commitments to either purchase or sell a financial instrument at
    a future date for a specified price or yield and may be settled
    in cash or through delivery of the underlying financial
    instrument. Interest rate caps and floors are option-based
    contracts that entitle the buyer to receive cash payments based
    on the difference between a designated reference rate and a
    strike price, applied to a notional amount. Written options,
    primarily caps, expose Huntington to market risk but not credit
    risk. Purchased options contain both credit and market risk. The
    interest rate risk of these customer derivatives is mitigated by
    entering into similar derivatives having offsetting terms with
    other counterparties. The credit risk to these customers is
    evaluated and included in the calculation of fair value.

The net fair values of these derivative financial instruments,
    for which the gross amounts are included in accrued income and
    other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, were $46.3 million and
    $45.1 million, respectively. The total notional values of
    derivative financial instruments used by Huntington on behalf of
    customers, including offsetting derivatives, were
    $9.8 billion and $9.6 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. Huntington’s credit risks from
    interest rate swaps used for trading purposes were
    $263.0 million and $255.7 million at the same dates,
    respectively.

Derivatives
    used in mortgage banking activities

Huntington also uses certain derivative financial instruments to
    offset changes in value of its residential MSRs. These
    derivatives consist primarily of forward interest rate
    agreements and forward mortgage securities. The derivative
    instruments used are not designated as hedges. Accordingly, such
    derivatives are recorded at fair value with changes in fair
    value reflected in mortgage banking income. The following table
    summarizes the derivative assets and liabilities used in
    mortgage banking activities:

    notional amount at December 31, 2010 corresponds to trading
    assets with a fair value of $2.7 million and trading
    liabilities with a fair value of $16.0 million. Total MSR
    hedging gains and (losses) for the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009, and 2008, were $55.0 million,
    ($37.8) million, and $22.4 million, respectively.
    Included in total MSR hedging gains and losses for the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 were gains and
    (losses) related to derivatives instruments of
    $64.6 million, ($41.2) million, and
    ($19.0) million, respectively. These amounts are included
    in mortgage banking income in the Consolidated Statements of
    Income.

VIEs

Consolidated
    VIEs

Consolidated VIEs at December 31, 2010 consist of the
    Franklin 2009 Trust (See Note 3) and certain loan
    securitization trusts. Loan securitizations include auto loan
    and lease securitization trusts formed in 2009, 2008, and 2006.
    Huntington has determined the trusts are VIEs. Through
    Huntington’s continuing involvement in the trusts
    (including ownership of beneficial interests and certain
    servicing or collateral management activities), Huntington is
    the primary beneficiary.

With the adoption of amended accounting guidance for VIEs,
    Huntington consolidated the 2009 Trust containing automobile
    loans on January 1, 2010. Huntington elected the fair value
    option under ASC 825, Financial Instruments, for both the
    automobile loans and the related debt obligations. Upon adoption
    of the new accounting standards, total assets increased
    $621.6 million, total liabilities increased

The auto loans and leases were designated to repay the
    securitized notes. Huntington services the loans and leases and
    uses the proceeds from principal and interest payments to pay
    the securitized notes during the amortization period. Huntington
    has not provided financial or other support that was not
    previously contractually required.

Trust-Preferred
    Securities

Huntington has certain wholly-owned trusts that are not
    consolidated. The trusts have been formed for the sole purpose
    of issuing trust-preferred securities, from which the proceeds
    are then invested in Huntington junior subordinated debentures,
    which are reflected in Huntington’s Consolidated Balance
    Sheet as subordinated notes. The trust securities are the
    obligations of the trusts and are not consolidated within
    Huntington’s



Consolidated Financial Statements. A list of trust-preferred
    securities outstanding at December 31, 2010 follows:

Each issue of the junior subordinated debentures has an interest
    rate equal to the corresponding trust securities distribution
    rate. Huntington has the right to defer payment of interest on
    the debentures at any time, or from time to time for a period
    not exceeding five years, provided that no extension period may
    extend beyond the stated maturity of the related debentures.
    During any such extension period, distributions to the trust
    securities will also be deferred and Huntington’s ability
    to pay dividends on its common stock will be restricted.
    Periodic cash payments and payments upon liquidation or
    redemption with respect to trust securities are guaranteed by
    Huntington to the extent of funds held by the trusts. The
    guarantee ranks subordinate and junior in right of payment to
    all indebtedness of the Company to the same extent as the junior
    subordinated debt. The guarantee does not place a limitation on
    the amount of additional indebtedness that may be incurred by
    Huntington.

Low
    Income Housing Tax Credit Partnerships

Huntington makes certain equity investments in various limited
    partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing
    the Low Income Housing Tax Credit pursuant to Section 42 of
    the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of these investments is
    to achieve a satisfactory return on capital, to facilitate the
    sale of additional affordable housing product offerings, and to
    assist in achieving goals associated with the Community
    Reinvestment Act. The primary activities of the limited
    partnerships include the identification, development, and
    operation of multi-family housing that is leased to qualifying
    residential tenants. Generally, these types of investments are
    funded through a combination of debt and equity.

Huntington does not own a majority of the limited partnership
    interests in these entities and is not the primary beneficiary.
    Huntington uses the equity method to account for the majority of
    its investments in these entities. These investments are
    included in accrued income and other assets. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, Huntington has commitments of
    $316.0 million and $285.3 million, respectively, of
    which $260.1 million and



$192.7 million, respectively, are funded. The unfunded
    portion is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

Commitments
    to extend credit

In the ordinary course of business, Huntington makes various
    commitments to extend credit that are not reflected in the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. The contract amounts of these
    financial agreements at December 31, 2010, and
    December 31, 2009, were as follows:

At December 31,

Standby letters of credit



Commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration
    dates, are variable-rate, and contain clauses that permit
    Huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts
    in the event of a significant deterioration in the
    customer’s credit quality. These arrangements normally
    require the payment of a fee by the customer, the pricing of
    which is based on prevailing market conditions, credit quality,
    probability of funding, and other relevant factors. Since many
    of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn
    upon, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of
    future cash requirements. The interest rate risk arising from
    these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of
    their predominantly short-term, variable-rate nature.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to
    guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These
    guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private
    borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond
    financing, and similar transactions. Most of these arrangements
    mature within two years. The carrying amount of deferred revenue
    associated with these guarantees was $2.2 million and
    $2.8 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.

Through the Company’s credit process, Huntington monitors
    the credit risks of outstanding standby letters of credit. When
    it is probable that a standby letter of credit will be drawn and
    not repaid in full, losses are recognized in the provision for
    credit losses. At December 31, 2010, Huntington had
    $0.6 billion of standby letters of credit outstanding, of
    which 73% were collateralized. Included in this
    $0.6 billion total are letters of credit issued by the Bank
    that support securities that were issued by customers and
    remarketed by The Huntington Investment Company, the
    Company’s broker-dealer subsidiary.

Huntington uses an internal loan grading system to assess an
    estimate of loss on its loan and lease portfolio. The same loan
    grading system is used to help monitor credit risk associated
    with standby letters of credit. Under this risk rating system as
    of December 31, 2010, approximately $72.2 million of
    the standby letters of credit were rated strong with sufficient
    asset quality, liquidity, and good debt capacity and coverage,
    approximately $460.2 million were rated average with
    acceptable asset quality, liquidity, and modest debt capacity;
    and approximately $74.5 million were rated substandard with
    negative financial trends, structural weaknesses, operating
    difficulties, and higher leverage.

Commercial letters of credit represent short-term,
    self-liquidating instruments that facilitate customer trade
    transactions and generally have maturities of no longer than
    90 days. The goods or cargo being traded normally secures
    these instruments.



Commitments
    to sell loans

Huntington enters into forward contracts relating to its
    mortgage banking business to hedge the exposures from
    commitments to make new residential mortgage loans with existing
    customers and from mortgage loans classified as held for sale.
    At December 31, 2010 and 2009, Huntington had commitments
    to sell residential real estate loans of $998.7 million and
    $662.9 million, respectively. These contracts mature in
    less than one year.

Litigation

Three putative derivative lawsuits were filed in the Court of
    Common Pleas of Delaware County, Ohio, the United States
    District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern
    Division, and the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County,
    Ohio, between January 16, 2008, and April 17, 2008,
    against certain of Huntington’s current or former officers
    and directors variously seeking to allege breaches of fiduciary
    duty, waste of corporate assets, abuse of control, gross
    mismanagement, and unjust enrichment, all in connection with
    Huntington’s acquisition of Sky Financial, certain
    transactions between Huntington and Franklin, and the financial
    disclosures relating to such transactions. Huntington was named
    as a nominal defendant in each of these actions. The derivative
    action filed in the United States District Court for the
    Southern District of Ohio was dismissed on September 23,
    2009. The plaintiff in that action thereafter filed a Notice of
    Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth
    Circuit, but the appeal was dismissed at the plaintiff’s
    request on January 12, 2010. That plaintiff subsequently
    sent a letter to Huntington’s board of directors demanding
    that it initiate certain litigation. The board of directors
    appointed a special independent committee to review and
    investigate the allegations made in the letter, and based upon
    that investigation, to recommend what actions, if any, should be
    taken. The special independent committee has concluded its
    review and investigation, has determined that the claims
    asserted in the letter and in the three derivative suits are
    without merit and that it would not be in the interest of the
    Company to pursue any of them, and has recommended to the board
    of directors that the claims not be pursued. The board of
    directors has accepted the recommendation of the independent
    special committee, and determined to refuse the plaintiff’s
    demand to initiate litigation. The Court of Common Pleas of
    Franklin County, Ohio granted the defendants’ motion to
    dismiss the derivative lawsuit pending in that court. On
    October 8, 2010, an agreed order to dismiss the derivative
    suit was entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware
    County, Ohio.

Between February 20, 2008 and February 29, 2008, three
    putative class action lawsuits were filed in the United States
    District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern
    Division, against Huntington, the Huntington Bancshares
    Incorporated Pension Review Committee, the Huntington Investment
    and Tax Savings Plan (the Plan) Administrative Committee, and
    certain of the Company’s officers and directors purportedly
    on behalf of participants in or beneficiaries of the Plan
    between either July 1, 2007 or July 20, 2007 and the
    present. On May 14, 2008, the three cases were consolidated
    into a single action. On August 4, 2008, a consolidated
    complaint was filed asserting a class period of July 1,
    2007 through the present, alleging breaches of fiduciary duties
    in violation of ERISA relating to Huntington stock being offered
    as an investment alternative for participants in the Plan and
    seeking money damages and equitable relief. On February 9,
    2009, the court entered an order dismissing with prejudice the
    consolidated lawsuit in its entirety, and the plaintiffs
    thereafter filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court
    of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. During the pendency of the
    appeal, the parties to the appeal commenced settlement
    discussions and have reached an agreement to settle this
    litigation on a classwide basis for $1,450,000, subject to court
    approval. Because the settlement has not been approved, it is
    not possible for Management to make further comment at this time.

Commitments
    Under Capital and Operating Lease Obligations

At December 31, 2010, Huntington and its subsidiaries were
    obligated under noncancelable leases for land, buildings, and
    equipment. Many of these leases contain renewal options and
    certain leases provide options to purchase the leased property
    during or at the expiration of the lease period at specified
    prices. Some leases contain escalation clauses calling for
    rentals to be adjusted for increased real estate taxes and other
    operating expenses or proportionately adjusted for increases in
    the consumer or other price indices.



The future minimum rental payments required under operating
    leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms
    in excess of one year as of December 31, 2010, were
    $43.2 million in 2011, $41.5 million in 2012,
    $39.0 million in 2013, $36.5 million in 2014,
    $34.7 million in 2015, and $270.9 million thereafter.
    At December 31, 2010, total minimum lease payments have not
    been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $25.8 million
    due in the future under noncancelable subleases. At
    December 31, 2010, the future minimum sublease rental
    payments that Huntington expects to receive are
    $12.7 million in 2011; $4.4 million in 2012;
    $3.7 million in 2013; $2.7 million in 2014;
    $1.6 million in 2015; and $0.8 million thereafter. The
    rental expense for all operating leases was $50.3 million,
    $49.8 million, and $53.4 million for 2010, 2009, and
    2008, respectively. Huntington had no material obligations under
    capital leases.

23.

OTHER
    REGULATORY MATTERS

Huntington and its bank subsidiary, The Huntington National Bank
    (the Bank), are subject to various regulatory capital
    requirements administered by federal and state banking agencies.
    These requirements involve qualitative judgments and
    quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, capital amounts,
    and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under
    regulatory accounting practices. Failure to meet minimum capital
    requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that, if
    undertaken, could have a material adverse effect on
    Huntington’s and the Bank’s financial statements.
    Applicable capital adequacy guidelines require minimum ratios of
    4.00% for Tier 1 Risk-based Capital, 8.00% for Total
    Risk-based Capital, and 4.00% for Tier 1 Leverage Capital.
    To be considered Well-capitalized under the regulatory framework
    for prompt corrective action, the ratios must be at least 6.00%,
    10.00%, and 5.00%, respectively.

As of December 31, 2010, Huntington and the Bank met all
    capital adequacy requirements and had regulatory capital ratios
    in excess of the levels established for Well-capitalized
    institutions. The period-end capital amounts and capital ratios
    of Huntington and the Bank are as follows:

Tier 1 Risk-based Capital consists of total equity plus
    qualifying capital securities and minority interest, excluding
    unrealized gains and losses accumulated in OCI, and
    non-qualifying intangible and servicing assets. Total Risk-based
    Capital is Tier 1 Risk-based Capital plus qualifying
    subordinated notes and allowable allowances for credit losses
    (limited to 1.25% of total risk-weighted assets). Tier 1
    Leverage Capital is equal to Tier 1 Capital. Both
    Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios are derived by
    dividing the respective capital amounts by net risk-weighted
    assets, which are calculated as prescribed by regulatory
    agencies. Tier 1 Leverage Capital ratio is calculated by
    dividing the Tier 1 capital amount by average total assets
    for the fourth quarter of 2010 and 2009, less non-qualifying
    intangibles and other adjustments.

Huntington has the ability to provide additional capital to the
    Bank to maintain the Bank’s risk-based capital ratios at
    levels at which would be considered Well-capitalized.

Huntington and its subsidiaries are also subject to various
    regulatory requirements that impose restrictions on cash, debt,
    and dividends. The Bank is required to maintain cash reserves
    based on the level of certain of its deposits. This reserve
    requirement may be met by holding cash in banking offices or on
    deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank. During 2010 and 2009, the
    average balances of these deposits were $0.8 billion and
    $1.4 billion, respectively.



Under current Federal Reserve regulations, the Bank is limited
    as to the amount and type of loans it may make to the parent
    company and non-bank subsidiaries. At December 31, 2010,
    the Bank could lend $554.9 million to a single affiliate,
    subject to the qualifying collateral requirements defined in the
    regulations.

Dividends from the Bank are one of the major sources of funds
    for the Company. These funds aid the Company in the payment of
    dividends to shareholders, expenses, and other obligations.
    Payment of dividends to the parent company is subject to various
    legal and regulatory limitations. Regulatory approval is
    required prior to the declaration of any dividends in excess of
    available retained earnings. The amount of dividends that may be
    declared without regulatory approval is further limited to the
    sum of net income for the current year and retained net income
    for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to
    surplus or common stock. At December 31, 2010, the Bank
    could not have declared and paid additional dividends to the
    Company without regulatory approval.

SEGMENT
    REPORTING

During the 2010 fourth quarter, we reorganized our business
    segments to better align certain business unit reporting with
    segment executives to accelerate cross-sell results and provide
    greater focus on the execution of strategic plans. We have four
    major business segments: Retail and Business Banking, Commercial
    Banking, Automobile Finance and Commercial Real Estate, and
    Wealth Advisors, Government Finance, and Home Lending. A
    Treasury / Other function includes other unallocated
    assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense. All periods have been
    reclassified to conform to the current period classification.

Segment results are determined based upon the Company’s
    management reporting system, which assigns balance sheet and
    income statement items to each of the business segments. The
    process is designed around the Company’s organizational and
    management structure and, accordingly, the results derived are
    not



necessarily comparable with similar information published by
    other financial institutions. An overview of this system is
    provided below, along with a description of each segment and
    discussion of financial results.

Retail and Business Banking:

This segment
    provides financial products and services to consumer and small
    business customers located within our primary banking markets
    consisting of five areas covering the six states of Ohio,
    Michigan, Pennsylvania, Indiana, West Virginia, and Kentucky.
    Its products include individual and small business checking
    accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates
    of deposit, consumer loans, and small business loans and leases.
    Other financial services available to consumers and small
    business customers include investments, insurance services,
    interest rate risk protection products, foreign exchange
    hedging, and treasury management services. Retail and Business
    Banking provides these services through a banking network of
    over 600 traditional branches and convenience branches located
    in grocery stores and retirement centers. In addition, an array
    of alternative distribution channels is available to customers
    including internet and mobile banking, telephone banking, and
    over 1,300 ATMs.

Commercial Banking:

Our Commercial Banking
    group provides a wide array of products and services to the
    middle market and large corporate client base located primarily
    within our core geographic banking markets. Products and
    services are delivered through a relationship banking model and
    include commercial lending, as well as depository and liquidity
    management products. Dedicated teams collaborate with our
    primary bankers to deliver complex and customized treasury
    management solutions, equipment and technology leasing,
    international services, capital markets services such as
    interest rate protection, foreign exchange hedging and sales,
    trading of securities, and employee benefit programs (insurance,
    410(k)). The Commercial Banking team specializes in serving a
    number of industry segments such as government entities,

not-for-profit

organizations, heath-care entities, and large, publicly traded
    companies.

Automobile Finance and Commercial Real
    Estate:

This segment provides lending and other
    banking products and services to customers outside of our normal
    retail or commercial channels. More specifically, we serve
    automotive dealerships, retail customers who obtain financing at
    the dealerships, professional real estate developers, REITs, and
    other customers with lending needs that are secured by
    commercial properties. Most of our customers are located in our
    primary banking markets. Our products and services include
    financing for the purchase of automobiles by customers of
    automotive dealerships; financing for the purchase of new and
    used vehicle inventory by automotive dealerships; and financing
    for land, buildings, and other commercial real estate owned or
    constructed by real estate developers, automobile dealerships,
    or other customers with real estate project financing needs. We
    also provide other banking products and services to our
    customers as well as their owners or principals. These products
    and services are delivered through: (1) our relationships
    with developers in our primary banking markets believed to be
    experienced, well-managed, and well-capitalized and are capable
    of operating in all phases of the real estate cycle (top-tier
    developers), (2) relationships with established automobile
    dealerships, (3) our leads through community involvement,
    and (4) referrals from other professionals.

Wealth Advisors, Government Finance, and Home
    Lending:

This segment consists primarily of
    fee-based businesses including home lending, wealth management,
    and government finance. We originate and service consumer loans
    to customers who are generally located in our primary banking
    markets. Consumer lending products are distributed to these
    customers primarily through the Retail and Business Banking
    segment and commissioned loan originators. We provide wealth
    management banking services to high net worth customers in our
    primary banking markets and in Florida by utilizing a cohesive
    model that employs a unified sales force to deliver products and
    services directly and through the other segments. We provide
    these products and services through a unified sales team, which
    consists of former private bankers, trust officers, and
    investment advisors; Huntington Asset Advisors, which provides
    investment management services; Huntington Asset Services, which
    offers administrative and operational support to fund complexes;
    retirement plan services, and the national settlements business.
    We also provide banking products and services to government
    entities across our primary banking markets by utilizing a team
    of relationship managers providing public finance, brokerage,
    trust, lending, and treasury management services.

In addition to the Company’s four business segments, the
    Treasury / Other function includes our insurance
    brokerage business, which specializes in commercial
    property/casualty, employee benefits, personal lines, life



and disability and specialty lines. We also provide brokerage
    and agency services for residential and commercial title
    insurance and excess and surplus product lines. As an agent and
    broker we do not assume underwriting risks; instead we provide
    our customers with quality, non-investment insurance contracts.
    It also includes technology and operations, and other
    unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense.

Assets in this group include investment securities and bank
    owned life insurance. Net interest income / (expense)
    includes the net impact of administering the Company’s
    investment securities portfolios as part of overall liquidity
    management. An FTP system is used to attribute appropriate
    funding interest income and interest expense to other business
    segments. As such, net interest income includes the net impact
    of any over or under allocations arising from centralized
    management of interest rate risk. Furthermore, net interest
    income includes the net impact of derivatives used to hedge
    interest rate sensitivity. Noninterest income includes
    miscellaneous fee income not allocated to other business
    segments, including bank owned life insurance income. Fee income
    also includes asset revaluations not allocated to business
    segments, as well as any investment securities and trading
    assets gains or losses. The noninterest expense includes certain
    corporate administrative, merger costs, and other miscellaneous
    expenses not allocated to business segments. This group also
    includes any difference between the actual effective tax rate of
    Huntington and the statutory tax rate used to allocate income
    taxes to the other segments.

In 2009, a comprehensive review of the FTP methodology resulted
    in changes to various assumptions, including liquidity premiums.
    Business segment financial performance for 2010 and 2009 reflect
    the methodology changes, however, financial performance for 2008
    was not restated to reflect these changes, as the changes for
    that year were not material. As a result of this change,
    business segment performance for net interest income comparisons
    between 2009 and 2008 are affected.

Listed below is certain operating basis financial information
    reconciled to Huntington’s 2010, 2009, and 2008 reported
    results by line of business:

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

Huntington maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed
    to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the
    reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934, as amended, are recorded, processed, summarized,
    and reported within the time periods specified in the
    Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
    procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
    designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
    an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act
    is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management,
    including its principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure. Huntington’s Management, with the participation
    of its Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer,

under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by
    this report. Based upon such evaluation, Huntington’s Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
    that, as of the end of such period, Huntington’s disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective.

There have not been any significant changes in Huntington’s
    internal control over financial reporting (as such term is
    defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this
    report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably
