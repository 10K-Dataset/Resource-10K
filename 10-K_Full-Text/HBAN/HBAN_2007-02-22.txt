Huntington Bancshares Incorporated

PART I

When we refer to “we,” “our,” and “us” in this report, we mean Huntington Bancshares
Incorporated and our consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates that we refer only to
the parent company, Huntington Bancshares Incorporated. When we refer to the “Bank” in this
report, we mean The Huntington National Bank, our only bank subsidiary.

Item 1: Business

We are a multi-state diversified financial holding company organized under Maryland law
in 1966 and headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. Through our subsidiaries, we provide full-service
commercial and consumer banking services, mortgage banking services, automobile financing,
equipment leasing, investment management, trust services, brokerage services, private mortgage
insurance, reinsuring credit life and disability insurance, and other insurance and financial
products and services. The Bank, organized in 1866, is our only bank subsidiary. At December 31,
2006, the Bank had:

•

202 banking offices in Ohio

•

12 banking offices in Kentucky

•

112 banking offices in Michigan

•

4 private banking offices in Florida

•

26 banking offices in West Virginia

•

one foreign office in the Cayman Islands

•

25 banking offices in Indiana

•

one foreign office in Hong Kong

We conduct certain activities in other states including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Maryland,
Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Vermont. Our
foreign banking activities, in total or with any individual country, are not significant. At
December 31, 2006, we had 8,081 full-time equivalent employees.

Our lines of business are discussed in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report to shareholders, which is incorporated
into this report by reference. The financial statement results for each of our lines of business
can be found in Note 27 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
this report.

Proposed Acquisition of Sky Financial Group, Inc.

On December 20, 2006, Huntington announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire
Sky Financial Group, Inc. (Sky Financial) in a stock and cash transaction expected to be
valued at approximately $3.5 billion.

Under the terms of the agreement, Sky Financial shareholders will receive 1.098 shares of
Huntington common stock, on a tax-free basis, and a taxable cash payment of $3.023 for each share
of Sky Financial common stock. The merger was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of
both companies and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2007, pending customary regulatory
approvals, as well as approval by both companies’ shareholders.

Competition

Competition is intense in most of our markets. We compete on price and service with other
banks and financial services companies such as savings and loans, credit unions, finance
companies, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, and brokerage firms. Competition could
intensify in the future as a result of industry consolidation, the increasing availability of
products and services from non-banks, greater technological developments in the industry, and
banking reform. For example, financial services reform legislation enacted in 1999 eliminated the
long-standing Glass-Steagall Act restrictions on securities activities of bank holding companies
and banks. That legislation, among other things, permits securities and insurance firms to engage
in banking activities under specified conditions.


Regulatory Matters

On March 1, 2005, we announced entering into a formal written agreement with the Federal
Reserve Bank of Cleveland (FRBC), providing for a comprehensive action plan designed to enhance
corporate governance, internal audit, risk management, accounting policies and procedures, and
financial and regulatory reporting. The agreement called for independent third-party reviews, as
well as the submission of written plans and progress reports by Management, and would remain in
effect until terminated by the banking regulators. On May 10, 2006, Huntington announced that the
FRBC notified Huntington’s board of directors that Huntington had satisfied the provisions of the
written agreement dated February 28, 2005, and that the FRBC, under delegated authority of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), had terminated the written agreement.

General

We are a bank holding company and are qualified as a financial holding company with the
Federal Reserve. We are subject to examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve pursuant to
the Bank Holding Company Act. We are required to file reports and other information regarding our
business operations and the business operations of our subsidiaries with the Federal Reserve.

Because we are a public company, we are also subject to regulation by the SEC. On December
15, 2005, the SEC adopted final rules establishing three categories of issuers for the purpose of
filing periodic and annual reports. Under the new regulations, we are considered to be a “large
accelerated filer” and, as such, must comply with the new SEC accelerated reporting requirements.

The
Bank is subject to examination and supervision by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Its domestic deposits are
insured by the Bank Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which also
has certain regulatory and supervisory authority over it. Our non-bank subsidiaries are also
subject to examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve or, in the case of non-bank
subsidiaries of the Bank, by the OCC. Our subsidiaries are also subject to examination by other
federal and state agencies, including, in the case of certain securities and investment management
activities, regulation by the SEC and the National Association of Securities Dealers.

In addition to the impact of federal and state regulation, the Bank and our non-bank
subsidiaries are affected significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve as it attempts to
control the money supply and credit availability in order to influence the economy.

Holding Company Structure

We have one national bank subsidiary and numerous non-bank subsidiaries. Exhibit 21.1 of this
report lists all of our subsidiaries.

The Bank is subject to affiliate transaction restrictions under federal laws, which limit the
transfer of funds by a subsidiary bank to its parent or any non-bank subsidiary of its parent,
whether in the form of loans, extensions of credit, investments, or asset purchases. Such transfers
by a subsidiary bank are limited to:

•

10% of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus for transfers to its parent
corporation or to any individual non-bank subsidiary of the parent, and

•

an aggregate of 20% of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus for transfers
to such parent together with all such non-bank subsidiaries of the parent.

Furthermore, such loans and extensions of credit must be secured within specified amounts. In
addition, all affiliate transactions must be conducted on terms and under circumstances that are
substantially the same as such transactions with unaffiliated entities.

As a matter of policy, the Federal Reserve expects a bank holding company to act as a source
of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to
support each such subsidiary bank. Under this source of strength doctrine, the Federal Reserve may
require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank. They may
charge the bank holding company with engaging in


unsafe and unsound practices if they fail to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. A
capital injection may be required at times when the holding company does not have the resources to
provide it.

Any loans by a holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to
deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding
company’s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a
federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, the
bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of
payment over the claims of the institution’s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of
its note obligations.

Federal law permits the OCC to order the pro rata assessment of shareholders of a national
bank whose capital stock has become impaired, by losses or otherwise, to relieve a deficiency in
such national bank’s capital stock. This statute also provides for the enforcement of any such pro
rata assessment of shareholders of such national bank to cover such impairment of capital stock by
sale, to the extent necessary, of the capital stock owned by any assessed shareholder failing to
pay the assessment. As the sole shareholder of the Bank, we are subject to such provisions.

Moreover, the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative
expenses and the claims of holders of deposit liabilities of such an institution are accorded
priority over the claims of general unsecured creditors of such an institution, including the
holders of the institution’s note obligations, in the event of liquidation or other resolution of
such institution. Claims of a receiver for administrative expenses and claims of holders of deposit
liabilities of the Bank, including the FDIC as the insurer of such holders, would receive priority
over the holders of notes and other senior debt of the Bank in the event of liquidation or other
resolution and over our interests as sole shareholder of the Bank.

The Federal Reserve maintains a bank holding company rating system that emphasizes risk
management, introduces a framework for analyzing and rating financial factors, and provides a
framework for assessing and rating the potential impact of non-depository entities of a holding
company on its subsidiary depository institution(s).

A composite rating is assigned based on the foregoing three components, but a fourth
component is also rated, reflecting generally the assessment of depository institution
subsidiaries by their principal regulators. Ratings are made on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 highest) and,
like current ratings, are not made public. The new rating system applies to us.

Dividend Restrictions

Dividends from the Bank are the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to our
shareholders. In the year ended December 31, 2006, we declared cash dividends to shareholders of
$239.4 million. There are, however, statutory limits on the amount of dividends that the Bank can
pay to us without regulatory approval.

The Bank may not, without prior regulatory approval, pay a dividend in an amount greater than
its undivided profits. In addition, the prior approval of the OCC is required for the payment of a
dividend by a national bank if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed
the total of its net income for the year combined with its retained net income for the two
preceding years. At December 31, 2006, the Bank could have declared and paid $0.7 million of
additional dividends to the parent company without regulatory approval.

If, in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a bank under its jurisdiction is
engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice, such authority may require,
after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from such practice. Depending on the
financial condition of the bank, the applicable regulatory authority might deem the bank to be
engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice if the bank were to pay dividends. The Federal Reserve
and the OCC have issued policy statements that provide that insured banks and bank holding
companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings.

FDIC Insurance

During 2006, the FDIC classified the Bank as a “well-capitalized” institution, the highest
supervisory subcategory. The Bank, therefore, was not obliged under then-existing FDIC assessment
practices to pay deposit insurance premiums for the year, either on its deposits insured by the
Bank Insurance Fund or on that portion of its deposits acquired from savings and loan associations
and insured by the Savings Association Insurance Fund. The


Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund were merged on March 31, 2006, to
form the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). Although not subject in 2006 to FDIC assessments for
deposit insurance premiums, the Bank was required, and continues to be required, to make payments
for the servicing of obligations of the Financing Corporation that were issued in connection with
the resolution of savings and loan associations, so long as such obligations remain outstanding.

With the enactment in February 2006 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 and
related legislation, and the adoption by the FDIC of implementing regulations in November 2006,
major changes were introduced in FDIC deposit insurance for 2007 and subsequent years. Henceforth,
the FDIC is to designate annually a target reserve ratio for the DIF within the range of 1.15
percent and 1.5 percent, instead of the prior fixed requirement to manage the DIF so as to maintain
a designated reserve ratio of 1.25 percent. The FDIC adopted 1.25 percent as the designated
reserve ratio for 2007.

In addition, the FDIC adopted a new risk-based system for assessment of deposit insurance
premiums on depository institutions, under which all such institutions would pay at least a minimum
level of premiums. The new system is based on an institution’s probability of causing a loss to
the DIF, and requires that each depository institution be placed in one of four risk categories,
depending on a combination of its capitalization and its supervisory ratings. Under a base rate
schedule, institutions in Risk Category I would be assessed between 2 and 4 basis points, while
institutions in Risk Category IV could be assessed a maximum of 40 basis points.

For 2007, the FDIC determined to set assessment rates at three basis points above the base
schedule rates. To assist the transition to the new system requiring assessment payments by all
insured institutions, depository institutions that were in existence on and paid deposit insurance
assessments prior to December 31, 1996, are eligible for a one-time assessment credit based on
their shares of the aggregate 1996 assessment base. We received a notification from the FDIC on
October 16, 2006, that our one-time assessment credit was $25.3 million. The Bank, as a well
capitalized institution, will be in Risk Category I and, therefore,
subject to an assessment of 5.65
basis points. We expect our annual FDIC expense to be
$15.9 million, which will initially be offset by the assessment
credit.

Capital Requirements

The Federal Reserve has issued risk-based capital ratio and leverage ratio guidelines for
bank holding companies. The risk-based capital ratio guidelines establish a systematic analytical
framework that:

•

makes regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles
among banking organizations,

•

takes off-balance sheet exposures into explicit account in assessing capital adequacy, and

•

minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets.

Under the guidelines and related policies, bank holding companies must maintain capital
sufficient to meet both a risk-based asset ratio test and a leverage ratio test on a consolidated
basis. The risk-based ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet
commitments into four weighted categories, with higher weighting assigned to categories perceived
as representing greater risk. A bank holding company’s risk-based ratio represents capital divided
by total risk weighted assets. The leverage ratio is core capital divided by total assets adjusted
as specified in the guidelines. The Bank is subject to substantially similar capital requirements.

Generally, under the applicable guidelines, a financial institution’s capital is divided into
two tiers. Institutions that must incorporate market risk exposure into their risk-based capital
requirements may also have a third tier of capital in the form of restricted short-term
subordinated debt. These tiers are:

•

“Tier 1”, or core capital, includes common equity, non-cumulative perpetual
preferred stock (excluding auction rate issues), and minority interests in equity
accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less both goodwill and, with certain limited
exceptions, all other intangible assets. Bank holding companies, however, may
include up to a limit of 25% of cumulative preferred stock in their Tier 1 capital.

•

“Tier 2”, or supplementary capital, includes, among other things, cumulative and
limited-life preferred stock, hybrid capital instruments, mandatory convertible
securities, qualifying subordinated debt, and the allowance for loan and lease
losses, subject to certain limitations.

•

“Total capital” is Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital.


The Federal Reserve and the other federal banking regulators require that all intangible
assets, except originated or purchased mortgage-servicing rights, non-mortgage servicing assets,
and purchased credit card relationships, be deducted from Tier 1 capital. However, the total
amount of these items included in a bank holding company’s capital cannot exceed 100% of its Tier
1 capital.

Under the risk-based guidelines, financial institutions are required to maintain a risk-based
ratio of 8%, with 4% being Tier 1 capital. The appropriate regulatory authority may set higher
capital requirements when an institution’s circumstances warrant.

Under the leverage guidelines, financial institutions are required to maintain a leverage
ratio of at least 3%. The minimum ratio is applicable only to financial institutions that meet
certain specified criteria, including excellent asset quality, high liquidity, low interest rate
risk exposure, and the highest regulatory rating. Financial institutions not meeting these
criteria are required to maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.

Special minimum capital requirements apply to equity investments in nonfinancial companies.
The requirements consist of a series of marginal capital charges that increase within a range from
8% to 25% as a financial institution’s over-all exposure to equity investments increases as a
percentage of its Tier 1 capital.

Failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject the financial institution to a
variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities. These include
limitations on the ability to pay dividends, the issuance by the regulatory authority of a capital
directive to increase capital, and the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC. In addition,
the financial institution could be subject to the measures described below under “Prompt Corrective
Action” as applicable to “under-capitalized” institutions.

The risk-based capital standards of the Federal Reserve, the OCC

,

and the FDIC specify that
evaluations by the banking agencies of a bank’s capital adequacy will include an assessment of the
exposure to declines in the economic value of the bank’s capital due to changes in interest rates.
These banking agencies issued a joint policy statement on interest rate risk describing prudent
methods for monitoring such risk that rely principally on internal measures of exposure and active
oversight of risk management activities by senior management.

Prompt Corrective Action

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, known as FDICIA, requires
federal banking regulatory authorities to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to
depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, FDICIA
establishes five capital tiers: “well-capitalized,” “adequately-capitalized,” “under-capitalized,”
“significantly under-capitalized,” and “critically under-capitalized.”

An institution is deemed to be:

Throughout 2006, our regulatory capital ratios and those of the Bank were in excess of the
levels established for “well-capitalized” institutions.

FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution,
including payment of a cash dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company, if the
depository institution would be “under-capitalized” after such payment. “Under-capitalized”
institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required by the appropriate federal banking
agency to submit a capital restoration plan. If any depository institution subsidiary of a holding
company is required to submit a capital restoration plan, the holding company


would be required to provide a limited guarantee regarding compliance with the plan as a
condition of approval of such plan.

If an “under-capitalized” institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if
it is “significantly under-capitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” institutions may be
subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting
stock to become “adequately-capitalized,” requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of
receipt of deposits from correspondent banks.

“Critically under-capitalized” institutions may not, beginning 60 days after becoming
“critically under-capitalized,” make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated
debt. In addition, “critically under-capitalized” institutions are subject to appointment of a
receiver or conservator within 90 days of becoming so classified.

Under FDICIA, a depository institution that is not “well-capitalized” is generally prohibited
from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the
prevailing rate in its market. As previously stated, the Bank is “well-capitalized” and the FDICIA
brokered deposit rule did not adversely affect its ability to accept brokered deposits. The Bank
had $0.7 billion of such brokered deposits at December 31, 2006.

Financial Holding Company Status

In order to maintain its status as a financial holding company, a bank holding company’s
depository subsidiaries must all be both “well capitalized” and “well managed,” and must meet
their Community Reinvestment Act obligations.

Financial holding company powers relate to “financial activities” that are determined by the
Federal Reserve, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, to be financial in nature,
incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity,
provided that the complementary activity does not pose a safety and soundness risk. The
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act designates certain activities as financial in nature, including:

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also authorizes the Federal Reserve, in coordination with the
Secretary of the Treasury

,

to determine that additional activities are financial in nature or
incidental to activities that are financial in nature.

We are required by the Bank Holding Company Act to obtain Federal Reserve approval prior to
acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of voting shares of any bank, if, after
such acquisition, we would own or control more than 5% of its voting stock. However, as a
financial holding company, we may commence any new financial activity, except for the acquisition
of a savings association, with notice to the Federal Reserve within 30 days after the commencement
of the new financial activity.

USA Patriot Act

The USA Patriot Act of 2001 and its related regulations require insured depository
institutions, broker-dealers, and certain other financial institutions to have policies,
procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing.
The statute and its regulations also provide for information sharing, subject to conditions,
between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial
institutions, for counter-terrorism purposes. Federal banking regulators are required, when
reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications, to take into account the
effectiveness of the anti-money laundering activities of the applicants. Originally enacted for
five years, the USA Patriot Act was signed into law as permanent legislation in March 2006.


Customer Privacy and Other Consumer Protections

Pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, we, like all other financial institutions, are
required to:

•

provide notice to our customers regarding privacy policies and practices,

•

inform our customers regarding the conditions under which their non-public
personal information may be disclosed to non-affiliated third parties, and

•

give our customers an option to prevent disclosure of such information to
non-affiliated third parties.

Under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, our customers may also opt out of
information sharing between and among us and our affiliates. We are also subject, in connection
with our lending and leasing activities, to numerous federal and state laws aimed at protecting
consumers, including the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act,
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposed new or revised corporate governance, accounting, and
reporting requirements on us and all other companies having securities registered with the SEC. In
addition to a requirement that chief executive officers and chief financial officers certify
financial statements in writing, the statute imposed requirements affecting, among other matters,
the composition and activities of audit committees, disclosures relating to corporate insiders and
insider transactions, codes of ethics, and the effectiveness of internal controls over financial
reporting.

Recent Regulatory Developments

Authority for financial holding companies to engage in real estate brokerage and property
management services was proposed by the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve in 2000, but
final regulations implementing the proposal have been subject to a statutory moratorium which has
been renewed annually by Congress since 2001. Legislation was introduced early in 2007 to ban such
activity permanently, and it is not possible at present to assess the prospects either for the
permanent ban or the ultimate adoption of the long-pending final regulations.

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s “Basel II” regulatory capital guidelines,
published in June 2004 and amended in November 2005, are designed to promote improved risk
measurement and management processes and better align minimum capital requirements with risk. The
Basel II guidelines would, however, be mandatory only for “core banks,” i.e., banks with
consolidated total assets of $250 billion or more. They would, therefore, not foreseeably be
applicable to the Bank, which continues to operate under U.S. risk-based capital guidelines
consistent with “Basel I” guidelines published in 1988.

U.S. banking regulators, however, in December 2006, issued proposed rules involving
modifications to the existing U.S. Basel I-based capital framework. The proposed rules, designated
as “Basel IA” rules, are intended to avoid future competitive inequalities between Basel I and
Basel II organizations, and would, if finally adopted, allow U.S. depository institutions to elect
to remain under existing capital rules or come under the Basel IA rules. The proposed rules
include:

•

increasing the number of risk-weight categories,

•

expanding the use of external ratings for credit risk,

•

expanding the range of collateral and guarantors to qualify for a lower risk weight, and

•

basing residential mortgage risk ratings on loan-to-value ratios.

The public comment period for the proposed Basel IA rules (as well as on additional questions
raised by regulators on a pending rulemaking on Basel II rules) ends in March 2007, and final rules
are not expected until late in the year.

Item 1A: Risk Factors

Like other financial companies, we are subject to a number of risks, many of which are
outside of our direct control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing
returns. Among the risks assumed are: (1)

credit risk

, which is the risk that loan and
lease customers or other counterparties will be unable to perform their contractual obligations,
(2)

market risk

, which is the risk that changes in market rates and prices will adversely
affect our financial condition or results of operation, (3)

liquidity risk

, which is the
risk that the parent company and/or the Bank will have insufficient cash or access to cash to meet
its operating needs, and (4)

operational risk

, which is the risk of loss resulting from
inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or external events.

In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report,
readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could
materially impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows.

(1) Credit Risks:

We extend credit to a variety of customers based on internally set standards and judgment. We
manage the credit risk through a program of underwriting standards, the review of certain credit
decisions, and an on-going process of assessment of the quality of the credit already extended. Our
credit standards and on-going process of credit assessment might not protect us from significant
credit losses.

We take credit risk by virtue of making loans and leases, purchasing non-governmental
securities, extending loan commitments and letters of credit, and being counterparties to
off-balance sheet financial instruments such as interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives.

Our exposure to credit risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting standards
that emphasize “in-market” lending while avoiding highly leveraged transactions as well as
excessive industry and other concentrations. Our credit administration function employs risk
management techniques to ensure that loans and leases adhere to corporate policy and problem loans
and leases are promptly identified. These procedures provide us with the information necessary to
implement policy adjustments where necessary, and to take proactive corrective actions.

For further discussion about our management of credit risk, see the “Credit Risk” section
included in our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which
are filed as Exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by
reference.

Our loans, leases, and deposits are focused in five states and adverse economic conditions in those
states, in particular, could negatively impact results from operations, cash flows, and financial
condition.

Concentration of credit risk can also arise with respect to loans and leases when the
borrowers are located in the same geographical region. Our customers with loan and/or deposit
balances at December 31, 2006, were


located predominantly in Ohio, Michigan, West Virginia, Indiana, and Kentucky. Because of the
concentration of loans, leases, and deposits in these states, in the event of adverse economic
conditions in these states, we could experience more difficulty in attracting deposits and
experience higher rates of loss and delinquency on our loans and leases than if the loans and
leases were more geographically diversified. Adverse economic conditions and other factors, such as
political or business developments or natural hazards that may affect these states, may reduce
demand for credit or fee-based products and could negatively affect real estate and other
collateral values, interest rate levels, and the availability of credit to refinance loans at or
prior to maturity.

Declines in home values in our markets could adversely impact results from operations.

Like all banks, we are subject to the effects of any economic downturn, and in particular, a
significant decline in home values in our markets could have a negative effect on results of
operations. At December 31, 2006, we had $4.9 billion of home equity loans and lines with a
weighted average loan-to-value ratio for the portfolio of 77%. In addition, at December 31, 2006,
we had $4.5 billion in residential real estate loans. Adjustable-rate mortgages, primarily
mortgages that have a fixed rate for the first 3 to 5 years and then adjust annually, comprised 54%
of this portfolio. A significant decline in home values could lead to higher charge-offs in event
of default in both the home equity loan and residential real estate loan portfolios. We also have
$1.3 billion of mortgage-backed securities that could be negatively affected by a decline in home
values.

(2) Market Risks:

Changes in interest rates could negatively impact our financial condition and results of
operations.

Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference
between interest earned on interest-earning assets (such as investments, loans, and direct
financing leases) and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (such as deposits and
borrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary
policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Conditions such as
inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors beyond our control may also
affect interest rates. If our interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than
interest-bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment, net interest income could be
adversely impacted. Likewise, if interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than
interest-earnings assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income could be
adversely impacted.

Changes in interest rates also can affect the value of loans and other assets, including
retained interests in securitizations, mortgage and non-mortgage servicing rights, and our ability
to realize gains on the sale of assets. A portion of our earnings result from transactional income.
An example of this type of transactional income is gain on sales of loans and other real
estate owned. This type of income can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year
based on a number of different factors, including the interest rate environment. An increase in
interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on
loans and leases may lead to an increase in non-performing assets and a reduction of income
recognized, which could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations and cash
flows. For further discussion, see Note 5 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which
are filed as Exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by
reference.

Although fluctuations in market interest rates are neither completely predictable nor
controllable, our Market Risk Committee (MRC) meets periodically to monitor our interest rate
sensitivity position and oversee our financial risk management by establishing policies and
operating limits. For further discussion, see the “Interest Rate Risk” section included in our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which
are filed as Exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by
reference.

(3) Liquidity Risks:

If we are unable to borrow funds through access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the
cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers, or meet the operating cash needs to fund
corporate expansion and other activities.

Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The
liquidity of the Bank is used to make loans and leases and to repay deposit liabilities as they
become due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and limits are established by the board
of directors, with operating limits set by MRC, based upon the ratio of loans to deposits and
percentage of assets funded with non-core or wholesale funding. The Bank’s MRC regularly monitors
the overall liquidity position of the Bank and the parent company to ensure that


various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect
liquidity. MRC also establishes policies and monitors guidelines to diversify the Bank’s wholesale
funding sources to avoid concentrations in any one market source. Wholesale funding sources include
Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and
medium- and long-term debt, which includes a domestic bank note program and a Euronote program. The
Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, Ohio (FHLB), which provide
funding through advances to members that are collateralized with mortgage-related assets.

We maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity.
There are other sources of liquidity available to us should they be needed. These sources include
the sale or securitization of loans, the ability to acquire additional national market, non-core
deposits, the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances, the issuance
of debt securities, and the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or private
transactions. The Bank also can borrow from the Federal Reserve’s discount window.

If we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed, we might be unable
to meet customers’ needs, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of
operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. For further discussion, see the
“Liquidity Risk” section included in our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which
are filed as Exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by
reference.

If our credit ratings were downgraded, the ability to access funding sources may be negatively
impacted or eliminated, and our liquidity and the market price of our common stock could be
adversely impacted.

Credit ratings by the three major credit rating agencies are an important component of our
liquidity profile. Among other factors, the credit ratings are based on the financial strength,
credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings,
capital adequacy, the quality of Management, the liquidity of the balance sheet, the availability
of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits, and the ability to access a broad
array of wholesale funding sources. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a negative
change in credit ratings and impact not only the ability to raise funds in the capital markets, but
also the cost of these funds. In addition, certain financial on- and off-balance sheet arrangements
contain credit rating triggers that could increase funding needs should a negative rating change
occur. Letter of credit commitments for marketable securities, interest rate swap collateral
agreements, and certain asset securitization transactions contain credit rating provisions.

Credit ratings as of December 31, 2006, for the parent company and the Bank can be found in
Table 27 included in our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which
are filed as Exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by
reference.

We rely on certain funding sources such as large corporate deposits, public fund deposits,
federal funds, Euro deposits, FHLB advances, and bank notes. Although not contractually tied to
credit ratings, our ability to access these funding sources may be impacted by negative changes in
credit ratings. In the case of public funds or FHLB advances, a credit downgrade may also trigger a
requirement that we pledge additional collateral against outstanding borrowings. Credit rating
downgrades could result in a loss of equity investor confidence.

We have authorized the use of a substantial amount of our cash for the repurchase of our shares,
and this use of funds may limit our ability to complete other transactions or to pursue other
business initiatives.

In April 2006, our board of directors authorized a new program for the repurchase of up to 15
million common shares, of which 3.8 million shares remain under the current authorization. We expect to
repurchase the remaining shares for cash as business conditions warrant. The full implementation
of this repurchase program will use a significant portion of our capital reserves. This use of
capital could limit future flexibility to complete acquisitions of businesses or technology, or
other transactions, or make investments in research and development, new employee hiring, or other
aspects of operations that might be in our best interests, or could require that we borrow money or
issue additional equity securities for such purposes. Any incurrence of debt may not be on
favorable terms and could result in our being subject to covenants or other contractual
restrictions that limit the ability to take advantage of other opportunities that may arise. Any
such incurrence of debt would likely increase our interest expense, and any issuance of additional
equity securities would dilute the stock ownership of existing shareholders.

(4) Operational Risks:

We have significant competition in both attracting and retaining deposits and in originating loans
and leases.

Competition is intense in most of our markets. We compete on price and service with other
banks and financial services companies such as savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies,
mortgage banking


companies, insurance companies, and brokerage firms. Competition could intensify in the future
as a result of industry consolidation, the increasing availability of products and services from
non-banks, greater technological developments in the industry, and banking reform.

In the normal course of business, we process large volumes of transactions. However, there can be
no assurance that we will be able to continue processing at the same or higher levels of
transactions. If systems of internal control should fail to work as expected, if systems are used
in an unauthorized manner, or if employees subvert the system of internal controls, significant
losses could result.

We process large volumes of transactions on a daily basis and are exposed to numerous types of
operational risk. Operational risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people,
and systems includes the risk of fraud by persons inside or outside the company, the execution of
unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and systems, and
breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements. This risk of loss also
includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of the operational deficiency or
as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards.

We establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide us with timely
and accurate information about our level of operational risk. While not foolproof, these systems
have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate, cost-effective levels. Procedures
exist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practices
are followed. From time to time, losses from operational risk may occur, including the effects of
operational errors. Such losses are recorded as non-interest expense.

While we continually monitor and improve the system of internal controls, data processing
systems, and corporate-wide processes and procedures, there can be no assurance that future losses
will not occur.

We may
fail to realize the anticipated cost savings and other financial
benefits of the merger on the anticipated schedule, if at all.

We may face significant challenges in integrating Sky Financial’s operations in our operations in a
timely and efficient manner and in retaining Sky Financial personnel. Currently, each company
operates as an independent public company. Achieving the anticipated cost savings and financial
benefits of the merger will depend on part on whether we integrate Sky Financial’s businesses in an
efficient and effective manner. We may not be able to accomplish this integration process smoothly
or successfully. In addition, the integration of certain operations following the merger will
require the dedication of significant management resources, which may temporarily distract
management’s attention from the day-to-day business of the combined company. Any inability to
realize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated cost savings and financial benefits of the
merger, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect
on the business and results of operations of the combined company, which may affect the market
price of Huntington common stock.

An extended disruption of vital infrastructure could negatively impact our business, results of
operations, and financial condition.

Our operations depend upon, among other things, our infrastructure, including
equipment and facilities. Extended disruption of vital infrastructure by fire,
power loss, natural disaster, telecommunications failure, computer hacking or
viruses, terrorist activity or the domestic and foreign response to such
activity, or other events outside of our control could have a material adverse
impact on the financial services industry as a whole and on our business,
results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition in particular. Our
business recovery plan may not work as intended or may not prevent significant
interruptions of our operations.

New or changes in existing tax, accounting, and regulatory rules and interpretations could
significantly impact strategic initiatives, results of operations, cash flows, and financial
condition.

The financial services industry is extensively regulated. Federal and state banking
regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers, not to
benefit a financial company’s shareholders. These regulations may sometimes impose significant
limitations on operations. The significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us are
described in this report under the heading “Regulatory Matters.” These regulations, along with the
currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, and monetary laws, regulations,


rules, standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which financial
institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern
financial reporting and disclosures. These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and
interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time.

In addition, we may be subject to actions of our regulators that are specific to us. For
further discussion, see Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which
are filed as Exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by
reference.

Events that may not have a direct impact on us, such as the bankruptcy of major U.S.
companies, have resulted in legislators, regulators, and authoritative bodies, such as the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and
various taxing authorities responding by adopting and/or proposing substantive revisions to laws,
regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations. International capital standards
developed in the framework of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision may also affect the
competitive environment for United States banks.

The nature, extent, and timing of the adoption of significant new laws and regulations, or
changes in or repeal of existing laws and regulations, or specific actions of regulators, may have
a material impact on our business and results of operations; however, it is impossible to predict
at this time the extent of any impact from these items.

Non-compliance with USA Patriot Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result
in fines or sanctions.

The USA Patriot and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to
prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If
such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity
reports with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These
rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the
identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these
regulations could result in fines or sanctions. During the last year, several banking institutions
have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. We have developed
policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations.

The OCC may impose dividend payment and other restrictions on the Bank, which would impact our
ability to pay dividends to shareholders or repurchase stock.

The OCC is the primary regulatory agency that examines the Bank, its subsidiaries, and their
respective activities. Under certain circumstances, including any determination that the activities
of the Bank or its subsidiaries constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice, the OCC has the
authority by statute to restrict the Bank’s ability to transfer assets, make shareholder
distributions, and redeem preferred securities.

Under applicable statutes and regulations, dividends by a national bank may be paid out of
current or retained net profits, but a national bank is prohibited from declaring a cash dividend
on shares of its common stock out of net profits until the surplus fund equals the amount of
capital stock or, if the surplus fund does not equal the amount of capital stock, until certain
amounts from net profits are transferred to the surplus fund. Moreover, the prior approval of the
OCC is required for the payment of a dividend if the total of all dividends declared by a national
bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for the year combined with its
net profits for the two preceding years, less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for the
retirement of any preferred securities.

Payment of dividends could also be subject to regulatory limitations if the Bank became
“under-capitalized” for purposes of the OCC “prompt corrective action” regulations.
“Under-capitalized” is currently defined as having a total risk-based capital ratio of less than
8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, or a core capital, or leverage, ratio of
less than 4.0%. If the Bank were unable to pay dividends to the parent company, it would impact
our ability to pay dividends to shareholders or repurchase stock. Throughout 2006, the Bank was in
compliance with all regulatory capital requirements and considered to be “well-capitalized.”

For further discussion, see the “Parent Company Liquidity” section included in our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which
are filed as Exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by
reference.


The Federal Reserve Board may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.

The Federal Reserve, which examines us and our non-bank subsidiaries, has a policy stating
that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to
a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the source of
strength doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital
injections into a troubled subsidiary bank, and may charge the bank holding company with engaging
in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. A
capital injection may be required at times when the holding company may not have the resources to
provide it, and therefore may be required to borrow the funds. Any loans by a holding company to
its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other
indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, the
bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory
agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, the bankruptcy law provides that
claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of
the institution’s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations.
Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital
injection becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the holding company’s
results of operations and cash flows.

If any of our Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) affiliates fail to qualify as a REIT, we may be
subject to a higher consolidated effective tax rate.

Huntington Preferred Capital, Inc. (HPCI), Huntington Preferred Capital II, Inc. (HPC-II) and
Huntington Capital Financing, LLC (HCF) operate as REITs for federal income tax purposes. HPCI,
HPC-II, and HCF are consolidated holding company subsidiaries established to acquire, hold, and
manage mortgage assets and other authorized investments to generate net income for distribution to
their shareholders.

Qualification as a REIT involves application of specific provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code relating to various asset tests. A REIT must satisfy six asset tests quarterly: (1) 75% of the
value of the REIT’s total assets must consist of real estate assets, cash and cash items, and
government securities; (2) not more than 25% of the value of the REIT’s total assets may consist of
securities, other than those includible under the 75% test; (3) not more than 5% of the value of
its total assets may consist of securities of any one issuer, other than those securities
includible under the 75% test or securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries; (4) not more than 10% of
the outstanding voting power of any one issuer may be held, other than those securities includible
under the 75% test or securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries; (5) not more than 10% of the total
value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer may be held, other than those securities
includible under the 75% test or securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries; and (6) a REIT cannot own
securities in one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries which comprise more than 20% of its total
assets. At December 31, 2006, HPCI, HPC-II, and HCF met all of the quarterly asset tests.

Also, a REIT must annually satisfy two gross income tests: (1) 75% of its gross income must be
from qualifying income closely connected with real estate activities; and (2) 95% of its gross
income must be derived from sources qualifying for the 75% test plus dividends, interest, and gains
from the sale of securities. In addition, a REIT must distribute 90% of the REIT’s taxable income
for the taxable year, excluding any net capital gains, to maintain its non-taxable status for
federal income tax purposes. For 2006, HPCI, HPC-II, and HCF had met all annual income and
distribution tests.

If any of these REIT affiliates fail to meet any of the required provisions for REITs, they
could no longer qualify as a REIT and the resulting tax consequences would increase our effective
tax rate.

We could be held responsible for environmental liabilities of properties acquired through
foreclosure of loans secured by real estate.

In the event we foreclose on a defaulted commercial mortgage and/or residential mortgage loan
to recover our investment, we may be subject to environmental liabilities in connection with the
underlying real property, which could exceed the value of the real property. Although we exercise
due diligence to discover potential environmental liabilities prior to acquiring any property
through foreclosure, hazardous substances or wastes, contaminants, pollutants, or their sources may
be discovered on properties during our ownership or after a sale to a third party. There can be no
assurance that we would not incur full recourse liability for the entire cost of any removal and
clean-up on an acquired property, that the cost of removal and clean-up would not exceed the value
of the property, or that we could recover any of the costs from any third party.


Item 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2: Properties

Our headquarters, as well as the Bank’s, are located in the Huntington Center, a
thirty-seven-story office building located in Columbus, Ohio. Of the building’s total office space
available, we lease approximately 39%. The lease term expires in 2015, with nine five-year renewal
options for up to 45 years but with no purchase option. The Bank has an indirect minority equity
interest of 18.4% in the building. Our other major properties consist of a thirteen-story and a
twelve-story office building, both of which are located adjacent to the Huntington Center; a
twenty-one story office building, known as the Huntington Building, located in Cleveland, Ohio; an
eighteen-story office building in Charleston, West Virginia; a three-story office building located
in Holland, Michigan; a Business Service Center in Columbus, Ohio; The Huntington Mortgage Group’s
building, located in the greater Columbus area; an office complex located in Troy, Michigan; and
two data processing and operations centers (Easton and Northland) located in Ohio. The office
buildings above serve as regional administrative offices occupied predominantly by our Regional
Banking and Private Financial and Capital Markets Group lines of business. The Dealer Sales line of
business is located in the Northland operations center. Of these properties, we own the
thirteen-story and twelve-story office buildings, and the Business Service Center. All of the other
major properties are held under long-term leases. In 1998, we entered into a sale/leaseback
agreement that included the sale of 51 of our locations. The transaction included a mix of branch
banking offices, regional offices, and operational facilities, including certain properties
described above, which we will continue to operate under a long-term lease.

Item 3: Legal Proceedings

The
Bank is involved in two lawsuits arising out of its banking
relationship with Cyberco Holdings, Inc. and a related company,
Teleservices Group, Inc. Both companies are subject to bankruptcy
estates in December 2006 and January 2007, respectively. The
complaints include claims under the Bankruptcy Code and various state
law claims and seek recoveries from the Bank in excess of $50
million. Although no assurance can be made that the ultimate outcome
of any matter will not exceed reserves or not have a material adverse
affect on operating results for a particular period, based on current
knowledge and consultation with counsel, Management believes that its
reserves are adequate and that is exposure to additional losses
arising from these lawsuits is not material.

Information is as of the end of the period.

On April 20, 2006, the Company announced that the board of directors authorized a new program
for the repurchase of up to 15 million shares (the 2006 Repurchase Program). The 2006 Repurchase
Program does not have an expiration date. The 2005 Repurchase Program, with 5 million shares
remaining, was canceled and replaced by the 2006 Repurchase Program. The Company announced its
expectation to repurchase the shares from time to time in the open market or through privately
negotiated transactions depending on market conditions.

On May 24, 2006, Huntington repurchased 6.0 million shares of common stock from Bear Stearns
under an accelerated share repurchase program. The accelerated share repurchase program enabled
Huntington to purchase the shares immediately, while Bear Stearns purchased shares in the market
over a period of up to four months (the Repurchase Term). In connection with the repurchase of
these shares, Huntington entered into a variable share forward sale agreement, which provides for a
settlement, reflecting a price differential based on the adjusted


volume-weighted average price as defined in the agreement with Bear Stearns. The variable
share forward agreement concluded at the end of September, resulting in a nominal settlement of
cash to Huntington. This was reflected as an adjustment to treasury shares on Huntington’s balance
sheet.

Item 9B: Other Information.

On February 21, 2007, the Board approved our election to
become subject to a provision of Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the
Maryland General Corporation Law (“MGCL”). This
election became effective on February 22, 2007 upon the
filing with and acceptance for record by the State Department of
Assessments and Taxation of Maryland of the
Articles Supplementary filed as
exhibit 3.4.
Prior to such election, under the MGCL a director elected by the
board of directors of a corporation to fill a vacancy serves
until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until his
successor is elected and qualifies. Pursuant to such election,
our charter now provides, as permitted by the MGCL, that any
director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office for the
remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which
the vacancy occurred and until a successor is duly elected and
qualifies.

On and effective February 21, 2007, the Board also amended
Section 2.04 of Huntington’s Bylaws to conform the
Bylaws to the MGCL election described above and amended
Section 1.01 of Huntington’s Bylaws to provide that
the 2007 annual meeting of stockholders may be held at such time
and on such date during the thirty-one day period beginning
April 19, 2007 and ending May 19, 2007 as the Board
shall determine. The Bylaws, as amended and restated, are filed
as
exhibit 3.3.

On
February 22, 2007, Karen A. Holbrook, director of Huntington since 2004,
announced that she does not wish to stand for re-election to the board of
directors when her current term expires at the 2007 annual meeting of
shareholders due to her forthcoming retirement from her position as President
of The Ohio State University in June 2007.
