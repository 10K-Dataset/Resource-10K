HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INCORPORATED

INDEX



Huntington Bancshares Incorporated

PART I

When we refer to “we,” “our,” and “us” in this report, we mean Huntington Bancshares
Incorporated and our consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates that we refer only to
the parent company, Huntington Bancshares Incorporated. When we refer to the “Bank” in this
report, we mean The Huntington National Bank, our only bank subsidiary.

Item 1: Business

We are a multi-state diversified financial holding company organized under Maryland law
in 1966 and headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. Through our subsidiaries, we provide full-service
commercial and consumer banking services, mortgage banking services, automobile financing,
equipment leasing, investment management, trust services, brokerage services, reinsurance of
private mortgage insurance, reinsurance of credit life and disability insurance, retail and
commercial insurance agency services, and other financial products and services. The Bank,
organized in 1866, is our only bank subsidiary. At December 31, 2007, the Bank had:

We conduct certain activities in other states including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Maryland,
Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Our foreign banking
activities, in total or with any individual country, are not significant. At December 31, 2007, we
had 11,925 full-time equivalent employees.

Our lines of business are discussed in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report to shareholders, which is incorporated
into this report by reference. The financial statement results for each of our lines of business
can be found in Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
this report.

Acquisition of Sky Financial Group, Inc.

On July 1, 2007, Huntington consummated its acquisition of Sky Financial Group, Inc. (Sky
Financial) in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately $3.5 billion.

Under the terms of the agreement, Sky Financial shareholders received 1.098 shares of
Huntington common stock, on a tax-free basis, and a taxable cash payment of $3.023 for each share
of Sky Financial common stock. Conversion of Sky Financial consumer and commercial accounts to
Huntington accounts was accomplished in late September 2007.

Competition

Competition is intense in most of our markets. We compete on price and service with other
banks and financial services companies such as savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies,
mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, and brokerage firms. Competition could intensify
in the future as a result of



industry consolidation, the increasing availability of products and services from non-banks,
greater technological developments in the industry, and banking reform. For example, financial
services reform legislation enacted in 1999 eliminated the long-standing Glass-Steagall Act
restrictions on securities activities of bank holding companies and banks. That legislation, among
other things, permits securities and insurance firms to engage in banking activities under
specified conditions.

Regulatory Matters

General

We are a bank holding company and are qualified as a financial holding company with the
Federal Reserve. We are subject to examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve pursuant to
the Bank Holding Company Act. We are required to file reports and other information regarding our
business operations and the business operations of our subsidiaries with the Federal Reserve.

Because we are a public company, we are also subject to regulation by the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC has established three categories of issuers for the purpose of
filing periodic and annual reports. Under these regulations, we are considered to be a “large
accelerated filer” and, as such, must comply with SEC accelerated reporting requirements.

The Bank is subject to examination and supervision by the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency (OCC). Its domestic deposits are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which also has certain regulatory and supervisory
authority over it. Our non-bank subsidiaries are also subject to examination and supervision by
the Federal Reserve or, in the case of non-bank subsidiaries of the Bank, by the OCC. Our
subsidiaries are also subject to examination by other federal and state agencies, including, in
the case of certain securities and investment management activities, regulation by the SEC and the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

In addition to the impact of federal and state regulation, the Bank and our non-bank
subsidiaries are affected significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve as it attempts to
control the money supply and credit availability in order to influence the economy.

Holding Company Structure

We have one national bank subsidiary and numerous non-bank subsidiaries. Exhibit 21.1 of this
report lists all of our subsidiaries.

The Bank is subject to affiliate transaction restrictions under federal laws, which limit the
transfer of funds by a subsidiary bank to its parent or any non-bank subsidiary of its parent,
whether in the form of loans, extensions of credit, investments, or asset purchases. Such
transfers by a subsidiary bank are limited to:

•

10% of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus for transfers to its parent
corporation or to any individual non-bank subsidiary of the parent, and

•

an aggregate of 20% of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus for transfers to such
parent together with all such non-bank subsidiaries of the parent.

Furthermore, such loans and extensions of credit must be secured within specified amounts. In
addition, all affiliate transactions must be conducted on terms and under circumstances that are
substantially the same as such transactions with unaffiliated entities.

As a matter of policy, the Federal Reserve expects a bank holding company to act as a source
of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to
support each such subsidiary bank. Under this source of strength doctrine, the Federal Reserve may
require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank. They
may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if it fails to
commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the
holding company does not have the resources to provide it.



Any loans by a holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to
deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding
company’s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to
a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, the
bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of
payment over the claims of the institution’s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of
its note obligations.

Federal law permits the OCC to order the pro rata assessment of shareholders of a national
bank whose capital stock has become impaired, by losses or otherwise, to relieve a deficiency in
such national bank’s capital stock. This statute also provides for the enforcement of any such pro
rata assessment of shareholders of such national bank to cover such impairment of capital stock by
sale, to the extent necessary, of the capital stock owned by any assessed shareholder failing to
pay the assessment. As the sole shareholder of the Bank, we are subject to such provisions.

Moreover, the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative
expenses and the claims of holders of deposit liabilities of such an institution are accorded
priority over the claims of general unsecured creditors of such an institution, including the
holders of the institution’s note obligations, in the event of liquidation or other resolution of
such institution. Claims of a receiver for administrative expenses and claims of holders of
deposit liabilities of the Bank, including the FDIC as the insurer of such holders, would receive
priority over the holders of notes and other senior debt of the Bank in the event of liquidation
or other resolution and over our interests as sole shareholder of the Bank.

The Federal Reserve maintains a bank holding company rating system that emphasizes risk
management, introduces a framework for analyzing and rating financial factors, and provides a
framework for assessing and rating the potential impact of non-depository entities of a holding
company on its subsidiary depository institution(s).

A composite rating is assigned based on the foregoing three components, but a fourth
component is also rated, reflecting generally the assessment of depository institution
subsidiaries by their principal regulators. Ratings are made on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 highest) and
are not made public. The bank holding company rating system, which became effective in 2005,
applies to us. The composite ratings assigned to us, like those assigned to other financial
institutions, are confidential and may not be directly disclosed, except to the extent required by
law.

Dividend Restrictions

Dividends from the Bank are the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to our
shareholders. In the year ended December 31, 2007, the Bank declared cash dividends to Huntington
of $239 million. There are, however, statutory limits on the amount of dividends that the Bank can
pay to us without regulatory approval.

The Bank may not, without prior regulatory approval, pay a dividend in an amount greater than
its undivided profits. In addition, the prior approval of the OCC is required for the payment of a
dividend by a national bank if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed
the total of its net income for the year combined with its retained net income for the two
preceding years. At December 31, 2007, the Bank could not have declared and paid any additional
dividends to the parent company without regulatory approval. To help meet any additional
liquidity needs, Huntington has an open-ended, automatic shelf registration statement filed and
effective with the SEC, which permits us to issue and unspecified amount of debt or equity
securities. Considering anticipated earnings and planned issuances of debt, we believe Huntington
has sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations.

If, in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a bank under its jurisdiction is
engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice, such authority may require,
after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from such practice. Depending on the
financial condition of the bank, the applicable regulatory authority might deem the bank to be
engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice if the bank were to pay dividends. The Federal Reserve
and the OCC have issued policy statements that provide that insured banks and bank holding
companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings.



FDIC Insurance

With the enactment in February 2006 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 and
related legislation, and the adoption by the FDIC of implementing regulations in November 2006,
major changes were introduced in FDIC deposit insurance, effective January 1, 2007.

Under the reformed deposit insurance regime, the FDIC designates annually a target reserve
ratio for the DIF within the range of 1.15 percent and 1.5 percent, instead of the prior fixed
requirement to manage the DIF so as to maintain a designated reserve ratio of 1.25 percent. The
FDIC adopted 1.25 percent as the designated reserve ratio for 2007.

In addition, the FDIC adopted a new risk-based system for assessment of deposit insurance
premiums on depository institutions, under which all such institutions would pay at least a minimum
level of premiums. The new system is based on an institution’s probability of causing a loss to
the DIF, and requires that each depository institution be placed in one of four risk categories,
depending on a combination of its capitalization and its supervisory ratings. Under a base rate
schedule, institutions in Risk Category I would be assessed between 2 and 4 basis points, while
institutions in Risk Category IV could be assessed a maximum of 40 basis points. Accordingly, in
contrast to 2006, the Bank was required in 2007 to pay premiums for FDIC insurance on its deposits.

The FDIC determined to set 2007 assessment rates at three basis points above the base schedule
rates, i.e., between 5 and 7 basis points for Risk Category I institutions and up to 43 basis
points for Risk Category IV institutions. To assist the transition to the new system requiring
assessment payments by all insured institutions, the Bank and other depository institutions that
were in existence on and paid deposit insurance assessments prior to December 31, 1996, were made
eligible for a one-time assessment credit based on their shares of the aggregate 1996 assessment
base. The Bank’s assessment rate, like that of other financial institutions, is confidential and
may not be directly disclosed, except to the extent required by law.

In 2007, we were assessed a total of $12.6 million for FDIC insurance on our deposits. This
entire amount was applied to the one-time assessment credit and, therefore, none of this was
recognized as expense within our financial statements. At December 31, 2007, our assessment credit
available for future FDIC insurance assessments was $21.7 million. We anticipate that our one-time
assessment credit will continue to offset FDIC insurance assessments until the fourth quarter of
2008.

The Bank continues to be required to make payments for the servicing of obligations of the
Financing Corporation (FICO) that were issued in connection with the resolution of savings and loan
associations, so long as such obligations remain outstanding.

Capital Requirements

The Federal Reserve has issued risk-based capital ratio and leverage ratio guidelines for bank
holding companies. The risk-based capital ratio guidelines establish a systematic analytical
framework that:

•

makes regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among
banking organizations,

•

takes off-balance sheet exposures into explicit account in assessing capital adequacy,
and

•

minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets.

Under the guidelines and related policies, bank holding companies must maintain capital
sufficient to meet both a risk-based asset ratio test and a leverage ratio test on a consolidated
basis. The risk-based ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet
commitments into four weighted categories, with higher weighting assigned to categories perceived
as representing greater risk. The risk-based ratio represents capital divided by total risk
weighted assets. The leverage ratio is core capital divided by total assets adjusted as specified
in the guidelines. The Bank is subject to substantially similar capital requirements.

Generally, under the applicable guidelines, a financial institution’s capital is divided into
two tiers. Institutions that must incorporate market risk exposure into their risk-based capital
requirements may also have a third tier of capital in the form of restricted short-term
subordinated debt. These tiers are:



•

“Tier 1”, or core capital, includes total equity plus qualifying capital securities and
minority interests, excluding unrealized gains and losses accumulated in other
comprehensive income, and non-qualifying intangible and servicing assets.

•

“Tier 2”, or supplementary capital, includes, among other things, cumulative and
limited-life preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, qualifying subordinated
debt, and the allowance for credit losses, subject to certain limitations.

•

“Total capital” is Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital.

The Federal Reserve and the other federal banking regulators require that all intangible
assets (net of deferred tax), except originated or purchased mortgage-servicing rights,
non-mortgage servicing assets, and purchased credit card relationships, be deducted from Tier 1
capital. However, the total amount of these items included in capital cannot exceed 100% of its
Tier 1 capital.

Under the risk-based guidelines, financial institutions are required to maintain a risk-based
ratio of 8%, with 4% being Tier 1 capital. The appropriate regulatory authority may set higher
capital requirements when they believe an institution’s circumstances warrant.

Under the leverage guidelines, financial institutions are required to maintain a leverage
ratio of at least 3%. The minimum ratio is applicable only to financial institutions that meet
certain specified criteria, including excellent asset quality, high liquidity, low interest rate
risk exposure, and the highest regulatory rating. Financial institutions not meeting these criteria
are required to maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.

Special minimum capital requirements apply to equity investments in nonfinancial companies.
The requirements consist of a series of deductions from Tier 1 capital that increase within a range
from 8% to 25% of the adjusted carrying value of the investment.

Failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject the financial institution to a
variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities. These include
limitations on the ability to pay dividends, the issuance by the regulatory authority of a capital
directive to increase capital, and the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC. In addition,
the financial institution could be subject to the measures described below under “Prompt Corrective
Action” as applicable to “under-capitalized” institutions.

The risk-based capital standards of the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the FDIC specify that
evaluations by the banking agencies of a bank’s capital adequacy will include an assessment of the
exposure to declines in the economic value of the bank’s capital due to changes in interest rates.
These banking agencies issued a joint policy statement on interest rate risk describing prudent
methods for monitoring such risk that rely principally on internal measures of exposure and active
oversight of risk management activities by senior management.

Prompt Corrective Action

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, known as FDICIA, requires
federal banking regulatory authorities to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to
depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, FDICIA
establishes five capital tiers: “well-capitalized,” “adequately-capitalized,” “under-capitalized,”
“significantly under-capitalized,” and “critically under-capitalized.”

An institution is deemed to be:

•

“well-capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% or greater and is
not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific
capital level for any capital measure;

•

“adequately-capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a
Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4% or greater, and, generally, a Tier 1 leverage ratio of
4% or greater and the institution does not meet the definition of a “well-capitalized”
institution;

•

“under-capitalized” if it does not meet one or more of the “adequately-capitalized” tests;



•

“significantly under-capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less
than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 3%, or a Tier 1 leverage ratio
that is less than 3%; and

•

“critically under-capitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity, as defined in the
regulations, to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%.

Throughout 2007, our regulatory capital ratios and those of the Bank were in excess of the
levels established for “well-capitalized” institutions.

FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution,
including payment of a cash dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company, if the
depository institution would be “under-capitalized” after such payment. “Under-capitalized”
institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required by the appropriate federal banking
agency to submit a capital restoration plan. If any depository institution subsidiary of a holding
company is required to submit a capital restoration plan, the holding company would be required to
provide a limited guarantee regarding compliance with the plan as a condition of approval of such
plan.

If an “under-capitalized” institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if
it is “significantly under-capitalized.” “Significantly under-capitalized” institutions may be
subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting
stock to become “adequately-capitalized,” requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of
receipt of deposits from correspondent banks.

“Critically under-capitalized” institutions may not, beginning 60 days after becoming
“critically under-capitalized,” make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated
debt. In addition, “critically under-capitalized” institutions are subject to appointment of a
receiver or conservator within 90 days of becoming so classified.

Under FDICIA, a depository institution that is not “well-capitalized” is generally prohibited
from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing
rate in its market. As previously stated, the Bank is “well-capitalized” and the FDICIA brokered
deposit rule did not adversely affect its ability to accept brokered deposits. The Bank had $0.7
billion of such brokered deposits at December 31, 2007.

Financial Holding Company Status

In order to maintain its status as a financial holding company, a bank holding company’s
depository subsidiaries must all be both “well capitalized” and “well managed,” and must meet
their Community Reinvestment Act obligations.

Financial holding company powers relate to “financial activities” that are determined by the
Federal Reserve, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, to be financial in nature,
incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity,
provided that the complementary activity does not pose a safety and soundness risk. The
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act designates certain activities as financial in nature, including:

•

underwriting insurance or annuities;

•

providing financial or investment advice;

•

underwriting, dealing in, or making markets in securities;

•

merchant banking, subject to significant limitations;

•

insurance company portfolio investing, subject to significant limitations; and

•

any activities previously found by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to
banking.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also authorizes the Federal Reserve, in coordination with the
Secretary of the Treasury, to determine that additional activities are financial in nature or
incidental to activities that are financial in nature.

We are required by the Bank Holding Company Act to obtain Federal Reserve approval prior to
acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of voting shares of any bank, if, after
such acquisition, we would own or control more than 5% of its voting stock. However, as a
financial holding company, we may commence any new



financial activity, except for the acquisition of a savings association, with notice to the
Federal Reserve within 30 days after the commencement of the new financial activity.

USA Patriot Act

The USA Patriot Act of 2001 and its related regulations require insured depository
institutions, broker-dealers, and certain other financial institutions to have policies,
procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing.
The statute and its regulations also provide for information sharing, subject to conditions,
between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial
institutions, for counter-terrorism purposes. Federal banking regulators are required, when
reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications, to take into account the
effectiveness of the anti-money laundering activities of the applicants. Originally enacted for
five years, the USA Patriot Act was signed into law as permanent legislation in March 2006.

Customer Privacy and Other Consumer Protections

Pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, we, like all other financial institutions, are
required to:

•

provide notice to our customers regarding privacy policies and practices,

•

inform our customers regarding the conditions under which their non-public personal
information may be disclosed to non-affiliated third parties, and

•

give our customers an option to prevent disclosure of such information to non-affiliated
third parties.

Under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, our customers may also opt out of
information sharing between and among us and our affiliates. We are also subject, in connection
with our lending and leasing activities, to numerous federal and state laws aimed at protecting
consumers, including the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act,
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposed new or revised corporate governance, accounting, and
reporting requirements on us and all other companies having securities registered with the SEC.
In addition to a requirement that chief executive officers and chief financial officers certify
financial statements in writing, the statute imposed requirements affecting, among other matters,
the composition and activities of audit committees, disclosures relating to corporate insiders and
insider transactions, codes of ethics, and the effectiveness of internal controls over financial
reporting.

Recent Regulatory Developments

Authority for financial holding companies to engage in real estate brokerage and property
management services was proposed by the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve in 2000, but
final regulations implementing the proposal have been subject to a statutory moratorium which was
renewed annually by Congress for the years 2001 through 2007. A further two-year moratorium was
included in an omnibus appropriations bill enacted in late 2007, and it is not possible at present
to assess the prospects either for a future permanent ban or the ultimate adoption of the
long-pending final regulations.

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s “Basel II” regulatory capital guidelines,
originally published in June 2004 and adopted in final form by U.S. regulatory agencies in
November 2007, are designed to promote improved risk measurement and management processes and
better align minimum capital requirements with risk. The Basel II guidelines are to become
operational in April 2008, but are mandatory only for “core banks,” i.e., banks with consolidated
total assets of $250 billion or more. They are thus not applicable to the Bank, which continues
to operate under U.S. risk-based capital guidelines consistent with “Basel I” guidelines published
in 1988.

Federal regulators issued for public comment in December 2006 proposed rules (designated as
“Basel IA”



rules) applicable to non-core banks that would have modified the existing U.S. Basel I-based
capital framework. These regulators announced in November 2007, however, that instead of the
Basel 1A proposals a new rulemaking was being prepared involving a “standardized approach” that
would implement some of the simpler approaches for both credit risk and operational risk from the
more advanced Basel II framework. Smaller U.S. depository institutions would be allowed to elect
to remain under the existing Basel 1-based regulatory capital framework. The new rulemaking is
expected to be published in the first half of 2008.

Item 1A: Risk Factors

Like other financial companies, we are subject to a number of risks, many of which are
outside of our direct control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing
returns. Among the risks assumed are: (1)

credit risk

, which is the risk that loan and
lease customers or other counterparties will be unable to perform their contractual obligations,
(2)

market risk

, which is the risk that changes in market rates and prices will adversely
affect our financial condition or results of operations, (3)

liquidity risk

, which is the
risk that the parent company and/or the Bank will have insufficient cash or access to cash to meet
its operating needs, and (4)

operational risk

, which is the risk of loss resulting from
inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or external events.

In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report,
readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could
materially impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows.

(1) Credit Risks:

The largest single contributor to our net loss in the fourth quarter of 2007, and our reduced net
income in 2007 as compared with 2006, was $405.8 million in charge-offs and special reserves
relating to our credit relationship with Franklin Credit Management Corporation (Franklin). This
charge represents our best estimate of the inherent loss within this credit relationship. However,
there can be no assurance that we will not incur further losses relating to the Franklin
relationship.

As a result of our acquisition of Sky Financial, we have a significant loan relationship with
Franklin. Franklin describes itself as a specialty consumer finance company primarily engaged in
the servicing and resolution of performing, re-performing, and non-performing residential mortgage
loans. Franklin’s portfolio consists of loans secured by 1-4 family residential real estate that
generally fall outside the underwriting standards of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and involve
elevated credit risk as a result of the nature or absence of income documentation, limited credit
histories, higher levels of consumer debt or past credit difficulties. Franklin purchased these
loan portfolios at a discount to the unpaid principal balances and originated loans with interest
rates and fees calculated to provide a rate of return adjusted to reflect the elevated credit risk
inherent in these types of loans. Franklin originated



nonprime loans through its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Tribeca Lending Corp., and has generally held for investment the loans acquired and a significant portion of
the loans originated. In its Current Report on Form 8-K, filed
November 15, 2007, Franklin announced a delay in the filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for
the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2007. In the November 15, 2007 Form 8-K, Franklin stated that due to the rapidly deteriorating real
estate and mortgage origination credit market and resulting increased delinquencies industry wide
in mortgages originated in the years 2005 and 2006, particularly for second-lien loans, Franklin
was in the process of reviewing and assessing its reserves for its portfolio of acquired loans,
particularly second-lien mortgage loans acquired in those years. Franklin stated that this credit
review would result in a substantial increase in the provision for loan losses for the quarter
ended September 30, 2007, again particularly for its portfolio of second-lien loans. In its Current Report on Form 8-K, filed
February 6, 2008, Franklin announced that while they previously believed that the reassessment would be complete on or
before January 31, 2008, the reassessment and related accountants’ review have not yet been
completed. Franklin stated on February 5, 2008, that it expects that it will complete the reassessment in time to file its
2007 third quarter Form 10-Q on or before March 31, 2008.
Franklin also stated on February 5, 2008, that it expects to file its Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, on or before March 31, 2008. At
December 31, 2007, following the troubled debt restructuring of our loans to Franklin, we had $1.2
billion of loans to Franklin, net of the amounts charged-off. For further discussion concerning
our exposure to Franklin, see the “Significant Items Influencing Financial Performance and Comparisons”
section included in our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to
this report, and incorporated by reference.

If we
were to assume the assets of Franklin, it is possible that we would report higher levels of
non-performing loans and charge-offs and while we could report higher levels of interest income
from these loans, lower levels of earnings than currently expected
could result. If Franklin’s financial or operating condition
were to deteriorate, we have established alternatives for loan servicing so that we should not be materially impacted if Franklin were
unable to service loans. In the event of default by Franklin, we can terminate servicing
responsibilities and appoint a successor servicer. Franklin would be contractually obligated to
cooperate with us and incur the costs of transferring all documents, files, and balances to the
successor. Franklin’s recent actions have not resulted in an event of default under any of its
agreements with us.

We do not control Franklin, and Franklin’s ability to collect payments of principal and
interest on its loans and other recoveries from its real estate assets depends upon the efforts of
its own employees and third-party servicers hired by it. Franklin, like other residential mortgage
lenders, is likely to be affected by the declines in home prices and disruptions in credit markets
in many locales across the United States.

Our commercial real estate loan portfolio has and will continue to be affected by the on-going
correction in residential real estate prices and reduced levels of home sales.

At December 31, 2007, we had $9.2 billion of commercial real estate loans, including $1.5
billion of loans to builders of single family homes. There
has been a general slowdown in the housing market across our geographic footprint, reflecting
declining prices and excess inventories of houses to be sold, particularly impacting borrowers in
our eastern Michigan and northern Ohio markets. As a result, home builders have shown signs of
financial deterioration. We expect the home builder market to continue to be volatile and
anticipate continued pressure on the home builder segment in the coming months. As we continue our
on-going portfolio monitoring, we will make credit and reserve decisions based on the current
conditions of the borrower or project combined with our expectations for the future. If the slow down in the housing market continues, we could experience higher charge-offs and
delinquencies in this portfolio.

Declines in home values and reduced levels of home sales in our markets could continue to adversely
affect us.

Like all banks, we are subject to the effects of any economic downturn. There has been a
slowdown in the housing market across our geographic footprint, reflecting declining prices and
excess inventories of houses to be sold, particularly in the eastern Michigan and northern Ohio
markets. These developments have had, and further declines may continue to have, a negative effect
on our financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2007, we had:

Continuing declines in home values are likely to lead to higher charge-offs and delinquencies
in each of these portfolios as compared to the pre-July 2007 historical levels.

The allowance for loan losses may prove inadequate or be negatively affected by credit risk
exposures.

Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. We periodically review the
allowance for loan and lease losses for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends,
collateral values and credit quality indicators, including past charge-off experience and levels of
past due loans and nonperforming assets. There is no certainty that the allowance for loan losses
will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse
changes in the economy, market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers,
industries or markets. If the credit quality of the customer base materially decreases, if the
risk profile of a market, industry or group of customers changes materially, or if the allowance
for loan losses is not adequate, our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, and results
of operations could be materially adversely affected.



(2) Market Risks:

Changes in interest rates could negatively impact our financial condition and results of
operations.

Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference
between interest earned on interest-earning assets (such as investments, loans, and direct
financing leases) and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (such as deposits and
borrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary
policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Conditions such as
inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors beyond our control may also
affect interest rates. If our interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than
interest-bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment, net interest income could be
adversely impacted. Likewise, if interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than
interest-earnings assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income could be
adversely impacted.

Changes in interest rates also can affect the value of loans, securities, and other assets, including
retained interests in securitizations, mortgage and non-mortgage servicing rights. A portion of our earnings results from transactional income.
An example of this type of transactional income is gain on sales of loans and other real estate
owned. This type of income can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year based on
a number of different factors, including the interest rate environment. An increase in interest
rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and
leases may lead to an increase in non-performing assets and a reduction of income recognized, which
could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. For further
discussion, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2007
Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and
incorporated by reference.

Although fluctuations in market interest rates are neither completely predictable nor
controllable, our Market Risk Committee (MRC) meets periodically to monitor our interest rate
sensitivity position and oversee our financial risk management by establishing policies and
operating limits. For further discussion, see the Market Risk — “Interest Rate Risk” section
included in our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to
this report, and incorporated by reference.

(3) Liquidity Risks:

If the Bank or holding company were unable to borrow funds through access to capital markets, we
may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers, or the
operating cash needs to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.

Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The
liquidity of the Bank is used to make loans and leases and to repay deposit liabilities as they
become due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and limits are established by the board
of directors, with operating limits set by MRC, based upon the ratio of loans to deposits and
percentage of assets funded with non-core or wholesale funding. The Bank’s MRC regularly monitors
the overall liquidity position of the Bank and the parent company to ensure that various
alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. MRC also
establishes policies and monitors guidelines to diversify the Bank’s wholesale funding sources to
avoid concentrations in any one market source. Wholesale funding sources include Federal funds
purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and medium- and
long-term debt, which includes a domestic bank note program and a Euronote program. The Bank is
also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, Ohio (FHLB), which provides funding
through advances to members that are collateralized with mortgage-related assets.

We maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity.
There are other sources of liquidity available to us should they be needed. These sources include
the sale or securitization of loans, the ability to acquire additional national market, non-core
deposits, the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances, the issuance
of debt securities, and the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or private
transactions. The Bank also can borrow from the Federal Reserve’s discount window.



If we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed, we might be unable
to meet customers’ needs, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of
operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. For further discussion, see the
“Liquidity Risk” section included in our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are
filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by reference.

If our credit ratings were downgraded, the ability to access funding sources may be
negatively impacted or eliminated, and our liquidity and the market price of our common stock could
be adversely impacted. The Bank has issued letters of credit that support $812 million of notes
and bonds issued by our customers. The majority of the bonds have been sold by The Huntington
Investment Company, our broker-dealer subsidiary. A downgrade in the Bank’s short term rating
might influence some of the bond investors to put the bonds back to the remarketing agent. A
failure to remarket would require the Bank to obtain funding for the amount of notes and bonds that
cannot be remarketed.

As a result of credit deterioration related to our lending relationship with Franklin, and our
related 2007 fourth quarter restructuring of that lending relationship, each of Moody’s Investors
Service (Moody’s), Standard and Poor’s, and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) changed their outlook for our
ratings from stable to negative, Moody’s placed all ratings on review for possible downgrade, and
Fitch downgraded our ratings on our senior unsecured notes and subordinated notes by one grade.
That downgrade, and potential future downgrades in our credit ratings, whether relating to credit
concerns, including our Franklin exposure, or other considerations, could limit our access to the
capital markets, will increase the cost of our debt, and could adversely affect our liquidity and
financial position.

Credit ratings by the three major credit rating agencies are an important component of our
liquidity profile. Among other factors, the credit ratings are based on the financial strength,
credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings,
capital adequacy, the quality of Management, the liquidity of the balance sheet, the availability
of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits, and the ability to access a broad
array of wholesale funding sources. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a negative
change in credit ratings and impact not only the ability to raise funds in the capital markets, but
also the cost of these funds.

Credit ratings as of December 31, 2007, for the parent company and the Bank can be found in
Table 31, included in our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as
exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by reference.

We rely on certain funding sources such as large corporate deposits, public fund deposits,
federal funds, Euro deposits, FHLB advances, and bank notes. Although not contractually tied to
credit ratings, our ability to access these funding sources may be impacted by negative changes in
credit ratings. In the case of public funds or FHLB advances, a credit downgrade may also trigger a
requirement that we pledge additional collateral against outstanding borrowings. Credit rating
downgrades could result in a loss of equity investor confidence.

The OCC may impose dividend payment and other restrictions on the Bank, which could impact our
ability to pay dividends to shareholders or repurchase stock. Due to the significant loss that the
Bank incurred in the fourth quarter of 2007, at December 31, 2007, the Bank could not declare and
pay dividends to the holding company without regulatory approval.

The OCC is the primary regulatory agency that examines the Bank, its subsidiaries, and their
respective activities. Under certain circumstances, including any determination that the activities
of the Bank or its subsidiaries constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice, the OCC has the
authority by statute to restrict the Bank’s ability to transfer assets, make shareholder
distributions, and redeem preferred securities.

Under applicable statutes and regulations, dividends by a national bank may be paid out of
current or retained net profits, but a national bank is prohibited from declaring a cash dividend
on shares of its common stock out of net profits until the surplus fund equals the amount of
capital stock or, if the surplus fund does not equal the amount of capital stock, until certain
amounts from net profits are transferred to the surplus fund. Moreover, the prior approval of the
OCC is required for the payment of a dividend if the total of all dividends declared by a national
bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for the year combined with its
net profits for the two preceding years, less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for the
retirement of any preferred securities.



We do not anticipate that the holding company will receive dividends from the Bank until
the second half of 2008. We anticipate increasing the holding company’s liquidity by raising
additional funds in early 2008.

Payment of dividends could also be subject to regulatory limitations if the Bank became
“under-capitalized” for purposes of the OCC “prompt corrective action” regulations.
“Under-capitalized” is currently defined as having a total risk-based capital ratio of less than
8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, or a core capital, or leverage, ratio of
less than 4.0%. If the Bank were unable to pay dividends to the parent company, it could impact
our ability to pay dividends to shareholders or repurchase stock. Throughout 2007, the Bank was in
compliance with all regulatory capital requirements and considered to be “well-capitalized.”

For further discussion, see the “Parent Company Liquidity” section included in our 2007 Annual
Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and
incorporated by reference.

(4) Operational Risks:

The resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse
affect on our results of operations for a particular period.

Huntington faces legal risks in its businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages
and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions
remain high. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against Huntington could
have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to Huntington, which
in turn could seriously harm Huntington’s business prospects. As more fully described in Item 3 of
this Form 10-K, three putative class actions and one shareholder derivative action were filed
against Huntington, certain affiliated committees, and / or certain of its current or former
officers and directors in December 2007 through February 2008 related to Huntington’s transactions
with Franklin and the financial disclosures relating to such transactions and, in one case,
Huntington stock being offered as an investment in a Huntington employee benefit plan. At this
early stage, it is not possible for management to assess the probability of an adverse outcome, or
reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss in connection with these lawsuits. Although
no assurance can be given, based on information currently available, consultation with counsel, and
available insurance coverage, management believes that the eventual outcome of these claims against
us will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial position or results of operations. It is possible that the ultimate resolution of these
matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations for a particular period.

Huntington faces significant operational risk.

Huntington is exposed to many types of operational risk, including reputational risk, legal
and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized
transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or
those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Negative public
opinion can result from Huntington’s actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities,
including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by
government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public
opinion can adversely affect Huntington’s ability to attract and keep customers and can expose it
to litigation and regulatory action.

We establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide us with timely
and accurate information about our level of operational risk. While not foolproof, these systems
have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate, cost-effective levels. Procedures
exist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practices
are followed. While we continually monitor and improve the system of internal controls, data
processing systems, and corporate-wide processes and procedures, there can be no assurance that
future losses will not occur.



Item 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2: Properties

Our headquarters, as well as the Bank’s, are located in the Huntington Center, a
thirty-seven-story office building located in Columbus, Ohio. Of the building’s total office space
available, we lease approximately 40%. The lease term expires in 2015, with nine five-year renewal
options for up to 45 years but with no purchase option. The Bank has an indirect minority equity
interest of 18.4% in the building.

Our other major properties consist of:

The office buildings above serve as regional administrative offices occupied predominantly by
our Regional Banking and Private Financial and Capital Markets Group lines of business. The Dealer
Sales line of business is located in the Northland operations center.

Of these properties, we own the thirteen-story and twelve-story office buildings, and the
Business Service Center in Columbus and the twelve-story office building in Youngstown, Ohio. All
of the other major properties are held under long-term leases. In 1998, we entered into a
sale/leaseback agreement that included the sale of 59 of our locations. The transaction included a
mix of branch banking offices, regional offices, and operational facilities, including certain
properties described above, which we will continue to operate under a long-term lease.

Item 3: Legal Proceedings

Between December 19, 2007 and February 1, 2008, two putative class actions were filed in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, against the
Company and certain of our current or former officers and directors purportedly on behalf of
purchasers of our securities during the periods July 20, 2007 to November 16, 2007 or
July 20, 2007 to January 10, 2008. These complaints seek to allege that the defendants violated
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Rule
10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act by issuing a series of
allegedly false and/or misleading statements concerning our financial results, prospects,
and condition, relating, in particular, to our transactions with Franklin Credit
Management (“Franklin”). It is expected that both cases will be consolidated into a single action.
At this early stage of these lawsuits, it is not possible for management to assess the probability
of an adverse outcome, or reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss.

On January 16, 2008, a shareholder derivative action was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of
Delaware County, Ohio, against certain of our current or former officers and directors
seeking to allege breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment, all
in connection with our acquisition of Sky Financial Group, Inc., certain transactions
between us and Franklin Credit Management, and the financial disclosures relating to such
transactions. The Company is named as a nominal defendant in this action. At this early stage of
the lawsuit, it is not possible for management to assess the probability of an adverse outcome, or
reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss.



On February 20, 2008, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Ohio against the Company, the Huntington Bancshares Incorporated
Pension Review Committee, the Huntington Investment and Tax Savings Plan (the Plan) Administrative
Committee, and certain of the Company’s officers and directors purportedly on behalf of
participants in or beneficiaries of the Plan between July 20, 2007 and the present. The complaint
seeks to allege breaches of fiduciary duties in violation of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act (ERISA) relating to the Company’s stock being offered as an investment alternative for
participants in the Plan. The complaint seeks money damages and equitable relief. At this early
stage of this lawsuit, it is not possible for management to assess the probability of a material
adverse outcome, or reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss.

It is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material
to the results of operations for a particular period. However, although no assurance can be given,
based on information currently available, consultation with counsel, and available insurance
coverage, management believes that the eventual outcome of these claims against us will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Huntington maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that the
information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time
periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and
communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Huntington’s Management, with the participation of its Chief
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of Huntington’s
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon such evaluation,
Huntington’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end
of such period, Huntington’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

There have not been any significant changes in Huntington’s internal control over financial
reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during
the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, Huntington’s internal control over financial reporting.
