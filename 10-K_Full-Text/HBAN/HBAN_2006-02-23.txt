Huntington Bancshares Incorporated

PART I

When we refer to “we,” “our,” and “us” in this report, we mean Huntington Bancshares
Incorporated and our consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates that we refer only to
the parent company, Huntington Bancshares Incorporated. When we refer to the “Bank” in this
report, we mean The Huntington National Bank, our only bank
subsidiary. We refer in this report to relevant sections of our 2005
Annual Report to shareholders. Portions of our 2005 Annual Report to
shareholders, including the sections we refer to in this report, are
filed as Exhibit 13 to, and are incorporated by reference into, this
report.

Item 1: Business

We are a multi-state diversified financial holding company organized under Maryland law
in 1966 and headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. Through our subsidiaries, we provide full-service
commercial and consumer banking services, mortgage banking services, automobile financing,
equipment leasing, investment management, trust services, and brokerage services. We also reinsure
private mortgage, credit life and disability insurance, and sell other insurance and financial
products and services. The Bank, organized in 1866, is our only bank subsidiary. At December 31,
2005, the Bank had:

•

165 banking offices in Ohio

•

12 banking offices in Kentucky

•

113 banking offices in Michigan

•

5 private banking offices in Florida

•

26 banking offices in West Virginia

•

one foreign office in the Cayman Islands

•

23 banking offices in Indiana

•

one foreign office in Hong Kong

We conduct certain activities in other states including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Maryland,
Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Tennessee. Our foreign
banking activities, in total or with any individual country, are not significant. At December 31,
2005, we had 7,602 full-time equivalent employees.

Our lines of business are discussed in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report to shareholders, which is incorporated
into this report by reference. The financial statement results for each of our lines of business
can be found in Note 26 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in our 2005 Annual Report.

Competition

Competition is intense in most of our markets. We compete on price and service with other
banks and financial services companies such as savings and loans, credit unions, finance
companies, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, and brokerage firms. Competition could
intensify in the future as a result of industry consolidation, the increasing availability of
products and services from non-banks, greater technological developments in the industry, and
banking reform. For example, financial services reform legislation enacted in 1999 eliminated the
long-standing Glass-Steagall Act restrictions on securities activities of bank holding companies
and banks. That legislation, among other things, permits securities and insurance firms to engage
in banking activities under specified conditions.

Regulatory Matters

As discussed further in Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on March
1, 2005, we announced entering into formal written agreements with our banking regulators, the
Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). On
October 6, 2005, we announced that the OCC had lifted its formal written agreement with the Bank.
We announced at the same time that our written agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of
Cleveland remained in effect, but we were advised that we were in full compliance with all
applicable requirements of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 including the well-capitalized and
well-managed criteria.

As discussed further in Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we
announced on June 2, 2005, that we had settled the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) formal
investigation.


Statements in this report concerning any statutory or regulatory provisions or their impact
on us are not intended to be comprehensive and are qualified by reference to such statutory or
regulatory provisions and, to the extent applicable, to our formal written agreement with the
Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.

General

We are a bank holding company and are qualified as a financial holding company with the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). We are subject to examination and
supervision by the Federal Reserve pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act. We are required to
file reports and other information regarding our business operations and the business operations
of our subsidiaries with the Federal Reserve.

Because we are a public company, we are also subject to regulation by the SEC. On December
15, 2005, the SEC adopted final rules establishing three categories of issuers for the purpose of
filing periodic and annual reports. Under the new regulations, we are considered to be a “large
accelerated filer” and, as such, must comply with the new SEC accelerated reporting requirements.

The Bank is subject to examination and supervision by the OCC. Its domestic deposits are
insured by the Bank Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which also
has certain regulatory and supervisory authority over it. Our non-bank subsidiaries are also
subject to examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve or, in the case of non-bank
subsidiaries of the Bank, by the OCC. Our subsidiaries are also subject to examination by other
federal and state agencies, including, in the case of certain securities and investment management
activities, regulation by the SEC and the National Association of Securities Dealers.

In addition to the impact of federal and state regulation, the Bank and our non-bank
subsidiaries are affected significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve as it attempts to
control the money supply and credit availability in order to influence the economy.

Holding Company Structure

We have one national bank subsidiary and numerous non-bank subsidiaries. Exhibit 21 of this
report lists all of our subsidiaries.

The Bank is subject to affiliate transaction restrictions under federal laws, which limit the
transfer of funds by a subsidiary bank to its parent or any non-bank subsidiary of its parent,
whether in the form of loans, extensions of credit, investments, or asset purchases. Such transfers
by a subsidiary bank are limited to:

•

10% of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus for transfers to its parent
corporation or to any individual non-bank subsidiary of the parent, and

•

an aggregate of 20% of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus for transfers
to such parent together with all such non-bank subsidiaries of the parent.

Furthermore, such loans and extensions of credit must be secured within specified amounts. In
addition, all affiliate transactions must be conducted on terms and under circumstances that are
substantially the same as such transactions with unaffiliated entities.

As a matter of policy, the Federal Reserve expects a bank holding company to act as a source
of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to
support each such subsidiary bank. Under this source of strength doctrine, the Federal Reserve may
require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank. They may
charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if they fail to
commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the
holding company does not have the resources to provide it.

Any loans by a holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to
deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding
company’s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a
federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, the
bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of
payment over the claims of the institution’s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of
its note obligations.


Federal law permits the OCC to order the pro rata assessment of shareholders of a national
bank whose capital stock has become impaired, by losses or otherwise, to relieve a deficiency in
such national bank’s capital stock. This statute also provides for the enforcement of any such pro
rata assessment of shareholders of such national bank to cover such impairment of capital stock by
sale, to the extent necessary, of the capital stock owned by any assessed shareholder failing to
pay the assessment. As the sole shareholder of the Bank, we are subject to such provisions.

Moreover, the claims of a receiver of an insured depository institution for administrative
expenses and the claims of holders of deposit liabilities of such an institution are accorded
priority over the claims of general unsecured creditors of such an institution, including the
holders of the institution’s note obligations, in the event of a liquidation or other resolution of
such institution. Claims of a receiver for administrative expenses and claims of holders of deposit
liabilities of the Bank, including the FDIC as the insurer of such holders, would receive priority
over the holders of notes and other senior debt of the Bank in the event of a liquidation or other
resolution and over our interests as sole shareholder of the Bank.

In December 2004, the Federal Reserve announced a revision of its bank holding company rating
system, effective January 1, 2005, to align the system more closely with current supervisory
practices. The revised system:

•

emphasizes risk management,

•

introduces a framework for analyzing and rating financial factors, and

•

provides a framework for assessing and rating the potential impact of
non-depository entities of a holding company on its subsidiary depository
institution(s).

A composite rating is assigned based on the foregoing three components, but a fourth
component is also rated, reflecting generally the assessment of depository institution
subsidiaries by their principal regulators. Ratings are made on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 highest) and,
like current ratings, are not made public. The new rating system applies to us.

Dividend Restrictions

Dividends from the Bank are the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to our
shareholders. In the year ended December 31, 2005, we declared cash dividends to shareholders of
$193.8 million. There are, however, statutory limits on the amount of dividends that the Bank can
pay to us without regulatory approval.

The Bank may not, without prior regulatory approval, pay a dividend in an amount greater than
its undivided profits. In addition, the prior approval of the OCC is required for the payment of a
dividend by a national bank if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed
the total of its net income for the year combined with its retained net income for the two
preceding years. At December 31, 2005, the Bank could declare
and pay dividends to the parent company of $163.0 million and still be considered “well capitalized.” The Bank could declare an additional $230.6
million of dividends without regulatory approval at December 31, 2005, although such dividends
would take the Bank below “well capitalized” levels.

If, in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a bank under its jurisdiction is
engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice, such authority may require,
after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from such practice. Depending on the
financial condition of the bank, the applicable regulatory authority might deem the bank to be
engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice if the bank were to pay dividends. The Federal Reserve
and the OCC have issued policy statements that provide that insured banks and bank holding
companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings.

FDIC Insurance

During 2005, the FDIC classified the Bank as a “well-capitalized” institution, the highest
supervisory subcategory. The Bank, therefore, was not obliged under FDIC assessment practices to
pay deposit insurance premiums in 2005, either on its deposits insured by the Bank Insurance Fund
or on that portion of its deposits acquired from savings and loan associations and insured by the
Savings and Loan Association Insurance Fund. Although not currently subject to FDIC assessments
for insurance premiums, the Bank is required to make payments for the servicing of obligations of
the Financing Corporation that were issued in connection with the resolution of savings and loan
associations, so long as such obligations remain outstanding.


The FDIC may alter its assessment practices in the future if required by developments
affecting the resources of the Bank Insurance Fund or the Savings and Loan Association Insurance
Fund. In November 2005, the FDIC announced that it expected the Bank Insurance Fund to fall below
its statutorily mandated reserve target of 1.25 percent of insured deposits by early 2006. This
could cause the FDIC to impose premiums on all Bank Insurance Fund-insured institutions.
Assessment practices may also be altered if pending legislative initiatives become law.

Capital Requirements

The Federal Reserve has issued risk-based capital ratio and leverage ratio guidelines for
bank holding companies. The risk-based capital ratio guidelines establish a systematic analytical
framework that:

•

makes regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles
among banking organizations,

•

takes off-balance sheet exposures into explicit account in assessing capital adequacy, and

•

minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets.

Under the guidelines and related policies, bank holding companies must maintain capital
sufficient to meet both a risk-based asset ratio test and a leverage ratio test on a consolidated
basis. The risk-based ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet
commitments into four weighted categories, with higher weighting assigned to categories perceived
as representing greater risk. A bank holding company’s risk-based ratio represents capital divided
by total risk weighted assets. The leverage ratio is core capital divided by total assets
adjusted as specified in the guidelines. The Bank is subject to substantially similar capital
requirements.

Generally, under the applicable guidelines, a financial institution’s capital is divided into
two tiers. Institutions that must incorporate market risk exposure into their risk-based capital
requirements may also have a third tier of capital in the form of restricted short-term
subordinated debt. These tiers are:

•

“Tier 1”, or core capital, includes common equity, non-cumulative perpetual
preferred stock (excluding auction rate issues), and minority interests in equity
accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less both goodwill and, with certain limited
exceptions, all other intangible assets. Bank holding companies, however, may
include up to a limit of 25% of cumulative preferred stock in their Tier 1 capital.

•

“Tier 2”, or supplementary capital, includes, among other things, cumulative and
limited-life preferred stock, hybrid capital instruments, mandatory convertible
securities, qualifying subordinated debt, and the allowance for loan and lease
losses, subject to certain limitations.

•

“Total capital” is Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital.

The Federal Reserve and the other federal banking regulators require that all intangible
assets, except originated or purchased mortgage servicing rights, non-mortgage servicing assets,
and purchased credit card relationships, be deducted from Tier 1 capital. However, the total
amount of these items included in a bank holding company’s capital cannot exceed 100% of its Tier
1 capital.

Under the risk-based guidelines, financial institutions are required to maintain a risk-based
ratio of 8%, with 4% being Tier 1 capital. The appropriate regulatory authority may set higher
capital requirements when an institution’s circumstances warrant.

Under the leverage guidelines, financial institutions are required to maintain a leverage
ratio of at least 3%. The minimum ratio is applicable only to financial institutions that meet
certain specified criteria, including excellent asset quality, high liquidity, low interest rate
risk exposure, and the highest regulatory rating. Financial institutions not meeting these
criteria are required to maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.

Special minimum capital requirements apply to equity investments in nonfinancial companies.
The requirements consist of a series of marginal capital charges that increase within a range from
8% to 25% as a financial institution’s over-all exposure to equity investments increases as a
percentage of its Tier 1 capital.

Failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject the financial institution to a
variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities. These include
limitations on the ability to pay dividends, the issuance by the regulatory authority of a capital
directive to increase capital, and the termination of


deposit insurance by the FDIC. In addition, the financial institution could be subject to the
measures described below under “Prompt Corrective Action” as applicable to “under-capitalized”
institutions.

The risk-based capital standards of the Federal Reserve, the OCC

,

and the FDIC specify that
evaluations by the banking agencies of a bank’s capital adequacy will include an assessment of the
exposure to declines in the economic value of the bank’s capital due to changes in interest rates.
These banking agencies issued a joint policy statement on interest rate risk describing prudent
methods for monitoring such risk that rely principally on internal measures of exposure and active
oversight of risk management activities by senior management.

Prompt Corrective Action

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, known as FDICIA, requires
federal banking regulatory authorities to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to
depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, FDICIA
establishes five capital tiers: “well-capitalized,”
“adequately-capitalized,” “under-capitalized,”
“significantly under-capitalized,” and “critically
under-capitalized.”

An institution is deemed to be:

•

“well-capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or
greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, and a Tier 1 leverage
ratio of 5% or greater and is not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or
directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure;

•

“adequately-capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or
greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4% or greater, and, generally, a
Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% or greater and the institution does not meet the
definition of a “well-capitalized” institution;

•

“under-capitalized” if it does not meet one or more of the
“adequately-capitalized” tests;

•

“significantly under-capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio
that is less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 3%, or a
Tier 1 leverage ratio that is less than 3%; and

•

“critically under-capitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity, as defined
in the regulations, to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%.

Throughout 2005, our regulatory capital ratios and those of the Bank were in excess of the
levels established for “well-capitalized” institutions.

FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution,
including payment of a cash dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company, if the
depository institution would be “under-capitalized” after such payment. “Under-capitalized”
institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required by the appropriate federal banking
agency to submit a capital restoration plan. If any depository institution subsidiary of a holding
company is required to submit a capital restoration plan, the holding company would be required to
provide a limited guarantee regarding compliance with the plan as a condition of approval of such
plan.

If an “under-capitalized” institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if
it is “significantly under-capitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” institutions may be
subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting
stock to become “adequately-capitalized,” requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of
receipt of deposits from correspondent banks.

“Critically under-capitalized” institutions may not, beginning 60 days after becoming
“critically under-capitalized,” make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated
debt. In addition, “critically under-capitalized” institutions are subject to appointment of a
receiver or conservator within 90 days of becoming so classified.

Under FDICIA, a depository institution that is not “well-capitalized” is generally prohibited
from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the
prevailing rate in its market. As previously stated, the Bank is “well-capitalized” and the FDICIA brokered deposit rule
did not adversely affect its ability to accept brokered deposits. The Bank had $3.2 billion of
such brokered deposits at December 31, 2005.


Financial Holding Company Status

In order to maintain its status as a financial holding company, a bank holding company’s
depository subsidiaries must all be both “well capitalized” and “well managed,” and must meet
their Community Reinvestment Act obligations.

Financial holding company powers relate to “financial activities” that are determined by the
Federal Reserve, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, to be financial in nature,
incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity,
provided that the complementary activity does not pose a safety and soundness risk. The
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act designates certain activities as financial in nature, including:

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also authorizes the Federal Reserve, in coordination with the
Secretary of the Treasury

,

to determine that additional activities are financial in nature or
incidental to activities that are financial in nature.

We are required by the Bank Holding Company Act to obtain Federal Reserve approval prior to
acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of voting shares of any bank, if, after
such acquisition, we would own or control more than 5% of its voting stock. However, as a
financial holding company, we may commence any new financial activity, except for the acquisition
of a savings association, with notice to the Federal Reserve within 30 days after the commencement
of the new financial activity.

USA Patriot Act

The USA Patriot Act of 2001 and its related regulations require insured depository
institutions, broker-dealers, and certain other financial institutions to have policies,
procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing.
The statute and its regulations also provide for information sharing, subject to conditions,
between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial
institutions, for counter-terrorism purposes. Federal banking regulators are required, when
reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications, to take into account the
effectiveness of the anti-money laundering activities of the applicants.

The U.S. Congress has temporarily renewed the USA Patriot Act and is expected to consider permanent
renewal early in 2006.

Customer Privacy and Other Consumer Protections

Pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, we, like all other financial institutions, are
required to:

•

provide notice to our customers regarding privacy policies and practices,

•

inform our customers regarding the conditions under which their non-public
personal information may be disclosed to non-affiliated third parties, and

•

give our customers an option to prevent disclosure of such information to
non-affiliated third parties.

Under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, our customers may also opt out of
information sharing between and among us and our affiliates. We are also subject, in connection
with our lending and leasing activities, to numerous federal and state laws aimed at protecting
consumers, including the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act,
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act.


Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposed new or revised corporate governance, accounting, and
reporting requirements on us and all other companies having securities registered with the SEC. In
addition to a requirement that chief executive officers and chief financial officers certify
financial statements in writing, the statute imposed requirements affecting, among other matters,
the composition and activities of audit committees, disclosures relating to corporate insiders and
insider transactions, codes of ethics, and the effectiveness of internal controls over financial
reporting.

Recent Regulatory Developments

Authority for financial holding companies to engage in real estate brokerage and property
management services was proposed by the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve in 2000, but
final regulations implementing the proposal have been subject to a statutory moratorium which was
renewed by Congress in late 2005 for an additional year. It is not possible at present to assess
when or whether final regulations will come into effect.

The U.S. Congress approved deposit insurance reform at the beginning of February 2006. Under the
new program, the BIF and the SAIF will be merged. In addition, the FDIC may from time to time
adjust the minimum reserve ratio, currently fixed at
1.25%, within a range between 1.15%
percent and 1.50%, and may adopt a risk-based premium system. Certain retirement accounts
may receive coverage up to $250,000, and the FDIC may adjust coverage levels for inflation
commencing in 2010.

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision presented its “Basel II” regulatory capital
guidelines in July 2004, which would require changes by large internationally-active banks in the
way in which their risk-based capital requirements are calculated. Federal banking regulators are
considering the extent and timing of application of the guidelines to such large U.S. depository
institutions.

On the basis of preliminary regulatory pronouncements, it does not appear that we would meet
the asset size criteria to be included among the U.S. banking organizations affected by Basel II.
In October 2005, however, U.S. banking regulators issued an advance rulemaking notice that
contemplated possible modifications to the “Basel I” risk-based capital framework applicable to
domestic banking organizations that would not be affected by Basel II. These possible
modifications, which would be designed to avoid future competitive inequalities between Basel I
and Basel II organizations and which would likely be applicable to us, include:

•

increasing the number of risk-weight categories,

•

expanding the use of external ratings for credit risk,

•

expanding the range of collateral and guarantors to qualify for a lower risk weight, and

•

basing residential mortgage risk ratings on loan-to-value ratios.

The banking regulators indicated an intention to publish proposed rules for implementation of
Basel I and Basel II in similar time frames, presumptively during 2006.

Item 1A: Risk Factors

Like other financial companies, we are subject to a number of risks, many of which are outside
of our direct control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns. Among the
risks assumed are: (1)

credit risk

, which is the risk that loan and lease customers or
other counterparties will be unable to perform their contractual obligations, (2)

market
risk

, which is the risk that changes in market rates and prices will adversely affect our
financial condition or results of operation, (3)

liquidity risk

, which is the risk that the
parent company and/or the Bank will have insufficient cash or access to cash to meet its operating
needs, and (4)

operational risk

, which is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or
failed internal processes, people and systems, or external events.

In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report,
readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could
materially impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows.


(1) Credit Risks:

We extend credit to a variety of customers based on internally set standards and judgment. We
manage the credit risk through a program of underwriting standards, the review of certain credit
decisions, and an on-going process of assessment of the quality of the credit already extended.
Our credit standards and on-going process of credit assessment might
not protect us from significant credit losses.

We take credit risk by virtue of making loans and leases, purchasing non-governmental
securities, extending loan commitments and letters of credit, and being counterparties to
off-balance sheet financial instruments such as interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives.

Our exposure to credit risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting standards
that emphasize “in-market” lending while avoiding highly leveraged transactions as well as
excessive industry and other concentrations. Our credit administration function employs risk
management techniques to ensure that loans and leases adhere to corporate policy and problem loans
and leases are promptly identified. These procedures provide us with the information necessary to
implement policy adjustments where necessary, and to take proactive corrective actions.

For further discussion about our management of credit risk, see the “Credit Risk” section of
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of our 2005 Annual Report.

Our loans, leases, and deposits are focused in five states and adverse economic conditions in those
states, in particular, could negatively impact results from operations, cash flows, and financial
condition.

Concentration of credit risk can also arise with respect to loans and leases when the
borrowers are located in the same geographical region. Our customers with loan and/or deposit
balances at December 31, 2005, were located predominantly in Ohio, Michigan, West Virginia,
Indiana, and Kentucky. Because of the concentration of loans, leases, and deposits in these states,
in the event of adverse economic conditions in these states, we could experience more difficulty in
attracting deposits and experience higher rates of loss and delinquency on our loans and leases
than if the loans and leases were more geographically diversified. Adverse economic conditions and
other factors, such as political or business developments or natural hazards that may affect these
states, may reduce demand for credit or fee-based products and could negatively affect real estate
and other collateral values, interest rate levels, and the availability of credit to refinance
loans at or prior to maturity.

Declines in home values in our markets could adversely impact results from operations.

Like all banks, we are subject to the effects of any economic downturn, and in particular, a
significant decline in home values in our markets could have a negative effect on results of
operations. At December 31, 2005, we had $4.6 billion of consumer home equity loans and lines with
a weighted average loan-to-value ratio for the portfolio of 80%. In addition, at December 31,
2005, we had $4.2 billion in residential real estate loans with a weighted average loan-to-value
ratio of 71%. A significant decline in home values could lead to higher charge-offs in event of
default in both the consumer home equity loan and residential real estate loan portfolios.

(2) Market Risks:

Changes in interest rates could negatively impact our financial condition and results of
operations.

Our
results of operations depend substantially on net interest income,
which is the difference between
interest earned on interest-earning assets (such as investments, loans, and direct financing
leases) and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings).
Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and
domestic and international economic and political conditions. Conditions such as inflation,
recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors beyond our control may also affect
interest rates. If our interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than
interest-bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment, net interest income could be
adversely impacted. Likewise, if interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than
interest-earnings assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income could be
adversely impacted.


Changes in interest rates also can affect the value of loans and other assets, including
retained interests in securitizations, mortgage and non-mortgage servicing rights, and our ability
to realize gains on the sale of assets. A portion of our earnings result from transactional income.
An example of this type of transactional income is gain on sales of loans and other real estate owned. This
type of income can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year based on a number of
different factors, including the interest rate environment. An increase in interest rates that
adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may
lead to an increase in non-performing assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could have
a material, adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. For further discussion, see
Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our
2005 Annual Report.

Although fluctuations in market interest rates are neither completely predictable nor
controllable, our Market Risk Committee (MRC) meets periodically to monitor our interest rate
sensitivity position and oversee our financial risk management by establishing policies and
operating limits. For further discussion, see the “Interest Rate Risk” section of Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of our 2005
Annual Report.

We could experience losses on residual values related to our automobile lease portfolio.

Inherently, automobile lease portfolios are subject to residual risk, which arises when the
market price of the leased vehicle at the end of the lease term is below the estimated residual
value at the time the lease is originated. This situation arises due to a decline in used car
market values. A reduction in the expected proceeds from the residual
values of our direct financing leases would result in an immediate
recognition of impairment on the lease whereas a reduction in the
expected proceeds from the residual values of our operating leases
would result in an increase in the depreciation of our operating
lease assets over the remaining term of the lease. For further discussion about our management of lease residual risk, see the “Lease
Residual Risk” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of our 2005 Annual Report.

(3) Liquidity Risks:

If we are unable to borrow funds through access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the
cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers, or meet the operating cash needs to fund
corporate expansion and other activities.

Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The
liquidity of the Bank is used to make loans and leases and to repay deposit liabilities as they
become due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and limits are established by the board
of directors, with operating limits set by MRC, based upon the ratio of loans to deposits and
percentage of assets funded with non-core or wholesale funding. The Bank’s MRC regularly monitors
the overall liquidity position of the Bank and the parent company to ensure that various
alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. MRC also
establishes policies and monitors guidelines to diversify the Bank’s wholesale funding sources to
avoid concentrations in any one market source. Wholesale funding sources include Federal funds
purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and medium- and
long-term debt, which includes a domestic bank note program and a Euronote program. The Bank is
also a member of certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB), which provide funding through advances to
members that are collateralized with mortgage-related assets.

We maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity.
There are other sources of liquidity available to us should they be needed. These sources include the sale or
securitization of loans, the ability to acquire additional national market, non-core deposits,
the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances, the issuance of debt securities, and
the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions. The Bank also can
borrow through the Federal Reserve’s discount window.

If we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed, we might be unable
to meet customers’ needs, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of
operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. For further discussion, see the
“Liquidity Risk” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of our 2005 Annual Report.


If our credit ratings were downgraded, the ability to access funding sources may be negatively
impacted or eliminated, and our liquidity and the market price of our common stock could be
adversely impacted.

Credit ratings by the three major credit rating agencies are an important component of our
liquidity profile. Among other factors, the credit ratings are based on the financial strength,
credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings,
capital adequacy, the quality of Management, the liquidity of the balance sheet, the availability
of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits, and the ability to access a broad
array of wholesale funding sources. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a negative
change in credit ratings and impact not only the ability to raise funds in the capital markets, but
also the cost of these funds. In addition, certain financial on- and off-balance sheet arrangements
contain credit rating triggers that could increase funding needs should a negative rating change
occur. Letter of credit commitments for marketable securities, interest rate swap collateral
agreements, and certain asset securitization transactions contain credit rating provisions.

Credit ratings as of December 31, 2005, for the parent company and the Bank can be found in
Table 26 of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of our 2005 Annual Report.

We rely on certain funding sources such as large corporate deposits, public fund deposits,
federal funds, Euro deposits, FHLB advances, and bank notes. Although not contractually tied to
credit ratings, our ability to access these funding sources may be impacted by negative changes in
credit ratings. In the case of public funds or FHLB advances, a credit downgrade may also trigger a
requirement that we pledge additional collateral against outstanding
borrowings. Credit rating downgrades could result in a loss of equity
investor confidence.

We have authorized the use of a substantial amount of our cash for the repurchase of our shares,
and this use of funds may limit our ability to complete other transactions or to pursue other
business initiatives.

In October 2005, our board of directors authorized a new program for the repurchase of up to
15 million shares. We expect to repurchase shares for cash as business conditions warrant. The
full implementation of this repurchase program will use a significant portion of our capital
reserves. This use of capital could limit future flexibility to complete acquisitions of
businesses or technology, or other transactions, or make investments in research and development, new
employee hiring, or other aspects of operations that might be in our best interests, or could
require that we borrow money or issue additional equity securities for such purposes. Any
incurrence of debt may not be on favorable terms and could result in our being subject to covenants
or other contractual restrictions that limit the ability to take advantage of other opportunities
that may arise. Any such incurrence of debt would likely increase our interest expense, and any
issuance of additional equity securities would dilute the stock ownership of existing shareholders.

(4) Operational Risks:

We have significant competition in both attracting and retaining deposits and in originating loans
and leases.

Competition is intense in most of our markets. We compete on price and service with other
banks and financial services companies such as savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies,
mortgage banking companies, insurance companies and brokerage firms. Competition could intensify in the future as a result of industry
consolidation, the increasing availability of products and services from non-banks, greater
technological developments in the industry, and banking reform.

In the
normal course of business, we process large
volumes of transactions. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue
processing at the same or higher levels of transactions. If systems of internal control should fail
to work as expected, if systems are used in an unauthorized manner, or if employees subvert the
system of internal controls, significant losses could result.

We process large volumes of transactions on a daily basis and are exposed to numerous types of
operational risk. Operational risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people,
and systems includes the risk of fraud by persons inside or outside the company, the execution of
unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and systems, and
breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements. This risk of loss also
includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of the operational deficiency or
as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards.


We establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide us with timely
and accurate information about our level of operational risk. While not foolproof, these systems
have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate, cost-effective levels. Procedures
exist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practices
are followed. From time to time, losses from operational risk may occur, including the effects of
operational errors. Such losses are recorded as non-interest expense.

While we continually monitor and improve the system of internal controls, data processing
systems, and corporate-wide processes and procedures, there can be no assurance that future losses
will not occur.

Our acquisitions may not receive the necessary approvals, meet income and/or cost saving
expectation levels, or be integrated within time frames originally anticipated. We may encounter
unforeseen difficulties, including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption in
connection with acquisitions. Acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect
operating results.

The completion of any merger is dependent on, among other things, receipt of shareholder and
regulatory approvals, the timing of which cannot be predicted with precision or may not be received
at all. Additionally, a merger may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, as a result of
unexpected factors or events, and the anticipated cost savings of a merger may take longer to be
realized or may not be entirely achieved. The integration of acquired businesses and operations,
including systems conversions, may take longer than anticipated, may be more costly than
anticipated and may have unanticipated adverse results relating to our existing businesses or the
businesses acquired. Further, decisions to sell or close units or otherwise change the business mix
may adversely impact combined results. Moreover, we may be unable to identify, negotiate, or
finance future acquisitions successfully. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive
issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization
expenses.

An extended disruption of vital infrastructure could negatively impact our business, results of
operations, and financial condition.

Our operations depend upon, among other things, our infrastructure, including equipment and
facilities. Extended disruption of vital infrastructure by fire, power loss, natural disaster,
telecommunications failure, computer hacking or viruses, terrorist activity or the domestic and
foreign response to such activity, or other events outside of our control could have a material
adverse impact on the financial services industry as a whole and on our business, results of
operations, cash flows, and financial condition in particular. Our
business recovery plan may not work as intended or may not prevent
significant interruptions of our operations.


New or changes in existing tax, accounting, and regulatory rules and interpretations could
significantly impact strategic initiatives, results of operations, cash flows, and financial
condition.

The financial services industry is extensively regulated. Federal and state banking
regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers, not to
benefit a financial company’s shareholders. These regulations may sometimes impose significant
limitations on operations. The significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us are
described in this report under the heading “Regulatory Matters.” These regulations, along with the
currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, and monetary laws, regulations, rules,
standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions
conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial
reporting and disclosures. These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations
are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time.

In addition, we may be subject to actions of our regulators that are specific to us. For
further discussion, see Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in our 2005 Annual
Report.

Events that may not have a direct impact on us, such as the bankruptcy of major U.S.
companies, have resulted in legislators, regulators, and authoritative bodies, such as the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and
various taxing authorities responding by adopting and/or proposing substantive revisions to laws,
regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations. International capital standards
developed in the framework of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision may also affect the
competitive environment for United States banks.

The nature, extent, and timing of the adoption of significant new laws and regulations, or
changes in or repeal of existing laws and regulations, or specific actions of regulators, may have
a material impact on our business and results of operations; however, it is impossible to predict
at this time the extent of any impact from these items.

Non-compliance
with USA Patriot Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in
fines or sanctions.

The USA Patriot and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to
prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If
such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity
reports with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These
rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the
identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these
regulations could result in fines or sanctions. During the last year, several banking institutions
have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. We have developed
policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations.


The OCC may impose dividend payment and other restrictions on the Bank, which would impact our
ability to pay dividends to shareholders or repurchase stock.

The OCC is the primary regulatory agency that examines the Bank, its subsidiaries, and their
respective activities. Under certain circumstances, including any determination that the activities
of the Bank or its subsidiaries constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice, the OCC has the
authority by statute to restrict the Bank’s ability to transfer assets, make shareholder
distributions, and redeem preferred securities.

Under applicable statutes and regulations, dividends by a national bank may be paid out of
current or retained net profits, but a national bank is prohibited from declaring a cash dividend
on shares of its common stock out of net profits until the surplus fund equals the amount of
capital stock or, if the surplus fund does not equal the amount of capital stock, until certain
amounts from net profits are transferred to the surplus fund. Moreover, the prior approval of the
OCC is required for the payment of a dividend if the total of all dividends declared by a national
bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for the year combined with its
net profits for the two preceding years, less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for the
retirement of any preferred securities.

Payment of dividends could also be subject to regulatory limitations if the Bank became
“under-capitalized” for purposes of the OCC “prompt corrective action” regulations.
“Under-capitalized” is currently defined as having a total risk-based capital ratio of less than
8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, or a core capital, or leverage, ratio of
less than 4.0%. If the Bank were unable to pay dividends to the
parent company, it would impact our
ability to pay dividends to shareholders or repurchase stock. Throughout 2005, the Bank was in
compliance with all regulatory capital requirements and considered to
be “well-capitalized.”

For
further discussion, see the “Parent Company Liquidity” section of Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of our 2005 Annual Report.

The Federal Reserve Board may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.

The Federal Reserve, which examines us and our non-bank subsidiaries, has a policy stating
that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to
a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the source of
strength doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital
injections into a troubled subsidiary bank, and may charge the bank holding company with engaging
in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. A
capital injection may be required at times when the holding company may not have the resources to
provide it, and therefore may be required to borrow the funds. Any loans by a holding company to
its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other
indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, the
bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory
agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, the bankruptcy law provides that
claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of
the institution’s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations.
Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital
injection becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the holding company’s
results of operations and cash flows.

If any of our Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) affiliates fail to qualify as a REIT, we may be
subject to a higher consolidated effective tax rate.

Huntington Preferred Capital, Inc. (HPCI), Huntington Preferred Capital II, Inc. (HPC-II) and
Huntington Capital Financing, LLC (HCF) operate as REITs for federal income tax purposes. HPCI,
HPC-II, and HCF are consolidated holding company subsidiaries established to acquire, hold, and
manage mortgage assets and other authorized investments to generate net income for distribution to
their shareholders.


Qualification as a REIT involves application of specific provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code relating to various asset tests. A REIT must satisfy six asset tests quarterly: (1) 75% of the
value of the REIT’s total assets must consist of real estate assets, cash and cash items, and
government securities; (2) not more than 25% of the value of the REIT’s total assets may consist of
securities, other than those includible under the 75% test; (3) not more than 5% of the value of
its total assets may consist of securities of any one issuer, other than those securities
includible under the 75% test or securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries; (4) not more than 10% of
the outstanding voting power of any one issuer may be held, other than those securities includible
under the 75% test or securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries; (5) not more than 10% of the total
value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer may be held, other than those securities
includible under the 75% test or securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries; and (6) a REIT cannot own
securities in one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries which comprise more than 20% of its total
assets. At December 31, 2005, HPCI, HPC-II, and HCF met all of the quarterly asset tests.

Also, a REIT must annually satisfy two gross income tests: (1) 75% of its gross income must be
from qualifying income closely connected with real estate activities; and (2) 95% of its gross
income must be derived from sources qualifying for the 75% test plus
dividends, interest, and gains
from the sale of securities. In addition, a REIT must distribute 90% of the REIT’s taxable income
for the taxable year, excluding any net capital gains, to maintain its non-taxable status for
federal income tax purposes. For 2005, HPCI, HPC-II, and HCF had met all annual income and
distribution tests.

If
any of these
REIT affiliates fail to meet any of the required provisions for
REITs, they could
no longer qualify as a REIT and the resulting tax consequences would increase our effective tax
rate.

We could be held responsible for environmental liabilities of properties acquired through
foreclosure of loans secured by real estate.

In the event we foreclose on a defaulted commercial mortgage and/or residential mortgage loan
to recover our investment, we may be subject to environmental liabilities in connection with the
underlying real property, which could exceed the value of the real property. Although we exercise
due diligence to discover potential environmental liabilities prior to acquiring any property
through foreclosure, hazardous substances or wastes, contaminants, pollutants, or their sources may
be discovered on properties during our ownership or after a sale to a third party. There can be no
assurance that we would not incur full recourse liability for the entire cost of any removal and
clean-up on an acquired property, that the cost of removal and clean-up would not exceed the value
of the property, or that we could recover any of the costs from any third party.

We have a pending formal supervisory agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.

On March 1, 2005, we announced entering into a formal written agreement with the Federal
Reserve Bank of Cleveland (FRBC) providing for a comprehensive action plan designed to enhance our
corporate governance, internal audit, risk management, accounting policies and procedures, and
financial and regulatory reporting. The agreement called for independent third-party reviews, as
well as the submission of written plans and progress reports by Management and remains in effect
until terminated by the banking regulators.

We
were verbally advised that we were in full compliance with the financial holding company and
financial subsidiary requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act). This notification
reflects that we and the Bank meet both the “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” criteria under
the GLB Act. We believe that the changes we have already made, and are in the process of making,
will address the FRBC issues fully and comprehensively.


Item 1B:

Item 2: Properties

Our
headquarters, as well as the Bank’s, are located in the Huntington Center, a
thirty-seven-story office building located in Columbus, Ohio. Of the building’s total office space
available, we lease approximately 39%. The lease term expires in 2015, with nine five-year renewal
options for up to 45 years but with no purchase option. The Bank has an indirect minority equity
interest of 18.4% in the building. Our other major properties consist of a thirteen-story and a
twelve-story office building, both of which are located adjacent to the Huntington Center; a
twenty-one story office building, known as the Huntington Building, located in Cleveland, Ohio; an
eighteen-story office building in Charleston, West Virginia; a three-story office building located
in Holland, Michigan; a Business Service Center in Columbus, Ohio; The Huntington Mortgage Group’s
building, located in the greater Columbus area; an office complex located in Troy, Michigan; and
two data processing and operations centers located in Ohio. The office buildings above serve as
regional administrative offices occupied predominantly by our Regional Banking and Private
Financial and Capital Markets Group lines of business. The Dealer Sales line of business is
primarily located in a three-story office building located in Columbus, Ohio. Of these properties,
we own the thirteen-story and twelve-story office buildings, and the Business Service Center. All
of the other major properties are held under long-term leases. In 1998, we entered into a
sale/leaseback agreement that included the sale of 51 of our locations. The transaction included a
mix of branch banking offices, regional offices, and operational facilities, including certain
properties described above, which we will continue to operate under a long-term lease.

PART II

Item 5:
Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Shareholder
Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

The common stock of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated is traded on the NASDAQ Stock
Market under the symbol “HBAN”. The stock is listed as “HuntgBcshr” or “HuntBanc” in most
newspapers. As of January 31, 2006, we had 25,374 shareholders of record.

Information regarding the high and low sale prices of our common stock and cash dividends
declared on such shares, as required by this item, is set forth in Table 36 entitled “Quarterly
Stock Summary, Key Ratios and Statistics, and Capital Data”
included in our 2005 Annual Report. Information regarding restrictions on dividends, as required by this item, is set forth
in Item 1 “Business-Regulatory Matters-Dividend
Restrictions” and in Note 23 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2005 Annual Report.

On January 7, 2005, we released from escrow 86,118 shares of unregistered Huntington common stock,
without par value, to three former employees (the “Former Employees”) in connection with a
settlement upon termination of their employment. In exchange, the Former Employees agreed to waive
all claims they may have against us. The shares were initially placed into escrow in connection
with our acquisition of LeaseNet, Inc. (“LeaseNet”) on September 19, 2002. The Former Employees
were the sole shareholders of LeaseNet at the time of this acquisition. The release of these
shares in this transaction was deemed to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, in reliance on Section 4(2) since this was a transaction by an issuer not
involving a public offering.

Information is as of the end of the period. On October 18, 2005, we announced that the board of directors authorized a new program for the
repurchase of up to 15 million shares of our common stock (the 2005 Repurchase Program). The 2005 Repurchase Program
does not have an expiration date. The 2004 Repurchase Program, with 3.1 million shares remaining, was cancelled and replaced by the 2005
Repurchase Program. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 5.2 million shares under the 2005 Repurchase Program. We expect to
repurchase the remaining shares from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated
transactions depending on market conditions.

On September 4, 2001, options on 3.2 million shares of common stock were granted to,
with certain specified exceptions, full- and part-time employees under the Huntington Bancshares
Incorporated Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the Incentive Plan). Under the terms of the Incentive
Plan, these options were to vest on the earlier of September 4, 2006, or at such time as the
closing price for our common stock for five consecutive trading days reached or exceeded $25.00.
Our common stock closing price exceeded $25.00 for each of the five consecutive trading days
beginning October 1, 2004, and ending October 7, 2004. As a result, options for 2.0 million shares
of common stock granted under the Incentive Plan, net of options for 1.2 million shares cancelled
due to employee attrition, became fully vested and exercisable after the close of trading on October 7, 2004. At
December 31, 2005, options on 0.7 million shares remain outstanding under this plan.

(2)

On August 27, 2002, options on 2.4 million shares of common stock were granted to,
with certain specified exceptions, full- and part-time employees under the Incentive Plan. Under
the terms of the Incentive Plan, these


options were to vest on the earlier of August 27, 2007, or
at such time as the closing price for our common stock for five consecutive trading days reached or
exceeded $27.00. At December 31, 2005, options on 1.5 million shares remain outstanding under this
plan.
