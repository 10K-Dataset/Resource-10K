    BANCSHARES INCORPORATED

INDEX

i


Huntington
    Bancshares Incorporated

PART I

When we refer to “we,” “our,” and
    “us” in this report, we mean Huntington Bancshares
    Incorporated and our consolidated subsidiaries, unless the
    context indicates that we refer only to the parent company,
    Huntington Bancshares Incorporated. When we refer to the
    “Bank” in this report, we mean our only bank
    subsidiary The Huntington National Bank, and its subsidiaries.

Item 1:

Business

We are a multi-state diversified financial holding company
    organized under Maryland law in 1966 and headquartered in
    Columbus, Ohio. Through our subsidiaries, we provide
    full-service commercial and consumer banking services, mortgage
    banking services, automobile financing, equipment leasing,
    investment management, trust services, brokerage services,
    customized insurance service programs, and other financial
    products and services. The Bank, organized in 1866, is our only
    bank subsidiary. At December 31, 2009, the Bank had:

•

340 banking offices in Ohio

•

115 banking offices in Michigan

•

56 banking offices in Pennsylvania

•

50 banking offices in Indiana

•

28 banking offices in West Virginia

•

13 banking offices in Kentucky

•

9 private banking offices

•

one foreign office in the Cayman Islands

•

one foreign office in Hong Kong

We conduct certain activities in other states including Arizona,
    Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York,
    Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Our foreign banking activities,
    in total or with any individual country, are not significant. At
    December 31, 2009, we had 10,272 full-time equivalent
    employees.

Our business segments are discussed in our Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations and the financial statement results for each of our
    business segments can be found in Note 27 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, both are included in our
    Annual Report to shareholders, which is incorporated into this
    report by reference.

Competition

Competition is intense in most of our markets. We compete on
    price and service with other banks and financial services
    companies such as savings and loans, credit unions, finance
    companies, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, and
    brokerage firms. Competition could intensify in the future as a
    result of industry consolidation, the increasing availability of
    products and services from non-banks, greater technological
    developments in the industry, and banking reform.

Regulatory
    Matters

General

We are a bank holding company and are qualified as a financial
    holding company with the Federal Reserve. We are subject to
    examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve pursuant to
    the Bank Holding Company Act. We are required to file reports
    and other information regarding our business operations and the
    business operations of our subsidiaries with the Federal Reserve.



Because we are a public company, we are also subject to
    regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The
    SEC has established three categories of issuers for the purpose
    of filing periodic and annual reports. Under these regulations,
    we are considered to be a “large accelerated filer”
    and, as such, must comply with SEC accelerated reporting
    requirements.

The Bank is subject to examination and supervision by the Office
    of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Its domestic deposits
    are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) of the Federal
    Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which also has certain
    regulatory and supervisory authority over it. Our non-bank
    subsidiaries are also subject to examination and supervision by
    the Federal Reserve or, in the case of non-bank subsidiaries of
    the Bank, by the OCC. Our subsidiaries are also subject to
    examination by other federal and state agencies, including, in
    the case of certain securities and investment management
    activities, regulation by the SEC and the Financial Industry
    Regulatory Authority.

In connection with emergency economic stabilization programs
    adopted in late 2008 as described below under “Recent
    Regulatory Developments,” we are also subject for the
    foreseeable future to certain direct oversight by the
    U.S. Treasury Department and to certain non-traditional
    oversight by our normal banking regulators.

In addition to the impact of federal and state regulation, the
    Bank and our non-bank subsidiaries are affected significantly by
    the actions of the Federal Reserve as it attempts to control the
    money supply and credit availability in order to influence the
    economy.

Holding
    Company Structure

We have one national bank subsidiary and numerous non-bank
    subsidiaries. Exhibit 21.1 of this report lists all of our
    subsidiaries.

The Bank is subject to affiliate transaction restrictions under
    federal laws, which limit the transfer of funds by a subsidiary
    bank or its subsidiaries to its parent corporation or any
    non-bank subsidiary of its parent corporation, whether in the
    form of loans, extensions of credit, investments, or asset
    purchases. Such transfers by a subsidiary bank are limited to:

•

10% of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus for
    transfers to its parent corporation or to any individual
    non-bank subsidiary of the parent, and

•

An aggregate of 20% of the subsidiary bank’s capital and
    surplus for transfers to such parent together with all such
    non-bank subsidiaries of the parent.

Furthermore, such loans and extensions of credit must be secured
    within specified amounts. In addition, all affiliate
    transactions must be conducted on terms and under circumstances
    that are substantially the same as such transactions with
    unaffiliated entities.

As a matter of policy, the Federal Reserve expects a bank
    holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial
    strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources
    to support each such subsidiary bank. Under this source of
    strength doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank
    holding company to make capital injections into a troubled
    subsidiary bank. They may charge the bank holding company with
    engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if it fails to commit
    resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions
    that the Federal Reserve believes might jeopardize its ability
    to commit resources to such subsidiary bank. A capital injection
    may be required at times when the holding company does not have
    the resources to provide it.

Any loans by a holding company to a subsidiary bank are
    subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other
    indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank
    holding company’s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will
    assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank
    regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank.
    Moreover, the bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any
    such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over
    the claims of the institution’s general unsecured
    creditors, including the holders of its note obligations.



Federal law permits the OCC to order the pro rata assessment of
    shareholders of a national bank whose capital stock has become
    impaired, by losses or otherwise, to relieve a deficiency in
    such national bank’s capital stock. This statute also
    provides for the enforcement of any such pro rata assessment of
    shareholders of such national bank to cover such impairment of
    capital stock by sale, to the extent necessary, of the capital
    stock owned by any assessed shareholder failing to pay the
    assessment. As the sole shareholder of the Bank, we are subject
    to such provisions.

Moreover, the claims of a receiver of an insured depository
    institution for administrative expenses and the claims of
    holders of deposit liabilities of such an institution are
    accorded priority over the claims of general unsecured creditors
    of such an institution, including the holders of the
    institution’s note obligations, in the event of liquidation
    or other resolution of such institution. Claims of a receiver
    for administrative expenses and claims of holders of deposit
    liabilities of the Bank, including the FDIC as the insurer of
    such holders, would receive priority over the holders of notes
    and other senior debt of the Bank in the event of liquidation or
    other resolution and over our interests as sole shareholder of
    the Bank.

The Federal Reserve maintains a bank holding company rating
    system that emphasizes risk management, introduces a framework
    for analyzing and rating financial factors, and provides a
    framework for assessing and rating the potential impact of
    non-depository entities of a holding company on its subsidiary
    depository institution(s).

A composite rating is assigned based on the foregoing three
    components, but a fourth component is also rated, reflecting
    generally the assessment of depository institution subsidiaries
    by their principal regulators. Ratings are made on a scale of 1
    to 5 (1 highest) and are not made public. The bank holding
    company rating system, which became effective in 2005, applies
    to us. The composite ratings assigned to us, like those assigned
    to other financial institutions, are confidential and may not be
    directly disclosed, except to the extent required by law.

Emergency
    Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation, Financial Stability Plan, American Recovery and
    Reinvestment Act of 2009, Homeowner Affordability and Stability
    Plan, Other Regulatory Developments and Pending
    Legislation

Emergency
    Economic Stabilization Act of 2008

On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization
    Act of 2008 (EESA) was enacted. EESA enables the federal
    government, under terms and conditions developed by the
    Secretary of the Treasury, to insure troubled assets, including
    mortgage-backed securities, and collect premiums from
    participating financial institutions. EESA includes, among other
    provisions: (a) the $700 billion Troubled Assets
    Relief Program (TARP), under which the Secretary of the Treasury
    is authorized to purchase, insure, hold, and sell a wide variety
    of financial instruments, particularly those that are based on
    or related to residential or commercial mortgages originated or
    issued on or before March 14, 2008; and (b) an
    increase in the amount of deposit insurance provided by the
    Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Both of these
    specific provisions are discussed in the below sections. In
    December 2009, the Secretary of the Treasury announced the
    extension of the TARP to October 2010, but indicated that not
    more than $550 billion of the total authorized would
    actually be deployed.

Under the TARP, the Department of Treasury authorized a
    voluntary capital purchase program (CPP) to purchase up to
    $250 billion of senior preferred shares of qualifying
    financial institutions that elected to participate by
    November 14, 2008. Participating companies must adopt
    certain standards for executive compensation, including
    (a) prohibiting “golden parachute” payments as
    defined in EESA to senior Executive Officers; (b) requiring
    recovery of any compensation paid to senior Executive Officers
    based on criteria that is later proven to be materially
    inaccurate; and (c) prohibiting incentive compensation that
    encourages unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the
    value of the financial institution. The terms of the CPP also
    limit certain uses of capital by the issuer, including
    repurchases of company stock, and increases in dividends. In
    late 2009, the Treasury Department announced that the CPP was
    effectively closed, and that certain other emergency programs
    under the TARP had been or would be terminated.



On November 14, 2008, we participated in the CPP and issued
    approximately $1.4 billion in capital in the form of
    non-voting cumulative preferred stock that pays cash dividends
    at the rate of 5% per annum for the first five years, and then
    pays cash dividends at the rate of 9% per annum thereafter. In
    addition, the Department of Treasury received warrants to
    purchase shares of our common stock having an aggregate market
    price equal to 15% of the preferred stock amount. The proceeds
    of the $1.4 billion have been credited to the preferred
    stock and additional

paid-in-capital.

The difference between the par value of the preferred stock and
    the amount credited to the preferred stock account is amortized
    against retained earnings and is reflected in our income
    statement as dividends on preferred shares, resulting in
    additional dilution to our common stock. The exercise price for
    the warrant of $8.90, and the market price for determining the
    number of shares of common stock subject to the warrants, was
    determined on the date of the preferred investment (calculated
    on a 20-trading day trailing average). The warrants are
    immediately exercisable, in whole or in part, over a term of
    10 years. The warrants are included in our diluted average
    common shares outstanding in periods when the effect of their
    inclusion is dilutive to earnings per share.

Federal
    Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)

EESA temporarily raised the limit on federal deposit insurance
    coverage from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. Separate from
    EESA, in October 2008, the FDIC also announced the Temporary
    Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) to guarantee certain debt
    issued by FDIC-insured institutions through October 31,
    2009. Under one component of this program, the Transaction
    Account Guaranty Program (TAGP), the FDIC temporarily provided
    unlimited coverage for noninterest bearing transaction deposit
    accounts through December 31, 2009. The $250,000 deposit
    insurance coverage limit was scheduled to return to $100,000 on
    January 1, 2010, but was extended by congressional action
    until December 31, 2013. The TLGP has been extended to
    cover debt of FDIC-insured institutions issued through
    April 30, 2010, and the TAGP has been extended through
    June 30, 2010. We participated in the TAGP since its
    beginning, and have elected to continue our participation during
    the extension period.

In addition, on February 3, 2009, the Bank completed the
    issuance and sale of $600 million of Floating Rate Senior
    Bank Notes with a variable rate of three month LIBOR plus
    40 basis points, due June 1, 2012 (the Notes). The
    Notes are guaranteed by the FDIC under the TLGP and are backed
    by the full faith and credit of the United States. The
    FDIC’s guarantee cost $20 million which will be
    amortized over the term of the notes.

(See “Bank Liquidity” discussion for additional
    details regarding the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.)

Financial
    Stability Plan

On February 10, 2009, the Financial Stability Plan (FSP)
    was announced by the U.S. Treasury Department. The FSP is a
    comprehensive set of measures intended to shore up the financial
    system. The core elements of the plan include making bank
    capital injections, creating a public-private investment fund to
    buy troubled assets, establishing guidelines for loan
    modification programs and expanding the Federal Reserve lending
    program. During the course of 2009, the Treasury Department
    announced numerous programs in implementation of the FSP, and
    sent various legislative proposals to the Congress for
    consideration. Summaries of these programs and legislative
    proposals have been posted on a government website,
    FinancialStability.gov. We continue to monitor these
    developments and assess their potential impact on our business.

American
    Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009

On February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and
    Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was enacted. ARRA is intended to
    provide a stimulus to the U.S. economy in the wake of the
    economic downturn brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis
    and the resulting credit crunch. The bill includes federal tax
    cuts, expansion of unemployment benefits and other social
    welfare provisions, and domestic spending in education,
    healthcare, and infrastructure, including the energy structure.
    The new law also includes numerous non-economic recovery related
    items, including a limitation on executive compensation in
    federally aided banks.



Under ARRA, an institution will be subject to the following
    restrictions and standards throughout the period in which any
    obligation arising from financial assistance provided under TARP
    remains outstanding:

•

Limits on compensation incentives for risk taking by senior
    executive officers.

•

Requirement of recovery of any compensation paid based on
    inaccurate financial information.

•

Prohibition on “Golden Parachute Payments”.

•

Prohibition on compensation plans that would encourage
    manipulation of reported earnings to enhance the compensation of
    employees.

•

Publicly registered TARP recipients must establish a board
    compensation committee comprised entirely of independent
    directors, for the purpose of reviewing employee compensation
    plans.

•

Prohibition on bonus, retention award, or incentive
    compensation, except for payments of long term restricted stock.

•

Limitation on luxury expenditures.

•

TARP recipients are required to permit a separate shareholder
    vote to approve the compensation of executives, as disclosed
    pursuant to the SEC’s compensation disclosure rules.

•

The chief executive officer and chief financial officer of each
    TARP recipient will be required to provide a written
    certification of compliance with these standards to the SEC.

The foregoing is a summary of requirements included in standards
    established by the Secretary of the Treasury.

Homeowner
    Affordability and Stability Plan

On February 18, 2009, the Homeowner Affordability and
    Stability Plan (HASP) was announced by the President of the
    United States. HASP is intended to support a recovery in the
    housing market and ensure that workers can continue to pay off
    their mortgages through the following elements:

•

Provide access to low-cost refinancing for responsible
    homeowners suffering from falling home prices.

•

A $75 billion homeowner stability initiative to prevent
    foreclosure and help responsible families stay in their homes.

•

Support low mortgage rates by strengthening confidence in Fannie
    Mae and Freddie Mac.

The Treasury Department has issued extensive guidance on the
    scope and mechanics of various components of HASP. We continue
    to monitor these developments and assess their potential impact
    on our business.

Other
    Regulatory Developments

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s “Basel
    II” regulatory capital guidelines originally published in
    June 2004 and adopted in final form by U.S. regulatory
    agencies in November 2007 are designed to promote improved risk
    measurement and management processes and better align minimum
    capital requirements with risk. The Basel II guidelines
    became operational in April 2008, but are mandatory only for
    “core banks,” i.e., banks with consolidated total
    assets of $250 billion or more. They are thus not
    applicable to the Bank, which continues to operate under
    U.S. risk-based capital guidelines consistent with
    “Basel I” guidelines published in 1988.

Federal regulators issued for public comment in December 2006
    proposed rules (designated as “Basel IA” rules)
    applicable to non-core banks that would have modified the
    existing U.S. Basel I-based capital framework. In July
    2008, however, these regulators issued

,

instead of the
    Basel 1A proposals

,

new rulemaking involving a
    “standardized framework” that would implement some of
    the simpler approaches for both credit risk and operational risk
    from the more advanced Basel II framework. Non-core
    U.S. depository institutions



would be allowed to opt in to the standardized framework or
    elect to remain under the existing Basel 1-based regulatory
    capital framework. The new rulemaking remained pending at the
    end of 2009.

Pending
    Legislation

At the end of 2009, there were numerous legislative proposals,
    originating both in Congressional committees and in the Obama
    Administration, that would, if enacted, have significant impact
    on the banking industry. These proposals include the creation of
    a Consumer Financial Protection Agency with rulemaking,
    examination, and enforcement powers to oversee consumer lending,
    credit card, and other consumer financial activities. The Agency
    would take over certain functions now lodged with banking
    regulators and other agencies. They also include a broad
    financial regulatory reform initiative that would, among other
    things, (a) abolish the thrift charter and convert the
    Office of Thrift Supervision into a division of the Office of
    the Comptroller of the Currency, (b) establish a Financial
    Stability Council to oversee systemic risk issues,
    (c) extend regulation beyond bank holding companies to
    financial sector companies not presently regulated, including
    hedge funds, and (d) provide a means for resolving, without
    governmental bailouts, entities previously regarded as “too
    big to fail.” We will monitor all legislative developments
    and assess their potential impact on our business.

Dividend
    Restrictions

Dividends from the Bank are the primary source of funds for
    payment of dividends to our shareholders. However, there are
    statutory limits on the amount of dividends that the Bank can
    pay to us without regulatory approval. The Bank may not, without
    prior regulatory approval, pay a dividend in an amount greater
    than its undivided profits. In addition, the prior approval of
    the OCC is required for the payment of a dividend by a national
    bank if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year
    would exceed the total of its net income for the year combined
    with its retained net income for the two preceding years. As a
    result, for the year ended December 31, 2009, the Bank did
    not pay any cash dividends to Huntington. At December 31,
    2009, the Bank could not have declared and paid any additional
    dividends to the parent company without regulatory approval.

If, in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a
    bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage
    in an unsafe or unsound practice, such authority may require,
    after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from
    such practice. Depending on the financial condition of the Bank,
    the applicable regulatory authority might deem us to be engaged
    in an unsafe or unsound practice if the Bank were to pay
    dividends. The Federal Reserve and the OCC have issued policy
    statements that provide that insured banks and bank holding
    companies should generally only pay dividends out of current
    operating earnings. As previously described, the CPP limits our
    ability to increase dividends to shareholders.

FDIC
    Insurance

With the enactment in February 2006 of the Federal Deposit
    Insurance Reform Act of 2005 and related legislation, and the
    adoption by the FDIC of implementing regulations in November
    2006, major changes were introduced in FDIC deposit insurance,
    effective January 1, 2007.

Under the reformed deposit insurance regime, the FDIC designates
    annually a target reserve ratio for the DIF within the range of
    1.15 percent and 1.5 percent, instead of the prior
    fixed requirement to manage the DIF so as to maintain a
    designated reserve ratio of 1.25 percent.

In addition, the FDIC adopted a new risk-based system for
    assessment of deposit insurance premiums on depository
    institutions, under which all such institutions would pay at
    least a minimum level of premiums. The new system is based on an
    institution’s probability of causing a loss to the DIF, and
    requires that each depository institution be placed in one of
    four risk categories, depending on a combination of its
    capitalization and its supervisory ratings. Under the base rate
    schedule adopted in late 2006, institutions in Risk Category I
    would be assessed between 2 and 4 basis points, while
    institutions in Risk Category IV could be assessed a
    maximum of 40 basis points.



The FDIC set 2007 assessment rates at three basis points above
    the base schedule rates, i.e., between 5 and 7 basis points
    for Risk Category I institutions and up to 43 basis points
    for Risk Category IV institutions. To assist the transition
    to the new system requiring assessment payments by all insured
    institutions, the Bank and other depository institutions that
    were in existence on and paid deposit insurance assessments
    prior to December 31, 1996, were made eligible for a
    one-time assessment credit based on their shares of the
    aggregate 1996 assessment base. The Bank’s assessment rate,
    like that of other financial institutions, is confidential and
    may not be directly disclosed, except to the extent required by
    law.

For 2008, the FDIC resolved to maintain the designated reserve
    ratio at 1.25 percent, and to leave risk-based assessments
    at the same rates as in 2007, that is between 5 and
    43 basis points, depending upon an institution’s risk
    category.

As a participating FDIC insured bank, we were assessed deposit
    insurance premiums totaling $24.1 million during 2008.
    However, the one-time assessment credit described above was
    fully utilized to substantially offset our 2008 deposit
    insurance premium and, therefore, only $7.9 million of
    deposit insurance premium expense was recognized during 2008.

In late 2008, the FDIC raised assessment rates for the first
    quarter of 2009 by a uniform 7 basis points, resulting in a
    range between 12 and 50 basis points, depending upon the
    risk category. At the same time, the FDIC proposed further
    changes in the assessment system beginning in the second quarter
    of 2009. As amended in a final rule issued in March 2009, the
    changes commencing April 1, 2009, set a five-year target of
    1.15 percent for the designated reserve ratio (which had
    fallen sharply during 2008 and early 2009), and set base
    assessment rates between 12 and 45 basis points, depending
    on the risk category. However, adjustments (relating to
    unsecured debt, secured liabilities, and brokered deposits) were
    provided for in the case of individual institutions that could
    result in assessment rates between 7 and 24 basis points
    for institutions in the lowest risk category and 40 to
    77.5 basis points for institutions in the highest risk
    category. The purpose of the April 1, 2009, changes was to
    ensure that riskier institutions bear a greater share of the
    increase in assessments, and are subsidized to a lesser degree
    by less risky institutions.

In addition to these changes in the basic assessment regime, the
    FDIC, in an interim rule also issued in March 2009, imposed a
    20 basis point emergency special assessment on deposits of
    insured institutions as of June 30, 2009, to be collected
    on September 30, 2009. In May 2009, the FDIC imposed a
    further special assessment on insured institutions of five basis
    points on their June 30, 2009, assets minus Tier 1
    capital, also payable September 30, 2009. And in November
    2009, the FDIC required all insured institutions to prepay, on
    December 30, 2009, slightly over three years of estimated
    insurance assessments.

Taking into account both regular and special deposit insurance
    assessments, we were required to pay total deposit and other
    insurance expense of $113.8 million in 2009. We also
    prepaid an estimated insurance assessment of $325 million
    on December 30, 2009.

The Bank continues to be required to make payments for the
    servicing of obligations of the Financing Corporation (FICO)
    that were issued in connection with the resolution of savings
    and loan associations, so long as such obligations remain
    outstanding.

Capital
    Requirements

The Federal Reserve has issued risk-based capital ratio and
    leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies. The
    risk-based capital ratio guidelines establish a systematic
    analytical framework that:

•

makes regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences
    in risk profiles among banking organizations,

•

takes off-balance sheet exposures into explicit account in
    assessing capital adequacy, and

•

minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets.

Under the guidelines and related policies, bank holding
    companies must maintain capital sufficient to meet both a
    risk-based asset ratio test and a leverage ratio test on a
    consolidated basis. The risk-based ratio is



determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet
    commitments into four weighted categories, with higher weighting
    assigned to categories perceived as representing greater risk.
    The risk-based ratio represents capital divided by total risk
    weighted assets. The leverage ratio is core capital divided by
    total assets adjusted as specified in the guidelines. The Bank
    is subject to substantially similar capital requirements.

Generally, under the applicable guidelines, a financial
    institution’s capital is divided into two tiers.
    Institutions that must incorporate market risk exposure into
    their risk-based capital requirements may also have a third tier
    of capital in the form of restricted short-term subordinated
    debt. These tiers are:

•

“Tier 1”, or core capital, includes total equity
    plus qualifying capital securities and minority interests,
    excluding unrealized gains and losses accumulated in other
    comprehensive income, and non-qualifying intangible and
    servicing assets.

•

“Tier 2”, or supplementary capital, includes,
    among other things, cumulative and limited-life preferred stock,
    mandatory convertible securities, qualifying subordinated debt,
    and the allowance for credit losses, up to 1.25% of
    risk-weighted assets.

•

“Total capital” is Tier 1 plus Tier 2
    capital.

The Federal Reserve and the other federal banking regulators
    require that all intangible assets (net of deferred tax), except
    originated or purchased mortgage-servicing rights, non-mortgage
    servicing assets, and purchased credit card relationships, be
    deducted from Tier 1 capital. However, the total amount of
    these items included in capital cannot exceed 100% of its
    Tier 1 capital.

Under the risk-based guidelines, financial institutions are
    required to maintain a risk-based ratio of 8%, with 4% being
    Tier 1 capital. The appropriate regulatory authority may
    set higher capital requirements when they believe an
    institution’s circumstances warrant.

Under the leverage guidelines, financial institutions are
    required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 3%. The
    minimum ratio is applicable only to financial institutions that
    meet certain specified criteria, including excellent asset
    quality, high liquidity, low interest rate risk exposure, and
    the highest regulatory rating. Financial institutions not
    meeting these criteria are required to maintain a minimum
    Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.

Special minimum capital requirements apply to equity investments
    in non-financial companies. The requirements consist of a series
    of deductions from Tier 1 capital that increase within a
    range from 8% to 25% of the adjusted carrying value of the
    investment.

Failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject the
    financial institution to a variety of enforcement remedies
    available to the federal regulatory authorities. These include
    limitations on the ability to pay dividends, the issuance by the
    regulatory authority of a capital directive to increase capital,
    and the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC. In
    addition, the financial institution could be subject to the
    measures described below under “Prompt Corrective
    Action” as applicable to “under-capitalized”
    institutions.

The risk-based capital standards of the Federal Reserve, the
    OCC, and the FDIC specify that evaluations by the banking
    agencies of a bank’s capital adequacy will include an
    assessment of the exposure to declines in the economic value of
    the bank’s capital due to changes in interest rates. These
    banking agencies issued a joint policy statement on interest
    rate risk describing prudent methods for monitoring such risk
    that rely principally on internal measures of exposure and
    active oversight of risk management activities by senior
    management.

Prompt
    Corrective Action

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of
    1991, known as FDICIA, requires federal banking regulatory
    authorities to take “prompt corrective action” with
    respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum
    capital requirements. For these purposes, FDICIA establishes
    five capital tiers: “well-capitalized,”
    “adequately-capitalized,”
    “under-capitalized,” “significantly
    under-capitalized,” and “critically
    under-capitalized.”



An institution is deemed to be:

•

“well-capitalized” if it has a total risk-based
    capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based
    capital ratio of 6% or greater, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio
    of 5% or greater and is not subject to a regulatory order,
    agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital
    level for any capital measure;

•

“adequately-capitalized” if it has a total risk-based
    capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital
    ratio of 4% or greater, and, generally, a Tier 1 leverage
    ratio of 4% or greater and the institution does not meet the
    definition of a “well-capitalized” institution;

•

“under-capitalized” if it does not meet one or more of
    the “adequately-capitalized” tests;

•

“significantly under-capitalized” if it has a total
    risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6%, a Tier 1
    risk-based capital ratio that is less than 3%, or a Tier 1
    leverage ratio that is less than 3%; and

•

“critically under-capitalized” if it has a ratio of
    tangible equity, as defined in the regulations, to total assets
    that is equal to or less than 2%.

Throughout 2009, our regulatory capital ratios and those of the
    Bank were in excess of the levels established for
    “well-capitalized” institutions.

FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making
    any capital distribution, including payment of a cash dividend
    or paying any management fee to its holding company, if the
    depository institution would be “under-capitalized”
    after such payment. “Under-capitalized” institutions
    are subject to growth limitations and are required by the
    appropriate federal banking agency to submit a capital
    restoration plan. If any depository institution subsidiary of a
    holding company is required to submit a capital restoration
    plan, the holding company would be required to provide a limited
    guarantee regarding compliance with the plan as a condition of
    approval of such plan.

If an “under-capitalized” institution fails to submit
    an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is
    “significantly under-capitalized.” “Significantly
    under-capitalized” institutions may be subject to a number
    of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell
    sufficient voting stock to become
    “adequately-capitalized,” requirements to reduce total
    assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent
    banks.

“Critically under-capitalized” institutions may not,
    beginning 60 days after becoming “critically
    under-capitalized,” make any payment of principal or
    interest on their subordinated debt. In addition,
    “critically under-capitalized” institutions are
    subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator within
    90 days of becoming so classified.

Under FDICIA, a depository institution that is not
    “well-capitalized” is generally prohibited from
    accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on
    deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market. As
    previously stated, the Bank is “well-capitalized” and
    the FDICIA brokered deposit rule did not adversely affect its
    ability to accept brokered deposits. The Bank had
    $2.1 billion of such brokered deposits at December 31,
    2009.



Financial
    Holding Company Status

In order to maintain its status as a financial holding company,
    a bank holding company’s depository subsidiaries must all
    be both “well capitalized” and “well
    managed,” and must meet their Community Reinvestment Act
    obligations.

Financial holding company powers relate to “financial
    activities” that are determined by the Federal Reserve, in
    coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, to be financial
    in nature, incidental to an activity that is financial in
    nature, or complementary to a financial activity, provided that
    the complementary activity does not pose a safety and soundness
    risk. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act designates certain activities
    as financial in nature, including:

•

underwriting insurance or annuities;

•

providing financial or investment advice;

•

underwriting, dealing in, or making markets in securities;

•

merchant banking, subject to significant limitations;

•

insurance company portfolio investing, subject to significant
    limitations; and

•

any activities previously found by the Federal Reserve to be
    closely related to banking.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also authorizes the Federal Reserve,
    in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, to determine
    that additional activities are financial in nature or incidental
    to activities that are financial in nature.

We are required by the Bank Holding Company Act to obtain
    Federal Reserve approval prior to acquiring, directly or
    indirectly, ownership or control of voting shares of any bank,
    if, after such acquisition, we would own or control more than 5%
    of its voting stock. However, as a financial holding company, we
    may commence any new financial activity, except for the
    acquisition of a savings association, with notice to the Federal
    Reserve within 30 days after the commencement of the new
    financial activity.

USA
    Patriot Act

The USA Patriot Act of 2001 and its related regulations require
    insured depository institutions, broker-dealers, and certain
    other financial institutions to have policies, procedures, and
    controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and
    terrorist financing. The statute and its regulations also
    provide for information sharing, subject to conditions, between
    federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as
    well as among financial institutions, for counter-terrorism
    purposes. Federal banking regulators are required, when
    reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger
    applications, to take into account the effectiveness of the
    anti-money laundering activities of the applicants.

Customer
    Privacy and Other Consumer Protections

Pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, we, like all other
    financial institutions, are required to:

•

provide notice to our customers regarding privacy policies and
    practices,

•

inform our customers regarding the conditions under which their
    non-public personal information may be disclosed to
    non-affiliated third parties, and

•

give our customers an option to prevent disclosure of such
    information to non-affiliated third parties.

Under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, our
    customers may also opt out of information sharing between and
    among us and our affiliates. We are also subject, in connection
    with our lending and leasing activities, to numerous federal and
    state laws aimed at protecting consumers, including the Home
    Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures
    Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act,
    and the Fair Credit Reporting Act.



Sarbanes-Oxley
    Act of 2002

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposed new or revised corporate
    governance, accounting, and reporting requirements on us and all
    other companies having securities registered with the SEC. In
    addition to a requirement that chief executive officers and
    chief financial officers certify financial statements in
    writing, the statute imposed requirements affecting, among other
    matters, the composition and activities of audit committees,
    disclosures relating to corporate insiders and insider
    transactions, codes of ethics, and the effectiveness of internal
    controls over financial reporting.

Item 1A:

Risk
    Factors

We, like other financial companies, are subject to a number of
    risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or
    results of operation, many of which are outside of our direct
    control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while
    optimizing returns. Among the risks assumed are: (1)

credit
    risk

, which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease
    customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their
    financial obligations under agreed upon terms, (2)

market
    risk

, which is the risk of loss due to changes in the market
    value of assets and liabilities due to changes in market
    interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and
    credit spreads, (3)

liquidity risk

, which is the risk of
    loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to
    satisfy current or future commitments based on external macro
    market issues, investor and customer perception of financial
    strength, and events unrelated to the Company such as war,
    terrorism, or financial institution market specific issues, and
    (4)

operational risk

, which is the risk of loss due to
    human error, inadequate or failed internal systems and controls,
    violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations,
    prescribed practices, or ethical standards, and external
    influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities,
    disasters, and security risks.

In addition to the other information included or incorporated by
    reference into this report, readers should carefully consider
    that the following important factors, among others, could
    materially impact our business, future results of operations,
    and future cash flows.

(1)

Credit
    Risks:

The
    allowance for loan losses may prove inadequate or be negatively
    affected by credit risk exposures.

Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers.
    We periodically review the allowance for loan and lease losses
    for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends,
    collateral values and credit quality indicators, including past
    charge-off experience and levels of past due loans and
    nonperforming assets. There is no certainty that the allowance
    for loan losses will be adequate over time to cover credit
    losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes
    in the economy, market conditions or events adversely affecting
    specific customers, industries or markets. If the credit quality
    of the customer base materially decreases, if the risk profile
    of a market, industry or group of customers changes materially,
    or if the allowance for loan losses is not adequate, our
    business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, and results
    of operations could be materially adversely affected.

All of
    our loan portfolios, particularly our construction and
    commercial real estate (CRE) loans, may continue to be affected
    by the sustained economic weakness of our Midwest markets and
    the impact of higher unemployment rates. This may have a
    significantly adverse affect on our business, financial
    condition, liquidity, capital, and results of
    operation.

As described in the “Credit Risk” discussion, credit
    quality performance continued to be under pressure during 2009,
    with nonaccrual loans and leases (NALs) and nonperforming assets
    (NPAs) both higher at December 31, 2009, compared with
    December 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007. It should be
    noted that there was a 12% decline in NPA’s in the 2009
    fourth quarter. The allowance for credit losses (ACL) of
    $1,531.4 million at December 31, 2009, was 4.16% of
    period-end loans and leases and 80% of period-end NALs.



The majority of our credit risk is associated with lending
    activities, as the acceptance and management of credit risk is
    central to profitable lending. Credit risk is mitigated through
    a combination of credit policies and processes, market risk
    management activities, and portfolio diversification. However,
    adverse changes in our borrowers’ ability to meet their
    financial obligations under agreed upon terms and, in some
    cases, to the value of the assets securing our loans to them may
    increase our credit risk. Our commercial portfolio, as well as
    our real estate-related consumer portfolios, have continued to
    be negatively affected by the ongoing reduction in real estate
    values and reduced levels of sales and leasing activities. Our
    ACL reserving methodology uses individual loan portfolio
    performance factors based on an analysis of historical
    charge-off experience and migration patterns as part of the
    determination of ACL adequacy. Such factors are subject to
    regular review and may change to reflect updated performance
    trends and expectations, particularly in times of severe
    economic stress. There is no certainty that the ACL will be
    adequate over time to cover credit losses in the portfolio
    because of continued adverse changes in the economy, market
    conditions, or events adversely affecting specific customers,
    industries or markets. If the credit quality of the customer
    base materially decreases, if the risk profile of a market,
    industry, or group of customers changes materially, or if the
    ACL is determined to not be adequate, our business, financial
    condition, liquidity, capital, and results of operations could
    be materially adversely affected.

Bank regulators periodically review our ACL and may require us
    to increase our provision for loan and lease losses or loan
    charge-offs. Any increase in our ACL or loan charge-offs as
    required by these regulatory authorities could have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial
    condition.

In particular, an increase in our ACL could result in a
    reduction in the amount of our tangible common equity (TCE)

and/or

our
    Tier 1 common equity. Given the focus on these
    measurements, we may be required to raise additional capital
    through the issuance of common stock as a result of an increase
    in our ACL. The issuance of additional common stock or other
    actions could have a dilutive effect on the existing holders of
    our common stock, and adversely affect the market price of our
    common stock.

A
    sustained weakness or weakening in business and economic
    conditions generally or specifically in the markets in which we
    do business could adversely affect our business and operating
    results.

Our business could be adversely affected to the extent that
    weaknesses in business and economic conditions have direct or
    indirect impacts on us or on our customers and counterparties.
    These conditions could lead, for example, to one or more of the
    following:

•

A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and
    services offered by us;

•

A decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for
    savings and investment products offered by us; and

•

An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who
    become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws, or
    default on their loans or other obligations to us.

An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or
    defaults could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets,
    net charge-offs, provision for credit losses, and valuation
    adjustments on loans held for sale. The markets we serve are
    dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and thus
    particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic
    conditions.

Declines
    in home values and reduced levels of home sales in our markets
    could continue to adversely affect us.

Like all financial institutions, we are subject to the effects
    of any economic downturn. There has been a slowdown in the
    housing market across our geographic footprint, reflecting
    declining prices and excess inventories of houses to be sold.
    These developments have had, and further declines may continue
    to have, a negative effect on our financial conditions and
    results of operations. At December 31, 2009, we had:

•

$7.6 billion of home equity loans and lines, representing
    21% of total loans and leases.



•

$4.5 billion in residential real estate loans, representing
    12% of total loans and leases. Adjustable-rate mortgages,
    primarily mortgages that have a fixed rate for the first 3 to
    5 years and then adjust annually, comprised 56% of this
    portfolio.

•

$0.9 billion of loans to single family home builders. These
    loans represented 2% of total loans and leases.

•

$4.9 billion of mortgage-backed securities, including
    $3.5 billion of Federal Agency mortgage-backed securities,
    $0.5 billion of private label collateralized mortgage
    obligations, $0.1 billion of Alt-A mortgage backed
    securities, and $0.1 billion of pooled trust preferred
    securities that could be negatively affected by a decline in
    home values.

•

$0.3 billion of bank owned life insurance (BOLI)
    investments primarily in mortgage-backed securities. This
    investment represents 24% of the total BOLI investment portfolio.

Adverse
    economic conditions in the automobile manufacturing and related
    service industries may impact our banking business.

Many of the banking markets we serve are connected, directly or
    indirectly, to the automobile manufacturing industry. We do not
    have any direct credit exposure to automobile manufacturers.
    However, we do have a modest exposure to companies that derive
    more than 25% of their revenues from contracts with the
    automobile manufacturing companies. Also, these automobile
    manufacturers or their suppliers employ many of our consumer
    customers. The automobile manufacturing industry has experienced
    significant economic difficulties over the past five years,
    which, in turn, has adversely impacted a number of related
    industries that serve the automobile manufacturing industry,
    including automobile parts suppliers and other indirect
    businesses. We cannot provide assurance that the economic
    conditions in the automobile manufacturing and related service
    industries will improve at any time in the foreseeable future or
    that adverse economic conditions in these industries will not
    impact the Bank.

Market
    Risks:

We may
    raise additional capital, which could have a dilutive effect on
    the existing holders of our common stock and adversely affect
    the market price of our common stock.

During 2009, we issued 346.8 million shares of additional
    common stock through two common stock public offerings, three
    discretionary equity issuance programs, and conversions of
    preferred stock into common stock. The issuance of these
    additional shares of common stock resulted in a 95% increase of
    outstanding shares of common stock at December 31, 2009,
    compared with December 31, 2008, and those additional
    shares were significantly dilutive to existing common
    shareholders. (See the “Capital” section located
    within the “Risk Management and Capital” section for
    additional information). As of December 31, 2009, we had
    130.2 million of additional authorized common shares
    available for issuance, and 4.8 million of additional
    authorized preferred shares available for issuance.

We are not restricted from issuing additional authorized shares
    of common stock or securities that are convertible into or
    exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common
    stock. We continually evaluate opportunities to access capital
    markets taking into account our regulatory capital ratios,
    financial condition, and other relevant considerations, and
    subject to market conditions, we may take further capital
    actions. Such actions, with regulatory approval when required,
    may include opportunistically retiring our outstanding
    securities, including our subordinated debt, trust-preferred
    securities, and preferred shares, in open market transactions,
    privately negotiated transactions, or public offers for cash or
    common shares, as well as issuing additional shares of common
    stock in public or private transactions in order to increase our
    capital levels above our already “well-capitalized”
    levels, as defined by the federal bank regulatory agencies, and
    other regulatory capital targets.

Both Huntington and the Bank are highly regulated, and we, as
    well as our regulators, continue to regularly perform a variety
    of capital analyses, including the preparation of stress case
    scenarios. As a result of those assessments, we could determine,
    or our regulators could require us, to raise additional capital
    in the



future. Any such capital raise could include, among other
    things, the potential issuance of additional common equity to
    the public, the potential issuance of common equity to the
    government under the CAP, or the additional conversions of our
    existing Series B Preferred Stock to common equity. There
    could also be market perceptions that we need to raise
    additional capital, and regardless of the outcome of any stress
    test or other stress case analysis, such perceptions could have
    an adverse effect on the price of our common stock.

Furthermore, in order to improve our capital ratios above our
    already “well-capitalized” levels, we can decrease the
    amount of our risk-weighted assets, increase capital, or a
    combination of both. If it is determined that additional capital
    is required in order to improve or maintain our capital ratios,
    we may accomplish this through the issuance of additional common
    stock.

The issuance of any additional shares of common stock or
    securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or
    that represent the right to receive common stock, or the
    exercise of such securities, could be substantially dilutive to
    existing common shareholders. Shareholders of our common stock
    have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their
    pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series
    and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in
    increased dilution to existing shareholders. The market price of
    our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of
    our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable
    for common stock in anticipation of such sales.

The value
    of certain investment securities is volatile and future declines
    or

other-than-temporary

impairments could have a materially adverse affect on our future
    earnings and regulatory capital.

Continued volatility in the market value for certain of our
    investment securities, whether caused by changes in market
    perceptions of credit risk, as reflected in the expected market
    yield of the security, or actual defaults in the portfolio could
    result in significant fluctuations in the value of the
    securities. This could have a material adverse impact on our
    accumulated other comprehensive income and shareholders’
    equity depending on the direction of the fluctuations.
    Furthermore, future downgrades or defaults in these securities
    could result in future classifications as other than temporarily
    impaired. This could have a material impact on our future
    earnings, although the impact on shareholders’ equity will
    be offset by any amount already included in other comprehensive
    income for securities where we have recorded temporary
    impairment.

Changes
    in interest rates could negatively impact our financial
    condition and results of operations.

Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest
    income, which is the difference between interest earned on
    interest-earning assets (such as investments and loans) and
    interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (such as deposits
    and borrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many
    factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic
    and international economic and political conditions. Conditions
    such as inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and
    other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates.
    If our interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly
    than interest-bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate
    environment, net interest income could be adversely impacted.
    Likewise, if interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more
    quickly than interest-earnings assets in a rising interest rate
    environment, net interest income could be adversely impacted.

Changes in interest rates also can affect the value of loans,
    securities, and other assets, including retained interests in
    securitizations, mortgage and non-mortgage servicing rights and
    assets under management. A portion of our earnings results from
    transactional income. Examples of transactional income include
    trust income, brokerage income, gain on sales of loans and other
    real estate owned. This type of income can vary significantly
    from

quarter-to-quarter

and

year-to-year

based on a number of different factors, including the interest
    rate environment. An increase in interest rates that adversely
    affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or
    interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in
    nonperforming assets and a reduction of income recognized, which
    could have a material, adverse effect on our results of
    operations and cash flows. When we decide to stop accruing
    interest on a loan, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest
    receivable, which decreases interest income. Subsequently, we
    continue to have a cost to fund the loan, which is reflected as
    interest expense, without any interest income to offset the
    associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the amount of
    loans on nonaccrual status could have an adverse impact on net
    interest income.



Although fluctuations in market interest rates are neither
    completely predictable nor controllable, our Market Risk
    Committee (MRC) meets periodically to monitor our interest rate
    sensitivity position and oversee our financial risk management
    by establishing policies and operating limits. For further
    discussion, see the Market Risk — “Interest Rate
    Risk” section in Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. If short-term
    interest rates remain at their historically low levels for a
    prolonged period, and assuming longer-term interest rates fall
    further, we could experience net interest margin compression as
    our interest-earning assets would continue to reprice downward
    while our interest-bearing liability rates, especially customer
    deposit rates, could remain at current levels.

Liquidity
    Risks:

If the
    Bank or holding company were unable to borrow funds through
    access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the cash
    flow requirements of our depositors, creditors, and borrowers,
    or the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and
    other corporate activities.

Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely
    basis at a reasonable cost. The liquidity of the Bank is used to
    make loans and leases and to repay deposit liabilities as they
    become due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and
    limits are established by the board of directors, with operating
    limits set by MRC, based upon the ratio of loans to deposits and
    percentage of assets funded with non-core or wholesale funding.
    The Bank’s MRC regularly monitors the overall liquidity
    position of the Bank and the parent company to ensure that
    various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated
    events that could affect liquidity. MRC also establishes
    policies and monitors guidelines to diversify the Bank’s
    wholesale funding sources to avoid concentrations in any one
    market source. Wholesale funding sources include Federal funds
    purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core
    deposits, and medium- and long-term debt, which includes a
    domestic bank note program and a Euronote program. The Bank is
    also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, Ohio
    (FHLB), which provides funding through advances to members that
    are collateralized with mortgage-related assets.

We maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a
    secondary source of liquidity. There are other sources of
    liquidity available to us should they be needed. These sources
    include the sale or securitization of loans, the ability to
    acquire additional national market, non-core deposits, issuance
    of additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances,
    the issuance of debt securities, and the issuance of preferred
    or common securities in public or private transactions. The Bank
    also can borrow from the Federal Reserve’s discount window.

Starting in the middle of 2007, there has been significant
    turmoil and volatility in worldwide financial markets which is,
    at present, moderating. These conditions have resulted in a
    disruption in the liquidity of financial markets, and could
    directly impact us to the extent we need to access capital
    markets to raise funds to support our business and overall
    liquidity position. This situation could affect the cost of such
    funds or our ability to raise such funds. If we were unable to
    access any of these funding sources when needed, we might be
    unable to meet customers’ needs, which could adversely
    impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash
    flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. We may, from
    time to time, consider opportunistically retiring our
    outstanding securities, including our subordinated debt, trust
    preferred securities and preferred shares in privately
    negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common
    shares. This could adversely affect our liquidity position. For
    further discussion, see the “Liquidity Risk” section.

The OCC
    has imposed dividend payment and other restrictions on the Bank,
    which could impact our ability to pay dividends to shareholders
    or repurchase stock. Due to the losses that the Bank incurred in
    2009 and 2008, at December 31, 2009, the Bank could not
    declare and pay dividends to the holding company without
    regulatory approval.

The OCC is the primary regulatory agency that examines the Bank,
    its subsidiaries, and their respective activities. Under certain
    circumstances, including any determination that the activities
    of the Bank or its subsidiaries constitute an unsafe and unsound
    banking practice, the OCC has the authority by statute to
    restrict the Bank’s ability to transfer assets, make
    shareholder distributions, and redeem preferred securities.



Under applicable statutes and regulations, dividends by a
    national bank may be paid out of current or retained net
    profits, but a national bank is prohibited from declaring a cash
    dividend on shares of its common stock out of net profits until
    the surplus fund equals the amount of capital stock or, if the
    surplus fund does not equal the amount of capital stock, until
    certain amounts from net profits are transferred to the surplus
    fund. Moreover, the prior approval of the OCC is required for
    the payment of a dividend if the total of all dividends declared
    by a national bank in any calendar year would exceed the total
    of its net profits for the year combined with its net profits
    for the two preceding years, less any required transfers to
    surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred securities.

We do not anticipate that the holding company will receive
    dividends from the Bank during 2010, as we build the Bank’s
    regulatory capital levels above our already
    “well-capitalized” level.

Payment of dividends could also be subject to regulatory
    limitations if the Bank became “under-capitalized” for
    purposes of the OCC “prompt corrective action”
    regulations. “Under-capitalized” is currently defined
    as having a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a
    Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, or a
    core capital, or leverage, ratio of less than 4.0%. If the Bank
    were unable to pay dividends to the parent company, it could
    impact our ability to pay dividends to shareholders or
    repurchase stock. Throughout 2009, the Bank was in compliance
    with all regulatory capital requirements and considered to be
    “well-capitalized.”

For further discussion, see the “Parent Company
    Liquidity” section.

Operational
    Risks:

Legislative
    and regulatory actions taken now or in the future to address the
    current liquidity and credit crisis in the financial industry
    may significantly affect our financial condition, results of
    operation, liquidity, or stock price.

Current economic conditions, particularly in the financial
    markets, have resulted in government regulatory agencies and
    political bodies placing increased focus on and scrutiny of the
    financial services industry. The U.S. Government has
    intervened on an unprecedented scale, responding to what has
    been commonly referred to as the financial crisis. In addition
    to the U.S. Treasury Department’s CPP under the TARP
    announced in the fall of 2008 and the new Capital Assistance
    Program (CAP) announced in spring of 2009, the
    U.S. Government has taken steps that include enhancing the
    liquidity support available to financial institutions,
    establishing a commercial paper funding facility, temporarily
    guaranteeing money market funds and certain types of debt
    issuances, and increasing insurance on bank deposits. The
    U.S. Congress, through the Emergency Economic Stabilization
    Act of 2008 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
    2009, has imposed a number of restrictions and limitations on
    the operations of financial services firms participating in the
    federal programs.

These programs subject us, and other financial institutions that
    participate in them, to additional restrictions, oversight, and
    costs that may have an adverse impact on our business, financial
    condition, results of operations, or the price of our common
    stock. In addition, new proposals for legislation continue to be
    introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further increase
    regulation of the financial services industry and impose
    restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms
    within the industry to conduct business consistent with
    historical practices, including as related to compensation,
    interest rates, the impact of bankruptcy proceedings on consumer
    real property mortgages, and otherwise. Federal and state
    regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their
    regulations

and/or

change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. We
    cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future
    legislation, regulation, or its application. Compliance with
    such current and potential regulation and scrutiny may
    significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our
    internal business processes, negatively impact the
    recoverability of certain of our recorded assets, require us to
    increase our regulatory capital, and limit our ability to pursue
    business opportunities in an efficient manner.

Recent legislative proposals in Congress could impact how we
    assess fees on deposit accounts for items and transactions that
    either overdraw an account or that are returned for
    nonsufficient funds. It is uncertain



which, if any, of the changes in these proposals will be
    adopted. Additionally, on November 12, 2009, the Federal
    Reserve Board (the “Board”) issued its final rule
    under Regulation E regarding overdraft fees, which becomes
    effective for new accounts on July 1, 2010, and for
    existing accounts on August 15, 2010. This rule generally
    prohibits financial institutions from charging overdraft fees
    for ATM and one-time debit card transactions that overdraw
    consumer deposit accounts, unless the consumer “opts
    in” to having such overdrafts authorized and paid. This
    rule may be affected by the legislative proposals in Congress
    regarding overdraft fees. Thus, although the Board’s rule
    will impact the amount of overdraft fees we will be able to
    charge, we cannot currently predict whether either the
    Board’s rule or the legislative proposals in Congress will
    have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.

We are
    subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions.
    The Internal Revenue Service and other taxing jurisdictions may
    propose various adjustments to our previously filed tax returns.
    It is possible that the ultimate resolution of such proposed
    adjustments, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of
    operations in the period it occurs.

The calculation of our provision for federal income taxes is
    complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments. We have
    two accruals for income taxes: our income tax receivable
    represents the estimated amount currently due from the federal
    government, net of any reserve for potential audit issues, and
    is reported as a component of “accrued income and other
    assets” in our consolidated balance sheet; our deferred
    federal income tax asset or liability represents the estimated
    impact of temporary differences between how we recognize our
    assets and liabilities under GAAP, and how such assets and
    liabilities are recognized under federal tax code.

In the ordinary course of business, we operate in various taxing
    jurisdictions and are subject to income and nonincome taxes. The
    effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretation of the
    relevant current tax laws. We believe the aggregate liabilities
    related to taxes are appropriately reflected in the consolidated
    financial statements. We review the appropriate tax treatment of
    all transactions taking into consideration statutory, judicial,
    and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax positions. In
    addition, we rely on various tax opinions, recent tax audits,
    and historical experience.

From time to time, we engage in business transactions that may
    have an effect on our tax liabilities. Where appropriate, we
    have obtained opinions of outside experts and have assessed the
    relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of
    business transactions taking into account statutory, judicial,
    and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position.
    However, changes to our estimates of accrued taxes can occur due
    to changes in tax rates, implementation of new business
    strategies, resolution of issues with taxing authorities
    regarding previously taken tax positions and newly enacted
    statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance. Such changes could
    affect the amount of our accrued taxes and could be material to
    our financial position

and/or

results of operations.

The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the
    U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state, city, and
    foreign jurisdictions. Federal income tax audits have been
    completed through 2005. In 2009, the IRS began the audit of our
    consolidated federal income tax returns for the tax years 2006
    and 2007. In addition, various state and other jurisdictions
    remain open to examination for tax years 2000 and forward.

The Internal Revenue Service, State of Ohio, and other state tax
    officials have proposed adjustments to our previously filed tax
    returns. We believe that the tax positions taken by us related
    to such proposed adjustments were correct and supported by
    applicable statutes, regulations, and judicial authority, and
    intend to vigorously defend them. It is possible that the
    ultimate resolution of the proposed adjustments, if unfavorable,
    may be material to the results of operations in the period it
    occurs. However, although no assurances can be given, we believe
    that the resolution of these examinations will not, individually
    or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position.

The Franklin restructuring resulted in a $159.9 million net
    deferred tax asset equal to the amount of income and equity that
    was included in our operating results for the 2009 first
    quarter. While we believe that our position regarding the
    deferred tax asset and related income recognition is correct,
    that position could be subject to challenge.



If our
    regulators deem it appropriate, they can take regulatory actions
    that could impact our ability to compete for new business,
    constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs, and increase
    the cost of our services.

Huntington and its subsidiaries are subject to the supervision
    and regulation of various State and Federal regulators,
    including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the
    Federal Reserve, the FDIC, SEC, FINRA, and various state
    regulatory agencies. As such, Huntington is subject to a wide
    variety of laws and regulations, many of which are discussed in
    the “Regulatory Matters” section. As part of their
    supervisory process, which includes periodic examinations and
    continuous monitoring, the regulators have the authority to
    impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the
    manner in which we manage the organization. These actions could
    impact the organization in a variety of ways, including
    subjecting us to monetary fines, restricting our ability to pay
    dividends, precluding mergers or acquisitions, limiting our
    ability to offer certain products or services, or imposing
    additional capital requirements.

The
    resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable,
    could have a material adverse affect on our results of
    operations for a particular period.

Huntington faces legal risks in its businesses, and the volume
    of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in
    litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial
    institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability or
    significant regulatory action against Huntington could have
    material adverse financial effects or cause significant
    reputational harm to Huntington, which in turn could seriously
    harm Huntington’s business prospects. As more fully
    described in Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, certain putative class actions and shareholder
    derivative actions were filed against Huntington, certain
    affiliated committees, and / or certain of its current
    or former officers and directors. At this time, it is not
    possible for management to assess the probability of an adverse
    outcome, or reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss
    in connection with these lawsuits. Although no assurance can be
    given, based on information currently available, consultation
    with counsel, and available insurance coverage, management
    believes that the eventual outcome of these claims against us
    will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material
    adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results
    of operations. However, it is possible that the ultimate
    resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to
    the results of operations for a particular period.

Huntington
    faces other significant operational risks.

Huntington is exposed to many types of operational risk,
    including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk
    of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized
    transactions by employees or outsiders, or operational errors by
    employees, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those
    resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications
    systems. In addition, today’s threats to customer
    information and information systems are complex, more wide
    spread, continually emerging, and increasing at a rapid pace.
    Huntington continues to invest in better tools and processes in
    all key security areas, and monitors these threats with
    increased rigor and focus.

Negative public opinion can result from Huntington’s actual
    or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including
    lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions and
    from actions taken by government regulators and community
    organizations in response to those activities. Negative public
    opinion can adversely affect Huntington’s ability to
    attract and keep customers and can expose it to litigation and
    regulatory action.

We establish and maintain systems of internal operational
    controls that provide us with timely and accurate information
    about our level of operational risk. While not foolproof, these
    systems have been designed to manage operational risk at
    appropriate, cost-effective levels. Procedures exist that are
    designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics,
    and business practices are followed. While we continually
    monitor and improve the system of internal controls, data
    processing systems, and corporate-wide processes and procedures,
    there can be no assurance that future losses will not occur.



Failure
    to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting
    in the future could impair our ability to accurately and timely
    report its financial results or prevent fraud, resulting in loss
    of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and
    stock price.

Effective internal controls over financial reporting are
    necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent
    fraud. As a financial holding company, we are subject to
    regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and
    procedures. Management continually seeks to improve these
    controls and procedures.

Management believes that our key internal controls over
    financial reporting are currently effective; however, such
    controls and procedures will be modified, supplemented, and
    changed from time to time as necessitated by our growth and in
    reaction to external events and developments. While Management
    will continue to assess our controls and procedures and take
    immediate action to remediate any future perceived gaps, there
    can be no guarantee of the effectiveness of these controls and
    procedures on an on-going basis. Any failure to maintain in the
    future an effective internal control environment could impact
    our ability to report its financial results on an accurate and
    timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of
    investor confidence, and adversely impact its business and stock
    price.

Properties

Our headquarters, as well as the Bank’s, are located in the
    Huntington Center, a thirty-seven-story office building located
    in Columbus, Ohio. Of the building’s total office space
    available, we lease approximately 40%. The lease term expires in
    2015, with nine five-year renewal options for up to
    45 years but with no purchase option. The Bank has an
    indirect minority equity interest of 18.4% in the building.

Our other major properties consist of:

•

a thirteen-story and a twelve-story office building, both of
    which are located adjacent to the Huntington Center;

•

a twenty-one story office building, known as the Huntington
    Building, located in Cleveland, Ohio;

•

an eighteen-story office building in Charleston, West Virginia;

•

a three-story office building located in Holland, Michigan;

•

The Crosswoods building, located in the greater Columbus area;

•

a twelve story office building in Youngstown, Ohio

•

a ten story office building in Warren, Ohio

•

an office complex located in Troy, Michigan; and

•

three data processing and operations centers (Easton, Northland,
    and Parma) located in Ohio and one in Indianapolis.

The office buildings above serve as regional administrative
    offices occupied predominantly by our Retail and Business
    Banking and Private Financial Group business segments. The Auto
    Finance and Dealer Services business segment is located in the
    Northland operations center.

Of these properties, we own the thirteen-story and twelve-story
    office buildings, and the Business Service Center in Columbus
    and the twelve-story office building in Youngstown, Ohio. All of
    the other major properties are held under long-term leases. In
    1998, we entered into a sale/leaseback agreement that included
    the sale of 59 of our locations. The transaction included a mix
    of branch banking offices, regional offices, and operational
    facilities, including certain properties described above, which
    we will continue to operate under a long-term lease.

Market
    for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters
    and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

The common stock of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated is traded
    on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol “HBAN”.
    The stock is listed as “HuntgBcshr” or
    “HuntBanc” in most newspapers. As of January 31,
    2010, we had 40,155 shareholders of record.

Information regarding the high and low sale prices of our common
    stock and cash dividends declared on such shares, as required by
    this item, is set forth in Table 65 entitled “Selected
    Quarterly Income Statement Data”. Information regarding
    restrictions on dividends, as required by this item, is set
    forth in Item 1 “Business-Regulatory Matters-Dividend
    Restrictions” and in Note 25 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

As a condition to participate in the TARP, Huntington may not
    repurchase any additional shares without prior approval from the
    Department of Treasury. Huntington did not repurchase any shares
    under the 2006 Repurchase Program for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. On February 18, 2009, the board of
    directors terminated the previously authorized program for the
    repurchase of up to 15 million shares of common stock (the
    2006 Repurchase Program).

The line graph below compares the yearly percentage change in
    cumulative total shareholder return on Huntington common stock
    and the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 Index and
    the KBW 50 Bank Index for the period December 31, 2004,
    through December 31, 2009. The KBW 50 Bank Index is a
    market capitalization-weighted bank stock index published by
    Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. The index is composed of the
    50 largest banking companies and includes all money-center banks
    and most major regional banks. An investment of $100 on
    December 31, 2004, and the reinvestment of all dividends
    are assumed.

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A)
    provides information we believe necessary for understanding our
    financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of
    operations, and cash flows. The MD&A should be read in
    conjunction with the financial statements, notes, and other
    information contained in this report.

Our discussion is divided into key segments:

•

Introduction

— Provides overview comments
    on important matters including risk factors, acquisitions, and
    other items. These are essential for understanding our
    performance and prospects.

•

Discussion of Results of Operations

— 
    Reviews financial performance from a consolidated company
    perspective. It also includes a “Significant Items”
    section that summarizes key issues helpful for understanding
    performance trends. Key consolidated average balance sheet and
    income statement trends are also discussed in this section.

•

Risk Management and Capital

— Discusses
    credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks, including how
    these are managed, as well as performance trends. It also
    includes a discussion of liquidity policies, how we obtain
    funding, and related performance. In addition, there is a
    discussion of guarantees

and/or

commitments made for items such as standby letters of credit and
    commitments to sell loans, and a discussion that reviews the
    adequacy of capital, including regulatory capital requirements.

•

Business Segment Discussion

— Provides an
    overview of financial performance for each of our major business
    segments and provides additional discussion of trends underlying
    consolidated financial performance.

•

Results for the Fourth Quarter

— Provides
    a discussion of results for the 2009 fourth quarter compared
    with the 2008 fourth quarter.

A reading of each section is important to understand fully the
    nature of our financial performance and prospects.



Forward-Looking
    Statements

This report, including MD&A, contains certain
    forward-looking statements, including certain plans,
    expectations, goals, projections, and statements, which are
    subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties.
    Statements that do not describe historical or current facts,
    including statements about beliefs and expectations, are
    forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are
    intended to be subject to the safe harbor provided by
    Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
    Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Actual results could differ materially from those contained or
    implied by such statements for a variety of factors including:
    (1) deterioration in the loan portfolio could be worse than
    expected due to a number of factors such as the underlying value
    of the collateral could prove less valuable than otherwise
    assumed and assumed cash flows may be worse than expected;
    (2) changes in economic conditions; (3) movements in
    interest rates; (4) competitive pressures on product
    pricing and services; (5) success and timing of other
    business strategies; (6) extended disruption of vital
    infrastructure; and (7) the nature, extent, and timing of
    governmental actions and reforms, including existing and
    potential future restrictions and limitations imposed in
    connection with the Troubled Asset Relief Program’s
    voluntary Capital Purchase Plan or otherwise under the Emergency
    Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. All forward-looking
    statements included in this release are based on information
    available at the time of the release. Huntington assumes no
    obligation to update any forward-looking statement.

All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they
    are made and are based on information available at that time. We
    assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements to
    reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the
    forward-looking statements were made or to reflect the
    occurrence of unanticipated events except as required by federal
    securities laws. As forward-looking statements involve
    significant risks and uncertainties, caution should be exercised
    against placing undue reliance on such statements.

Risk
    Factors

We, like other financial companies, are subject to a number of
    risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or
    results of operation, many of which are outside of our direct
    control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while
    optimizing returns. Among the risks assumed are: (1)

credit
    risk

, which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease
    customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their
    financial obligations under agreed upon terms, (2)

market
    risk

, which is the risk of loss due to changes in the market
    value of assets and liabilities due to changes in market
    interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and
    credit spreads, (3)

liquidity risk

, which is the risk of
    loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to
    satisfy current or future obligations resulting from external
    macro market issues, investor and customer perception of
    financial strength, and events unrelated to the company such as
    war, terrorism, or financial institution market specific issues,
    and (4)

operational risk

, which is the risk of loss due
    to human error, inadequate or failed internal systems and
    controls, violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules,
    regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards, and
    external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent
    activities, disasters, and security risks.

More information on risk is set forth under the heading
    “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A. Additional
    information regarding risk factors can also be found in the
    “Risk Management and Capital” discussion.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity
    with GAAP requires us to establish critical accounting policies
    and make accounting estimates, assumptions, and judgments that
    affect amounts recorded and reported in our financial
    statements. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements lists significant accounting policies we use in the
    development and presentation of our financial statements. This
    discussion and analysis, the significant accounting policies,
    and other financial statement



disclosures identify and address key variables and other
    qualitative and quantitative factors necessary for an
    understanding and evaluation of our company, financial position,
    results of operations, and cash flows.

An accounting estimate requires assumptions about uncertain
    matters that could have a material effect on the financial
    statements if a different amount within a range of estimates
    were used or if estimates changed from period to period.
    Estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in
    time, and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce
    results that differ from when those estimates were made. The
    most significant accounting estimates and their related
    application are discussed below. This analysis is included to
    emphasize that estimates are used in connection with the
    critical and other accounting policies and to illustrate the
    potential effect on the financial statements if the actual
    amount were different from the estimated amount.

Total
    Allowances for Credit Losses

The ACL is the sum of the ALLL and the allowance for unfunded
    loan commitments and letters of credit (AULC), and represents
    the estimate of the level of reserves appropriate to absorb
    inherent credit losses. The amount of the ACL was determined by
    judgments regarding the quality of each individual loan
    portfolio and loan commitments. All known relevant internal and
    external factors that affected loan collectibility were
    considered, including analysis of historical charge-off
    experience, migration patterns, changes in economic conditions,
    and changes in loan collateral values. Such factors are subject
    to regular review and may change to reflect updated performance
    trends and expectations, particularly in times of severe stress
    such as have been experienced throughout 2009. We believe the
    process for determining the ACL considers all of the potential
    factors that could result in credit losses. However, the process
    includes judgmental and quantitative elements that may be
    subject to significant change. There is no certainty that the
    ACL will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in the
    portfolio because of continued adverse changes in the economy,
    market conditions, or events adversely affecting specific
    customers, industries or markets. To the extent actual outcomes
    differ from our estimates, the credit quality of our customer
    base materially decreases, the risk profile of a market,
    industry, or group of customers changes materially, or if the
    ACL is determined to not be adequate, additional provision for
    credit losses could be required, which could adversely affect
    our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, and
    results of operations in future periods.

At December 31, 2009, the ACL was $1,531.4 million, or
    4.16% of total loans and leases. To illustrate the potential
    effect on the financial statements of our estimates of the ACL,
    a 10 basis point increase would have required
    $36.8 million in additional reserves (funded by additional
    provision for credit losses), which would have negatively
    impacted 2009 net loss by approximately $23.9 million,
    or $0.04 per common share.

Additionally, in 2007, we established a specific reserve of
    $115.3 million associated with our loans to Franklin Credit
    Management Corporation (Franklin). At December 31, 2008,
    our specific ALLL for Franklin loans increased to
    $130.0 million. In 2009, as a result of our restructuring
    of the Franklin relationship, the specific ALLL for Franklin
    loans was eliminated.

Refer to the “Franklin
    relationship” section located within the “Risk
    Management and Capital” section for additional discussion
    regarding the restructuring of the Franklin relationship.

Fair
    Value Measurements

The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the
    amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
    transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or
    liquidation sale. We estimate the fair value of a financial
    instrument using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial
    instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices,
    quoted market prices are used for fair value. We characterize
    active markets as those where transaction volumes are sufficient
    to provide objective pricing information, with reasonably narrow
    bid/ask spreads, and where received quoted prices do not vary
    widely. When the financial instruments are not actively traded,
    other observable market inputs, such as quoted prices of
    securities with similar characteristics, may be used, if
    available, to determine fair value. Inactive markets are
    characterized by low transaction volumes, price quotations that
    vary substantially among market participants, or in which
    minimal information is released publicly. When observable market
    prices do not exist,



we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other
    financial modeling methods. Our valuation methods consider
    factors such as liquidity and concentration concerns and, for
    the derivatives portfolio, counterparty credit risk. Other
    factors such as model assumptions, market dislocations, and
    unexpected correlations can affect estimates of fair value.
    Changes in these underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates
    in any of these areas could materially impact the amount of
    revenue or loss recorded.

Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result
    in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Assets
    measured at fair value include investment securities, loans
    held-for-sale, derivatives, mortgage servicing rights (MSRs),
    and trading account securities. At December 31, 2009,
    approximately $9.2 billion of our assets were recorded at
    fair value. In addition to the above mentioned ongoing fair
    value measurements, fair value is also the unit of measure for
    recording business combinations.

The Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (FASB) Accounting
    Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820, “Fair Value
    Measurements”, establishes a framework for measuring the
    fair value of financial instruments that considers the
    attributes specific to particular assets or liabilities and
    establishes a three-level hierarchy for determining fair value
    based on the transparency of inputs to each valuation as of the
    fair value measurement date. The three levels are defined as
    follows:

•

Level 1 —

quoted prices (unadjusted) for
    identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

•

Level 2

— inputs include quoted prices for
    similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices
    of identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that
    are not active, and inputs that are observable for the asset or
    liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the
    full term of the financial instrument.

•

Level 3 —

inputs that are unobservable and
    significant to the fair value measurement. Financial instruments
    are considered Level 3 when values are determined using
    pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar
    techniques, and at least one significant model assumption or
    input is unoberservable.

At the end of each quarter, we assess the valuation hierarchy
    for each asset or liability measured. From time to time, assets
    or liabilities may be transferred within hierarchy levels due to
    changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure
    fair value at the measurement date.

The table below provides a description and the valuation
    methodologies used for financial instruments measured at fair
    value, as well as the general classification of such instruments
    pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. The fair values measured at
    each level of the fair value hierarchy, as well as additional
    discussion regarding fair value measurements, can be found in
    Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Hierarchy

Valuation methodology

Mortgage loans held-for-sale

Level 2

Mortgage loans held-for-sale are estimated using security prices
    for similar product types.

Investment Securities & Trading Account
    Securities(2)

Level 1

Consist of U.S. Treasury and other federal agency securities,
    and money market mutual funds which generally have quoted prices.

Level 2

Consist of U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed securities
    and municipal securities for which an active market is not
    available. Third-party pricing services provide a fair value
    estimate based upon trades of similar financial instruments.



Financial Instrument(1)

Hierarchy

Valuation methodology

Level 3

Consist of asset-backed securities and certain private label
    CMOs, and residual interest in automobile securitizations, for
    which fair value is estimated. Assumptions used to determine the
    fair value of these securities have greater subjectivity due to
    the lack of observable market transactions. Generally, there are
    only limited trades of similar instruments and a discounted cash
    flow approach is used to determine fair value.

Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)(3)

Level 3

MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily
    observable prices. Although sales of MSRs do occur, the precise
    terms and conditions typically are not readily available.  Fair
    value is based upon the final month-end valuation, which
    utilizes the month-end curve and prepayment assumptions.

Derivatives(4)

Level 1

Consist of exchange traded options and forward commitments to
    deliver mortgage-backed securities which have quoted prices.

Level 2

Consist of basic asset and liability conversion swaps and
    options, and interest rate caps. These derivative positions are
    valued using internally developed models that use readily
    observable market parameters.

Level 3

Consist primarily of interest rate lock agreements related to
    mortgage loan commitments. The determinination of fair value
    includes assumptions related to the likelihood that a commitment
    will ultimately result in a closed loan, which is a significant
    unobservable assumption.

Equity Investments(5)

Level 3

Consist of equity investments via equity funds (holding both
    private and publicly-traded equity securities), directly in
    companies as a minority interest investor, and directly in
    companies in conjunction with our mezzanine lending activities.
    These investments do not have readily observable prices. Fair
    value is based upon a variety of factors, including but not
    limited to, current operating performance and future
    expectations of the particular investment, industry valuations
    of comparable public companies, and changes in market outlook.

    SECURITIES

(This section should be read in conjunction with the
    “Investment Securities Portfolio” discussion and
    Note 1 and Note 6 in the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.)

Level 3
    Analysis on Certain Securities Portfolios

Our Alt-A, CMO, and pooled-trust-preferred securities portfolios
    are classified as Level 3, and as such, the significant
    estimates used to determine the fair value of these securities
    have greater subjectivity. The Alt-A and CMO securities
    portfolios are subjected to a monthly review of the projected
    cash flows, while the cash flows of our pooled-trust-preferred
    securities portfolio are reviewed quarterly. These reviews are
    supported



with analysis from independent third parties, and are used as a
    basis for impairment analysis. These three segments, and the
    results of our impairment analysis for each segment, are
    discussed in further detail below:

Alt-A mortgage-backed / Private-label
    collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO)
    securities

,

represent securities collateralized
    by first-lien residential mortgage loans. As the lowest level
    input that is significant to the fair value measurement of these
    securities in its entirety was a Level 3 input, we
    classified all securities within these portfolios as
    Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The securities were
    priced with the assistance of an outside third-party specialist
    using a discounted cash flow approach and the independent
    third-party’s proprietary pricing model. The model used
    inputs such as estimated prepayment speeds, losses, recoveries,
    default rates that were implied by the underlying performance of
    collateral in the structure or similar structures, discount
    rates that were implied by market prices for similar securities,
    collateral structure types, and house price
    depreciation/appreciation rates that were based upon
    macroeconomic forecasts.

We analyzed both our Alt-A mortgage-backed and private-label CMO
    securities portfolios to determine if the securities in these
    portfolios were other-than-temporarily impaired. We used the
    analysis to determine whether we believed it is probable that
    all contractual cash flows would not be collected. All
    securities in these portfolios remained current with respect to
    interest and principal at December 31, 2009.

Our analysis indicated, as of December 31, 2009, a total of
    5 Alt-A mortgage-backed securities and 8 private-label CMO
    securities could experience a loss of principal in the future.
    The future expected losses of principal on these
    other-than-temporarily impaired securities ranged from 0.44% to
    86.37% of their par value. These losses were projected to occur
    beginning anywhere from 7 months to as many as 8 years
    in the future. We measured the amount of credit impairment on
    these securities using the cash flows discounted at each
    security’s effective rate. As a result, during the 2009
    fourth quarter, we recorded $2.6 million of credit
    other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) in our Alt-A
    mortgage-backed securities portfolio and $3.0 million of
    credit OTTI in our private-label CMO securities portfolio. In
    2009, a total of $12.2 million of credit OTTI was recorded
    in our Alt-A mortgage-backed securities portfolio, and
    $6.0 million of credit OTTI was recorded in our private
    label-CMO securities portfolio. These OTTI adjustments
    negatively impacted our earnings.

Pooled-trust-preferred securities

, represent
    collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) backed by a pool of debt
    securities issued by financial institutions. As the lowest level
    input that is significant to the fair value measurement of these
    securities in its entirety was a Level 3 input, we
    classified all securities within this portfolio as Level 3
    in the fair value hierarchy. The collateral generally consisted
    of trust-preferred securities and subordinated debt securities
    issued by banks, bank holding companies, and insurance
    companies. A full cash flow analysis was used to estimate fair
    values and assess impairment for each security within this
    portfolio. Impairment was calculated as the difference between
    the carrying amount and the amount of cash flows discounted at
    each security’s effective rate. We engaged a third party
    specialist with direct industry experience in
    pooled-trust-preferred securities valuations to provide
    assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows
    for each security in this portfolio. Relying on cash flows was
    necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in
    the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for
    these securities were no longer able to provide a fair value
    that was compliant with ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements
    and Disclosures”.

The analysis was completed by evaluating the relevant credit and
    structural aspects of each pooled-trust-preferred security in
    the portfolio, including collateral performance projections for
    each piece of collateral in each security and terms of each
    security’s structure. The credit review included analysis
    of profitability, credit quality, operating efficiency,
    leverage, and liquidity using the most recently available
    financial and regulatory information for each underlying
    collateral issuer. We also reviewed historical industry default
    data and current/near term operating conditions. Using the
    results of our analysis, we estimated appropriate default and
    recovery probabilities for each piece of collateral and then
    estimated the expected cash flows for each security. No
    recoveries were assumed on issuers who are in default. The
    recovery assumptions on issuers who are deferring interest
    ranged from 10% to 55% with a cure assumed after the maximum
    deferral period. As a result of this testing, we believe we will
    experience a loss of principal or interest on 12 securities; and
    as such, recorded credit OTTI of $11.4 million for one
    newly impaired and 11 previously impaired pooled-trust-



preferred securities in the 2009 fourth quarter. In 2009,
    $40.8 million of total OTTI was recorded for impairment of
    the pooled-trust-preferred securities. These OTTI adjustments
    negatively impacted our earnings.

Please refer to the “Investment Securities Portfolio”
    discussion and Note 1 and Note 6 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
    regarding OTTI.

Certain other assets and liabilities which are not financial
    instruments also involve fair value measurements. A description
    of these assets and liabilities, and the methodologies utilized
    to determine fair value are discussed below:

GOODWILL

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, as of
    October 1, using a two-step process that begins with an
    estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit. Goodwill
    impairment exists when a reporting unit’s carrying value of
    goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Goodwill is also tested
    for impairment on an interim basis, using the same two-step
    process as the annual testing, if an event occurs or
    circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely
    than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its
    carrying amount. For 2009, we performed interim evaluations of
    our goodwill balances at each quarter end, as well as our annual
    goodwill impairment assessment as of October 1.

During the 2009 first quarter, our stock price declined 78%,
    from $7.66 per common share at December 31, 2008, to $1.66
    per common share at March 31, 2009. Many peer banks also
    experienced similar significant declines in market
    capitalization. This decline primarily reflected the continuing
    economic slowdown and increased market concern surrounding
    financial institutions’ credit risks and capital positions,
    as well as uncertainty related to increased regulatory
    supervision and intervention. We determined that these changes
    would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of certain
    reporting units below their carrying amounts. Therefore, we
    performed an interim goodwill impairment test during the 2009
    first quarter. An independent third party was engaged to assist
    with the impairment assessment.

Significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for
    impairment. This judgment includes developing cash flow
    projections, selecting appropriate discount rates, identifying
    relevant market comparables, incorporating general economic and
    market conditions, and selecting an appropriate control premium.
    The selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques
    may result in a higher or lower fair value. Judgment is applied
    in determining the weightings that are most representative of
    fair value. The assumptions used in the goodwill impairment
    assessment and the application of these estimates and
    assumptions are discussed below.

    First Quarter Impairment Testing

The first step (Step 1) of impairment testing requires a
    comparison of each reporting unit’s fair value to carrying
    value to identify potential impairment. For our impairment
    testing conducted during the 2009 first quarter, we identified
    four reporting units: Regional Banking, PFG, Insurance, and Auto
    Finance and Dealer Services (AFDS).

•

Although Insurance is included within PFG for business segment
    reporting, it was evaluated as a separate reporting unit for
    goodwill impairment testing because it has its own separately
    allocated goodwill resulting from prior acquisitions. The fair
    value of PFG (determined using the market approach as described
    below), excluding Insurance, exceeded its carrying value, and
    goodwill was determined to not be impaired for this reporting
    unit.

•

There was no goodwill associated with AFDS and, therefore, it
    was not subject to impairment testing.

For Regional Banking, we utilized both the income and market
    approaches to determine fair value. The income approach was
    based on discounted cash flows derived from assumptions of
    balance sheet and income statement activity. An internal
    forecast was developed by considering several long-term key
    business drivers such as anticipated loan and deposit growth.
    The long-term growth rate used in determining the terminal value
    was estimated at 2.5%. The discount rate of 14% was estimated
    based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model,



which considered the risk-free interest rate

(20-year

Treasury Bonds), market risk premium, equity risk premium, and a
    company-specific risk factor. The company-specific risk factor
    was used to address the uncertainty of growth estimates and
    earnings projections of management. For the market approach,
    revenue, earnings and market capitalization multiples of
    comparable public companies were selected and applied to the
    Regional Banking unit’s applicable metrics such as book and
    tangible book values. A 20% control premium was used in the
    market approach. The results of the income and market approaches
    were weighted 75% and 25%, respectively, to arrive at the final
    calculation of fair value. As market capitalization declined
    across the banking industry, we believed that a heavier
    weighting on the income approach is more representative of a
    market participant’s view. For the Insurance reporting
    unit, management utilized a market approach to determine fair
    value. The aggregate fair market values were compared with
    market capitalization as an assessment of the appropriateness of
    the fair value measurements. As our stock price fluctuated
    greatly, we used our average stock price for the 30 days
    preceding the valuation date to determine market capitalization.
    The aggregate fair market values of the reporting units compared
    with market capitalization indicated an implied premium of 27%.
    A control premium analysis indicated that the implied premium
    was within range of overall premiums observed in the market
    place. Neither the Regional Banking nor Insurance reporting
    units passed Step 1.

The second step (Step 2) of impairment testing is necessary
    only if the reporting unit does not pass Step 1. Step 2 compares
    the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the
    carrying amount of the goodwill for the reporting unit. The
    implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner
    as goodwill that is recognized in a business combination.
    Significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating
    the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting
    unit.

To determine the implied fair value of goodwill, the fair value
    of Regional Banking and Insurance (as determined in Step
    1) was allocated to all assets and liabilities of the
    reporting units including any recognized or unrecognized
    intangible assets. The allocation was done as if the reporting
    unit was acquired in a business combination, and the fair value
    of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the
    reporting unit. This allocation process is only performed for
    purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. The carrying values
    of recognized assets or liabilities (other than goodwill, as
    appropriate) were not adjusted nor were any new intangible
    assets recorded. Key valuations were the assessment of core
    deposit intangibles, the mark-to-fair-value of outstanding debt
    and deposits, and mark-to-fair-value on the loan portfolio. Core
    deposits were valued using a 15% discount rate. The marks on our
    outstanding debt and deposits were based upon observable trades
    or modeled prices using current yield curves and market spreads.
    The valuation of the loan portfolio indicated discounts in the
    ranges of 9%-24%, depending upon the loan type. The estimated
    fair value of these loan portfolios was based on an exit price,
    and the assumptions used were intended to approximate those that
    a market participant would have used in valuing the loans in an
    orderly transaction, including a market liquidity discount. The
    significant market risk premium that is a consequence of the
    current distressed market conditions was a significant
    contributor to the valuation discounts associated with these
    loans. We believed these discounts were consistent with
    transactions currently occurring in the marketplace.

Upon completion of Step 2, we determined that the Regional
    Banking and Insurance reporting units’ goodwill carrying
    values exceeded their implied fair values of goodwill by
    $2,573.8 million and $28.9 million, respectively. As a
    result, we recorded a noncash pretax impairment charge of
    $2,602.7 million in the 2009 first quarter. The impairment
    charge was included in noninterest expense and did not affect
    our regulatory and tangible capital ratios.

Other
    Interim and Annual Impairment Testing

While we recorded an impairment charge of $4.2 million in
    the 2009 second quarter related to the sale of a small
    payments-related business completed in July 2009, we concluded
    that no other goodwill impairment was required during the
    remainder of 2009.

Subsequent to the 2009 first quarter impairment testing, we
    reorganized our Regional Banking segment to reflect how our
    assets and operations are now managed. The Regional Banking
    business segment, which through March 31, 2009, had been
    managed geographically, is now managed by a product segment
    approach.



Essentially, Regional Banking has been divided into the new
    segments of Retail and Business Banking, Commercial Banking, and
    Commercial Real Estate.

Each of these three new segments is considered a separate
    reporting unit. The remaining Regional Banking goodwill amount
    of $314.5 million was reallocated on a relative fair value
    basis at the end of the 2009 first quarter to Retail and
    Business Banking, Commercial Banking, and Commercial Real Estate
    resulting in goodwill balances to those reporting units of
    $309.5 million, $5.0 million and $0 respectively.

The Step 1 results of the annual impairment test indicated that
    the PFG and Insurance units passed by a substantial margin. The
    Retail and Business Banking unit also passed, however, only by a
    minimal amount. Through analysis, we were confident that had the
    Retail and Business Banking unit failed Step 1 at
    October 1, 2009, no additional goodwill impairment would
    have been recorded. The assumptions and methodologies utilized
    in the annual assessment were consistent with those used in the
    first quarter assessment as discussed above. Overall, fair
    values for the reporting units improved significantly due to
    improvements in market comparables compared with the 2009 first
    quarter.

Step 2 was required for only the Commercial Banking reporting
    unit as it was determined in Step 1 that its carrying value
    exceeded its fair value. Upon completion of Step 2, we
    determined that the Commercial Banking goodwill carrying value
    exceeded its implied fair value of goodwill; therefore, no
    goodwill impairment was recorded for this unit as of
    October 1. The most significant Step 2 adjustment was the
    20% mark-to-fair-value discount on the loan portfolio.

Due to the current economic environment and other uncertainties,
    it is possible that our estimates and assumptions may adversely
    change in the future. If our market capitalization decreases or
    the liquidity discount on our loan portfolio improves
    significantly without a concurrent increase in market
    capitalization, we may be required to record additional goodwill
    impairment losses in future periods, whether in connection with
    our next annual impairment testing in the 2010 third quarter or
    prior to that, if any changes constitute a triggering event. It
    is not possible at this time to determine if any such future
    impairment loss would result, however, any such future
    impairment loss would be limited as the remaining goodwill
    balance was only $0.4 billion at December 31, 2009.

FRANKLIN
    LOANS RESTRUCTURING TRANSACTION

(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 5
    of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Franklin is a specialty consumer finance company primarily
    engaged in servicing performing, reperforming, and nonperforming
    residential mortgage loans. Prior to March 31, 2009,
    Franklin owned a portfolio of loans secured by first- and
    second-liens on 1-4 family residential properties. These loans
    generally fell outside the underwriting standards of the Federal
    National Mortgage Association (“FNMA” or “Fannie
    Mae”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
    (“FHLMC” or “Freddie Mac”), and involve
    elevated credit risk as a result of the nature or absence of
    income documentation, limited credit histories, higher levels of
    consumer debt,

and/or

past
    credit difficulties (“nonprime loans”). At
    December 31, 2008, our total loans outstanding to Franklin
    were $650.2 million, all of which were placed on nonaccrual
    status. Additionally, the specific allowance for loan and lease
    losses for the Franklin portfolio was $130.0 million,
    resulting in our net exposure to Franklin at December 31,
    2008, of $520.2 million.

On March 31, 2009, we entered into a transaction with
    Franklin whereby a Huntington wholly-owned REIT subsidiary
    (REIT) indirectly acquired an 83% ownership right in a trust
    which holds all the underlying consumer loans and other real
    estate owned (OREO) properties that were formerly collateral for
    the Franklin commercial loans. The equity interests provided to
    Franklin by the REIT were pledged by Franklin as collateral for
    the Franklin commercial loans.

As a result of the restructuring, on a consolidated basis, the
    $650.2 million nonaccrual commercial loan to Franklin at
    December 31, 2008, is no longer reported. Instead, we now
    report the loans secured by first- and second- mortgages on
    residential properties and OREO properties both of which had
    previously been assets of Franklin or its subsidiaries and were
    pledged to secure our loan to Franklin. At the time of the



restructuring, these loans had a fair value of
    $493.6 million and the OREO properties had a fair value of
    $79.6 million. As a result, NALs declined by a net amount
    of $284.1 million as there were $650.2 million
    commercial NALs outstanding related to Franklin, and
    $366.1 million mortgage-related NALs outstanding,
    representing first- and second- lien mortgages that were
    nonaccruing at March 31, 2009. Also, our specific allowance
    for loan and lease losses for the Franklin portfolio of
    $130.0 million was eliminated; however, no initial increase
    to the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) relating to
    the acquired mortgages was recorded as these assets were
    recorded at fair value.

In accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations”,
    we recorded a net deferred tax asset of $159.9 million
    related to the difference between the tax basis and the book
    basis in the acquired assets. Because the acquisition price,
    represented by the equity interests in our wholly-owned
    subsidiary, was equal to the fair value of the acquired 83%
    ownership right, no goodwill was created from the transaction.
    The recording of the net deferred tax asset was a bargain
    purchase under ASC 805, and was recorded as a tax benefit in the
    2009 first quarter.

PENSION

Pension plan assets consist of mutual funds and Huntington
    common stock. Investments are accounted for at cost on the trade
    date and are reported at fair value. Mutual funds are valued at
    quoted net asset value (NAV). Huntington common stock is traded
    on a national securities exchange and is valued at the last
    reported sales price.

The discount rate and expected return on plan assets used to
    determine the benefit obligation and pension expense for
    December 31, 2009, are both assumptions. Any deviation from
    these assumptions could cause actual results to change.

OTHER
    REAL ESTATE OWNED (OREO)

OREO property obtained in satisfaction of a loan is recorded at
    its estimated fair value less anticipated selling costs based
    upon the property’s appraised value at the date of
    transfer, with any difference between the fair value of the
    property and the carrying value of the loan charged to the ALLL.
    Subsequent declines in value are reported as adjustments to the
    carrying amount, and are charged to noninterest expense. Gains
    or losses not previously recognized resulting from the sale of
    OREO are recognized in noninterest expense on the date of sale.
    At December 31, 2009, OREO totaled $140.1 million,
    representing a 14% increase compared with $122.5 million at
    December 31, 2008.

Income
    Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets

INCOME
    TAXES

The calculation of our provision for federal income taxes is
    complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments. We have
    two accruals for income taxes: Our income tax receivable
    represents the estimated amount currently due from the federal
    government, net of any reserve for potential audit issues, and
    is reported as a component of “accrued income and other
    assets” in our consolidated balance sheet; our deferred
    federal income tax asset or liability represents the estimated
    impact of temporary differences between how we recognize our
    assets and liabilities under GAAP, and how such assets and
    liabilities are recognized under the federal tax code.

In the ordinary course of business, we operate in various taxing
    jurisdictions and are subject to income and nonincome taxes. The
    effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretation of the
    relevant current tax laws. We believe the aggregate liabilities
    related to taxes are appropriately reflected in the consolidated
    financial statements. We review the appropriate tax treatment of
    all transactions taking into consideration statutory, judicial,
    and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax positions. In
    addition, we rely on various tax opinions, recent tax audits,
    and historical experience.

From time to time, we engage in business transactions that may
    have an effect on our tax liabilities. Where appropriate, we
    have obtained opinions of outside experts and have assessed the
    relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of
    business transactions taking into account statutory, judicial,
    and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position.
    However, changes to our estimates of accrued taxes can



occur due to changes in tax rates, implementation of new
    business strategies, resolution of issues with taxing
    authorities regarding previously taken tax positions and newly
    enacted statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance. Such
    changes could affect the amount of our accrued taxes and could
    be material to our financial position

and/or

results of operations.

(See Note 19 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.)

DEFERRED
    TAX ASSETS

At December 31, 2009, we had a net federal deferred tax
    asset of $480.5 million, and a net state deferred tax asset
    of $0.8 million. Based on our ability to offset the net
    deferred tax asset against taxable income in prior carryback
    years and the level of our forecast of future taxable income,
    there was no impairment of the deferred tax asset at
    December 31, 2009. All available evidence, both positive
    and negative, was considered to determine whether, based on the
    weight of that evidence, impairment should be recognized.
    However, our forecast process includes judgmental and
    quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change.
    If our forecast of taxable income within the
    carryback/carryforward periods available under applicable law is
    not sufficient to cover the amount of net deferred tax assets,
    such assets may be impaired.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements and Developments

Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses
    new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2009 and the
    expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but
    not yet required to be adopted. To the extent the adoption of
    new accounting standards materially affect financial condition,
    results of operations, or liquidity, the impacts are discussed
    in the applicable section of this MD&A and the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Acquisitions

Sky
    Financial Group, Inc. (Sky Financial)

The merger with Sky Financial was completed on July 1,
    2007. At the time of acquisition, Sky Financial had assets of
    $16.8 billion, including $13.3 billion of loans, and
    total deposits of $12.9 billion. The impact of this
    acquisition was included in our consolidated results for the
    last six months of 2007. Additionally, in September 2007, Sky
    Bank and Sky Trust, National Association (Sky Trust), merged
    into the Bank and systems integration was completed. As a
    result, performance comparisons between 2008 and 2007 are
    affected.

As a result of this acquisition, we have a significant loan
    relationship with Franklin. This relationship is discussed in
    greater detail in the “Commercial Credit” and
    “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant
    Estimates” sections of this report.

Unizan
    Financial Corp. (Unizan)

The merger with Unizan was completed on March 1, 2006. At
    the time of acquisition, Unizan had assets of $2.5 billion,
    including $1.6 billion of loans and core deposits of
    $1.5 billion. The impact of this acquisition was included
    in our consolidated results for the last ten months of 2006.

Impact
    Methodology

For both the Sky Financial and Unizan acquisitions, comparisons
    of the reported results are impacted as follows:

•

Increased the absolute level of reported average balance sheet,
    revenue, expense, and the absolute level of certain credit
    quality results.

•

Increased the absolute level of reported noninterest expense
    items because of costs incurred as part of merger integration
    activities, most notably employee retention bonuses, outside
    programming services related to systems conversions, occupancy
    expenses, and marketing expenses related to customer retention
    initiatives.



Given the significant impact of the mergers on reported results,
    we believe that an understanding of the impacts of each merger
    is necessary to understand better underlying performance trends.
    When comparing post-merger period results to premerger periods,
    we use the following terms when discussing financial performance:

•

“Merger-related” refers to amounts and percentage
    changes representing the impact attributable to the merger.

•

“Merger costs” represent noninterest expenses
    primarily associated with merger integration activities,
    including severance expense for key executive personnel.

•

“Nonmerger-related” refers to performance not
    attributable to the merger, and includes “merger
    efficiencies”, which represent noninterest expense
    reductions realized as a result of the merger.

After completion of our mergers, we combine the acquired
    companies’ operations with ours, and do not monitor the
    subsequent individual results of the acquired companies. As a
    result, the following methodologies were implemented to estimate
    the approximate effect of the mergers used to determine
    “merger-related” impacts.

BALANCE
    SHEET ITEMS

Sky
    Financial

For average loans and leases, as well as total average deposits,
    Sky Financial’s balances as of June 30, 2007, adjusted
    for purchase accounting adjustments, and transfers of loans to
    loans held-for-sale, were used in the comparison. To estimate
    the impact on 2007 average balances, it was assumed that the
    June 30, 2007, balances, as adjusted, remained constant
    over time.

Unizan

For average loans and leases, as well as core average deposits,
    balances as of the acquisition date were pro-rated to the
    post-merger period being used in the comparison. For example, to
    estimate the impact on 2006 first quarter average balances,
    one-third of the closing date balance was used as those balances
    were in reported results for only one month of the quarter.
    Quarterly estimated impacts for the 2006 second, third, and
    fourth quarter results were developed using this same pro-rata
    methodology. Full-year 2006 estimated results represent the
    annual average of each quarter’s estimate. This methodology
    assumed acquired balances remained constant over time.

INCOME
    STATEMENT ITEMS

Sky
    Financial

Sky Financial’s actual results for the first six months of
    2007, adjusted for the impact of unusual items and purchase
    accounting adjustments, were determined. This six-month adjusted
    amount was multiplied by two to estimate an annual impact. This
    methodology does not adjust for any market-related changes, or
    seasonal factors in Sky Financial’s 2007 six-month results.
    Nor does it consider any revenue or expense synergies realized
    since the merger date. The one exception to this methodology of
    holding the estimated annual impact constant relates to the
    amortization of intangibles expense where the amount is known
    and is therefore used.

Unizan

Unizan’s actual full-year 2005 results were used for
    pro-rating the impact on post-merger periods. For example, to
    estimate the 2006 first quarter impact of the merger on
    personnel costs, one-twelfth of Unizan’s full-year
    2005 personnel costs was used. Full quarter and
    year-to-date estimated impacts for subsequent periods were
    developed using this same pro-rata methodology. This results in
    an approximate impact since the methodology does not adjust for
    any unusual items or seasonal factors in Unizan’s 2005
    reported results, or synergies realized since the merger date.
    The one exception to this methodology relates to the
    amortization of intangibles expense where the amount is known
    and is therefore used.

Certain tables and comments contained within our discussion and
    analysis provide detail of changes to reported results to
    quantify the estimated impact of the Sky Financial merger using
    this methodology.

DISCUSSION
    OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This section provides a review of financial performance from a
    consolidated perspective. It also includes a “Significant
    Items” section that summarizes key issues important for a
    complete understanding of performance trends. Key consolidated
    balance sheet and income statement trends are discussed. All
    earnings per share data are reported on a diluted basis. For
    additional insight on financial performance, please read this
    section in conjunction with the “Business Segment
    Discussion”.

Summary

    versus 2008

We reported a net loss of $3,094.2 million in 2009,
    representing a loss per common share of $6.14. These results
    compared unfavorably with a net loss of $113.8 million, or
    $0.44 per common share in 2008. Comparisons with the prior year
    were significantly impacted by $2,606.9 million of goodwill
    impairment charges in 2009, the issuance of 346.8 million
    new shares of common stock, an increase of $128.4 million
    in dividends on preferred shares, as well as other factors.
    These factors, including the goodwill impairment, are discussed
    later in the “Significant Items” section.

2009 was one of the most challenging years that we, and the
    entire banking industry, have faced, as we continued to be
    negatively impacted by the sustained economic weakness in our
    Midwest markets. The negative impacts were evident in several
    credit quality measures including increased nonaccrual loans
    (NALs), net charge-offs (NCOs), and provision for credit losses.
    Although there have been recent signs that the economic
    environment is stabilizing, it remains uncertain.

NCOs and provision levels increased substantially compared with
    2008. The ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases
    increased to 4.16% at December 31, 2009, compared with
    2.30% at December 31, 2008. At the beginning of 2009, a key
    objective was to better understand the risks in our credit
    portfolio in light of an economic outlook that showed increasing
    weakness. The implementation of enhanced portfolio management
    processes followed by a series of detailed portfolio reviews
    throughout the year as the economic environment continued to
    weaken, permitted us to identify and proactively address the
    risks in our loan portfolio. In late 2009, because we believed
    there would still not be any significant economic recovery in
    2010, we reviewed our loan loss reserve assumptions. As a result
    of that review, we substantially strengthened our loan loss
    reserves during the fourth quarter. Specifically, our fourth
    quarter provision for credit losses was 43% of our total 2009
    provision for credit losses of $2,074.7 million. Our
    provision for credit losses exceeded net charge-offs
    ($1,476.6 million) by $598.1 million. Going forward,
    we expect that the absolute level of the ACL, and the related
    provision expense, will decline as existing reserves address the
    continuing losses inherent in our portfolio.

NALs also significantly increased to $1,917.0 million,
    compared with $1,502.1 million at the prior year-end,
    reflecting increased NALs in our commercial real estate (CRE)
    portfolios, particularly the single family home builder and
    retail properties segments. Commercial and industrial (C&I)
    NALs also increased significantly, particularly the segments
    related to businesses that support residential development. In
    many cases, loans were placed on nonaccrual status even though
    the loan was less than 30 days past due for both principal
    and interest payments, reflecting our proactive approach in
    identifying and classifying emerging problem credits. While
    NALs, as well as NCOs, are expected to remain higher than
    historical levels during 2010, we expect that the absolute
    levels will decline from 2009 levels. There was a 12% decline in



nonperforming assets (NPAs) in the 2009 fourth quarter compared
    with the prior quarter, providing a basis of expectation for
    lower levels of NPAs and NCOs in 2010 compared with 2009.

At the beginning of 2009, we viewed our highest-risk loan
    portfolios to be Franklin, as well as the single family home
    builder and retail properties segments of our CRE portfolio.
    During 2009, we believe that we have substantially addressed the
    credit issues within our Franklin portfolio and our single
    family home builder portfolio segment, and we do not expect any
    additional material credit impact to these portfolios. However,
    the CRE portfolio remains stressed, particularly the retail
    properties segment. We continue to work with the borrowers in
    this segment to resolve the credit issues.

Another key objective for 2009 was to strengthen our capital
    position in order to withstand potential future credit losses
    should the economic environment continue to deteriorate. During
    2009, we raised $1.7 billion of capital, including
    $1.3 billion of common equity. This increase in capital
    substantially strengthened all of our period-end capital ratios
    compared with the year-ago period. Our tangible-to-common equity
    (TCE) ratio increased to 5.92% from 4.04%, and our Tier 1
    common equity ratio increased to 6.69% from 5.05%.

Our period-end liquidity position strengthened compared with the
    end of 2008 as average core deposits grew $2.9 billion, or
    9%, thus reducing our reliance on noncore funding. Additionally,
    we anticipate continued growth in core deposits for 2010. Also,
    period-end total cash and due from banks was $1.5 billion,
    compared with $0.8 billion at the end of 2008, and our
    period-end unpledged investment securities increased
    $4.1 billion compared with the end of last year. We
    redeployed a portion of the cash generated from our capital
    raising actions and our core deposit growth into our investment
    securities portfolio during the current year. Our preference
    would be to use this cash to generate higher-margin loans;
    however, given the continued economic uncertainty, many of our
    customers, especially businesses, are waiting for further signs
    of economic recovery before borrowing funds.

Fully-taxable net interest income in 2009 declined
    $116.2 million, or 7%, compared with 2008. The decline
    primarily reflected a 14 basis point decline in the net
    interest margin, as well as a $1.7 billion, or 4%, decline
    in average earning assets that reflected a $2.3 billion, or
    6%, decline in total average loans. We anticipate that the net
    interest margin will improve during 2010, and we anticipate that
    loan growth will be flat, or increase slightly, in 2010.

Noninterest income in 2009 increased $298.5 million, or
    42%, compared with 2008. This increase consisted of a
    $187.1 million improvement in securities losses and a
    $57.3 million improvement in MSR valuation adjustments net
    of hedging. After adjusting for these items, overall noninterest
    income performance was mixed for the year. Electronic banking
    income increased $9.9 million, or 11%, including additional
    third-party processing fees, however, service charges on deposit
    accounts declined $5.3 million, or 2%, reflecting lower
    consumer nonsufficient funds and overdraft fees. We expect that
    fee income in 2010 will be flat, or decrease slightly, compared
    with 2009. Although we expect growth in trust services income,
    as well as brokerage and insurance revenue and capital market
    fees, that growth could be offset by declines in service charges
    on deposit accounts revenue related to lower nonsufficient funds
    and overdraft fees.

Noninterest expense in 2009 increased $2,556.1 million
    compared with 2008. This increase consisted of 2009 goodwill
    impairment charges totaling $2,606.9 million, partially
    offset by additional gains of $123.9 million related to the
    early extinguishment of debt. After adjusting for these items,
    noninterest expense increased $73.1 million. Primary
    contributors to the increase were a $91.4 million increase
    in deposit and other insurance expense, and a $60.4 million
    increase in OREO and foreclosure expense, representing higher
    levels of problem assets, as well as loss mitigation activities.
    These increases were partially offset by an $83.1 million,
    or 11%, decline in personnel costs, reflecting a decline in
    salaries, and lower benefits and commission expense. Full-time
    equivalent staff declined 6% from the comparable year-ago
    period. For 2010, expenses will remain well-controlled, but are
    expected to increase, reflecting investments in growth, and the
    implementation of key strategic initiatives.



    versus 2007

We reported a net loss of $113.8 million in 2008,
    representing a loss per common share of $0.44. These results
    compared unfavorably with net income of $75.2 million, or
    $0.25 per common share, in 2007. Comparisons with the prior year
    were significantly impacted by a number of factors that are
    discussed later in the “Significant Items” section.

During 2008, the primary focus within our industry continued to
    be credit quality. The economy deteriorated substantially
    throughout the year in our regions, and continued to put stress
    on our borrowers.

The largest setback to 2008 performance was the credit quality
    deterioration of the Franklin relationship that occurred in the
    2008 fourth quarter resulting in a negative impact of
    $454.3 million, or $0.81 per common share. The loan
    restructuring associated with our relationship with Franklin,
    completed during the 2007 fourth quarter, continued to perform
    consistent with the terms of the restructuring agreement through
    the 2008 third quarter. However, cash flows that we received
    deteriorated significantly during the 2008 fourth quarter,
    reflecting a more severe than expected deterioration in the
    overall economy.

Non-Franklin-related NCOs and provision levels in 2008 increased
    substantially compared with 2007. During 2008, the
    non-Franklin-related ACL as a percentage of total loans and
    leases increased to 2.01% compared with 1.36% at the prior
    year-end. Non-Franklin-related NALs also significantly increased
    to $851.9 million, compared with $319.8 million at the
    prior year-end, reflecting increased NALs in our CRE loans,
    particularly the single family home builder and retail
    properties segments, and within our C&I portfolio related
    to businesses that support residential development.

Our year-end regulatory capital levels were strong. Our tangible
    equity ratio improved 264 basis points to 7.72% compared
    with the prior year-end, reflecting the benefits of a
    $0.6 billion preferred stock issuance in the 2008 second
    quarter and a $1.4 billion preferred stock issuance in the
    2008 fourth quarter as a result of our participation in the
    Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) voluntary Capital Purchase
    Plan. However, our tangible common equity ratio declined
    104 basis points compared with the prior year-end, and we
    believed that it was important that we begin rebuilding our
    common equity. To that end, we reduced our quarterly common
    stock dividend to $0.01 per common share, effective with the
    dividend declared on January 22, 2009. Our period-end
    liquidity position was sound, as we have conservatively managed
    our liquidity position at both the parent company and bank
    levels.

Fully-taxable net interest income in 2008 increased
    $231.1 million, or 18%, compared with 2007. The prior year
    reflected only six months of net interest income attributable to
    the acquisition of Sky Financial compared with twelve months for
    2008. The Sky Financial acquisition added $13.3 billion of
    loans and $12.9 billion of deposits at July 1, 2007.
    There was good nonmerger-related growth in total average
    commercial loans, partially offset by a decline in total average
    residential mortgages reflecting the continued slowdown in the
    housing market, as well as loan sales. Fully-taxable net
    interest income in 2008 was negatively impacted by an
    11 basis point decline in the net interest margin compared
    with 2007, primarily due to the interest accrual reversals
    resulting from loans being placed on nonaccrual status, as well
    as deposit pricing.

Noninterest income in 2008 increased $30.5 million, or 5%,
    compared with 2007. Comparisons with the prior year were
    affected by a $137.4 million increase resulting from the
    Sky Financial acquisition, partially offset by the
    $39.2 million net decline in MSR valuation and hedging
    activity. Other factors contributing to the increase included
    the positive impact of loan sales, and the gain resulting from
    the proceeds of the
    Visa

®

initial public offering (IPO) in 2008. Performance of the
    remaining components of noninterest income was generally
    favorable. Automobile operating lease income, brokerage and
    insurance income, and electronic banking income increased,
    however, trust services income declined reflecting the impact of
    lower market values on asset management revenues.

Expenses were well controlled, with our efficiency ratio
    improving to 57.0% in 2008 compared with 62.5% in 2007.
    Noninterest expense in 2008 increased $165.5 million, or
    13%, compared with 2007. Comparisons with the prior year were
    affected by $208.1 million increase resulting from the Sky
    Financial acquisition, including the impact of restructuring and
    merger costs. Other factors contributing to the change in



noninterest expense included positive impacts associated with
    the
    Visa

®

IPO, early extinguishment of debt, and litigation reserves.
    Performance of the remaining components of noninterest expense
    was mixed. OREO and foreclosure expense, as well as professional
    services expense, increased as the economy continued to weaken.
    Automobile operating lease expense and deposit and other
    insurance expense also increased. These increases are partially
    offset by a decline in personnel expense, as well as other
    expense categories, due to merger/restructuring efficiencies.

Significant
    Items

Definition
    of Significant Items

From time to time, revenue, expenses, or taxes, are impacted by
    items judged by us to be outside of ordinary banking activities

and/or

by
    items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking
    activities, are so unusually large that their outsized impact is
    believed by us at that time to be infrequent or short-term in
    nature. We refer to such items as “Significant Items”.
    Most often, these Significant Items result from factors
    originating outside the company; e.g., regulatory
    actions/assessments, windfall gains, changes in accounting
    principles, one-time tax assessments/refunds, etc. In other
    cases they may result from our decisions associated with
    significant corporate actions out of the ordinary course of
    business; e.g., merger/restructuring charges, recapitalization
    actions, goodwill impairment, etc.

Even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally
    subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market
    and economic environment conditions, as a general rule
    volatility alone does not define a Significant Item. For
    example, changes in the provision for credit losses,
    gains/losses from investment activities, asset valuation
    writedowns, etc., reflect ordinary banking activities and are,
    therefore, typically excluded from consideration as a
    Significant Item.

We believe the disclosure of “Significant Items” in
    current and prior period results aids in better understanding
    our performance and trends to ascertain which of such items, if
    any, to include or exclude from an analysis of our performance;
    i.e., within the context of determining how that performance
    differed from expectations, as well as how, if at all, to adjust
    estimates of future performance accordingly. To this end, we
    adopted a practice of listing “Significant Items” in
    our external disclosure documents (e.g., earnings press
    releases, investor presentations,

Forms 10-Q

and

10-K).

“Significant Items” for any particular period are not
    intended to be a complete list of items that may materially
    impact current or future period performance.

Significant
    Items Influencing Financial Performance
    Comparisons

Earnings comparisons among the three years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 were impacted by a number
    of significant items summarized below.

1.

Goodwill Impairment.

The impacts of
    goodwill impairment on our reported results were as follows:

•

During the 2009 first quarter, bank stock prices continued to
    decline significantly. Our stock price declined 78% from $7.66
    per share at December 31, 2008 to $1.66 per share at
    March 31, 2009. Given this significant decline, we
    conducted an interim test for goodwill impairment. As a result,
    we recorded a noncash $2,602.7 million ($4.88 per common
    share) pretax charge.

(See “Goodwill” discussion
    located within the “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of
    Significant Estimates” section for additional
    information).

•

During the 2009 second quarter, a pretax goodwill impairment of
    $4.2 million ($0.01 per common share) was recorded relating
    to the sale of a small payments-related business in July 2009.

2.

Sky Financial Acquisition.

The merger
    with Sky Financial was completed on July 1, 2007. The
    impacts of Sky Financial on the 2008 reported results compared
    with the 2007 reported results are as follows:

•

Increased the absolute level of reported average balance sheet,
    revenue, expense, and credit quality results (e.g., NCOs).



•

Increased reported noninterest expense items as a result of
    costs incurred as part of merger integration and post-merger
    restructuring activities, most notably employee retention
    bonuses, outside programming services related to systems
    conversions, and marketing expenses related to customer
    retention initiatives. These net merger costs were
    $21.8 million ($0.04 per common share) in 2008 and
    $85.1 million ($0.18 per common share) in 2007.

3.

Franklin Relationship.

Our
    relationship with Franklin was acquired in the Sky Financial
    acquisition. On March 31, 2009, we restructured our
    relationship with Franklin

(see “Critical Accounting
    Policies and Use of Significant Estimates” section).

Performance for 2009 included a nonrecurring net tax benefit
    of $159.9 million ($0.30 per common share) related to this
    restructuring. Also as a result of the restructuring, although
    earnings were not significantly impacted, commercial NCOs
    increased $128.3 million as the previously established
    $130.0 million Franklin-specific ALLL was utilized to
    write-down the acquired mortgages and OREO collateral to fair
    value.

4.

Early Extinguishment of Debt.

The
    positive impacts relating to the early extinguishment of debt on
    our reported results were: $147.4 million ($0.18 per common
    share) in 2009, $23.5 million ($0.04 per common share) in
    2008, and $8.1 million ($0.02 per common share) in 2008.
    These amounts were recorded to noninterest expense.

5.

Preferred Stock Conversion.

During the
    2009 first and second quarters, we converted 114,109 and
    92,384 shares, respectively, of Series A 8.50%
    Non-cumulative Perpetual Preferred (Series A Preferred
    Stock) stock into common stock. As part of these transactions,
    there was a deemed dividend that did not impact net income, but
    resulted in a negative impact of $0.11 per common share for
    2009.

See Significant Factors Influencing Financial Performance

Net
    Interest Income / Average Balance Sheet

(This section should be read in conjunction with Significant
    Items 2 and 3.)

Our primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is
    the difference between interest income from earning assets
    (primarily loans, direct financing leases, and securities), and
    interest expense of funding sources (primarily interest-bearing
    deposits and borrowings). Earning asset balances and related
    funding, as well as changes in the levels of interest rates,
    impact net interest income. The difference between the average
    yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for
    interest-bearing liabilities is the net interest spread.
    Noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits
    and shareholders’ equity, also support earning assets. The
    impact of the noninterest-bearing sources of funds, often
    referred to as “free” funds, is captured in the net
    interest margin, which is calculated as net interest income
    divided by average earning assets. Given the



“free” nature of noninterest-bearing sources of funds,
    the net interest margin is generally higher than the net
    interest spread. Both the net interest spread and net interest
    margin are presented on a fully-taxable equivalent basis, which
    means that tax-free interest income has been adjusted to a
    pretax equivalent income, assuming a 35% tax rate.

The following table shows changes in fully-taxable equivalent
    interest income, interest expense, and net interest income due
    to volume and rate variances for major categories of earning
    assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

    versus 2008

Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income for 2009 decreased
    $116.2 million, or 7%, from 2008. This reflected the
    unfavorable impact of a $1.7 billion, or 4%, decrease in
    average earning assets, which included a $2.3 billion
    decrease in average loans and leases. Also contributing to the
    decline in net interest income was a 14 basis point decline
    in the fully-taxable net interest margin to 3.11%, primarily due
    to the unfavorable impact of our stronger liquidity position and
    an increase in NALs.

The $2.3 billion, or 6%, decrease in average total loans
    and leases primarily reflected:

•

$1.0 billion, or 4%, decline in average total commercial
    loans. The decline in average CRE loans reflected our planned
    efforts to shrink this portfolio through payoffs and paydowns,
    as well as the impact of charge-offs and the 2009
    reclassifications of CRE loans to C&I loans

(see
    “Commercial Credit” section)

. The decline in
    average C&I loans reflected paydowns, the Franklin
    restructuring, and a reduction in the line-of-credit utilization
    in our automobile dealer floorplan exposure; partially offset by
    the 2009 reclassifications.

•

$1.0 billion, or 22%, decline in average automobile loans
    and leases due to the 2009 securitization of $1.0 billion
    of automobile loans, as well as the continued runoff of the
    automobile lease portfolio.

•

$0.5 billion, or 9%, decline in residential mortgages
    reflecting the impact of loan sales, as well as the continued
    refinance of portfolio loans. The majority of this refinance
    activity was fixed-rate loans, which we typically sell in the
    secondary market.

Partially offset by:

•

$0.2 billion, or 3%, increase in average home equity loans
    reflecting higher utilization of existing lines resulting from
    higher quality borrowers taking advantage of the current
    relatively lower interest rate environment, as well as a
    slowdown in runoff.

Total average investment securities increased $1.7 billion,
    or 38%, as the cash proceeds from core deposit growth and the
    capital actions initiated during 2009 were deployed. This
    increase was partially offset by a



$0.9 billion, or 87%, decline in trading account securities
    due to the reduction in the use of these securities to hedge
    MSRs.

The $1.6 billion, or 4%, increase in average total deposits
    reflected:

•

$2.9 billion, or 9%, growth in total core deposits,
    primarily reflecting increased sales efforts and initiatives for
    deposit accounts.

Partially offset by:

•

$1.4 billion, or 24%, decline in average noncore deposits,
    reflecting a managed decline in public fund deposits as well as
    planned efforts to reduce our reliance on noncore funding
    sources.

    versus 2007

Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income for 2008 increased
    $231.1 million, or 18%, from 2007. This reflected the
    favorable impact of a $8.4 billion, or 21%, increase in
    average earning assets, of which $7.8 billion represented
    an increase in average loans and leases, partially offset by a
    decrease in the fully-taxable net interest margin of
    11 basis points to 3.25%. The increase to average earning
    assets, and to average loans and leases, was primarily
    merger-related.

    on our reported loans and deposits:

Calculated as nonmerger-related / (prior period +
    merger-related).



The $1.3 billion, or 3%, nonmerger-related increase in
    average total loans and leases primarily reflected:

•

$1.5 billion, or 7%, growth in average total commercial
    loans, with growth reflected in both the C&I and CRE
    portfolios. The growth in CRE loans was primarily to existing
    borrowers with a focus on traditional income producing property
    types and was not related to the single family home builder
    segment. The growth in C&I loans reflected a combination of
    draws associated with existing commitments, new loans to
    existing borrowers, and some originations to new high quality
    borrowers.

Partially offset by:

•

$0.2 billion, or 1%, decline in total average consumer
    loans reflecting a $0.5 billion, or 9%, decline in
    residential mortgages due to loan sales, as well as the
    continued slowdown in the housing markets. This decrease was
    partially offset by a $0.2 billion, or 4%, increase in
    average automobile loans and leases reflecting higher automobile
    loan originations, although automobile loan origination volumes
    have declined throughout 2008 due to the industry wide decline
    in sales. Automobile lease origination volumes have also
    declined throughout 2008. During the 2008 fourth quarter, we
    exited the automobile leasing business.

Average other earning assets increased $0.7 billion,
    primarily reflecting the increase in average trading account
    securities. The increase in these assets reflected a change in
    our strategy to use trading account securities to hedge the
    change in fair value of our MSRs, however, the practice of
    hedging the change in fair value of our MSRs using on-balance
    sheet trading assets ceased at the end of 2008.

The $0.3 billion, or 1%, increase in average total deposits
    reflected growth in other deposits. These deposits were
    primarily other domestic time deposits of $250,000 or more
    reflecting increases in commercial and public fund deposits.
    Changes from the prior year also reflected customers
    transferring funds from lower rate to higher rate accounts such
    as certificates of deposit as short-term rates had fallen.

Provision
    for Credit Losses

(This
    section should be read in conjunction with Significant Items 2
    and 3 and the Credit Risk section.)

The provision for credit losses is the expense necessary to
    maintain the ALLL and the AULC at levels adequate to absorb our
    estimate of probable inherent credit losses in the loan and
    lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded loan commitments
    and letters of credit.

The provision for credit losses in 2009 was
    $2,074.7 million, up $1,017.2 million from 2008, and
    exceeded NCOs by $598.1 million. The increase in 2009 from
    2008 primarily reflected the continued economic weakness across
    all our regions and all our loan portfolios, although our
    commercial loan portfolios were the most affected.

The provision for credit losses in 2008 was
    $1,057.5 million, up from $643.6 million in 2007, and
    reflected $27.2 million of higher provision related to
    Franklin ($438.0 million in 2008 compared with
    $410.8 million in 2007). The remaining increase in 2008
    from 2007 primarily reflected the continued economic weakness
    across all our regions and within the single family home builder
    segment of our CRE portfolio.

The following table details the Franklin-related impact to the
    provision for credit losses for each of the past three years.

    versus 2008

As shown in Table 11, noninterest income increased
    $298.5 million, or 42%, from the year-ago period, primarily
    reflecting:

•

$103.3 million increase in mortgage banking income,
    reflecting a $57.5 million increase in origination and
    secondary marketing income as loans sales and loan originations
    were substantially higher, and a $57.3 million improvement
    in MSR hedging

(see Table 12)

.

•

$187.1 million, or 95%, improvement in securities losses as
    2008 included $197.1 million of OTTI adjustments compared
    with $59.0 million in 2009.

•

$12.0 million, or 30%, increase in automobile operating
    lease income, reflecting a 21% increase in average operating
    lease balances as lease originations since the 2007 fourth
    quarter were recorded as operating leases. However, during the
    2008 fourth quarter, we exited the automobile leasing business.

•

$13.4 million, or 10%, increase in other income, reflecting
    the net impact of a $22.4 million change in the fair value
    of derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting,
    partially offset by a $4.7 million decline in mezzanine
    lending income and a $4.1 million decline in customer
    derivatives income.

•

$9.9 million, or 11%, increase in electronic banking,
    reflecting increased transaction volumes and additional
    third-party processing fees.

Partially offset by:

•

$22.3 million, or 18%, decline in trust services income,
    reflecting the impact of reduced market values on asset
    management revenues, as well as lower yields on proprietary
    money market funds.

    versus 2007

Noninterest income increased $30.5 million, or 5%, from the
    year-ago period.

Calculated as other / (prior period + merger-related)

The $30.5 million, or 5%, increase from 2007 reflected
    $137.4 million of merger-related impacts. Nonmerger-related
    noninterest income declined $106.9 million, reflecting:

•

$168.2 million negative impact relating to securities
    losses, primarily reflecting OTTI adjustments in 2008 of
    $197.1 million, compared with $43.1 million of OTTI
    adjustments in 2007.

•

$33.3 million, or 79%, decline in mortgage banking income
    primarily reflecting the negative impact in MSR valuation, net
    of hedging.

•

$9.5 million, or 7%, decline in trust services income
    reflecting the impact of lower market values on asset management
    revenues.

Partially offset by:

•

$46.2 million, or 50%, increase in other noninterest
    income, primarily reflecting: (a) $26.8 million
    positive impact on losses on loan sales,
    (b) $25.1 million gain in 2008 resulting from the
    proceeds of the
    Visa

®

IPO, and (c) $14.1 million improvement in equity
    investment losses. These positive impacts were partially offset
    by: (a) $7.3 million of interest rate swap losses in
    2008, (b) $7.1 million decline in customer derivatives
    revenue, and (c) $5.9 million venture capital loss in
    2008.

•

$32.0 million increase in automobile operating lease income
    as all leases originated since the 2007 fourth quarter were
    recorded as operating leases. During the 2008 fourth quarter, we
    exited the automobile leasing business.

•

$11.3 million, or 9%, increase in brokerage and insurance
    income reflecting growth in annuity sales and the 2007 fourth
    quarter acquisition of an insurance company.

•

$7.6 million, or 9%, increase in electronic banking income
    reflecting increased debit card transaction volumes.

    versus 2008

As shown in the above table, noninterest expense increased
    $2,556.1 million from the year-ago period, and primarily
    reflected:

•

$2,606.9 million of goodwill impairment recorded in 2009.
    The majority of the goodwill impairment, $2,602.7 million,
    was recorded during the 2009 first quarter. The remaining
    $4.2 million of goodwill impairment was recorded in the
    2009 second quarter, and was related to the sale of a small
    payments-related business in July 2009.

(See
    “Goodwill” discussion located within the Critical
    Account Policies and Use of Significant Estimates” for
    additional information).

•

$91.4 million increase in deposit and other insurance
    expense. This increase was comprised of two components:
    (a) $23.6 million FDIC special assessment during the
    2009 second quarter, and (b) $67.8 million increase
    related to our 2008 FDIC assessments being significantly reduced
    by a nonrecurring deposit assessment credit provided by the FDIC
    that was depleted during the 2008 fourth



quarter. This deposit insurance credit offset substantially all
    of our assessment in 2008. Higher levels of deposits also
    contributed to the increase.

•

$60.4 million increase in OREO and foreclosure expense,
    reflecting higher levels of problem assets, as well as loss
    mitigation activities.

•

$26.8 million, or 54%, increase in professional services,
    reflecting higher consulting and collection-related expenses.

•

$17.9 million, or 14%, increase in outside data processing
    and other services, primarily reflecting portfolio servicing
    fees paid to Franklin resulting from the 2009 first quarter
    restructuring of this relationship.

•

$12.1 million, or 39%, increase in automobile operating
    lease expense, primarily reflecting a 21% increase in average
    operating leases. However, as previously discussed, we exited
    the automobile leasing business during the 2008 fourth quarter.

Partially offset by:

•

$123.9 million positive impact related to gains on early
    extinguishment of debt.

•

$83.1 million, or 11%, decline in personnel expense,
    reflecting a decline in salaries, and lower benefits and
    commission expense. Full-time equivalent staff declined 6% from
    the comparable year-ago period.

•

$25.8 million, or 27%, decline in other noninterest expense
    primarily reflecting lower automobile lease residual value
    expense as used vehicle prices improved.

•

$10.8 million, or 12%, decline in equipment costs,
    reflecting lower depreciation costs, as well as lower repair and
    maintenance costs.

    versus 2007

Noninterest expense increased $165.5 million, or 13%, from
    2007.

Calculated as other / (prior period + merger-related)



As shown in the table above, $271.4 million of the
    $165.5 million increase in noninterest expense pertained to
    merger-related expenses, partially offset by $63.3 million
    of lower merger/restructuring costs. After adjusting for these
    merger-related impacts, noninterest expense declined
    $42.6 million, reflecting:

•

$43.4 million decline in other noninterest expense,
    primarily reflecting: (a) $41.9 million positive
    impact related to the recording of an indemnification liability
    in 2007, and partial reversal in 2008, regarding various
    litigations filed against
    Visa

®

,

    (b) the positive impact of no material increases to
    litigation reserves in 2008, compared with $10.8 million of
    such increases in 2007. These positive impacts were partially
    offset by a $4.0 million charge-off of a receivable in 2008.

•

$22.1 million, or 3%, decline in personnel expense
    reflecting the benefit of merger and restructuring efficiencies.

•

$15.5 million positive impact relating to gains on early
    extinguishment of debt.

•

$8.7 million, or 21%, decline in marketing expense.

•

$7.6 million, or 6%, decline in outside data processing and
    other services reflecting merger efficiencies.

Partially offset by:

•

$26.1 million increase in automobile operating lease
    expense as all leases originated since the 2007 fourth quarter
    were recorded as operating leases. During the 2008 fourth
    quarter, we exited the automobile leasing business.

•

$15.7 million increase in OREO and foreclosure expense,
    reflecting higher levels of problem assets.

•

$13.2 million, or 36%, increase in professional services,
    reflecting increased legal and collection costs.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

(This
    section should be read in conjunction with Significant
    Items 1, 2, 3 and 7.)

The provision for income taxes was a benefit of
    $584.0 million for 2009 compared with a benefit of
    $182.2 million in 2008 and a benefit of $52.5 million
    in 2007. The tax benefit in all years includes the benefits from
    tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments and general
    business credits. The tax benefit in 2009 was impacted by the
    pretax loss combined with the favorable impacts of the Franklin
    restructuring

(see “Franklin Loans Restructuring
    Transaction” discussion located within the “Critical
    Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates” for
    additional information)

and the reduction of the capital
    loss valuation reserve, offset by the nondeductible portion of
    the goodwill impairment

(see “Goodwill” discussion
    located within the “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of
    Significant Estimates” for additional information and
    Note 19 to the Notes to the Financial Statements).

During 2008, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed the
    audit of our consolidated federal income tax returns for tax
    years 2004 and 2005. In 2009, the IRS began the audit of our
    consolidated federal income tax returns for tax years 2006 and
    2007. In addition, we are subject to ongoing tax examinations in
    various state and local jurisdictions. Both the IRS and state
    tax officials have proposed adjustments to our previously filed
    tax returns. We believe that our tax positions related to such
    proposed adjustments are correct and supported by applicable
    statutes, regulations, and judicial authority, and intend to
    vigorously defend them. It is possible that the ultimate
    resolution of the proposed adjustments, if unfavorable, may be
    material to the results of operations in the period it occurs.
    However, although no assurance can be given, we believe that the
    resolution of these examinations will not, individually or in
    the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position.



RISK
    MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL

Risk identification and monitoring are key elements in overall
    risk management. We believe our primary risk exposures are
    credit, market, liquidity, and operational risk.

Credit
    risk

is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in the
    borrower’s ability to meet its financial obligations under
    agreed upon terms.

Market risk

represents the risk of
    loss due to changes in the market value of assets and
    liabilities due to changes in interest rates, exchange rates,
    and equity prices.

Liquidity risk

arises from the
    possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current
    or future obligations resulting from external macro market
    issues, investor perception of financial strength, and events
    unrelated to the company such as war, terrorism, or financial
    institution market specific issues.

Operational risk

arises from the inherent

day-to-day

operations of the company that could result in losses due to
    human error, inadequate or failed internal systems and controls,
    and external events.

We follow a formal policy to identify, measure, and document the
    key risks facing the company. The policy outlines how those
    identified risks can be controlled or mitigated and how we
    monitor the controls to ensure that they are effective. Our
    chief risk officer is responsible for ensuring that appropriate
    systems of controls are in place for managing and monitoring
    risk across the company. Potential risk concerns are shared with
    the board of directors, as appropriate. Our internal audit
    department performs ongoing independent reviews of the risk
    management process and ensures the adequacy of documentation.
    The results of these reviews are reported regularly to the audit
    committee of the board of directors.

Some of the more significant processes used to manage and
    control credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks are
    described in the following paragraphs.

Credit
    Risk

Credit risk is the risk of loss due to our counterparties not
    being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon
    terms. We are subject to credit risk in our lending, trading,
    and investment activities. The nature and degree of credit risk
    is a function of the types of transactions, the structure of
    those transactions, and the parties involved. The majority of
    our credit risk is associated with lending activities, as the
    acceptance and management of credit risk is central to
    profitable lending. We also have credit risk associated with our
    investment and derivatives activities. Credit risk is incidental
    to trading activities and represents a significant risk that is
    associated with our investment securities portfolio

(see
    “Investment Securities Portfolio” discussion)

.
    Credit risk is mitigated through a combination of credit
    policies and processes, market risk management activities, and
    portfolio diversification.

The maximum level of credit exposure to individual commercial
    borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on each borrower
    or related group of borrowers. All authority to grant
    commitments is delegated through the independent credit
    administration function and is monitored and regularly updated.
    Concentration risk is managed via limits on loan type,
    geography, industry, and loan quality factors. We continue to
    focus predominantly on extending credit to retail and commercial
    customers with existing or expandable relationships within our
    primary banking markets. We continue to add new borrowers that
    meet our targeted risk and profitability profile.

The checks and balances in the credit process and the
    independence of the credit administration and risk management
    functions are designed to appropriately assess the level of
    credit risk being accepted, facilitate the early recognition of
    credit problems when they do occur, and to provide for effective
    problem asset management and resolution.

Credit
    Exposure Mix

As shown in the following table, at December 31, 2009,
    commercial loans totaled $20.6 billion, and represented 56%
    of our total credit exposure. Our commercial loan portfolio is
    diversified along product type,



size, and geography within our footprint, and is comprised of
    the following

(see “Commercial Credit”
    discussion)

:

Commercial and Industrial (C&I) loans

—
    C&I loans represent loans to commercial customers for use
    in normal business operations to finance working capital needs,
    equipment purchases, or other projects. The vast majority of
    these borrowers are commercial customers doing business within
    our geographic regions. C&I loans are generally
    underwritten individually and usually secured with the assets of
    the company

and/or

the
    personal guarantee of the business owners. The financing of
    owner-occupied facilities is considered a C&I loan even
    though there is improved real estate as collateral. This
    treatment is a function of the underwriting process, which
    focuses on cash flow from operations to repay the debt. The sale
    of the real estate is not considered either a primary or
    secondary repayment source for the loan.

Commercial real estate (CRE) loans

— CRE loans
    consist of loans for income producing real estate properties and
    real estate developers. We mitigate our risk on these loans by
    requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and
    underwriting the loan with cash flow substantially in excess of
    the debt service requirement. These loans are made to finance
    properties such as apartment buildings, office and industrial
    buildings, and retail shopping centers; and are repaid through
    cash flows related to the operation, sale, or refinance of the
    property.

Construction CRE loans

— Construction CRE loans
    are loans to individuals, companies, or developers used for the
    construction of a commercial or residential property for which
    repayment will be generated by the sale or permanent financing
    of the property. Our construction CRE portfolio primarily
    consists of retail, residential (land, single family,
    condominiums), office, and warehouse product types. Generally,
    these loans are for construction projects that have been
    presold, preleased, or otherwise have secured permanent
    financing, as well as loans to real estate companies that have
    significant equity invested in each project. These loans are
    generally underwritten and managed by a specialized real estate
    group that actively monitors the construction phase and manages
    the loan disbursements according to the predetermined
    construction schedule.

Total consumer loans were $16.2 billion at
    December 31, 2009, and represented 44% of our total credit
    exposure. The consumer portfolio was diversified among home
    equity loans, residential mortgages, and automobile loans and
    leases

(see “Consumer Credit” discussion)

.

Home equity

— Home equity lending includes both
    home equity loans and

lines-of-credit.

This type of lending, which is secured by a first- or second-
    mortgage on the borrower’s residence, allows customers to
    borrow against the equity in their home. Real estate market
    values as of the time the loan or line is granted directly
    affect the amount of credit extended and, in addition, changes
    in these values impact the severity of losses.

Residential mortgages

— Residential mortgage
    loans represent loans to consumers for the purchase or refinance
    of a residence. These loans are generally financed over a 15- to
    30- year term, and in most cases, are extended to borrowers to
    finance their primary residence. In some cases, government
    agencies or private mortgage insurers guarantee the loan.
    Generally speaking, our practice is to sell a significant
    majority of our fixed-rate originations in the secondary market.

Automobile loans/leases

— Automobile
    loans/leases is primarily comprised of loans made through
    automotive dealerships, and includes exposure in several

out-of-market

states. However, no

out-of-market

state represented more than 10% of our total automobile loan and
    lease portfolio, and we expect to see relatively rapid
    reductions in these exposures as we ceased automobile loan
    originations in

out-of-market

states during the 2009 first quarter. Our automobile lease
    portfolio will continue to decline as we exited the automobile
    leasing business during the 2008 fourth quarter.

    COMMERCIAL LOAN PORTFOLIO REVIEWS AND ACTIONS

In the 2009 first quarter, we restructured our commercial loan
    relationship with Franklin by taking control of the underlying
    mortgage loan collateral, and transferring the exposure to the
    consumer loan portfolio as first- and second- lien loans to
    individuals secured by residential real estate properties.

(See “Franklin Loans Restructuring Transaction”
    located within the “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of
    Significant Estimates” section).

We also proactively
    completed a concentrated review of our single family home
    builder and retail CRE loan portfolio segments, our CRE
    portfolio’s two highest risk segments. We initiated a
    review of the “criticized” portion of these portfolios
    on a monthly basis. The increased review activity resulted in
    more pro-active decisions on nonaccrual status, reserve levels,
    and charge-offs throughout the remainder of 2009. This
    heightened level of portfolio monitoring is ongoing.

During the 2009 second quarter, we updated our evaluation of
    every “noncriticized” commercial relationship with an
    aggregate exposure of over $500,000. This review included
    C&I, CRE, and business banking loans and encompassed
    $13.2 billion of total commercial loans, and
    $18.8 billion in related



commitments. This was a detailed, labor-intensive process
    designed to enhance our understanding of each borrower’s
    financial position, and to ensure that this understanding was
    accurately reflected in our internal risk rating system. Our
    objective was to identify current and potential credit risks
    across the portfolio consistent with our expectation that the
    economy in our markets will not improve for the foreseeable
    future.

Our activity in the 2009 third quarter represented a
    continuation of the portfolio management processes established
    in the first two quarters of 2009. We continue to fully assess
    our criticized loans over $500,000 on a monthly basis, and have
    maintained the discipline associated with the ongoing
    “noncriticized” review process established in the 2009
    second quarter. In many cases, we directly contacted the
    borrower and obtained the most recent financial information
    available, including interim financial results. In addition, we
    discussed the impact of the economic environment on the future
    direction of their company, industry prospects, collateral
    values, and other borrower-specific information.

In the 2009 fourth quarter, we finalized an initiative to
    segregate our CRE portfolio into core and noncore components.
    This distinction is based on borrower characteristics,
    relationship profitability, and location of the projects. Those
    designated as core relationships will be supported and grown in
    the coming years. Those borrowers designated as noncore will be
    managed effectively, with a goal of significantly reducing the
    exposure. Opportunities to expand some of these noncore
    relationships to a level of profitability may arise, resulting
    in a reclassification to a core designation. Additional
    information regarding the designation can be found in the
    “Core and Noncore Portfolios” section located within
    the “Commercial Real Estate” section.

Also, during the 2009 fourth quarter, we conducted a review of
    our ACL practices and methodologies. We experienced increasing
    charge-offs throughout 2009, and continued to see increases in
    criticized and classified loans, although increases in the
    second half of 2009 were at a slower rate compared with the
    first half of 2009. The level of criticized loans, one indicator
    of possible future losses, reached its highest point in the 2009
    fourth quarter. Even though there were declines in both the
    inflow and absolute level of NALs, the inflow of
    $495 million remained significant. Based on these asset
    quality trends, along with the unstable and fragile economy
    particularly in our Midwest markets, as well as continued
    elevated quarterly charge-offs, the ACL was substantially
    increased. Much of our concern relates to our CRE portfolio and,
    to a lesser degree, our C&I portfolio. Regarding our CRE
    portfolio, higher vacancy rates, lower rents, and falling
    property values are of significant concern. Loss in the event of
    default on many classes of CRE properties has increased
    substantially throughout 2009 and is expected to continue into
    2010. C&I borrowers have been suffering from the weak
    economy for several consecutive years, and many borrowers no
    longer have sufficient capital to withstand protracted stress
    and, as a result, may not be able to comply with the original
    terms of their credit agreements.

Lastly, with respect to our commercial loan exposure to
    automobile dealers, we have had an ongoing review process in
    place for some time now. Our automobile dealer commercial loan
    portfolio is predominantly comprised of larger,
    “well-capitalized”, multi-franchised dealer groups
    underwritten to conservative credit standards. These dealer
    groups have largely remained profitable on a consolidated basis
    due to franchise diversity and a shift of sales emphasis to
    higher-margin, used vehicles, as well as a focus on the service
    department. Additionally, our portfolio is closely monitored
    through receipt and review of monthly dealer financial
    statements and ongoing floor plan inventory audits, which allow
    for rapid response to weakening trends. As a result, we have not
    experienced any significant deterioration in the credit quality
    of our automobile dealer commercial loan portfolio and remain
    comfortable with our expectation of no material losses, even
    given the substantial stress associated with our dealership
    closings announced by Chrysler and General Motors. The more
    recent announcement regarding the Saturn dealerships also has
    had no impact on our view of the portfolio.

(See
    “Automobile Industry” section located within the
    “Commercial and Industrial Portfolio” section for
    additional information.)

In summary, we have established an ongoing portfolio management
    process involving each business segment, providing an improved
    view of emerging risk issues at a borrower level, enhanced
    ongoing monitoring capabilities, and strengthened actions and
    timeliness to mitigate emerging loan risks. Given our stated
    view of continued economic weakness for the foreseeable future,
    we anticipate some level of additional negative credit
    migration. While we can give no assurances given market
    uncertainties, we believe that as a



result of our increased portfolio management actions, a
    portfolio management process involving each business segment, an
    improved view of emerging risk issues at the borrower level,
    enhanced ongoing monitoring capabilities, and strengthened
    borrower-level loan structures, any future migration will be
    manageable.

Our commercial loan portfolio is diversified by C&I and CRE
    loans as shown in the following table:

The primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals
    are the financial strength of the borrower, assessment of the
    borrower’s management capabilities, industry sector trends,
    type of exposure, transaction structure, and the general
    economic outlook. While these are the primary factors
    considered, there are a number of other factors that may be
    considered in the decision process. There are two processes for
    approving credit risk exposures. The first, and more prevalent
    approach, involves individual approval of exposures. Credit
    officers that understand each local region and are experienced
    in the industries and loan structures of the requested credit
    exposure, make credit extension decisions. All credit exposures
    greater than $5 million are approved by a senior loan
    committee, led by our chief credit officer. The second involves
    a centralized loan approval process for the standard products
    and structures utilized in small business banking. In this
    centralized decision environment, where the above primary
    factors are the basis for approval, certain individuals who
    understand each local region make credit-extension decisions to
    preserve our local decision-making focus. In addition to
    disciplined, consistent, and judgmental factors, a sophisticated
    credit scoring process is used as a primary evaluation tool in
    the determination of approving an exposure.

In commercial lending, ongoing credit management is dependent on
    the type and nature of the loan. We monitor all significant
    exposures on a periodic basis. All commercial credit extensions
    are assigned internal risk ratings reflecting the
    borrower’s

probability-of-default

and loss-given-default. This two-dimensional rating methodology,
    which results in 192 individual loan grades, provides
    granularity in the portfolio management process. The

probability-of-default

is rated on a scale of 1-12 and is applied at the borrower
    level. The loss-given-default is rated on a 1-16 scale and is
    applied based on the type of credit extension and the underlying
    collateral. The internal risk ratings are assessed and updated
    with each periodic monitoring event. There is also extensive
    macro portfolio management analysis on an ongoing basis. The
    single family home builder portfolio and retail projects are
    examples of segments of the portfolio that have received more
    frequent evaluation at the loan level as a result of the
    economic environment and performance trends (see “Single
    Family Home Builder” and “Retail Properties”
    discussions). We continually review and adjust our risk rating
    criteria based on actual experience. The continuous analysis and
    review process results in a determination of an appropriate ALLL
    amount for our commercial loan portfolio.

In addition to the initial credit analysis initiated during the
    approval process, the credit review group performs analyses to
    provide an independent review and assessment of the quality

and/or

exposure of the loan. This group is part of our Risk Management
    area, and reviews individual loans and credit processes and
    conducts a portfolio review for each of the regions on a

15-month

cycle. The loan review group validates the internal risk ratings
    on approximately 60% of the portfolio exposure each calendar
    year. Similarly, to provide consistent oversight, a centralized
    portfolio management team monitors and reports on the
    performance of the small business banking loans.



Credit exposures may be designated as monitored credits when
    warranted by individual borrower performance, or by industry and
    environmental factors. Monitored credits are subjected to
    additional monthly reviews in order to adequately assess the
    borrower’s credit status and to take appropriate action.

The Special Assets Division (SAD) is a specialized credit group
    that handles workouts, commercial recoveries, and problem loan
    sales. This group is involved in the day-to- day management of
    relationships rated substandard or lower. Its responsibilities
    include developing an action plan, assessing the risk rating,
    and determining the adequacy of the reserve, the accrual status,
    and the ultimate collectibility of the managed monitored credits.

Our commercial loan portfolio, including CRE loans, is
    diversified by customer size, as well as throughout our
    geographic footprint. Certain segments of our commercial loan
    portfolio are discussed in further detail below:

We manage the risks inherent in this portfolio through
    origination policies, concentration limits, ongoing loan level
    reviews, recourse requirements, and continuous portfolio risk
    management activities. Our origination policies for this
    portfolio include loan product-type specific policies such as
    LTV, debt service coverage ratios, and pre-leasing requirements,
    as applicable. Generally, we: (a) limit our loans to 80% of
    the appraised value of the commercial real estate,
    (b) require net operating cash flows to be 125% of required
    interest and principal payments, and (c) if the commercial
    real estate is non-owner occupied, require that at least 50% of
    the space of the project be pre-leased. We may require more
    conservative loan terms, depending on the project.

Dedicated real estate professionals within our Commercial Real
    Estate segment team originated the majority of the portfolio,
    with the remainder obtained from prior acquisitions. Appraisals
    from approved vendors are reviewed by an internal appraisal
    review group to ensure the quality of the valuation used in the
    underwriting process. The portfolio is diversified by project
    type and loan size, and represents a significant piece of the
    credit risk management strategies employed for this portfolio.
    Our loan review staff provides an assessment of the quality of
    the underwriting and structure and validates the risk rating
    assigned to the loan.

Appraisal values are obtained in conjunction with all
    originations and renewals, and on an as needed basis, in
    compliance with regulatory requirements. Given the stressed
    environment for some loan types, we have initiated ongoing
    portfolio level reviews of segments such as single family home
    builders and retail properties

(see “Single Family Home
    Builders” and “Retail Properties”
    discussions)

. These reviews generate action plans based on
    occupancy levels or sales volume associated with the projects
    being reviewed. The results of these actions indicated that
    additional stress is likely due to the current economic
    conditions. Property values are updated using appraisals on a
    regular basis to ensure that appropriate decisions regarding the
    ongoing management of the portfolio reflect the changing market
    conditions. This highly individualized process requires working
    closely with all of our borrowers as well as an in-depth
    knowledge of CRE project lending and the market environment.

At the portfolio level, we actively monitor the concentrations
    and performance metrics of all loan types, with a focus on
    higher risk segments. Macro-level stress-test scenarios based on
    retail sales and home-price depreciation trends for the segments
    are embedded in our performance expectations, and

lease-up

and
    absorption scenarios are assessed. We anticipate the current
    stress within this portfolio will continue for the foreseeable
    future, resulting in elevated charge-offs, NALs, and ALLL levels.



During 2009, portfolio reviews resulted in reclassifications of
    certain CRE loans to C&I loans. These net reclassifications
    totaled $1.4 billion, and were primarily associated with:
    (a) loans to businesses secured by the real estate and
    buildings that house their operations as these owner-occupied
    loans secured by real estate were underwritten based on the cash
    flow of the business, and (b) healthcare entities and
    colleges and universities. We believe that loans underwritten
    based on cash flow from operations should be considered as
    commercial loans secured by real estate, rather than the CRE
    portfolio which is real estate project oriented.

Within the CRE portfolio, the single family home builder and
    retail properties segments continued to be stressed throughout
    2009 as a result of the continued decline in the housing markets
    and general economic conditions. As previously mentioned above,
    these segments were considered to be the highest risk segments
    in 2009 within our CRE portfolio, and are discussed further
    below.

Single
    Family Home Builders

At December 31, 2009 we had $857 million of CRE loans
    to single family home builders. Such loans represented 2% of
    total loans and leases. Of this portfolio segment, 67% were to
    finance projects currently under construction, 15% to finance
    land under development, and 18% to finance land held for
    development. The $857 million represented a
    $732 million, or 46%, decrease compared with
    $1,589 million at December 31, 2008. The decrease
    primarily reflected the reclassification of loans secured by 1-4
    family residential real estate rental properties to C&I
    loans, consistent with industry practices in the definition of
    this segment. Other factors contributing to the decrease in
    exposure include no new originations in this portfolio segment
    in 2009, increased property sale activity, and substantial
    charge-offs. The increased sale activity was evident throughout
    2009. Based on the portfolio management processes, including
    charge-off activity, over the past 30 months, we believe
    that we have substantially addressed the credit issues in this
    portfolio. We do not expect any future significant credit impact
    from this portfolio segment.

Retail
    Properties

Our portfolio of CRE loans secured by retail properties totaled
    $2,115 million, or approximately 6% of total loans and
    leases, at December 31, 2009. Loans within this portfolio
    segment declined $150 million, or 7%, from
    December 31, 2008. Credit approval in this portfolio
    segment is generally dependent on pre-leasing requirements, and
    net operating income from the project must cover debt service by
    specified percentages when the loan is fully funded.

The weakness of the economic environment in our geographic
    regions significantly impacted the projects that secure the
    loans in this portfolio segment. Lower occupancy rates, reduced
    rental rates, increased unemployment levels compared with recent
    years, and the expectation that these levels will continue to
    increase for the foreseeable future are expected to adversely
    affect our borrowers’ ability to repay these loans. We have
    increased the level of credit risk management activity to this
    portfolio segment, and we analyze our retail property loans in
    detail by combining property type, geographic location, tenants,
    and other data, to assess and manage our credit concentration
    risks.

Core
    and Noncore portfolios

Each CRE loan is classified as either core or noncore. We
    segmented the CRE portfolio into these designations in order to
    provide more clarity around our portfolio management strategies
    and to provide additional clarity for our investors. A CRE loan
    is generally considered core when the borrower is an
    experienced, well-capitalized developer in our Midwest
    footprint, and has either an established meaningful relationship
    or the prospective of establishing one, that generates an
    acceptable return on capital. The core CRE portfolio was
    $4.0 billion at December 31, 2009, representing 52% of
    total CRE loans. Personal guarantees support approximately 95%
    of this portfolio. Based on the extensive project level
    assessment process, including forward-looking collateral
    valuations, we are comfortable with the credit quality of the
    core portfolio at this time.

A CRE loan is generally considered noncore based on a lack of a
    substantive relationship outside of the credit product, with no
    immediate prospects for improvement. The noncore CRE portfolio
    totaled $3.7 billion



at December 31, 2009, representing 48% of total CRE loans.
    Personal guarantees support approximately 96% of this portfolio,
    with over 99% representing secured debt. This segment has only
    approximately $155 million of future funding requirements.
    Nevertheless, it is within the noncore segment where most of the
    credit quality challenges exist. For example,
    $932.0 million, or 26%, of related outstandings, are
    classified as NALs. The Special Assets Division (SAD)
    administers $1.8 billion, or 50%, of total noncore CRE
    loans. It is expected that we will exit the majority of noncore
    CRE relationships over time. This would reflect normal
    repayments, possible sales should economically attractive
    opportunities arise, or the reclassification as a core CRE
    relationship if it expands to meet the core requirements.

The table below provides the segregation of the CRE portfolio
    into core and noncore segments as of December 31, 2009.

As shown in the above table, substantial reserves for the
    noncore portfolio have been established. At December 31,
    2009, the ACL of related total loans and leases for the noncore
    portfolio was 16.32%. We believe segregating the noncore CRE
    from core CRE improves our ability to understanding the nature,
    performance prospects, and problem resolution opportunities of
    this segment, thus allowing us to continue to deal proactively
    with future credit issues.

The combination of prior NCOs and the existing ACL represents
    the total credit actions taken on each segment of the portfolio.
    From this data, we calculate a measurement, called a
    “Credit Mark”, that provides a consistent measurement
    of the cumulative credit actions taken against a specific
    portfolio segment. We believe that the combined credit activity
    is appropriate for each of the CRE segments.

COMMERCIAL
    AND INDUSTRIAL (C&I) PORTFOLIO

The C&I portfolio is comprised of loans to businesses where
    the source of repayment is associated with the ongoing
    operations of the business. Generally, the loans are secured
    with the financing of the borrower’s assets, such as
    equipment, accounts receivable, or inventory. In many cases, the
    loans are secured by real estate, although the sale of the real
    estate is not a primary source of repayment for the loan. For
    loans secured by real estate, appropriate appraisals are
    obtained at origination, and updated on an as needed basis, in
    compliance with regulatory requirements.

There were no outstanding commercial loans that would be
    considered a concentration of lending to a particular industry
    or within a geographic standpoint. Currently, higher-risk
    segments of the C&I portfolio include loans to borrowers
    supporting the home building industry, contractors, and
    automotive suppliers. However, the combined total of these
    segments represent less than 10% of the total C&I
    portfolio. We manage the risks inherent in this portfolio
    through origination policies, concentration limits, ongoing loan
    level reviews, recourse requirements, and continuous portfolio
    risk management activities. Our origination policies for this
    portfolio include loan product-type specific policies such as

loan-to-value

(LTV), and debt service coverage ratios, as applicable.

C&I borrowers have been challenged by the weak economy for
    consecutive years, and some borrowers may no longer have
    sufficient capital to withstand the protracted stress and, as a
    result, may not be able to comply with the original terms of
    their credit agreements. We continue to focus ongoing attention
    on the portfolio management process to proactively identify
    borrowers that may be facing financial difficulty.

To the extent C&I loans are secured by real estate
    collateral, appropriate appraisals are obtained at origination,
    and updated on an as needed basis, in compliance with regulatory
    requirements.



As shown in the following table, C&I loans totaled
    $12.9 billion at December 31, 2009.

Companies with > 25% of revenue derived from the automotive
    industry.

Although we do not have direct exposure to the automobile
    manufacturing companies, we do have limited exposure to
    automobile industry suppliers, and automobile dealer-related
    exposures. While we continue to believe that this industry
    represents a high degree of risk, the primary impact to
    automobile industry suppliers has likely already occurred, given
    the substantial adjustments to production in 2008 and 2009. As a
    result of our geographic locations and the above referenced
    exposure, we have closely monitored the entire automobile
    industry, particularly the recent events associated with General
    Motors and Chrysler, including bankruptcy filings, plant
    closings, production suspension, and model eliminations. We have
    anticipated the significant reductions in production across the
    industry that will result in additional economic distress in
    some of our markets. Our eastern Michigan and northern Ohio
    markets are particularly exposed to these reductions, although
    all our markets are affected. We anticipate the impact will
    result in additional stress throughout our commercial and
    consumer loan portfolios, as secondary and tertiary businesses
    are affected by the actions of the manufacturers. However, as
    these actions were anticipated, many of the potential impacts
    have been mitigated through changes in underwriting criteria and
    regionally focused policies and procedures. Within the AFDS
    portfolio, our dealer selection criteria and focus is on
    multiple brand dealership groups, as we have immaterial exposure
    to single-brand dealerships.

As shown in the table above, at December 31, 2009, our
    total direct exposure to the automotive supplier segment was
    $332.5 million, of which $187.2 million represented
    loans outstanding. We included companies that derive more than
    25% of their revenues from contracts with automobile
    manufacturing companies. This low level of exposure is
    reflective of our industry-level risk-limits approach.

While the entire automotive industry is under significant
    pressure as evidenced by a significant reduction in new car
    sales and the resulting production declines, we believe that our
    floorplan exposure will not be



materially affected. Our floorplan exposure is centered in
    large, multi-dealership entities, and we have focused on client
    selection and conservative underwriting standards. We anticipate
    that the economic environment will affect our dealerships in the
    near-term, but we believe the majority of our portfolio will
    perform favorably relative to the industry in the increasingly
    stressed environment. The decline in floorplan loans outstanding
    at December 31, 2009, compared with December 31, 2008,
    reflected reduced dealership inventory, in part as a result of
    the successful 2009 “Cash for Clunkers” program.

While the specific impacts associated with the ongoing changes
    in the industry are unknown, we believe that we have taken
    appropriate steps to limit our exposure. When we have chosen to
    extend credit, our client selection process has focused us on
    the most diversified and strongest dealership groups. We do not
    anticipate any material dealer-related losses in the portfolio
    despite numerous dealership closings during 2009. Our dealer
    selection criteria, with a focus on multi-dealership groups has
    proven itself in this environment.

FRANKLIN
    RELATIONSHIP

(This section should be read in conjunction with Significant
    Item 3 and the “Franklin Loans Restructuring
    Transaction” discussion located within the “Critical
    Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates”
    section.)

As a result of the March 31, 2009, restructuring, on a
    consolidated basis, the $650.2 million nonaccrual
    commercial loan to Franklin at December 31, 2008, was no
    longer reported. Instead, we reported the loans secured by
    first- and second- mortgages on residential properties and OREO
    properties, both of which had previously been assets of Franklin
    or its subsidiaries, and were pledged to secure our commercial
    loan to Franklin. At the time of the restructuring, the loans
    had a fair value of $493.6 million and the OREO properties
    had a fair value of $79.6 million. As of December 31,
    2009, the balances had reduced to $443.9 million and
    $23.8 million, respectively. There is not a specific ALLL
    for the Franklin portfolio.

The following table summarizes the Franklin-related balances for
    accruing loans, NALs, and OREO since the restructuring:

The changes in the Franklin-related balances since the
    restructuring have been consistent with our expectations based
    on the restructuring agreement. Collection strategies were
    designed to generate cash flow with the intention of reducing
    our exposure associated with these loans.

Consumer
    Credit

Consumer credit approvals are based on, among other factors, the
    financial strength and payment history of the borrower, type of
    exposure, and the transaction structure. Consumer credit
    decisions are generally made in a centralized environment
    utilizing decision models. However, certain individuals who
    understand each local region have the authority to make credit
    extension decisions to preserve our local decision-making focus.
    Each credit extension is assigned a specific

probability-of-default

and loss-given-default. The

probability-of-default

is generally based on the borrower’s most recent credit
    bureau score (FICO), which we update quarterly, while the
    loss-given-default is related to the type of collateral and the
    LTV ratio associated with the credit extension.



In consumer lending, credit risk is managed from a loan type and
    vintage performance analysis. All portfolio segments are
    continuously monitored for changes in delinquency trends and
    other asset quality indicators. We make extensive use of
    portfolio assessment models to continuously monitor the quality
    of the portfolio, which may result in changes to future
    origination strategies. The continuous analysis and review
    process results in a determination of an appropriate ALLL amount
    for our consumer loan portfolio. The independent risk management
    group has a consumer process review component to ensure the
    effectiveness and efficiency of the consumer credit processes.

Collection action is initiated on an “as needed” basis
    through a centrally managed collection and recovery function.
    The collection group employs a series of collection
    methodologies designed to maintain a high level of effectiveness
    while maximizing efficiency. In addition to the retained
    consumer loan portfolio, the collection group is responsible for
    collection activity on all sold and securitized consumer loans
    and leases.

Please refer to the “Nonperforming
    Assets” discussion for further information regarding the
    placement of consumer loans on nonaccrual status and the
    charging off of balances to the ALLL.

The residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are
    primarily located throughout our geographic footprint. The
    general slowdown in the housing market has impacted the
    performance of our residential mortgage and home equity
    portfolios over the past year. While the degree of price
    depreciation varies across our markets, all regions throughout
    our footprint have been affected. Given the continued economic
    weaknesses in our markets, the home equity and residential
    mortgage portfolios are particularly noteworthy, and are
    discussed in greater detail below:

HOME
    EQUITY PORTFOLIO

Our home equity portfolio (loans and

lines-of-credit)

consists of both first and second mortgage loans with
    underwriting criteria based on minimum credit scores,

debt-to-income

ratios, and LTV ratios. We offer closed-end home equity loans
    with a fixed interest rate and level monthly payments and a
    variable-rate, interest-only home equity

line-of-credit.

Home equity loans are generally fixed-rate with periodic
    principal and interest payments. Home equity

lines-of-credit

are generally variable-rate and do not require payment of
    principal during the

10-year

revolving period of the line.

We believe we have granted credit conservatively within this
    portfolio. We have not originated stated income home equity
    loans or

lines-of-credit

that allow negative amortization. Also, we have not originated
    home equity loans or

lines-of-credit

with an LTV ratio at origination greater than 100%, except for
    infrequent situations with high quality borrowers. However,
    recent declines in housing prices have likely eliminated a



portion of the collateral for this portfolio as some loans with
    an original LTV ratio of less than 100% currently have an LTV
    ratio above 100%. At December 31, 2009, 43% of our home
    equity loan portfolio, and 27% of our home equity

line-of-credit

portfolio were secured by a first-mortgage lien on the property.
    The risk profile is substantially improved when we hold a
    first-mortgage lien position. In 2009, over 40% of our home
    equity portfolio originations (both loans and

lines-of-credit)

were loans where the loan was secured by a first-mortgage lien.

For certain home equity loans and

lines-of-credit,

we may utilize Automated Valuation Methodology (AVM) or other
    model driven value estimates during the credit underwriting
    process. Regardless of the estimate methodology, we supplement
    our underwriting with a third party fraud detection system to
    limit our exposure to “flipping”, and outright
    fraudulent transactions. We update values, as we believe
    appropriate, and in compliance with applicable regulations, for
    loans identified as higher risk, based on performance indicators
    to facilitate our workout and loss mitigation functions.

We continue to make appropriate origination policy adjustments
    based on our assessment of an appropriate risk profile as well
    as industry actions. As an example, the significant changes made
    in 2009 and 2008 by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac resulted in the
    reduction of our maximum LTV ratio on second-mortgage loans,
    even for customers with high credit scores. In addition to
    origination policy adjustments, we take appropriate actions, as
    necessary, to manage the risk profile of this portfolio. We
    focus production primarily within our banking footprint or to
    existing customers.

RESIDENTIAL
    MORTGAGES

We focus on higher quality borrowers, and underwrite all
    applications centrally, often through the use of an automated
    underwriting system. We do not originate residential mortgage
    loans that allow negative amortization or are “payment
    option adjustable-rate mortgages.”

All residential mortgage loans are originated based on a full
    appraisal during the credit underwriting process. Additionally,
    we supplement our underwriting with a third party fraud
    detection system to limit our exposure to “flipping”,
    and outright fraudulent transactions. We update values, as we
    believe appropriate, and in compliance with applicable
    regulations, for loans identified as higher risk, based on
    performance indicators to facilitate our workout and loss
    mitigation functions.

During 2009, we sold $44.8 million of underperforming
    mortgage loans, resulting in a reduction in residential mortgage
    NALs. We will continue to evaluate this type of transaction in
    future periods based on market conditions.

A majority of the loans in our loan portfolio have adjustable
    rates. Our adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) are primarily
    residential mortgages that have a fixed-rate for the first 3 to
    5 years and then adjust annually. These loans comprised
    approximately 56% of our total residential mortgage loan
    portfolio at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009,
    ARM loans that were expected to have rates reset totaled
    $888.5 million for 2010, and $477.7 million for 2011.
    Given the quality of our borrowers and the relatively low
    current interest rates, we believe that we have a relatively
    limited exposure to ARM reset risk. Nonetheless, we have taken
    actions to mitigate our risk exposure. We initiate borrower
    contact at least six months prior to the interest rate
    resetting, and have been successful in converting many ARMs to
    fixed-rate loans through this process. Additionally, where
    borrowers are experiencing payment difficulties, loans may be
    reunderwritten based on the borrower’s ability to repay the
    loan.

We had $363.3 million of Alt-A mortgage loans in the
    residential mortgage loan portfolio at December 31, 2009,
    compared with $445.4 million at December 31, 2008.
    These loans have a higher risk profile than the rest of the
    portfolio as a result of origination policies for this limited
    segment including reliance on stated income, stated assets, or
    higher acceptable LTV ratios. At December 31, 2009,
    borrowers for Alt-A mortgages had an average current FICO score
    of 662 and the loans had an average LTV ratio of 87%, compared
    with 671 and 88%, respectively, at December 31, 2008. Total
    Alt-A NCOs were $21.3 million, or an annualized 5.25%, in
    2009, compared with $9.4 million, or an annualized 1.91%,
    in 2008. As with the entire residential mortgage portfolio, the
    increase in NCOs reflected, among other actions, a more
    conservative position on the



timing of loss recognition and the sale of underperforming
    mortgage loans in 2009. At December 31, 2009,
    $17.7 million of the ALLL was allocated to the Alt-A
    mortgage portfolio, representing 4.87% of period-end related
    loans and leases. Our exposure related to this product will
    continue to decline in the future as we stopped originating
    these loans in 2007.

Interest-only loans comprised $576.7 million of residential
    real estate loans at December 31, 2009, compared with
    $691.9 million at December 31, 2008. Interest-only
    loans are underwritten to specific standards including minimum
    credit scores, stressed

debt-to-income

ratios, and extensive collateral evaluation. At
    December 31, 2009, borrowers for interest-only loans had an
    average current FICO score of 718 and the loans had an average
    LTV ratio of 77%, compared with 724 and 78%, respectively, at
    December 31, 2008. Total interest-only NCOs were
    $11.3 million, or an annualized 1.79% in 2009, compared
    with $1.6 million, or an annualized 0.21%, in 2008. As with
    the entire residential mortgage portfolio, the increase in NCOs
    reflected, among other actions, a more conservative position on
    the timing of loss recognition, and the sale of underperforming
    mortgage loans in 2009. At December 31, 2009,
    $7.5 million of the ALLL was allocated to the interest-only
    loan portfolio, representing 1.30% of period-end related loans
    and leases.

Several recent government actions have been enacted that have
    affected the residential mortgage portfolio and MSRs in
    particular. Various refinance programs positively affected the
    availability of credit for the industry. We are utilizing these
    programs to enhance our existing strategies of working closely
    with our customers.

AUTOMOTIVE
    INDUSTRY IMPACTS ON CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO

The issues affecting the automotive industry

(see
    “Automotive Industry” discussion located within the
    “Commercial Credit” section)

also have an impact
    on the performance of the consumer loan portfolio. While there
    is a direct correlation between the industry situation and our
    exposure to the automotive suppliers and automobile dealers in
    our commercial portfolio, the loss of jobs and reduction in
    wages may have a negative impact on our consumer portfolio. We
    continue to monitor the potential impact on our geographic
    regions in the event of significant production changes or plant
    closings in our markets and, we believe that we have made a
    number of positive decisions regarding the quality of our
    consumer portfolio given the current environment. In the
    indirect automobile portfolio, we have consistently focused on
    borrowers with high credit scores and lower LTVs, as reflected
    by the performance of the portfolio given the economic
    conditions. In the residential and home equity loan portfolios,
    we have been operating in a relatively high unemployment
    situation for an extended period of time, yet have been able to
    maintain our performance metrics reflecting our focus on strong
    underwriting. In summary, while we anticipate our performance
    results may be negatively impacted, we believe the impact will
    be manageable.

Counterparty
    Risk

In the normal course of business, we engage with other financial
    counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing,
    asset and liability management, mortgage banking, and for
    trading activities. As a result, we are exposed to credit risk,
    or the risk of loss if the counterparty fails to perform
    according to the terms of our contract or agreement.

We minimize counterparty risk through credit approvals, actively
    setting adjusting exposure limits, implementing monitoring
    procedures similar to those used for our commercial portfolio

(see “Commercial Credit” discussion)

, generally
    entering into transactions only with counterparties that carry
    high quality ratings, and requiring collateral when appropriate.

The majority of the financial institutions with whom we are
    exposed to counterparty risk are large commercial banks. The
    potential amount of loss, which would have been recognized at
    December 31, 2009, if a counterparty defaulted, did not
    exceed $17 million for any individual counterparty.



Credit
    Quality

We believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit
    quality performance for 2009 is through an analysis of credit
    quality performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of
    most of the discussion in the three sections immediately
    following: NALs and NPAs, ACL, and NCOs.

Credit quality performance in 2009 was negatively impacted by
    the sustained economic weakness in our Midwest markets, although
    there were signs of stabilization late in the year. In addition,
    we initiated certain actions in 2009 with regard to loss
    recognition on our residential mortgage portfolio that we
    believe will increase the flexibility in working the loans
    toward a more timely resolution. We anticipate a challenging
    full-year in 2010 with regards to credit quality, but believe
    that 2009 was the peak in terms of NPA levels, as well as for
    credit losses and the related increase in the ACL.

NONACCRUAL
    LOANS (NALs) AND NONPERFORMING ASSETS (NPAs)

(This section should be read in conjunction with Significant
    Items 2 and 3 and the “Franklin Loans Restructuring
    Transaction” discussion located with the “Critical
    Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates”
    section.)

NPAs consist of (a) NALs, which represent loans and leases
    that are no longer accruing interest, (b) impaired

held-for-sale

loans, (c) OREO, and (d) other NPAs. A C&I or CRE
    loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when collection of
    principal or interest is in doubt or when the loan is

90-days

past
    due. Residential mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual status
    at 180 days, and a charge-off is recorded when the loan has
    been foreclosed and the loan balance exceeds the fair value of
    the collateral. A home equity loan is placed on nonaccrual
    status at 120 days, and a charge-off is recorded when it is
    determined that there is not sufficient equity in the loan to
    cover our position. When interest accruals are suspended,
    accrued interest income is reversed with current year accruals
    charged to earnings and prior-year amounts generally charged-off
    as a credit loss.

Accruing restructured loans (ARLs) consists of accruing loans
    that have been reunderwritten, modified, or restructured when
    borrowers are experiencing payment difficulties. Generally,
    prior to restructuring, these loans have not reached a status to
    be considered as NALs. These loan restructurings are one
    component of the loss mitigation process, and are made to
    increase the likelihood of the borrower’s ability to repay
    the loan. Modifications to these loans include, but are not
    limited to, changes to any of the following: interest rate,
    maturity, principal, payment amount, or a combination of each.

Table 27 reflects period-end NALs and NPAs detail for each of
    the last five years, and Table 28 reflects period-end ARLs and
    past due loans and leases detail for each of the last five
    years. Table 29 details the Franklin-related impacts to NALs and
    NPAs for 2009 and 2008. Prior to 2008, there were no
    Franklin-related NALs or NPAs.

During 2009, and because we believe that there will be no
    meaningful economic recovery for the foreseeable future, we took
    a more conservative approach in identifying and classifying
    emerging problem credits. In many cases, commercial loans were
    placed on nonaccrual status even though the loan was less than
    30 days past due for both principal and interest payments.
    Of the $1,514.2 million of CRE and C&I-related NALs at
    December 31, 2009, $530.1 million, or 35%, represented
    loans that were less than 30 days past due. We believe the
    decisions increase our options for working these loans toward
    timelier resolution. It is important to note that although there
    was an increase in NALs from December 31, 2008, to
    December 31, 2009, there was a substantial decline in the
    2009 fourth quarter.



NPAs, which include NALs, were $2,058.1 million at
    December 31, 2009, and represented 5.57% of related assets.
    This compared with $1,636.6 million, or 3.97%, at
    December 31, 2008. The $421.4 million increase
    reflected:

•

$414.8 million increase to NALs, discussed below.

•

$17.6 million increase to OREO. This reflected an increase
    of $79.6 million in OREO assets recorded as part of the
    2009 first quarter Franklin restructuring. Subsequently,
    Franklin-related OREO assets declined $55.8 million,
    reflecting the active marketing and selling of Franklin-related
    OREO properties during 2009. The non-Franklin-related decline
    also reflected the same active marketing and selling of our OREO
    properties.

Partially offset by:

•

$11.0 million decrease in impaired loans

held-for-sale,

primarily reflecting loan sales and payments.

NALs were $1,917.0 million at December 31, 2009,
    compared with $1,502.1 million at December 31, 2008.
    The increase of $414.8 million primarily reflected:

•

$490.1 million increase in CRE NALs, reflecting the
    continued decline in the housing market and stress on retail
    sales, as the majority of the increase was associated with the
    retail and single family home builder segments. The stress of
    the lower retail sales and downward pressure on rents given the
    economic conditions, have adversely affected retail projects.

•

$263.7 million increase in residential mortgage NALs. This
    reflected a net increase of $299.7 million related to the
    2009 first quarter Franklin restructuring, partially offset by
    declines due to the more conservative position regarding the
    timing of loss recognition, active loss mitigation, as well as
    the sale of residential mortgage NALs during 2009. Our efforts
    to proactively address existing issues with loss mitigation and
    loan modification transactions have helped to reduce the inflow
    of new residential mortgage NALs. All residential mortgage NALs
    have been written down to current value less selling costs.

•

$15.3 million increase in home equity NALs, primarily
    reflecting the loans recorded as part of the 2009 first quarter
    Franklin restructuring. As with residential mortgages, all home
    equity NALs have been written down to current value less selling
    costs.

Partially offset by:

•

$354.2 million decrease in C&I NALs. This reflected a
    reduction of $650.2 million related to the 2009 first
    quarter Franklin restructuring, partially offset by an increase
    of $296.0 million in non-Franklin related NALs, reflecting
    the economic conditions of our markets. In general, the C&I
    loans experiencing the most stress are those supporting the
    housing and construction segments, and to a lesser degree, the
    automobile suppliers and restaurant segments.

The over

90-day

delinquent, but still accruing, ratio excluding loans guaranteed
    by the U.S. Government, was 0.40% at December 31,
    2009, representing a 6 basis points decrease compared with
    December 31, 2008. On this same basis, the over

90-day

delinquency ratio for total consumer loans was 0.90% at
    December 31, 2009, representing a 22 basis point
    increase compared with December 31, 2008.

As part of our loss mitigation process, we reunderwrite, modify,
    or restructure loans when borrowers are experiencing payment
    difficulties, and these loan restructurings are based on the
    borrower’s ability to repay the loan.



NPA activity for each of the past five years was as follows:

The activity above excludes the 2007 impact of the placement of
    the loans to Franklin on nonaccrual status and their return to
    accrual status upon the restructuring of these loans. At
    2007 year-end, the loans to Franklin were not included in
    the nonperforming assets total. At 2008 year-end, the loans
    to Franklin were reported as nonaccrual commercial and
    industrial loans. At 2009 year-end, nonaccrual Franklin
    loans were reported as residential mortgage loans, home equity
    loans, and OREO. The 2009 impact primarily reflects loan and
    lease losses, as well as payments.

ALLOWANCES
    FOR CREDIT LOSSES (ACL)

(This section should be read in conjunction with Significant
    Item 3, “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of
    Significant Estimates”, and Note 1 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.)

We maintain two reserves, both of which are available to absorb
    credit losses: the ALLL and the AULC. When summed together,
    these reserves comprise the total ACL. Our credit administration
    group is responsible for developing methodology assumptions and
    estimates, as well as determining the adequacy of the ACL. The
    ALLL represents the estimate of probable losses inherent in the
    loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. Additions to the ALLL
    result from recording provision expense for loan losses or
    recoveries, while reductions reflect charge-offs, net of
    recoveries, or the sale of loans. The AULC is determined by
    applying the transaction reserve process, which is described in
    Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, to the unfunded portion of the portfolio adjusted by
    an applicable funding expectation.

As shown in the following tables below, the ALLL increased to
    $1,482.5 million at December 31, 2009, compared with
    $900.2 million at December 31, 2008. Expressed as a
    percent of period-end loans and leases, the ALLL ratio increased
    to 4.03% at December 31, 2009, compared with 2.19% at
    December 31, 2008.

The $582.3 million increase in the ALLL primarily
    reflected an increase in specific reserves associated with
    impaired loans, and an increase associated with risk-grade
    migration, predominantly in the commercial portfolio. The
    increase is also a result of a change in estimate resulting from
    the 2009 fourth quarter review of our ACL practices and
    assumptions, consisting of:

•

Approximately $200 million increase in the judgmental
    component.

•

Approximately $200 million allocated primarily to the CRE
    portfolio addressing the severity of CRE loss-given-default
    percentages and a longer term view of the loss emergence time
    period.

•

Approximately $50 million from updating the consumer
    reserve factors to include the current delinquency status.



Partially offset by:

•

$130 million of previously established Franklin specific
    reserves utilized to absorb related NCOs due to the 2009 first
    quarter Franklin restructuring (

see “Franklin Loan
    Restructuring Transaction” discussion located within the
    “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant
    Estimates” section)

.

On a combined basis, the ACL as a percent of total loans and
    leases at December 31, 2009, was 4.16% compared with 2.30%
    at December 31, 2008. Like the ALLL, the Franklin
    restructuring impacted the change in the ACL from
    December 31, 2008.

The table below reflects how our ACL was allocated among our
    various loan categories during the past five years:

Not applicable. Franklin loans were acquired at fair value on
    March 31, 2009. Under guidance provided by the FASB
    regarding acquired impaired loans, a nonaccretable discount was
    recorded to reduce the carrying value of the loans to the amount
    of future cash flows we expect to receive.

We believe that the total ACL/NAL coverage ratio of 80% at
    December 31, 2009, represented an appropriate level of
    reserves for the remaining risk in the portfolio. The Franklin
    NAL balance of $314.7 million does not have reserves
    assigned as those loans were written down to fair value as a
    part of the restructuring agreement on March 31, 2009, and
    we do not expect any significant additional charge-offs.

(See
    “Franklin Loan Restructuring Transaction” discussion
    located within the “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of
    Significant Estimates” section.)

As we believe that the coverage ratios are used to gauge
    coverage of potential future losses, not including these
    balances provides a more accurate measure of our ACL level
    relative to NALs. After adjusting for the Franklin portfolio,
    our December 31, 2009, ACL/NAL ratio was 96%.

2007 includes charge-offs totaling $397.0 million
    associated with the Franklin restructuring. These charge-offs
    were reduced by the unamortized discount associated with the
    loans, and by other amounts received by Franklin totalling
    $88.5 million, resulting in net charge-offs totaling
    $308.5 million.

Total NCOs during 2009 were $1,476.6 million, or an
    annualized 3.82% of average related balances compared with
    $758.1 million, or annualized 1.85% of average related
    balances in 2008. After adjusting for NCOs relating to the
    Franklin relationship of $115.9 million in 2009, and
    $423.3 million in 2008, total NCOs during 2009 were
    $1,360.7 million and $334.8 million in 2008. We
    anticipate a challenging full-year in 2010 with regards to
    credit quality, resulting in elevated NCOs across all of our
    loan and lease portfolios compared with normalized levels. We
    believe that 2009 represented the peak for credit losses in this
    cycle.

Total commercial NCOs during 2009 were $1,170.3 million, or
    an annualized 5.25% of average related balances, compared with
    $594.9 million, or an annualized 2.55% in 2008. 2009
    included Franklin relationship-related NCOs of
    $114.5 million, and 2008 included Franklin
    relationship-related NCOs of $423.3 million.
    Non-Franklin-related commercial NCOs in 2009 were
    $1,055.9 million and $171.6 million in 2008.

The non-Franklin-related increase of $270.2 million in
    C&I NCOs reflected the continued economic weakness in our
    regions and our focused proactive approach to loss recognition
    in 2009. The increase was spread across our footprint, with no
    industry concentrations that were inconsistent with our industry
    exposure levels.



The $614.0 million increase in CRE NCOs was primarily
    centered in the single family home builder and the retail
    portfolios. These two segments of the CRE portfolio were the
    primary drivers of the overall portfolio performance in 2009.
    The impact was spread across our footprint, and included
    significant charge-offs associated with our relatively small

out-of-market

portfolio. We continued our ongoing portfolio management
    efforts, including obtaining updated appraisals on properties
    and assessing a project status within the context of market
    environment expectations. Historically, the single family
    homebuilder portfolio and retail portfolios have been the
    highest risk segments. Based on our portfolio management
    processes, including charge-off activity over the past two and
    one half years, we believe the credit issues in the single
    family homebuilder portfolio have been addressed. The retail
    property portfolio remains more susceptible to the ongoing
    market disruption, but we also believe that the combination of
    prior charge-offs and existing reserve balances positions us
    well to make effective credit decisions in the future.

In assessing commercial NCOs trends, it is helpful to understand
    the process of how these loans are treated as they deteriorate
    over time. Reserves for loans are established at origination
    consistent with the level of risk associated with the original
    underwriting. If the quality of a commercial loan deteriorates,
    it migrates to a lower quality risk rating as a result of our
    normal portfolio management process, and a higher reserve amount
    is assigned. As a part of our normal portfolio management
    process, the loan is reviewed and reserves are increased as
    warranted. Charge-offs, if necessary, are generally recognized
    in a period after the reserves were established. If the
    previously established reserves exceed that needed to
    satisfactorily resolve the problem credit, a reduction in the
    overall level of the reserve could be recognized. In summary, if
    loan quality deteriorates, the typical credit sequence for
    commercial loans are periods of reserve building, followed by
    periods of higher NCOs as previously established reserves are
    utilized. Additionally, it is helpful to understand that
    increases in reserves either precede or are in conjunction with
    increases in NALs. When a credit is classified as NAL, it is
    evaluated for specific reserves or charge-off. As a result, an
    increase in NALs does not necessarily result in an increase in
    reserves or an expectation of higher future NCOs.

Total consumer NCOs during 2009 were $306.3 million, or an
    annualized 1.87%, compared with $163.2 million, or an
    annualized 0.92%, in 2008. The increases were spread across all
    consumer loan portfolios, but particularly in the residential
    mortgage portfolio.

Automobile loan and lease NCOs in 2009 increased
    $1.8 million, or 3%, compared with 2008. The performance of
    the portfolio relative to NCOs reflected the positive impact of
    increasing used-vehicle prices, offset by the continued economic
    weakness in our markets. Performance of this portfolio on both
    an absolute and relative basis continued to be consistent with
    our views regarding the underlying quality of the portfolio. The
    2009 level of delinquencies have improved compared with 2008
    levels, further supporting our view of

flat-to-improved

performance going forward.

The NCO performance of our home equity portfolio continued to be
    impacted by lower housing prices, and the general weak market
    conditions. While 2009 NCOs were higher compared with prior
    years, there continued to be a declining trend throughout 2009
    in the early-stage delinquency level in the home equity

line-of-credit

portfolio, supporting our longer-term positive view for home
    equity portfolio performance. Also contributing to the NCO
    performance of our home equity portfolio was a significant
    increase in loss mitigation activity and short sales. We
    continue to believe that our more proactive loss mitigation
    strategies are in our best interest, as well as that of our
    customers. Although NCOs have increased over the course of 2009,
    given the market conditions, performance remained within
    expectations.

The increase in our residential mortgage NCOs compared with the
    prior year, reflected the continued negative impacts resulting
    from the general weak economic conditions and housing-related
    pressures. The increased NCOs were a direct result of our
    continued emphasis on loss mitigation strategies, an increased
    number of short sales, and a more conservative position
    regarding the timing of loss recognition. Specifically, in 2009,
    we sold $44.8 million of underperforming loans that
    resulted in $17.6 million of NCOs, and we adjusted the
    timing of loss recognition that resulted in an additional
    $32.0 million of NCOs. We continued to see some positive
    trends in early-stage delinquencies, indicating that even with
    the economic stress on our borrowers, losses are expected to
    remain manageable.



INVESTMENT
    SECURITIES PORTFOLIO

(This
    section should be read in conjunction with the “Critical
    Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates”
    discussion, and Notes 1 and 6 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.)

We routinely review our investment securities portfolio, and
    recognize impairment write-downs based primarily on fair value,
    issuer-specific factors and results, and our intent to hold such
    investments. Our investment securities portfolio is evaluated in
    light of established asset/liability management objectives, and
    changing market conditions that could affect the profitability
    of the portfolio, as well as the level of interest rate risk to
    which we are exposed.

Our investment securities portfolio is comprised of various
    financial instruments. At December 31, 2009, our investment
    securities portfolio totaled $8.6 billion. The composition
    and maturity of the portfolio is presented on the following two
    tables.

Weighted average yields were calculated using amortized cost on
    a fully-taxable equivalent basis, assuming a 35% tax rate.

Declines in the fair value of available for sale investment
    securities are recorded as temporary impairment, noncredit OTTI,
    or credit OTTI adjustments.

Temporary impairment adjustments are recorded when the fair
    value of a security fluctuates from its historical cost.
    Temporary impairment adjustments are recorded in accumulated
    OCI, and therefore, reduces equity. Temporary impairment
    adjustments do not impact net income or risk-based capital. A
    recovery of available for sale security prices also is recorded
    as an adjustment to OCI for securities that are temporarily
    impaired, and results in an increase to equity.

Because the available for sale securities portfolio is recorded
    at fair value, the conclusion as to whether an investment
    decline is

other-than-temporarily

impaired, does not significantly impact our equity position as
    the amount of temporary adjustment has already been reflected in
    accumulated other comprehensive income/loss. A recovery in the
    value of an

other-than-temporarily

impaired security is recorded as additional interest income over
    the remaining life of the security.

Given the continued disruption in the financial markets, we may
    be required to recognize additional credit OTTI losses in future
    periods with respect to our available for sale investment
    securities portfolio. The amount and timing of any additional
    credit OTTI will depend on the decline in the underlying cash
    flows of the securities. If our intent regarding the decision to
    hold temporarily impaired securities changes in future periods,
    we may be required to record noncredit OTTI, which will
    negatively impact our earnings.

Alt-A,
    Pooled-Trust-Preferred, and Private-Label CMO
    Securities

Our three highest risk segments of our investment portfolio are
    the Alt-A mortgage backed, pooled-trust-preferred, and
    private-label CMO portfolios. The Alt-A mortgage backed
    securities and pooled-trust-preferred securities are located
    within the asset-backed securities portfolio. The performance of
    the underlying securities in each of these segments continues to
    reflect the economic environment. Each of these securities in
    these three segments is subjected to a rigorous review of their
    projected cash flows. These reviews are supported with analysis
    from independent third parties.

(See the “Investment
    Securities” section located within the “Critical
    Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates”
    section for additional information).

The following table presents the credit ratings for our Alt-A,
    pooled-trust-preferred, and private label CMO securities as of

Credit ratings reflect the lowest current rating assigned by a
    nationally recognized credit rating agency.

Negative changes to the above credit ratings would generally
    result in an increase of our risk-weighted assets, which could
    result in a reduction to our regulatory capital ratios.



In an effort to lower the risk profile of the Alt-A portfolio,
    we sold $214.9 million (book value) of our Alt-A securities
    during 2009, resulting in a net securities gain of
    $3.4 million. These sold securities were some of the lower
    rated securities that we owned.

The following table summarizes the relevant characteristics of
    our pooled-trust-preferred securities portfolio. Each of the
    securities is part of a pool of issuers and each support a more
    senior tranche of securities except for the I-Pre TSL II
    security that is the most senior class.

Market
    Risk

Market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market
    values of assets and liabilities. We incur market risk in the
    normal course of business through exposures to market interest
    rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, credit spreads,
    and expected lease residual values. We have identified two
    primary sources of market risk: interest rate risk and price
    risk. Interest rate risk is our primary market risk.



Interest
    Rate Risk

OVERVIEW

Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings and value arising
    from changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk arises
    from timing differences in the repricings and maturities of
    interest-bearing assets and liabilities (reprice risk), changes
    in the expected maturities of assets and liabilities arising
    from embedded options, such as borrowers’ ability to prepay
    residential mortgage loans at any time and depositors’
    ability to terminate certificates of deposit before maturity
    (option risk), changes in the shape of the yield curve whereby
    interest rates increase or decrease in a non-parallel fashion
    (yield curve risk), and changes in spread relationships between
    different yield curves, such as U.S. Treasuries and London
    Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) (basis risk.)

Our board of directors establishes broad policy limits with
    respect to interest rate risk. Our Market Risk Committee (MRC),
    formerly the Management Risk Committee, establishes specific
    operating guidelines within the parameters of the board of
    directors’ policies. In general, we seek to minimize the
    impact of changing interest rates on net interest income and the
    economic values of assets and liabilities. Our MRC regularly
    monitors the level of interest rate risk sensitivity to ensure
    compliance with board of directors approved risk limits.

Interest rate risk management is an active process that
    encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by
    investment and funding activities. Effective management of
    interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic
    characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the
    appropriate interest rate risk posture given business segment
    forecasts, management objectives, market expectations, and
    policy constraints.

“Asset sensitive position”

refers to an
    increase in short-term interest rates that is expected to
    generate higher net interest income as rates earned on our
    interest-earning assets would reprice upward more quickly than
    rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. Conversely,
    “liability sensitive position” refers to an increase
    in short-term interest rates that is expected to generate lower
    net interest income as rates paid on our interest-bearing
    liabilities would reprice upward more quickly than rates earned
    on our interest-earning assets.

INCOME
    SIMULATION AND ECONOMIC VALUE ANALYSIS

Interest rate risk measurement is performed monthly. Two broad
    approaches to modeling interest rate risk are employed: income
    simulation and economic value analysis. An income simulation
    analysis is used to measure the sensitivity of forecasted net
    interest income to changes in market rates over a one-year time
    period. Although bank owned life insurance, automobile operating
    lease assets, and excess cash balances held at the Federal
    Reserve Bank are classified as noninterest earning assets, and
    the net revenue from these assets is in noninterest income and
    noninterest expense, these portfolios are included in the
    interest sensitivity analysis because they have attributes
    similar to interest earning assets. Economic value of equity
    (EVE) analysis is used to measure the sensitivity of the values
    of period-end assets and liabilities to changes in market
    interest rates. EVE serves as a complement to income simulation
    modeling as it provides risk exposure estimates for time periods
    beyond the one-year simulation period.

The models used for these measurements take into account
    prepayment speeds on mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities,
    and consumer installment loans, as well as cash flows of other
    assets and liabilities. Balance sheet growth assumptions are
    also considered in the income simulation model. The models
    include the effects of derivatives, such as interest rate swaps,
    interest rate caps, floors, and other types of interest rate
    options.

The baseline scenario for income simulation analysis, with which
    all other scenarios are compared, is based on market interest
    rates implied by the prevailing yield curve as of the period
    end. Alternative interest rate scenarios are then compared with
    the baseline scenario. These alternative interest rate scenarios
    include parallel rate shifts on both a gradual and immediate
    basis, movements in interest rates that alter the shape of the
    yield curve (e.g., flatter or steeper yield curve), and current
    interest rates remaining unchanged for the



entire measurement period. Scenarios are also developed to
    measure short-term repricing risks, such as the impact of
    LIBOR-based interest rates rising or falling faster than the
    prime rate.

The simulations for evaluating short-term interest rate risk
    exposure are scenarios that model gradual
    “+/−100” and “+/−200” basis
    point parallel shifts in market interest rates over the next

12-month

period beyond the interest rate change implied by the current
    yield curve. We assumed that market interest rates would not
    fall below 0% over the next

12-month

period for the scenarios that used the “-100” and
    “-200” basis point parallel shift in market interest
    rates. The table below shows the results of the scenarios as of
    December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008. All of the
    positions were within the board of directors’ policy limits.

The net interest income at risk reported as of December 31,
    2009 for the “+200” basis points scenario shows a
    change to a slight near-term liability sensitive position
    compared with December 31, 2008. Net interest income at
    risk reflects actions taken by management to improve the
    liquidity position of the balance sheet and improvements made in
    modeling assumptions regarding deposit pricing. The primary
    factors contributing to the change include:

•

3.1% incremental liability sensitivity reflecting the net impact
    of the execution of $7.0 billion receive fixed interest
    rates swaps during 2009, partially offset by $2.9 billion
    receive fixed interest rates swap maturities and early
    terminations, to offset the impact of actual and anticipated
    reductions in fixed-rate assets.

•

1.7% incremental asset sensitivity reflecting the decrease in
    floating rate debt and an increase in deposits and net free
    funds.

•

1.2% incremental liability sensitivity reflecting the purchase
    of securities to maintain a higher liquidity position.

•

1.3% incremental asset sensitivity reflecting the sale of
    municipal securities, the securitization and sale of automobile
    loans, and the sale of residential mortgage loans, slightly
    offset by an increase in other securities.

•

0.9% incremental liability sensitivity reflecting an update to
    deposit pricing models.

•

0.7% incremental asset sensitivity reflecting the anticipated
    slow down in fixed-rate loan originations due to customer
    preferences for variable-rate loans.

The primary simulations for EVE at risk assume immediate
    “+/−100” and “+/−200” basis
    point parallel shifts in market interest rates beyond the
    interest rate change implied by the current yield curve. The
    table below outlines the December 31, 2009, results
    compared with December 31, 2008. All of the positions were
    within the board of directors’ policy limits.

The EVE at risk reported as of December 31, 2009 for the
    “+200” basis points scenario shows a change to a
    higher long-term liability sensitive position compared with
    December 31, 2008, reflecting actions taken by management
    to improve the capital and liquidity position of the balance
    sheet, and improvements made in modeling assumptions regarding
    deposit pricing and mortgage asset prepayments. The primary
    factors contributing to the change include:

•

2.7% incremental liability sensitivity reflecting the purchase
    of securities to maintain a higher liquidity position.

•

2.8% incremental liability sensitivity reflecting the execution
    of $7.0 billion receive fixed interest rates swaps during
    2009, partially offset by $2.9 billion receive fixed
    interest rates swap maturities and early terminations, to offset
    the impact of actual and anticipated reductions in fixed-rate
    assets.

•

2.5% incremental asset sensitivity reflecting the sale of
    municipal securities, the securitization of indirect auto loans,
    and the sale of residential mortgage loans, slightly offset by
    an increase in other securities.

•

1.2% incremental asset sensitivity reflecting the improvements
    made in modeling assumptions regarding deposit pricing, mortgage
    asset prepayments, and implied forward yield curves.

The remainder of the change in EVE at risk for the
    “+200” basis points scenario was primarily related to
    a change in market rates throughout the year as longer-term
    interest rates implied by the current yield curve increased
    resulting in incremental liability sensitivity.

MORTGAGE
    SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRs)

(This section should be read in conjunction with Note 7
    of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)

At December 31, 2009, we had a total of $214.6 million
    of capitalized MSRs representing the right to service
    $16.0 billion in mortgage loans. Of this
    $214.6 million, $176.4 million was recorded using the
    fair value method, and $38.2 million was recorded using the
    amortization method. If we actively engage in hedging, the MSR
    asset is carried at fair value. If we do not actively engage in
    hedging, the MSR asset is adjusted using the amortization
    method, and is carried at the lower of cost or market value.

MSR fair values are very sensitive to movements in interest
    rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the
    projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying
    loans, which can be greatly reduced by prepayments. Prepayments
    usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and
    decrease when mortgage interest rates rise. We have employed
    strategies to reduce the risk of MSR fair value changes or
    impairment. In addition, we engage a third party to provide
    improved valuation tools and assistance with our strategies with
    the objective to decrease the volatility from MSR fair value
    changes. However, volatile changes in interest rates can
    diminish the effectiveness of these hedges. We typically report
    MSR fair value adjustments net of hedge-related trading activity
    in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income.
    Changes in fair value between reporting dates are recorded as an
    increase or decrease in mortgage banking income.

MSRs recorded using the amortization method generally relate to
    loans originated with historically low interest rates, resulting
    in a lower probability of prepayments and, ultimately,
    impairment. MSR assets are included in other assets, and are
    presented in Table 12.



Price
    Risk

Price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse
    movements in the prices of financial instruments that are
    carried at fair value and are subject to fair value accounting.
    We have price risk from trading securities, securities owned by
    our broker-dealer subsidiaries, foreign exchange positions,
    equity investments, investments in securities backed by mortgage
    loans, and marketable equity securities held by our insurance
    subsidiaries. We have established loss limits on the trading
    portfolio, on the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can
    be maintained, and on the amount of marketable equity securities
    that can be held by the insurance subsidiaries.

EQUITY
    INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS

In reviewing our equity investment portfolio, we consider
    general economic and market conditions, including industries in
    which private equity merchant banking and community development
    investments are made, and adverse changes affecting the
    availability of capital. We determine any impairment based on
    all of the information available at the time of the assessment.
    New information or economic developments in the future could
    result in the recognition of additional impairment.

Investment decisions that incorporate credit risk require the
    approval of the independent credit administration function. The
    degree of initial due diligence and subsequent review is a
    function of the type, size, and collateral of the investment.
    Performance is monitored on a regular basis, and reported to the
    MRC.

From time to time, we invest in various investments with equity
    risk. Such investments include investment funds that buy and
    sell publicly traded securities, investment funds that hold
    securities of private companies, direct equity or venture
    capital investments in companies (public and private), and
    direct equity or venture capital interests in private companies
    in connection with our mezzanine lending activities. These
    investments are included in “accrued income and other
    assets” on our consolidated balance sheet. At
    December 31, 2009, we had a total of $34.5 million of
    such investments, down from $44.7 million at
    December 31, 2008. Net gains related to these equity
    investments totaled $0.7 million in 2009, compared with net
    losses of $9.0 million in 2008. The 2008 losses reflected a
    $5.9 million venture capital loss, and $4.5 million of
    losses on public equity funds that bought and sold primarily
    publicly traded securities. These investments were primarily in
    funds that focused on the financial services sector that, during
    2008, performed worse than the broad equity market. In 2009, we
    sold these public equity fund investments.

Liquidity
    Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk of loss due to the possibility that
    funds may not be available to satisfy current or future
    commitments resulting from external macro market issues,
    investor and customer perception of financial strength, and
    events unrelated to the company such as war, terrorism, or
    financial institution market specific issues. We manage
    liquidity risk at both the Bank and at the parent company,
    Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (HBI).

The overall objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure
    that we can obtain cost-effective funding to meet current and
    future obligations, as well as maintain sufficient levels of
    on-hand liquidity, under both normal “business as
    usual” and unanticipated, stressed circumstances. The Risk
    Management Committee was appointed by the HBI Board Risk
    Committee to oversee liquidity risk management and establish
    policies and limits, based upon analyses of the ratio of loans
    to deposits, liquid asset coverage ratios, the percentage of
    assets funded with noncore or wholesale funding, net cash
    capital, liquid assets, and emergency borrowing capacity. In
    addition, operating guidelines are established to ensure that
    bank loans included in the Retail and Business Banking,
    Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, and PFG business
    segments are funded with core deposits. These operating
    guidelines also ensure diversification of noncore funding by
    type, source, and maturity and provide sufficient liquidity to
    cover 100% of wholesale funds maturing within a six-month
    period. A contingency funding plan is in place, which includes
    forecasted sources and uses of funds under various scenarios in
    order to prepare for unexpected liquidity shortages, including
    the implications of any credit rating changes

and/or

other
    trigger events related to financial ratios, deposit
    fluctuations, debt issuance capacity, stock performance, or
    negative news related to us or the banking industry. Liquidity
    risk is reviewed



monthly for the Bank and the parent company, as well as its
    subsidiaries. In addition, liquidity working groups meet
    regularly to identify and monitor liquidity positions, provide
    policy guidance, review funding strategies, and oversee
    adherence to, and the maintenance of, the contingency funding
    plan(s). A Contingency Funding Working Group monitors daily cash
    flow trends, branch activity, unfunded commitments, significant
    transactions, and parent company subsidiary sources and uses of
    funds in order to identify areas of concern, and establish
    specific funding strategies. This group works closely with the
    Risk Management Committee and the HBI Communication Team in
    order to identify issues that may require a more proactive
    communication plan to shareholders, employees, and customers
    regarding specific events or issues that could have an impact on
    our liquidity position.

In the normal course of business, in order to better manage
    liquidity risk, we perform stress tests to determine the effect
    that a potential downgrade in our credit ratings or other market
    disruptions could have on liquidity over various time periods.
    These credit ratings, which are presented in Table 47, have a
    direct impact on our cost of funds and ability to raise funds
    under normal, as well as adverse, circumstances. The results of
    these stress tests indicate that sufficient sources of funds are
    available to meet our financial obligations and fund our
    operations for a

12-month

period. The stress test scenarios include testing to determine
    the impact of an interruption to our access to the national
    markets for funding, significant run-off in core deposits and
    liquidity triggers inherent in other financial agreements. To
    compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures,
    we consider alternative sources of liquidity over different time
    periods to project how funding needs would be managed. The
    specific alternatives for enhancing liquidity include generating
    client deposits, securitizing or selling loans, selling or
    maturing of securities, and extending the level or maturity of
    wholesale borrowings.

Most credit markets in which we participate and rely upon as
    sources of funding have been significantly disrupted and highly
    volatile since mid-2007. Reflecting concern about the stability
    of the financial markets generally, many lenders reduced, and in
    some cases, ceased unsecured funding to borrowers, including
    other financial institutions. Since that time, as a means of
    maintaining adequate liquidity, we, like many other financial
    institutions, have relied more heavily on the liquidity and
    stability present in the secured credit markets since access to
    unsecured term debt has been restricted. Throughout this period,
    we continued to extend maturities ensuring that we maintained
    adequate liquidity in the event the crisis became prolonged. In
    addition to managing our maturities, we strengthened our overall
    liquidity position by significantly reducing our noncore funds
    and wholesale borrowings, and increasing our overall level of
    liquid assets. Shifting from the net purchasing of overnight
    federal funds to an excess reserve position at the end of the
    2009 first quarter, as well as significantly increasing the
    level of free securities, has significantly improved our on-hand
    liquidity. However, we are part of a financial system, and a
    systemic lack of available credit, a lack of confidence in the
    financial sector, and increased volatility in the financial
    markets could materially and adversely affect our liquidity
    position.

Bank
    Liquidity and Sources of Liquidity

Our primary sources of funding for the Bank are retail and
    commercial core deposits. As of December 31, 2009, these
    core deposits, of which our Retail and Business Banking business
    segment provided 77%, funded 73% of total assets. At
    December 31, 2009, total core deposits represented 92% of
    total deposits, an increase from 86% at the prior year-end.

Core deposits are comprised of interest bearing and noninterest
    bearing demand deposits, money market deposits, savings and
    other domestic time deposits, consumer certificates of deposit
    both over and under $250,000, and nonconsumer certificates of
    deposit less than $250,000. Noncore deposits consist of brokered
    money market deposits and certificates of deposit, foreign time
    deposits, and other domestic time deposits of $250,000 or more
    comprised primarily of public fund certificates of deposit more
    than $250,000.

Core deposits may increase our need for liquidity as
    certificates of deposit mature or are withdrawn before maturity
    and as nonmaturity deposits, such as checking and savings
    account balances, are withdrawn. Specifically, if the FDIC
    permits the Transaction Account Guarantee Program
    (“TAGP”) to expire as scheduled on June 30, 2010,
    customers may elect to reduce their deposits with us in an
    effort to maintain deposit



insurance coverage. The TAGP is a voluntary program provided by
    the FDIC as part of its TLGP. Under the program, all
    noninterest-bearing transaction accounts are fully guaranteed by
    the FDIC for the customer’s entire account balance. This
    program provides our customers with additional deposit insurance
    coverage, and is in addition to and separate from the $250,000
    coverage available under the FDIC’s general deposit
    insurance rules. At December 31, 2009, noninterest-bearing
    transaction account balances exceeding $250,000 totaled
    $2.5 billion, and represented the amount of
    noninterest-bearing transaction customer deposits that would not
    have been FDIC insured without the additional coverage provided
    by the TAGP.

As referenced in the above paragraph, the FDIC establishes a
    coverage limit, generally $250,000 currently, for
    interest-bearing deposit balances. To provide our customers
    deposit insurance above the established $250,000, we have joined
    the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS), a
    program that allows customers to invest up to $50 million
    in certificates of deposit through one participating financial
    institution, with the entire amount covered by FDIC insurance.
    At December 31, 2009, we had $529.4 million of CDARS
    deposit balances.

Demand deposit overdrafts that have been reclassified as loan
    balances were $40.4 million and $17.1 million at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Domestic time deposits of $250,000 or more, brokered deposits
    and negotiable CDs totaled $2.7 billion at the end of 2009
    and $4.7 billion at the end of 2008. The contractual
    maturities of these deposits at December 31, 2009 were as
    follows: $1.0 billion in three months or less,
    $0.5 billion in three months through six months,
    $0.8 billion in six months through twelve months, and
    $0.4 billion after twelve months.

The following table reflects deposit composition detail for each
    of the past five years.

In 2009, we reduced our dependence on noncore funds (total
    average liabilities less average core deposits and average
    accrued expenses and other liabilities) to 21% of total average
    assets, down from 28% in 2008. However, to the extent that we
    are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity through core deposits,
    we may meet



our liquidity needs through sources of wholesale funding. These
    sources include other domestic time deposits of $250,000 or
    more, brokered deposits and negotiable CDs, deposits in foreign
    offices, short-term borrowings, FHLB advances, other long-term
    debt, and subordinated notes. At December 31, 2009, total
    wholesale funding was $7.8 billion, a decrease from
    $13.8 billion at December 31, 2008. The
    $7.8 billion portfolio at December 31, 2009, had a
    weighted average maturity of 4.5 years. Various strategies

(described below)

, as well as growth in core deposits,
    reduced our reliance on wholesale borrowings.

During 2009, we initiated various strategies with the intent of
    further strengthening our liquidity position, as well as
    reducing the size of our balance sheet to, among other
    objectives, provide additional support to our TCE ratio

(see
    “Capital” discussion).

Our actions taken during
    2009 resulted in: (a) $4.1 billion increase in our
    unpledged investment securities, (b) $0.7 billion
    increase in available cash and due from banks,
    (c) $1.0 billion automobile loan securitization,
    (d) $0.6 billion sale of municipal securities,
    (e) $0.6 billion debt issuance as part of the TLGP,
    and (f) $0.2 billion mortgage loan sale. Any proceeds
    from these actions were used primarily to pay down wholesale
    borrowings.

In addition to these actions, core deposits grew
    $4.9 billion during 2009. This increase reduced our
    reliance upon noncore funding sources. In addition, our

loan-to-deposit

ratio improved to 91% at December 31, 2009, compared with
    108% at December 31, 2008.

In late 2009, we redeemed $370.8 million aggregate
    principle amount of certain subordinated notes issued previously
    by the Bank. This capital at the Bank was replaced with an
    intercompany subordinated note from the parent company in the
    amount of $400 million with a term of 15 years. A
    pretax gain of $73.6 million was recorded reflecting the
    difference between the carrying value of the notes and the
    purchase price of the debt, net of expenses and associated
    interest rate swaps. This transaction increased the quantity and
    quality of the Bank’s capital, and did not have a material
    impact on our liquidity position.

The Bank has access to the Federal Reserve’s discount
    window and Term Auction Facility (TAF). These borrowings are
    secured by commercial loans and home equity

lines-of-credit.

The Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank
    (FHLB)-Cincinnati, and as such, has access to advances from this
    facility. These advances are generally secured by residential
    mortgages, other mortgage-related loans, and

available-for-sale

securities. Information regarding amounts pledged, for the
    ability to borrow if necessary, and unused borrowing capacity at
    both the Federal Reserve and the FHLB-Cincinnati, are outlined
    in the following table:

As part of a periodic review conducted by the Federal Reserve,
    our discount window and TAF borrowing capacity was reduced
    during 2009. The reduction was based on the lowering of the
    specific percentages of pledged amounts available for borrowing.

We can also obtain funding through other methods including:
    (a) purchasing federal funds

(see Table 45 below)

,
    (b) selling securities under repurchase agreements

(see
    Table 45 below)

, (c) the sale or maturity of investment
    securities, (d) the sale or securitization of loans,
    (e) the sale of national market certificates of deposit,
    (f) the relatively shorter-term structure of our commercial
    loans

(see Table 46 below)

and automobile loans, and
    (g) the issuance of common and preferred stock.

At December 31, 2009, we believe that the Bank had
    sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations for the
    foreseeable future.

At December 31, 2009, the fair value of our portfolio of
    investment securities totaled $8.6 billion, of which
    $2.8 billion was pledged to secure public and trust
    deposits, interest rate swap agreements, U.S. Treasury
    demand notes, and securities sold under repurchase agreements.
    The composition and maturity of these securities were presented
    in Table 38.

Parent
    Company Liquidity

The parent company’s funding requirements consist primarily
    of dividends to shareholders, debt service, income taxes,
    operating expenses, funding of non-bank subsidiaries,
    repurchases of our stock, and acquisitions. The parent company
    obtains funding to meet obligations from dividends received from
    direct subsidiaries, net taxes collected from subsidiaries
    included in the federal consolidated tax return, fees for
    services provided to subsidiaries, and the issuance of debt
    securities.

At December 31, 2009, the parent company had
    $1.4 billion in cash or cash equivalents, compared with
    $1.1 billion at December 31, 2008. The following
    actions taken during 2009 affected the parent company’s
    liquidity position: (a) the issuance of 213.0 million
    shares of new common stock through two common stock offerings
    resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of $796.8 million;
    (b) the completion of three separate “discretionary
    equity issuance” programs, which allowed us to take
    advantage of market opportunities to issue an additional
    92.7 million shares of common stock worth
    $338.9 million; (c) two contributions of
    $250.0 million and one contribution of $400.0 million,
    or $900.0 million total, of additional capital made by the
    parent company to the Bank, which increased the Bank’s
    regulatory capital levels above its already
    “well-capitalized” levels; and (d) the redemption
    of a portion of our junior subordinated debt at a total cost of
    $96.2 million. A portion of the cash proceeds received from
    the common stock issuances were used to purchase investment
    securities.

Based on the current dividend of $0.01 per common share, cash
    demands required for common stock dividends are estimated to be
    approximately $7.2 million per quarter. We recognize the
    importance of the



dividend to our shareholders. While our overall capital and
    liquidity positions are strong, extreme economic market
    deterioration and the changing regulatory environment drove the
    difficult but prudent decision to reduce the dividend during the
    2009 first quarter to $0.01 per common share. This proactive
    measure contributed to growth in capital and the strengthening
    of our balance sheet. Table 65 provides additional detail
    regarding quarterly dividends declared per common share.

During 2008, we issued an aggregate $569 million of
    Series A Non-cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred
    Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock will pay, as declared
    by our board of directors, dividends in cash at a rate of 8.50%
    per annum, payable quarterly

(see Note 16 of the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements).

During the 2009 first
    and second quarters, we entered into agreements with various
    institutional investors exchanging shares of our common stock
    for shares of the Series A Preferred Stock held by them

(see “Capital/Capital Adequacy” discussion)

. In
    the aggregate, these exchanges are anticipated to reduce our
    total dividend cash requirements (common, Series A
    Preferred Stock, and Series B Preferred Stock) by an
    estimated $4.0 million per quarter. Considering these
    exchanges and the current dividend, cash demands required for
    Series A Preferred Stock are estimated to be approximately
    $7.7 million per quarter.

Also during 2008, we received $1.4 billion of equity
    capital by issuing 1.4 million shares of Series B
    Preferred Stock to the U.S. Department of Treasury as a
    result of our participation in the TARP voluntary CPP. The
    Series B Preferred Stock will pay cumulative dividends at a
    rate of 5% per year for the first five years and 9% per year
    thereafter, resulting in quarterly cash demands of approximately
    $18 million through 2012, and $32 million thereafter

(see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for additional information regarding the
    Series B Preferred Stock issuance).

Based on a regulatory dividend limitation, the Bank could not
    have declared and paid a dividend to the parent company at
    December 31, 2009, without regulatory approval. We do not
    anticipate that the Bank will request regulatory approval to pay
    dividends in the near future as we continue to build Bank
    regulatory capital above our already
    “well-capitalized” level. To help meet any additional
    liquidity needs, we have an open-ended, automatic shelf
    registration statement filed and effective with the SEC, which
    permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity
    securities.

With the exception of the common and preferred dividends
    previously discussed, the parent company does not have any
    significant cash demands. There are no maturities of parent
    company obligations until 2013, when a debt maturity of
    $50 million is payable.

Considering the factors discussed above, and other analyses that
    we have performed, we believe the parent company has sufficient
    liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations for the foreseeable
    future.

Credit
    Ratings

Credit ratings provided by the three major credit rating
    agencies are an important component of our liquidity profile.
    Among other factors, the credit ratings are based on financial
    strength, credit quality and concentrations in the loan
    portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings, capital
    adequacy, the quality of management, the liquidity of the
    balance sheet, the availability of a significant base of core
    deposits, and our ability to access a broad array of wholesale
    funding sources. Adverse changes in these factors could result
    in a negative change in credit ratings and impact our ability to
    raise funds at a reasonable cost in the capital markets. In
    addition, certain financial on- and off-balance sheet
    arrangements contain credit rating triggers that could increase
    funding needs if a negative rating change occurs. Other
    arrangements that could be impacted by credit rating changes
    include, but are not limited to, letter of credit commitments
    for marketable securities, interest rate swap collateral
    agreements, and certain asset securitization transactions
    contain credit rating provisions or could otherwise be impacted
    by credit rating changes.



The most recent credit ratings for the parent company and the
    Bank are as follows:

During 2009, all three rating agencies lowered their credit
    ratings for both the parent company and the Bank. The credit
    ratings to senior unsecured notes, subordinated notes, and
    short-term debt were changed. The above table reflects these
    changes. During the 2009 third quarter, Fitch Ratings reaffirmed
    the ratings given to both the parent company and the Bank. The
    FHLB uses the Bank’s credit rating in its calculation of
    borrowing capacity. As a result of these credit rating changes,
    the FHLB reduced our borrowing capacity by $370 million
    during the 2009 first quarter.

A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold
    securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by
    the assigning rating organization, and should be evaluated
    independently of any other rating.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

In the normal course of business, we enter into various
    off-balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include
    financial guarantees contained in standby letters of credit
    issued by the Bank and commitments by the Bank to sell mortgage
    loans.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to
    guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These
    guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private
    borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond
    financing, and similar transactions. Most of these arrangements
    mature within two years, and are expected to expire without
    being drawn upon. Standby letters of credit are included in the
    determination of the amount of risk-based capital that the
    parent company, and the Bank, are required to hold.

Through our credit process, we monitor the credit risks of
    outstanding standby letters of credit. When it is probable that
    a standby letter of credit will be drawn and not repaid in full,
    losses are recognized in the provision for credit losses. At
    December 31, 2009, we had $0.6 billion of standby
    letters of credit outstanding, of which 60% were collateralized.
    Included in this $0.6 billion total are letters of credit
    issued by the Bank that support securities that were issued by
    our customers and remarketed by The Huntington Investment
    Company (HIC), our broker-dealer subsidiary. Due to the credit
    rating changes in 2009 noted above, and pursuant to the letters
    of credit issued by the Bank, the Bank repurchased substantially
    all of these securities, net of payments and maturities, during
    2009. As a result of these repurchases, only $32.3 million
    of these standby letters of credit remained outstanding at
    December 31, 2009.

We enter into forward contracts relating to the mortgage banking
    business to hedge the exposures we have from commitments to
    extend new residential mortgage loans to our customers and from
    our

held-for-sale

mortgage loans. At December 31, 2009 and

December 31, 2008, we had commitments to sell residential
    real estate loans of $662.9 million and
    $759.4 million, respectively. These contracts mature in
    less than one year.



During the 2009 first quarter, we transferred $1.0 billion
    automobile loans and leases to a trust in a securitization
    transaction. The securitization qualified for sale accounting
    under ASC 860. We retained $210.9 million of the related
    securities and recorded a $47.1 million retained residual
    interest as a result of the transaction. Subsequent to the
    transaction, we sold $78.4 million of these securities in
    the 2009 second quarter. These amounts were recorded as
    investment securities on our balance sheet. We also recorded a
    $5.9 million loss in other noninterest income on our income
    statement and recorded a $19.5 million servicing asset in
    accrued income and other assets associated with this
    transaction. In 2009, amended guidance was issued by FASB with
    respect to this type of transaction. With our adoption of this
    amended guidance in 2009, the trust was consolidated on
    January 1, 2010

. (See Note 3 of the Notes to the
    Financial Statements for additional details.)

We do not believe that off-balance sheet arrangements will have
    a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources.

Operational
    Risk

As with all companies, we are subject to operational risk.
    Operational risk is the risk of loss due to human error,
    inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, violations
    of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed
    practices, or ethical standards, and external influences such as
    market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, and
    security risks. We continuously strive to strengthen our system
    of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws, rules, and
    regulations, and to improve the oversight of our operational
    risk.

Risk Management manages the risk for the company through
    processes that assess the overall level of risk on a regular
    basis and identifies specific risks and the steps being taken to
    mitigate them. To mitigate operational and compliance risks, we
    have established a senior management level Operational Risk
    Committee, headed by the chief operational risk officer, and a
    senior management level Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance
    Committee, headed by the director of corporate compliance. The
    responsibilities of these committees, among other things,
    include establishing and maintaining management information
    systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential
    concerns, risks, or trends that may have a significant impact
    and develop recommendations to address the identified issues.
    Both of these committees report any significant findings and
    recommendations to the executive level Risk Management
    Committee, headed by the chief risk officer. Additionally,
    potential concerns may be escalated to the Risk Committee of the
    board of directors, as appropriate.

The goal of this framework is to implement effective operational
    risk techniques and strategies, minimize operational losses, and
    strengthen our overall performance.



Capital/Capital
    Adequacy

(This
    section should be read in conjunction with Significant
    Items 1 and 5.)

Capital is managed both at the Bank and on a consolidated basis.
    Capital levels are maintained based on regulatory capital
    requirements and the economic capital required to support
    credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks inherent in our
    business, and to provide the flexibility needed for future
    growth and new business opportunities. Shareholders’ equity
    totaled $5.3 billion at December 31, 2009. This
    represented a decrease compared with $7.2 billion at
    December 31, 2008, primarily reflecting the negative impact
    of the $2.6 billion goodwill impairment charge, partially
    offset by the issuance of 305.7 million new shares of
    common stock, through two common stock offerings and three
    “discretionary equity issuance” programs, worth
    $1.1 billion, and the exchange of a portion of our
    Series A Preferred Stock for 41.1 million shares of
    our common stock worth $0.2 billion

(see
    “Tier 1 Common Equity” section below)

.

Tier 1
    Common Equity

During 2009, a key priority was to strengthen our capital
    position in order to withstand potential future credit losses
    should the economic environment continue to deteriorate. During
    the 2009 second quarter, the Federal Reserve conducted a
    Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) on the
    country’s 19 largest bank holding companies to determine
    the amount of capital required to absorb losses that could arise
    under “baseline” and “more adverse” economic
    scenarios. The SCAP results determined that a Tier 1 common
    capital risk based ratio of at least 4.0% would be needed. A
    total of 10 of the 19 bank holding companies were directed to
    increase their capital levels to meet this 4.0% threshold.

While we were not one of these 19 institutions required by the
    Federal Reserve to conduct a forward-looking capital assessment,
    or “stress test”, we believed it important that we
    have an equivalent relative amount of capital to meet the
    official SCAP threshold of a 4% Tier 1 common capital
    risk-based ratio. As such, in May of 2009, we conducted an
    internal analysis designed to emulate the SCAP “more
    adverse” economic scenario based on December 31, 2008,
    portfolio balances as modeled by the Federal Reserve. As a
    result of that analysis, we disclosed on May 20, 2009, that
    we estimated $675 million of Tier 1 common equity was
    needed in addition to that already obtained through that date.
    By June 30, 2009, substantially all of that capital had
    been obtained. On September 17, 2009, we announced the
    completion of a third discretionary equity issuance program that
    raised a net $146.9 million of common equity, thus
    exceeding the remaining capital needed indicated by our internal
    SCAP analysis.

On that same date (September 17, 2009), we announced a new
    $350 million common stock offering as favorable market
    conditions and investor interest presented an opportunity to
    continue to build common equity efficiently to the long-term
    benefit of our shareholders. On September 19, 2009, we
    announced the completion of this common stock offering, which
    resulted in a net $440.4 million issuance of common equity.
    This capital, over and above that indicated by our internal SCAP
    analysis, increases our flexibility to repurchase debt and
    improve our overall funding. Further, it provides additional
    capacity to pursue growth of our core businesses, which includes
    supporting organic asset and deposit growth. This capital also
    provides us with sufficient capital to withstand a stressed
    economic scenario, allows us to take advantage of initiatives
    identified through our strategic planning effort currently
    underway, and significantly enhances our ability to eventually
    repay our $1.4 billion of TARP capital.



The following table summarizes the primary activity during 2009
    to increase Tier 1 common equity:

Primarily represents improvement in other comprehensive income.

As shown in the table above, these actions increased our
    Tier 1 common equity by $1.7 billion during 2009.
    While we may continue to seek opportunities to further
    strengthen our capital position, we believe that we have
    sufficient capital to withstand a severe economic scenario
    similar to that used by the Federal Reserve in its modeling of
    capital adequacy for the 19 large bank holding companies where
    “stress tests” were conducted.



The following table presents risk-weighed assets and other
    financial data necessary to calculate certain financial ratios,
    including the Tier 1 common equity ratio, which we use to
    measure capital adequacy:

As shown in the above table, our consolidated TCE ratio was
    5.92% at December 31, 2009, an increase from 4.04% at
    December 31, 2008. The 188 basis point increase from
    December 31, 2008, primarily reflected the
    $796.8 million aggregate of new common stock offering
    issuances, the $206.4 million conversion of



Series A Preferred Stock to common stock, as well as the
    reducing of our balance sheet through the securitizing of
    automobile loans, and the selling of a portion of our municipal
    securities portfolio, as well as mortgage loans.

Regulatory
    Capital

Regulatory capital ratios are the primary metrics used by
    regulators in assessing the “safety and soundness” of
    banks. We intend to maintain both the company’s and the
    Bank’s risk-based capital ratios at levels at which each
    would be considered “well-capitalized” by regulators.
    The Bank is primarily supervised and regulated by the Office of
    the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which establishes
    regulatory capital guidelines for banks similar to those
    established for bank holding companies by the Federal Reserve
    Board.

Regulatory capital primarily consists of Tier 1 capital and
    Tier 2 capital. The sum of Tier 1 capital and
    Tier 2 capital equals our total risk-based capital. The
    following table reflects changes and activity to the various
    components utilized in the calculation our consolidated
    Tier 1, Tier 2, and total risk-based capital amounts
    during 2009.

Based on an interim decision by the banking agencies on
    December 14, 2006, we have excluded the impact of adopting
    ASC Topic 715, “Compensation — Retirement
    Benefits”, from the regulatory capital calculations.

At December 31, 2009, the parent company had Tier 1
    and Total risk-based capital in excess of the minimum level
    required to be considered “well-capitalized” of
    $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.

Our risk-weighted capital ratios improved during 2009 compared
    with the prior year. The primary driver of these improvements
    was the $1.3 billion of net proceeds from the three
    discretionary equity issuance programs, conversions from
    preferred stock to common stock, and the common stock public
    offering completed in 2009. Additionally, risk-weighted assets
    declined during the 2009, as both loans outstanding and unfunded
    loan commitments decreased. These improvements were slightly
    offset by an increase in the amount of our net deferred tax
    asset that was disallowed for regulatory capital purposes.
    Regulations require that we deduct from our Tier 1 capital
    any amount that we cannot demonstrate the ability to recover
    within the next 12 months. This adjustment to regulatory
    capital has no impact on our assessment of the realizability of
    our net deferred tax asset.

In late 2009, we redeemed $370.8 million aggregate
    principal amount of certain subordinated notes issued previously
    by the Bank. This capital at the Bank was replaced with an
    intercompany subordinated note from the parent company in the
    amount of $400 million with a term of 15 years. A
    pretax gain of $73.6 million was recorded reflecting the
    difference between the carrying value of the notes and the
    purchase price of the debt, net of expenses and associated
    interest rate swaps. On a consolidated basis, this transaction
    reduced our Tier 2 capital by $354.9 million and
    increased our Tier 1 capital by $47.9 million, which
    included gain on the extinguishment of debt net of fees and
    associated interest rate swaps.

The Bank’s risk-weighted assets declined compared with
    December 31, 2008, as both loans outstanding and unfunded
    loan commitments decreased. At December 31, 2009, the Bank
    had Tier 1 and Total risk-based capital in excess of the
    minimum level required to be considered
    “well-capitalized” of $0.3 billion and
    $0.5 billion, respectively.

Preferred
    Stock/TARP

In 2008, we issued an aggregate $569 million of
    Series A Preferred Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock
    is nonvoting and may be convertible at any time, at the option
    of the holder, into 83.668 shares of our common stock.
    Shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by investors is not
    a component of Tier 1 common equity. As previously
    discussed

(see “Tier 1 Common Equity”
    section)

, we entered into agreements with



various institutional investors exchanging 41.1 million
    shares of our common stock for 0.2 million shares of the
    Series A Preferred Stock held by them during 2009. These
    transactions increased common equity by $206.4 million,
    while preferred equity decreased by the same amount.

During 2008, we received $1.4 billion of equity capital by
    issuing 1.4 million shares of Series B Preferred Stock
    to the U.S. Department of Treasury, and a ten-year warrant
    to purchase up to 23.6 million shares of our common stock,
    par value $0.01 per share, at an exercise price of $8.90 per
    share. The proceeds received were allocated to the preferred
    stock and additional

paid-in-capital.

The resulting discount on the preferred stock will be amortized,
    resulting in additional dilution to our earnings per share. The
    Series B Preferred Stock is not a component of Tier 1
    common equity.

(See Note 16 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
    regarding the Series B Preferred Stock issuance).

Other
    Capital Matters

To accelerate the building of capital, we reduced our quarterly
    common stock dividend to $0.01 per common share, effective with
    the dividend paid April 1, 2009.

On February 18, 2009, our 2006 Repurchase Program was
    terminated. Additionally, as a condition to participate in the
    TARP, we may not repurchase any shares without prior approval
    from the Department of Treasury. No shares were repurchased
    during 2009.

As shown in the Table 65, our book value per share declined to
    $5.10 per share at December 31, 2009, from $14.62 per share
    at December 31, 2008. This decline reflected the net loss
    applicable to common shares in 2009, which included a
    $2.6 billion impairment of our goodwill

(see the
    “Goodwill” discussion located within the
    “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant
    Estimates” section)

. Our tangible book value per share,
    which excludes goodwill and other intangible assets from equity,
    declined to $4.21 per share at December 31, 2009, from
    $5.64 at December 31, 2008. This decline was significantly
    less, on both an absolute and relative basis, compared with the
    decline in book value per share, as the size of the net loss
    applicable to common shares reflected the goodwill impairment in
    2009 and had no impact to tangible equity. Tangible book value
    per share also declined as a result of the issuance of
    305.7 million common shares in 2009, through two common
    stock offerings and three discretionary equity issuance
    programs, at an average net proceeds of $3.71 per share.

BUSINESS
    SEGMENT DISCUSSION

Overview

This section reviews financial performance from a business
    segment perspective and should be read in conjunction with the
    Discussion of Results of Operations, Note 27 of the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements, and other sections for a
    full understanding of our consolidated financial performance.

We have five major business segments: Retail and Business
    Banking, Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Auto
    Finance and Dealer Services (AFDS), and the Private Financial
    Group (PFG). A Treasury/Other function includes other
    unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense. For each
    of our business segments, we expect the combination of our
    business model and exceptional service to provide a competitive
    advantage that supports revenue and earnings growth. Our
    business model emphasizes the delivery of a complete set of
    banking products and services offered by larger banks, but
    distinguished by local decision-making regarding the pricing and
    offering of these products.

Funds
    Transfer Pricing

We use a centralized funds transfer pricing (FTP) methodology to
    attribute appropriate net interest income to the business
    segments. The Treasury/Other business segment charges (credits)
    an internal cost of funds for assets held in (or pays for
    funding provided by) each business segment. The FTP rate is
    based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable
    duration assets (or liabilities), and includes an estimate for
    the cost of liquidity (“liquidity premium”). Deposits
    of an indeterminate maturity receive an FTP credit based on a
    combination of vintage-based average lives and replicating
    portfolio pool rates. Other assets, liabilities, and



capital are charged (credited) with a four-year moving average
    FTP rate. The intent of the FTP methodology is to eliminate all
    interest rate risk from the business segments by providing
    matched duration funding of assets and liabilities. The result
    is to centralize the financial impact, management, and reporting
    of interest rate and liquidity risk in the Treasury/Other
    function where it can be monitored and managed. The denominator
    in net interest margin calculation has been modified to add the
    amount of net funds provided by each business segment for all
    periods presented.

In 2009, a comprehensive review of our FTP methodology resulted
    in changes to various assumptions, including liquidity premiums.
    FTP rates charged to business segments holding commercial loans,
    and credited to segments holding indeterminate maturity and time
    deposits, were impacted most. Business segment financial
    performance for 2009 reflect the methodology changes, however,
    financial performance for 2008 was not restated to reflect these
    changes as the changes for that year were not material. The
    impact of this methodology change to 2009 financial performance
    was a $291.1 million increase in the net interest margin
    for Treasury/Other compared with results under the previous
    methodology, and an aggregate decrease to the net interest
    margin of the other five business segments by the same amount.
    As a result of this change, business segment performance for net
    interest income comparisons between 2009 and 2008 are affected.

Fee
    Sharing

Our business segments operate in cooperation to provide products
    and services to our customers. Revenue is recorded in the
    business segment responsible for the related product or service.
    Fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to
    other business segments involved in selling to or providing
    service to customers. The most significant revenues for which
    fee sharing is recorded relate to customer derivatives and
    brokerage services, which are recorded by PFG and shared
    primarily with Retail and Business Banking and Commercial
    Banking. Results of operations for the business segments reflect
    these fee sharing allocations.

Expense
    Allocation

Business segment results are determined based upon our
    management reporting system, which assigns balance sheet and
    income statement items to each of the business segments. The
    process is designed around our organizational and management
    structure and, accordingly, the results derived are not
    necessarily comparable with similar information published by
    other financial institutions.

The management accounting process used to develop the business
    segment reporting utilized various estimates and allocation
    methodologies to measure the performance of the business
    segments. Expenses are allocated to business segments using a
    two-phase approach. The first phase consists of measuring and
    assigning unit costs (activity-based costs) to activities
    incident to product origination and servicing. These
    activity-based costs are then extended, based on volumes, with
    the resulting amount allocated to business segments which own
    the related products. The second phase consists of the
    allocation of overhead costs to all five business segments from
    Treasury/Other. During 2009, we implemented a full-allocation
    methodology, where all Treasury/Other expenses, except those
    related to servicing Franklin assets, reported “Significant
    Items” (excluding the goodwill impairment), and a small
    residual of other unallocated expenses, are allocated to the
    other five business segments. Prior to this implementation, only
    certain expenses were allocated to the five business segments.
    Business segment financial performance for 2009 reflect the
    implementation, however, financial performance for 2008 was not
    restated due to impracticability. As a result of this change,
    business segment performance comparisons for noninterest expense
    between 2009 and 2008 are affected.

Treasury/Other

The Treasury/Other function includes revenue and expense related
    to assets, liabilities, and equity not directly assigned or
    allocated to one of the five business segments. Assets include
    investment securities, bank owned life insurance, and the loans
    and OREO properties acquired through the 2009 first quarter
    Franklin restructuring. The financial impact associated with our
    FTP methodology, as described above, is also included.

Net interest income includes the impact of administering our
    investment securities portfolios and the net impact of
    derivatives used to hedge interest rate sensitivity. Noninterest
    income includes miscellaneous fee



income not allocated to other business segments such as bank
    owned life insurance income, and any investment securities and
    trading assets gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes
    certain corporate administrative, merger, and other
    miscellaneous expenses not allocated to other business segments.
    The provision for income taxes for the business segments is
    calculated at a statutory 35% tax rate, though our overall
    effective tax rate is lower. As a result, Treasury/Other
    reflects a credit for income taxes representing the difference
    between the lower actual effective tax rate and the statutory
    tax rate used to allocate income taxes to the business segments.

Net
    Income by Business Segment

We reported a net loss of $3,094.2 million during 2009.
    This compared with a net loss of $113.8 million during
    2008. The segregation of net income by business segment for 2009
    and 2008 is presented in the following table:

Retail
    and Business Banking

(This section should be read in conjunction with Significant
    Items 1 and 2.)

Objectives,
    Strategies, and Priorities

Our Retail and Business Banking segment provides traditional
    banking products and services to consumer and small business
    customers located in our 11 operating regions within the six
    states of Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Indiana, West Virginia,
    and Kentucky. It provides these services through a banking
    network of over 600 branches, and approximately 1,300 ATMs,
    along with internet and telephone banking channels. It also
    provides certain services on a limited basis outside of these
    six states, such as mortgage banking. Retail products and
    services include home equity loans and

lines-of-credit,

first mortgage loans, direct installment loans, small business
    loans, personal and business deposit products, treasury
    management products, as well as sales of investment and
    insurance services. At December 31, 2009, Retail and
    Business Banking accounted for 39% and 71% of consolidated loans
    and leases and deposits, respectively.

The Retail and Business Banking strategy is to focus on building
    a deeper relationship with our customers by providing an
    exceptional service experience. This focus on service involves
    continued investments in

state-of-the-art

platform technology in our branches, award-winning retail and
    business websites for our customers, extensive development of
    employees, and internal processes that empower our local bankers
    to serve our customers.

    versus 2008

Retail and Business Banking reported a net loss of
    $22.9 million in 2009, compared with net income of
    $226.9 million in 2008.

The most notable factor contributing to this $249.8 million
    decrease was a $307.1 million increase to the provision for
    credit losses, reflecting: (a) the continued economic
    weaknesses in our markets, (b) an increase of commercial
    reserves resulting from credit actions taken during 2009

(see
    “2009 Commercial Loan Portfolio Review and Actions”
    section located within the “Commercial Credit” section
    for additional information),

and (c) a
    $244.1 million increase in NCOs. Our consumer loan NCOs
    increased $123.9 million, primarily reflecting:
    (a) the sale of underperforming mortgage loans that were
    written down to their fair value prior to sale, (b) a more
    conservative position regarding the timing of loss recognition
    in our residential mortgage portfolio, and (c) the higher
    unemployment rate, particularly in our Michigan and northern
    Ohio markets. The overall economic slowdown also impacted our
    commercial loan portfolio NCO performance as NCOs increased
    $120.2 million. The impact to net income resulting from the
    increase in the provision for credit losses was partially offset
    by a $134.5 million reduction in provision for income taxes
    expense reflecting the net loss during 2009.

Net interest income decreased $59.8 million, or 6%,
    primarily reflecting a 46 basis point decline in net
    interest margin. The net interest margin decline primarily
    reflected the previously discussed FTP methodology



change. Other factors contributing to the decline in net
    interest margin included a reduction in loan net interest
    income, resulting from significant declines in interest rates,
    and a $30.1 million reduction related to MSR hedging.
    Partially offsetting these decreases were: (a) lower market
    interest rates, (b) $1.6 billion increase in average
    consumer deposit balances, (c) decreases in our funding
    costs for nonearning assets, and (d) an increase in
    allocated equity, resulting in a higher funding credit.

The $1.0 billion decline in total average loans and leases
    reflected $0.7 billion decrease in average residential
    mortgages, resulting from the impact of loan sales. Although
    mortgage originations increased 39%, the majority of our
    fixed-rate originations were sold in the secondary market, as is
    our practice. The $0.4 billion decrease in average
    commercial loans, primarily reflected: (a) substantially
    higher commercial loan NCOs, and (b) lower loan origination
    production when compared with 2008, particularly in our CRE
    portfolio reflecting our planned efforts to shrink this
    portfolio.

Average total deposits increased $1.7 billion, or 6%,
    primarily reflecting increased sales efforts throughout 2009,
    particularly in our money market deposit products, as deposit
    growth has been a strategic priority for us for the year.
    Additionally, the number of DDA households increased 3%,
    primarily reflecting the same sales efforts. Period-end balances
    for total core deposits increased in 10 of our 11 regions.

Noninterest income increased $105.6 million, or 26%,
    primarily reflecting a $102.5 million increase in mortgage
    banking income. The increase to mortgage banking income
    primarily reflected a $57.5 million increase in origination
    and secondary marketing fees as a result of a 39% increase in
    mortgage originations, as well as a $57.3 million
    improvement of MSR valuation, net of hedging. Additionally,
    electronic banking income increased $9.8 million, primarily
    reflecting an increased number of deposit accounts and
    transaction volumes, as well as additional third-party
    processing fees. These increases were partially offset by an
    $11.1 million decline in service charges on deposit
    accounts, primarily reflecting lower consumer nonsufficient
    funds and overdraft fees, partially offset by higher commercial
    service charges. During the current economic environment,
    customers have improved the management of their deposit
    balances, thus resulting in fewer overdraft instances.

Noninterest expense increased $123.1 million. This increase
    reflected a $41.7 million increase in deposit and other
    insurance expense as the comparable year-ago period’s
    expense was substantially offset by an FDIC insurance assessment
    credit that has since been fully utilized, and a
    $19.3 million increase in OREO and foreclosure expense, as
    a result of higher levels of problem assets, as well as loss
    mitigation activities. Additionally, indirect allocated expenses
    increased $92.4 million as a result of the previously
    discussed changes in our process for allocating corporate
    overhead. These increases were partially offset by a
    $26.2 million decrease in personnel expense resulting from
    a 7% reduction average full-time equivalent employees, as well
    as a reduction in, or elimination of, incentive plan payouts.
    Also, several other expense categories, such as printing and
    supplies expense and travel expense, declined as a result of the
    implementation of expense reduction initiatives.

    vs. 2007

Retail and Business Banking reported net income of
    $226.9 million in 2008, compared with net income of
    $215.0 million in 2007. The $11.9 million increase was
    driven by the net positive impact of the Sky Financial
    acquisition on July 1, 2007. The acquisition increased net
    interest income, noninterest income, noninterest expense,
    average total loans and average total deposits from the prior
    year. The positive impact of the Sky Financial acquisition was
    partially offset by a $171.0 million increase in provision
    for credit losses. This increase was largely due to a
    $58.0 million increase in NCOs, and a $129 million
    increase in NALs compared with the prior year-end. The increase
    in both NCOs and NALs reflected the impact of the overall
    weakened economy across all of our regions.



Commercial
    Banking

Objectives,
    Strategies, and Priorities

The Commercial Banking segment provides a variety of banking
    products and services to customers within our primary banking
    markets that generally have larger credit exposures and sales
    revenues compared with our Retail and Business Banking
    customers. Commercial Banking products include commercial loans,
    international trade, cash management, leasing, interest rate
    protection products, capital market alternatives, 401(k) plans,
    and mezzanine investment capabilities. Our Commercial Banking
    team also serves customers that specialize in equipment leasing,
    as well as serving the commercial banking needs of government
    entities,

not-for-profit

organizations, and large corporations. Commercial bankers
    personally deliver these products and services by developing
    leads through community involvement, referrals from other
    professionals, and targeted prospect calling.

The Commercial Banking strategy is to focus on building a deeper
    relationship with our customers by providing an exceptional
    service experience. This focus on service requires continued
    investments in technology for our product offerings, websites
    for our customers, extensive development of employees, and
    internal processes that empower our local bankers to serve our
    customers better.

    vs. 2008

Commercial Banking reported a net loss of $130.2 million in
    2009, compared with net income of $104.4 million in 2008.
    The decline reflected a $257.1 million increase to the
    provision for credit losses. This increase to the provision for
    credit losses reflected: (a) the continued economic
    weaknesses in our markets, (b) an increase of commercial
    reserves resulting from credit actions taken during 2009

(see
    “2009 Commercial Loan Portfolio Review and Actions”
    section located within the “Commercial Credit” section
    for additional information),

and
    (c) $186.2 million increase in NCOs, again reflecting
    the continued impact of the economic conditions on our
    commercial borrowers. As NALs have continued to grow, we built
    our loan loss reserves. NALs increased $150 million,
    reflecting our more conservative approach in identifying and
    classifying emerging problem credits. In many cases, commercial
    loans were placed on nonaccrual status even though the loan was
    less than 30 days past due for both principal and interest
    payments. The impact to net income resulting from the increase
    in the provision for credit losses was partially offset by a
    $126.3 million reduction



in provision for income taxes expense reflecting the net loss
    during 2009. Although we expect our commercial portfolio will
    remain under pressure, we believe that the risks in our loan
    portfolios are manageable.

Net interest income decreased $104.0 million, or 33%,
    primarily reflecting a 113 basis point decline in net
    interest margin, and a $0.2 billion decline in average
    earning assets, partially offset by a $0.9 billion decline
    in average interest-bearing liabilities. The net interest margin
    decline primarily reflected the previously discussed FTP
    methodology change. Other factors contributing to the decline in
    net interest margin included a reduction in loan net interest
    income, resulting from significant declines in interest rates
    and lower average total loans, as well as a $150 million
    increase in NALs.

The decline in average earning assets primarily reflected a
    $0.2 billion decline in total average loans and leases, and
    included a $0.5 billion decrease in average CRE loans,
    partially offset by a $0.3 billion increase in total
    average C&I loans. These changes reflected the impact of
    reclassifications in 2009 of CRE loans to C&I loans, as
    well as the impact of substantially higher charge-offs in 2009,
    the Franklin restructuring, and lower loan origination
    production compared with 2008 reflecting, in part, our planned
    efforts to shrink the CRE portfolio.

Total average interest-bearing liabilities declined
    $0.9 billion, and included a $1.0 billion decline in
    noncore deposits and other sweep product balances. This decline
    reflected a $0.5 billion decline in public fund deposit
    balances resulting from a managed decline in this product. Also,
    throughout 2009, a migration of money-market account, time
    deposit, and other sweep product balances into demand deposit
    accounts occurred due to lower market rates and the increased
    FDIC insurance coverage provided to demand deposit accounts.

Noninterest income decreased $3.7 million, or 4%, primarily
    reflecting: (a) $5.7 million decrease in derivative
    income due to a decline in demand for interest rate swap
    products, (b) $1.6 million decrease in derivative
    trading income, (c) $1.3 million decrease in
    international and foreign exchange income,
    (d) $1.2 million decrease in loan syndication fee
    income, (e) $1.1 million decrease in mezzanine income,
    and (f) $2.7 million decline in operating lease income
    as lease originations were recorded as direct finance leases
    rather than operating leases effective with the 2009 second
    quarter. These decreases were partially offset by:
    (a) $5.5 million increase in loan commitment fee
    income reflecting higher unfunded commitment loan fees, and
    (b) $4.2 million increase in service charges on
    deposit accounts, reflecting pricing initiatives implemented
    during the first half of 2009.

Noninterest expense declined $3.9 million, and reflected:
    (a) $9.4 million decrease in personnel expense
    resulting from a reduction in average full-time equivalent
    employees, as well as significantly reduced incentive payouts,
    partially offset by a decrease in deferred salary expense due to
    decreased loan production; (b) $3.2 million decrease
    in overhead allocation as a result of the previously discussed
    changes in our process for allocating corporate overhead;
    (c) $3.2 million reduction in travel, business
    development and marketing as a result of the implementation of
    several expense reduction initiatives; and
    (d) $2.5 million decrease in operating lease expense
    reflecting the change in accounting for lease originations
    effective with the 2009 second quarter as described above. These
    decreases were partially offset by a $8.3 million increase
    in deposit and other insurance expense as a result of the
    comparable year-ago period’s expense was offset by an FDIC
    insurance assessment credit that has since been fully utilized,
    and a $4.8 million increase in OREO and foreclosure
    expense, as a result of higher levels of problem assets, as well
    as loss mitigation activities.

    vs. 2007

Commercial Banking reported net income of $104.4 million in
    2008, compared with net income of $129.5 million in 2007.
    The $25.2 million decline included a $107.5 million
    increase in provision for credit losses. This increase was
    largely due to a $67.0 million increase in NCOs, and a
    $115 million increase in NALs compared with the prior
    year-end. The increase in both NCOs and NALs reflected the
    overall economic weakness across our regions. The increase to
    provision for credit losses was partially offset by the net
    positive impact of the Sky Financial acquisition on July 1,
    2007. The acquisition increased net interest income, noninterest
    income, noninterest expense, average total loans and average
    total deposits from the prior year.



Commercial
    Real Estate

Objectives,
    Strategies, and Priorities

Our Commercial Real Estate segment serves professional real
    estate developers or other customers with real estate project
    financing needs within our primary banking markets. Commercial
    Real Estate products and services include CRE loans, cash
    management, interest rate protection products, and capital
    market alternatives. Commercial Real Estate bankers personally
    deliver these products and services by relationships with
    developers in our footprint who are recognized as the most
    experienced, well-managed and well-capitalized, and are capable
    of operating in all phases of the real estate cycle
    (“top-tier developers”); leading through community
    involvement; and referrals from other professionals.

The Commercial Real Estate strategy is to focus on building a
    deeper relationship with top-tier developers within our
    geographic footprint. Our local expertise of the customers,
    market, and products, gives us a competitive advantage and
    supports revenue growth in our footprint. Our strategy is to
    continue to expand the relationships of our current customer
    base and to attract new, profitable business with top-tier
    developers in our footprint.

    $618.2 million in 2009, compared with a net loss of
    $20.6 million in 2008. The decline primarily reflected a
    $835.0 million increase to the provision for credit losses
    reflecting: (a) the continued economic weaknesses in our
    markets, (b) an increase of commercial reserves resulting
    from credit actions taken during 2009

(see “2009
    Commercial Loan Portfolio Review and Actions” section
    located within the “Commercial Credit” section for
    additional information),

and (c) a $563.9 million
    increase in NCOs, again reflecting the continued impact of the
    economic conditions on our commercial borrowers. As NALs
    continued to grow, we built our loan loss reserves. NALs
    increased $583 million, reflecting our more conservative
    approach in identifying and classifying emerging problem
    credits. In many cases, commercial loans were placed on
    nonaccrual status even though the loan was less than
    30 days past due for both principal and interest payments.
    The impact to net income resulting from the increase in the
    provision for credit losses was partially offset by a
    $321.8 million reduction in provision for



income taxes expense reflecting the net loss during 2009.
    Although we expect our CRE portfolio will remain under pressure,
    we believe that the risks in our loan portfolios are manageable.

Net interest income decreased $68.0 million, or 34%,
    reflecting a 94 basis point decrease in net interest
    margin, partially offset by a $0.3 billion, or 4%, increase
    in average earning assets. The net interest margin decline
    primarily reflected the previously discussed FTP methodology
    change. Other factors contributing to the decline in net
    interest margin included a reduction in loan net interest
    income, resulting from significant declines in interest rates,
    as well as a significant increase in NALs, which increased to
    $994.2 million at December 31, 2009.

The $0.3 billion increase in total average earning assets
    reflected a $0.3 billion increase in total average
    commercial loans reflecting significant growth in this portfolio
    throughout 2008 as quarterly average balances grew
    $1.2 billion, or 16%, between the 2008 first quarter and
    the 2009 first quarter. However, since the 2009 first quarter,
    average balances have decreased $0.5 billion, or 6%,
    reflecting our planned efforts to shrink the CRE portfolio.

Noninterest income decreased $11.7 million, or 88%,
    primarily reflecting: (a) $5.1 million decrease in
    derivative income due to a decline in demand for interest rate
    swap products, (b) $4.3 million decrease in mezzanine
    lending income, resulting from lower participation gains, and
    (c) $2.3 million increase in interest rate swap losses.

Noninterest expense increased $4.8 million, or 15%,
    reflecting: (a) $5.0 million increase in allocated
    overhead as a result of the previously discussed changes in our
    process for allocating corporate overhead, and
    (b) $4.8 million increase in OREO and foreclosure
    expense, as a result of higher levels of problem assets, as well
    as loss mitigation activities. These increases were partially
    offset by: (a) $2.5 million decrease in personnel
    expense resulting from a 6% reduction in full-time equivalent
    employees, and (b) $2.4 million decrease in fees and
    commissions related to the reduced mezzanine lending activity
    mentioned above. In addition, various other expense categories
    declined as a result of the implementation of several expense
    reduction initiatives, specifically travel and business
    development expenses.

    vs. 2007

Commercial Real Estate Banking reported a net loss of
    $20.6 million in 2008, compared with a net loss of
    $6.4 million in 2007. The $14.2 million decline
    included a $70.4 million increase in provision for credit
    losses reflecting a $6.0 million increase in NCOs, and a
    $280 million increase in NALs compared with the prior
    year-end. The increase in NCOs and NALs reflected the overall
    economic weakness across our regions, and was centered in the
    single family home builder industry. The increase to provision
    for credit losses was partially offset by the net positive
    impact of the Sky Financial acquisition on July 1, 2007.
    The acquisition increased net interest income, noninterest
    income, noninterest expense, average total loans and average
    total deposits from the prior year.

Auto
    Finance and Dealer Services (AFDS)

(This section should be read in conjunction with the
    “Automotive Industry” discussion located within the
    “Commercial Credit” section.)

Objectives,
    Strategies, and Priorities

Our AFDS business segment provides a variety of banking products
    and services to approximately 2,200 automotive dealerships
    within our primary banking markets. During the first quarter of
    2009, AFDS discontinued lending activities in Arizona, Florida,
    Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Also, all lease origination
    activities were discontinued during the 2008 fourth quarter.
    AFDS finances the purchase of automobiles by customers at the
    automotive dealerships; finances dealerships’ new and used
    vehicle inventories, land, buildings, and other real estate
    owned by the dealership; finances dealership working capital
    needs; and provides other banking services to the automotive
    dealerships and their owners. Competition from the financing
    divisions of automobile manufacturers and from other financial
    institutions is intense. AFDS’



production opportunities are directly impacted by the general
    automotive sales business, including programs initiated by
    manufacturers to enhance and increase sales directly. We have
    been in this line of business for over 50 years.

The AFDS strategy focuses on developing relationships with the
    dealership through its finance department, general manager, and
    owner. An underwriter who understands each local region makes
    loan decisions, though we prioritize maintaining pricing
    discipline over market share.

    vs. 2008

AFDS reported a net loss of $1.0 million in 2009, compared
    with net income of $10.7 million in 2008. This
    $11.6 million decline reflected a $22.2 million
    increase to the provision for credit losses due to reserve
    building necessary due to the continued economic and automobile
    industry-related weaknesses, as well as a $2.1 million
    increase in NCOs that also reflected the continued economic
    weaknesses in our markets. Although total NCOs increased from
    the comparable year-ago period, automobile loan and lease NCOs
    in the second-half of 2009 declined 26%, compared with the
    first-half of 2009. Also, delinquency levels have improved from
    the year-ago period. At December 31, 2009, the ALLL as a
    percentage of total loans and leases increased to 1.77% compared
    with 0.84% at December 31, 2008. Performance of this
    portfolio on both an absolute and relative basis continues to be
    consistent with our views regarding the underlying quality of
    the portfolio and we expect

flat-to-improved

performance going forward.

Net interest income decreased $7.2 million, or 5%, to
    $142.0 million, reflecting a $1.0 billion decrease in
    average loans and leases. The decrease in average loans and
    leases reflected: (a) the sale of $1.0 billion of
    automobile loans at the end of March 2009; (b) continued
    run-off in the automobile lease portfolio; and (c) lower
    loan originations, primarily from exited markets. Total loan
    originations were $1.6 billion in 2009 ($1.5 billion
    from our primary banking markets) compared with
    $2.2 billion in 2008 ($1.4 billion from our primary banking
    markets). Partially offsetting the impact of these declining
    balances was a 24 basis point improvement in the net
    interest margin to 2.73% from 2.49%. Effective January 1,
    2010, loan balances will reflect the inclusion of approximately
    $0.8 billion of automobile loans previously transferred to
    a trust in a securitization transaction.

(See “a”
    above and Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements).

Noninterest income (excluding operating lease income of
    $51.8 million in 2009, and $39.8 million in
    2008) declined $10.5 million, and included a
    $5.9 million nonrecurring loss from the previously
    mentioned $1.0 billion sale of loans in 2009. In addition,
    fee income from the sale of Huntington Plus loans declined



$2.9 million as this program was discontinued in the 2008
    fourth quarter, servicing income decreased $0.4 million due
    to declines in underlying serviced loan portfolios, and fees
    associated with customers exercising their purchase option on
    leased vehicles declined $0.3 million. Servicing income is
    expected to decline in 2010 as a result of the consolidation on
    January 1, 2010, of the automobile sale transaction,
    previously mentioned.

(See Note 7 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements).

Noninterest expense (excluding operating lease expense of
    $43.4 million in 2009, and $31.3 million in
    2008) decreased $22.1 million. This decline reflected:
    (a) $22.4 million reduction in losses associated with
    sales of vehicles returned at the end of their lease terms due
    to an improvement in used vehicle values combined with a decline
    in the number of vehicles being returned, (b) a
    $2.1 million decline in residual value insurance costs as
    all residual value insurance policies were terminated in the
    2008 fourth quarter, and (c) a $2.8 million decline in
    personnel costs. Personnel costs, as well as various other
    expenses, have declined primarily as a result of expense
    reduction initiatives that began in the second half of 2008 and
    continued into 2009. A majority of these reduction initiatives
    involved discontinuing lending activities outside of our primary
    banking markets. Partially offsetting these declines was an
    $8.5 million increase in corporate and other overhead
    expenses as a result of the previously discussed changes in our
    process for allocating corporate overhead.

Net automobile operating lease income decreased
    $0.1 million and consisted of a $12.0 million increase
    in noninterest income, offset by a $12.1 million increase
    in noninterest expense. These increases primarily reflected the
    increase in average operating lease balances, which resulted
    from all automobile lease originations since the 2007 fourth
    quarter being recorded as operating leases. However, the
    automobile operating lease portfolio and related income will
    decline in the future as all lease origination activities were
    discontinued during the 2008 fourth quarter.

    vs. 2007

AFDS reported net income of $10.7 million during 2008,
    compared with net income of $46.9 million in 2007. This
    decline primarily reflected a $38.4 million increase to the
    provision for credit losses resulting from the continuing
    economic and automobile industry related weaknesses in our
    regions, as well as declines in values of used vehicles, which
    have resulted in lower recovery rates on sales of repossessed
    vehicles.

    vs. 2008

PFG reported a net loss of $5.5 million in 2009, compared
    with net income of $46.2 million in 2008. The decline
    reflected the negative impact of several items outside of normal
    business activities. These items included:
    (a) $28.9 million goodwill impairment charge recorded
    during 2009

(see “Goodwill” discussion located
    within the “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of
    Significant Estimates” for additional information;

(b) $20.1 million reduction in net interest income
    resulting from the methodology change discussed earlier, and
    (c) $7.4 million increase in noninterest expense as a
    result of the previously discussed overhead allocation
    methodology change. After adjusting for the goodwill impairment
    charge, and the related tax impact, PFG’s net income
    decreased $15.1 million.

Net interest income increased $2.7 million, or 4%,
    primarily as a result of the 62% growth in average deposits. A
    substantial portion of the deposit growth resulted from the
    introduction of three deposit products during 2009 designed as
    alternative options for lower yielding money market mutual
    funds. The new deposit products are: (a) the Huntington
    Conservative Deposit Account (HCDA), (b) the Huntington
    Protected Deposit Account (HPDA), and (c) the Bank Deposit
    Sweep Product (BDSP). These three accounts had balances in
    excess of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2009.

Provision for credit losses increased $44.2 million
    reflecting: (a) the continued economic weaknesses in our
    markets, particularly relating to the commercial portfolio,
    (b) an increase of commercial loan loss reserves



resulting from credit actions taken during 2009

(see
    “Commercial Loan Portfolio Review and Actions” section
    located within the “Commercial Credit” section for
    additional information),

and (c) a 119 basis point
    increase in total NCOs. The increase in NCOs included a
    significant increase in residential mortgage charge-offs, as a
    result of, among other actions, a more conservative position
    regarding the timing of loss recognition.

Noninterest income decreased $14.0 million, or 5%,
    primarily reflecting a $21.4 million decline in trust
    services revenue. The trust revenue decline reflected:
    (a) a market-driven $1.8 billion decline in average
    total assets under management, (b) reduced proprietary
    mutual fund fees due to the migration of proprietary
    money-market mutual fund balances to the new deposit products
    noted above, and (c) the impact of reduced money market
    yields. Also contributing to the reduction in noninterest income
    was a $3.9 million decline in derivatives income primarily
    as a result of reduced commercial loan originations. These
    decreases were partially offset by a $10.4 million
    improvement in equity investment portfolio valuation adjustments
    from a loss of $8.7 million in 2008 to a $1.7 million
    gain in 2009.

Noninterest expense increased $24.1 million, or 10%.
    Performance for 2009 was unfavorably impacted by the
    $28.9 million goodwill impairment charge and a
    $7.4 million increase in corporate and other overhead
    expenses as a result of the previously discussed changes in our
    process for allocating corporate overhead. After adjusting for
    the overhead allocation change and the goodwill impairment,
    noninterest expense declined $12.2 million. This net
    decline reflected reduced personnel expense of
    $16.8 million largely as a result of the implementation of
    several expense reduction initiatives, partially offset by an
    increase of $3.8 million in deposit and other insurance
    expense, as well as increased OREO losses.

    vs. 2007

PFG reported net income of $46.2 million in 2008, compared
    with $33.9 million in 2007. This increase primarily
    reflected the impact of the Sky Financial acquisition on
    July 1, 2007, and a $14.1 million improvement in the
    market value adjustments to the equity funds portfolio. These
    benefits were partially offset by: (a) $12.3 million
    increase in provision for credit losses resulting from a
    $6.7 million increase in NCOs primarily reflecting
    increased charge-offs in the home equity portfolio, and
    (b) a decrease in total period-end assets under management
    to $13.3 billion from $16.3 billion reflecting the
    impact of lower market values associated with the decline in the
    general economic and market conditions.

RESULTS
    FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER

Earnings
    Discussion

2009 fourth quarter results were a net loss of
    $369.7 million, or $0.56 per common share, compared with a
    net loss of $417.3 million, or $1.20 per common share, in
    the year-ago quarter. Significant items impacting 2009 fourth
    quarter performance included

(see table below)

:

•

$73.6 million pretax gain ($0.07 per common share) on the
    tender of $370.8 million of subordinated bank notes
    reflected in other noninterest expense.

•

$11.3 million ($0.02 per common share) benefit to provision
    for income taxes, representing a reduction to the previously
    established capital loss carry-forward valuation allowance.

Net
    Interest Income, Net Interest Margin, Loans and Average Balance
    Sheet

Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income decreased
    $3.4 million, or 1%, from the year-ago quarter. This
    reflected the unfavorable impact of a $0.7 billion, or 2%,
    decline in total average earning assets, partially offset by the
    favorable impact of a slight increase in the net interest margin
    to 3.19% from 3.18%. The decline in total average earning assets
    primarily reflected a $4.3 billion, or 10%, decline in
    average total loans and leases and a $0.8 billion, or 88%,
    decline in average trading assets, partially offset by a
    $4.4 billion, or 97%, increase in investment securities.

The following table details the $4.3 billion, or 10%,
    decrease in average loans and leases.

The decrease in average total loans and leases reflected:

$2.9 billion, or 12%, decrease in average total commercial
    loans. The $1.2 billion, or 9%, decline in average C&I
    loans reflected a general decline in borrowing as reflected in a
    decline in

line-of-credit

utilization, including significant reductions in

line-of-credit

utilization in our automobile dealer floorplan exposure,
    charge-off activity, and the 2009 first quarter Franklin
    restructuring, partially offset by the impact of the 2009
    reclassifications. The $1.8 billion, or 17%, decrease in
    average CRE loans reflected a combination of factors, including
    our planned efforts to shrink this portfolio through payoffs and
    paydowns, as well as the impact of charge-offs and the 2009
    reclassifications.



•

$1.4 billion, or 8%, decrease in average total consumer
    loans. This primarily reflected a $1.2 billion, or 27%,
    decline in average automobile loans and leases due to the 2009
    first quarter securitization of $1.0 billion of automobile
    loans, as well as the continued runoff of the automobile lease
    portfolio. The $0.3 billion, or 7%, decline in average
    residential mortgages reflected the impact of loan sales, as
    well as the continued refinance of portfolio loans and the
    related increased sale of fixed-rate originations, partially
    offset by additions related to the 2009 first quarter Franklin
    restructuring. Average home equity loans were little changed as
    lower origination volume was offset by slower runoff experience
    and slightly higher line utilization. The increased line usage
    continued to be associated with higher quality customers taking
    advantage of the low interest rate environment.

Average total investment securities increased $4.4 billion,
    or 97%, reflecting the deployment of the cash from core deposit
    growth and the proceeds from capital actions.

(See
    “Capital / Capital Adequacy” section)

.
    Average trading account securities declined $0.8 billion,
    or 88%, from the year-ago quarter, due to the reduction in the
    use of securities to hedge MSRs.

The following table details the $2.6 billion, or 7%,
    increase in average total deposits.

The increase in average total deposits from the year-ago quarter
    reflected:

•

$4.5 billion, or 14%, growth in average total core
    deposits, primarily reflecting increased sales efforts and
    initiatives for deposit accounts.

Partially offset by:

•

A $0.7 billion, or 51%, decrease in average other domestic
    deposits of $250,000 or more and a $0.7 billion, or 23%,
    decline in brokered deposits and negotiable CDs, primarily
    reflecting the reduction of noncore funding sources.

Provision
    for Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses in the 2009 fourth quarter was
    $894.0 million, up $171.4 million from the year-ago
    quarter. The current quarter’s provision for credit losses
    exceeded NCOs by $449.2 million.

The $177.4 million increase in total noninterest income
    reflected:

•

$124.5 million reduction in securities losses as the
    current quarter reflected a $2.6 million loss compared with
    a $127.1 million loss in the year-ago quarter due to OTTI
    adjustments on certain investment securities.

•

$31.4 million increase in mortgage banking income,
    reflecting a $24.3 million net improvement in MSR valuation
    and hedging activity, as well as a $9.3 million increase in
    origination and secondary marketing income as originations in
    the current quarter were 56% higher.

•

$17.4 million increase in other income, reflecting
    $12.8 million increase in swap derivatives trading income
    due primarily to $7.3 million of losses recorded in the
    prior year quarter, as well as improvements in equity gains and
    higher gains on SBA loan sales.

•

$2.3 million, or 10%, increase in electronic banking income.

The $67.5 million decline reflected:

•

$73.6 million gain on the early extinguishment of debt in
    the current quarter.

•

$16.1 million, or 8%, decline in personnel costs,
    reflecting a decline in salaries and lower benefits and
    commission expense. Full-time equivalent staff declined 6% from
    the year-ago period.

•

$15.8 million, or 48%, decline in other expense primarily
    due to $12.5 million lower automobile lease residual losses
    as used vehicle prices improved, as well as $4.1 million
    lower franchise and other taxes.

Partially offset by:

•

$15.0 million increase in deposit and other insurance
    expense primarily due to higher FDIC insurance costs as premiums
    rates increased and the level of deposits grew.

•

$10.3 million increase in OREO and foreclosure expense,
    reflecting higher levels of problem assets, as well as loss
    mitigation activities.

•

$8.7 million, or 53%, increase in professional services,
    reflecting higher consulting and collection-related expenses.

•

$5.2 million, or 16%, increase in outside data processing
    and other services, primarily reflecting portfolio servicing
    fees now paid to Franklin resulting from the first quarter
    restructuring of this relationship.

•

$3.3 million, or 14%, increase in net occupancy expenses,
    as the year-ago quarter reflected property asset valuation gains.



Income
    Taxes

(This
    section should be read in conjunction with Significant
    Item 7.)

The provision for income taxes in the 2009 fourth quarter was a
    benefit of $228.3 million. The effective tax rate for the
    2009 fourth quarter was a tax benefit of 38.2%. At
    December 31, 2009, we had a net federal deferred tax asset
    of $480.5 million, and a net state deferred tax asset of
    $0.8 million. Based on our ability to offset a portion of
    the net deferred tax asset against taxable income in prior years
    and level of our forecast of future taxable income, there was no
    impairment of the deferred tax asset at December 31, 2009.

Credit
    Quality

Credit quality performance in the 2009 fourth quarter continued
    to be negatively impacted by the sustained economic weakness in
    our Midwest markets, but there were signs of stabilization. As
    an example, there was an overall decline of $286.0 million,
    or 12%, in NPAs. Furthermore, the level of criticized and
    classified loans increased at a much lower rate than prior
    quarters.

NET
    CHARGE-OFFS (NCOs)

(This
    section should be read in conjunction with Significant
    Item 3.)

Total NCOs for the 2009 fourth quarter were $444.7 million,
    or an annualized 4.80% of average total loans and leases. NCOs
    in the year-ago quarter were $560.6 million, or an
    annualized 5.41%, including $423.3 million related to
    Franklin. Total non-Franklin-related commercial NCOs increased
    $279.3 million from the year-ago quarter. Total consumer
    NCOs increased $28.0 million.

Total C&I NCOs for the 2009 fourth quarter were
    $109.8 million, or an annualized 3.49%, down from
    $473.4 million, or an annualized 13.78% of related loans,
    in the year-ago quarter. C&I NCOs in the year-ago quarter
    included $423.3 million related to Franklin.
    Non-Franklin-related C&I NCOs increased $59.7 million
    compared with the year-ago quarter. Fourth quarter results were
    substantially impacted by individual charge-offs in excess of
    $5 million, as there was $39.5 million associated with
    the activity on five relationships. The specific circumstances
    of each occurrence were distinct to the relationship in
    question, but the impact of the economic conditions was the
    proximate cause for each. Primarily as a result of these larger
    individual charge-offs, there was a regional concentration of
    losses in our Northeast and Central Ohio regions. While there
    continues to be concern regarding the impact of the economic
    conditions on our commercial customers, the lower inflow of new
    nonaccruals and the significant decline in early stage
    delinquencies, compared with earlier 2009 levels, supports our
    outlook for improved performance in 2010.

Current quarter CRE NCOs were $258.1 million, or an
    annualized 12.21%, up from $38.4 million, or an annualized
    1.50% in the year-ago quarter. Retail projects and single family
    homebuilders continued to represent a significant portion, or
    73%, of the losses. Included in the retail portfolio results
    were $47.5 million of charge-offs associated with three
    projects. We continued our ongoing portfolio management efforts
    including obtaining updated appraisals on properties and
    assessing a project status within the context of market
    environment expectations. Historically we have thought of the
    single family homebuilder portfolio and retail portfolios as the
    highest risk segments, in that order. Based on the portfolio
    management processes, including charge-off activity over the
    past two and one half years, the credit issues in the single
    family homebuilder portfolio have been substantially addressed.
    The retail property portfolio remains more susceptible to the
    ongoing market disruption, but we also believe that the
    combination of prior charge-offs and existing reserve balances
    positions us well to make effective credit decisions in the
    future.

Total consumer NCOs in the current quarter were
    $76.8 million, or an annualized 1.91%, up from
    $48.8 million, or an annualized 1.12% of average total
    consumer loans in the year-ago quarter. The fourth quarter
    results represented a continuation of our loss mitigation
    programs and active loss recognition processes. This includes
    accounts in all stages of performance, including bankruptcy.

Residential mortgage NCOs were $17.8 million, or an
    annualized 1.61% of related average balances, up from
    $7.3 million, or an annualized 0.62% in the year-ago
    quarter. During the current quarter, we continued to



see positive trends in early-stage delinquencies, indicating
    that even with the economic stress on our customers, losses are
    expected to remain manageable.

Home equity NCOs in the 2009 fourth quarter were
    $35.8 million, or an annualized 1.89%. This was up from
    $19.2 million, or an annualized 1.02%, in the year-ago
    quarter. Although NCOs were higher compared with prior quarters,
    there continued to be a declining trend in the early-stage
    delinquency level in the home equity

line-of-credit

portfolio, supporting our longer-term positive view for home
    equity portfolio performance. The higher losses resulted from a
    significant increase in loss mitigation activity and short
    sales. We continue to believe that our more proactive loss
    mitigation strategies are in the best interest of both the
    company and our customers. While there has been a clear increase
    in the losses over the course of 2009, given the market
    conditions, performance remained within expectations.

Automobile loan and lease NCOs were $12.9 million, or an
    annualized 1.55%, down from $18.6 million, or an annualized
    1.64%, in the year-ago quarter. Performance of this portfolio on
    both an absolute and relative basis continued to be consistent
    with our views regarding the underlying quality of the
    portfolio. The level of delinquencies have improved compared
    with the year-ago period, supporting our view of

flat-to-improved

performance going forward.

NONACCRUAL
    LOANS (NAL) AND NONPERFORMING ASSETS (NPA)

Total NALs were $1,917.0 million at December 31, 2009,
    and represented 5.21% of total loans and leases. This was up
    $414.8 million, or 28%, from $1,502.1 million, or
    3.66% compared with December 31, 2008. The increase from
    the year-ago quarter primarily reflected increases in CRE and
    non-Franklin-related C&I NALs. These increases reflected
    the sustained economic weakness in our markets, particularly in
    our single family home builder and retail properties portfolio
    segments.

NPAs, which include NALs, were $2,058.1 million at
    December 31, 2009, and represented 5.57% of related assets.
    This was significantly higher than $1,636.6 million, or
    3.97% of related assets at the end of the year-ago period. The
    $421.4 million increase in NPAs from the end of the
    year-ago period reflected the $414.8 million increase in
    NALs.

The over

90-day

delinquent, but still accruing, ratio excluding loans guaranteed
    by the U.S. Government, was 0.40% at December 31,
    2009, down 6 basis points from a year-ago. On this same
    basis, the over

90-day

delinquency ratio for total consumer loans was 0.90% at
    December 31, 2009, up from 0.68% a year-ago.

ALLOWANCE
    FOR CREDIT LOSSES (ACL)

(This
    section should be in read in conjunction with Notes 1 and 8
    in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements).

In the 2009 fourth quarter we conducted a review of our ACL
    practices. Based on recent asset quality trends, coupled with a
    fragile economic outlook, the ACL was significantly increased,
    reflecting a 2009 fourth quarter provision for credit losses of
    $894.0 million, which was more than double the level of the
    2009 fourth quarter charge-offs. We experienced an increasing
    trend in charge-offs throughout 2009. The level of criticized
    loans, an indicator of possible losses, continued to increase
    through the fourth quarter, although the increases in the second
    half of 2009 were at a slower rate compared with the first half
    of 2009. While we did show a decline in the level of NPAs at
    December 31, 2009, the inflow of $494.6 million
    remained substantially higher than would be the case in a stable
    credit environment. Nevertheless, this was the lowest level of
    new NALs in five quarters. Based on these asset quality trends,
    in conjunction with a fragile economy particularly in our
    Midwest markets, the ACL was increased.

Much of the increase related to our CRE retail portfolio where
    higher vacancy rates, lower rents, and falling property values
    are of significant concern. Loss in the event of default on many
    classes of CRE properties has increased substantially throughout
    2009 and this is expected to continue into 2010.



Additionally, C&I customers have been suffering from the
    weak economy for several consecutive years and some of these
    customers no longer have the capital base to withstand
    protracted stress and, therefore, may not be able to comply with
    the original terms of their credit agreements.

In the 2009 fourth quarter, the provision for credit losses
    exceeded net charge-offs by $449.2 million, or 101%.

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT

The management of Huntington (the Company) is responsible for
    the financial information and representations contained in the
    consolidated financial statements and other sections of this
    report. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared
    in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
    the United States. In all material respects, they reflect the
    substance of transactions that should be included based on
    informed judgments, estimates, and currently available
    information. Management maintains a system of internal
    accounting controls, which includes the careful selection and
    training of qualified personnel, appropriate segregation of
    responsibilities, communication of written policies and
    procedures, and a broad program of internal audits. The costs of
    the controls are balanced against the expected benefits. During
    2009, the audit committee of the board of directors met
    regularly with Management, Huntington’s internal auditors,
    and the independent registered public accounting firm,
    Deloitte & Touche LLP, to review the scope of the
    audits and to discuss the evaluation of internal accounting
    controls and financial reporting matters. The independent
    registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have
    free access to, and meet confidentially with, the audit
    committee to discuss appropriate matters. Also, Huntington
    maintains a disclosure review committee. This committee’s
    purpose is to design and maintain disclosure controls and
    procedures to ensure that material information relating to the
    financial and operating condition of Huntington is properly
    reported to its chief executive officer, chief financial
    officer, internal auditors, and the audit committee of the board
    of directors in connection with the preparation and filing of
    periodic reports and the certification of those reports by the
    chief executive officer and the chief financial officer.

REPORT OF
    MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting for the
    Company, including accounting and other internal control systems
    that, in the opinion of Management, provide reasonable assurance
    that (1) transactions are properly authorized, (2) the
    assets are properly safeguarded, and (3) transactions are
    properly recorded and reported to permit the preparation of the
    financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States. Huntington’s
    management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, Management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

. Based on that
    assessment, Management believes that, as of December 31,
    2009, the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting is effective based on those criteria. The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009 has been audited by Deloitte &
    Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
    stated in their report appearing on the next page, which
    expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Huntington Bancshares Incorporated

Columbus, Ohio

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    Huntington Bancshares Incorporated and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Report of Management’s
    Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 of the Company and our report dated
    February 18, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    financial statements.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Huntington Bancshares Incorporated

Columbus, Ohio

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Huntington Bancshares Incorporated and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and
    the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2009. These
    consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    Huntington Bancshares Incorporated and subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2009 in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 18, 2010 expressed
    an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations

— Huntington Bancshares
    Incorporated (Huntington or the Company) is a multi-state
    diversified financial holding company organized under Maryland
    law in 1966 and headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. Through its
    subsidiaries, including its bank subsidiary, The Huntington
    National Bank (the Bank), Huntington is engaged in providing
    full-service commercial and consumer banking services, mortgage
    banking services, automobile financing, equipment leasing,
    investment management, trust services, brokerage services,
    customized insurance service programs, and other financial
    products and services. Huntington’s banking offices are
    located in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Indiana, West Virginia,
    and Kentucky. Selected financial service activities are also
    conducted in other states including: Auto Finance and Dealer
    Services offices in Nevada, New Jersey, and New York; Private
    Financial and Capital Markets Group offices in Florida; and
    Mortgage Banking offices in Maryland and New Jersey. Huntington
    Insurance offers retail and commercial insurance agency services
    in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana, and West Virginia.
    International banking services are available through the
    headquarters office in Columbus and a limited purpose office
    located in both the Cayman Islands and Hong Kong.

Basis of Presentation

— The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of Huntington and its
    majority-owned subsidiaries and are presented in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    (GAAP). All intercompany transactions and balances have been
    eliminated in consolidation. Companies in which Huntington holds
    more than a 50% voting equity interest or are a variable
    interest entity (VIE) in which Huntington absorbs the majority
    of expected losses are consolidated. Huntington evaluates VIEs
    in which it holds a beneficial interest for consolidation. VIEs
    are legal entities with insubstantial equity, whose equity
    investors lack the ability to make decisions about the
    entity’s activities, or whose equity investors do not have
    the right to receive the residual returns of the entity if they
    occur. VIEs in which Huntington does not absorb the majority of
    expected losses are not consolidated. For consolidated entities
    where Huntington holds less than a 100% interest, Huntington
    recognizes a minority interest liability (included in accrued
    expenses and other liabilities) for the equity held by others
    and minority interest expense (included in other long-term debt)
    for the portion of the entity’s earnings attributable to
    minority interests. Investments in companies that are not
    consolidated are accounted for using the equity method when
    Huntington has the ability to exert significant influence. Those
    investments in non-marketable securities for which Huntington
    does not have the ability to exert significant influence are
    generally accounted for using the cost method and are
    periodically evaluated for impairment. Investments in private
    investment partnerships are carried at fair value. Investments
    in private investment partnerships and investments that are
    accounted for under the equity method or the cost method are
    included in accrued income and other assets and
    Huntington’s proportional interest in the equity
    investments’ earnings are included in other non-interest
    income.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
    requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that
    significantly affect amounts reported in the financial
    statements. Huntington uses significant estimates and employs
    the judgments of management in determining the amount of its
    allowance for credit losses and income tax accruals and
    deferrals, in its fair value measurements of investment
    securities, derivatives, mortgage loans held for sale, mortgage
    servicing rights and in the evaluation of impairment of loans,
    goodwill, investment securities, and fixed assets. As with any
    estimate, actual results could differ from those estimates.
    Significant estimates are further discussed in the critical
    accounting policies included in Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform
    to the current year’s presentation.

Securities

— Securities purchased with the
    intention of recognizing short-term profits or which are
    actively bought and sold are classified as trading account
    securities and reported at fair value. The unrealized gains or
    losses on trading account securities are recorded in other
    non-interest income, except for gains and losses on trading
    account securities used to hedge the fair value of mortgage
    servicing rights, which are included in mortgage banking income.
    All other securities are classified as investment securities.
    Investment securities include securities designated as available
    for sale and non-marketable equity securities. Unrealized gains
    or losses on investment securities designated as available for
    sale are reported as a separate component of accumulated other
    comprehensive loss in the consolidated statement of changes in
    shareholders’ equity.



Declines in the value of debt and marketable equity securities
    that are considered

other-than-temporary

are recorded in non-interest income as securities losses.

Huntington evaluates its investment securities portfolio on a
    quarterly basis for indicators of

other-than-temporary

impairment (OTTI). This determination requires significant
    judgment. Huntington assesses whether OTTI has occurred when the
    fair value of a debt security is less than the amortized cost
    basis at the balance sheet date. Under these circumstances, OTTI
    is considered to have occurred (1) if Huntington intends to
    sell the security; (2) if it is more likely than not
    Huntington will be required to sell the security before recovery
    of its amortized cost basis; or (3) the present value of
    the expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire
    amortized cost basis. For securities that Huntington does not
    expect to sell or it is not more likely than not to be required
    to sell, the OTTI is separated into credit and noncredit
    components. The credit-related OTTI, represented by the expected
    loss in principal, is recognized in noninterest income, while
    noncredit-related OTTI is recognized in other comprehensive
    income (loss) (OCI). Noncredit-related OTTI results from other
    factors, including increased liquidity spreads and extension of
    the security. For securities which Huntington does expect to
    sell, all OTTI is recognized in earnings. Presentation of OTTI
    is made in the income statement on a gross basis with a
    reduction for the amount of OTTI recognized in OCI. Once an

other-than-temporary

impairment is recorded, when future cash flows can be reasonably
    estimated, future cash flows are re-allocated between interest
    and principal cash flows to provide for a level-yield on the
    security.

Securities transactions are recognized on the trade date (the
    date the order to buy or sell is executed). The amortized cost
    of sold securities is used to compute realized gains and losses.
    Interest and dividends on securities, including amortization of
    premiums and accretion of discounts using the effective interest
    method over the period to maturity, are included in interest
    income.

Non-marketable equity securities include stock acquired for
    regulatory purposes, such as Federal Home Loan Bank stock and
    Federal Reserve Bank stock. These securities are generally
    accounted for at cost and are included in investment securities.

Loans and Leases —

Loans and direct financing
    leases for which Huntington has the intent and ability to hold
    for the foreseeable future (at least 12 months), or until
    maturity or payoff, are classified in the balance sheet as loans
    and leases. Loans and leases are carried at the principal amount
    outstanding, net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees
    and costs and net of unearned income. Direct financing leases
    are reported at the aggregate of lease payments receivable and
    estimated residual values, net of unearned and deferred income.
    Interest income is accrued as earned using the interest method
    based on unpaid principal balances. Huntington defers the fees
    it receives from the origination of loans and leases, as well as
    the direct costs of those activities. Huntington also acquires
    loans at a premium and at a discount to their contractual
    values. Huntington amortizes loan discounts, loan premiums and
    net loan origination fees and costs on a level-yield basis over
    the estimated lives of the related loans.

Loans that Huntington has the intent to sell or securitize are
    classified as held for sale. Loans held for sale (excluding
    loans originated or acquired with the intent to sale) are
    carried at the lower of cost or fair value. The fair value
    option was elected for mortgage loans held for sale to
    facilitate hedging of the loans. Fair value is determined based
    on collateral value and prevailing market prices for loans with
    similar characteristics. Subsequent declines in fair value are
    recognized either as a charge-off or as non-interest income,
    depending on the length of time the loan has been recorded as
    held for sale. When a decision is made to sell a loan that was
    not originated or initially acquired with the intent to sell,
    the loan is reclassified into held for sale.

Residual values on leased automobiles and equipment are
    evaluated quarterly for impairment. Impairment of the residual
    values of direct financing leases is recognized by writing the
    leases down to fair value with a charge to other non-interest
    expense. Residual value losses arise if the expected fair value
    at the end of the lease term is less than the residual value
    recorded at original lease, net of estimated amounts
    reimbursable by the lessee. Future declines in the expected
    residual value of the leased equipment would result in expected
    losses of the leased equipment.



For leased equipment, the residual component of a direct
    financing lease represents the estimated fair value of the
    leased equipment at the end of the lease term. Huntington uses
    industry data, historical experience, and independent appraisals
    to establish these residual value estimates. Additional
    information regarding product life cycle, product upgrades, as
    well as insight into competing products are obtained through
    relationships with industry contacts and are factored into
    residual value estimates where applicable.

Commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans
    are generally placed on non-accrual status and stop accruing
    interest when principal or interest payments are 90 days or
    more past due or the borrower’s creditworthiness is in
    doubt or other reasons. A loan may remain in accruing status if
    it is sufficiently collateralized, which means the collateral
    covers the full repayment of principal and interest, and is in
    the process of active collection.

Management evaluates direct financing leases individually for
    impairment. Commercial loans are evaluated periodically for
    impairment. An allowance is established as a component of the
    allowance for loan and lease losses when, based upon current
    information and events, it is probable that all amounts due
    according to the contractual terms of the loan or lease will not
    be collected. The amount of the impairment is measured using the
    present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the
    loan’s or lease’s effective interest rate or, as a
    practical expedient, the observable market price of the loan or
    lease, or, the fair value of the collateral if the loan or lease
    is collateral dependent. When the present value of expected
    future cash flows is used, the effective interest rate is the
    contractual interest rate of the loan adjusted for any premium
    or discount. When the contractual interest rate is variable, the
    effective interest rate of the loan changes over time. Interest
    income is recognized on impaired loans using a cost recovery
    method unless the receipt of principal and interest as they
    become contractually due is not in doubt, such as in a troubled
    debt restructuring (TDR). TDRs of impaired loans that continue
    to perform under the restructured terms continue to accrue
    interest. Huntington does not have significant commitments to
    lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans have been
    modified as a TDR.

Consumer loans and leases are subject to mandatory charge-off
    based on specific criteria and are not classified as
    non-performing prior to being charged off. Huntington recently
    adjusted the timing of the loss recognition to ensure a
    conservative view of the value of the underlining real estate
    collateral. A charge-off on a residential mortgage loan is
    recorded when the loan has been foreclosed and the loan balance
    exceeds the fair value of the collateral.

(See Note 5
    for further information.)

A home equity charge-off occurs
    when it is determined that there is not sufficient equity in the
    loan to cover Huntington’s position. A write down in value
    occurs as determined by Huntington’s internal processes,
    with subsequent losses incurred upon final disposition. In the
    event the first mortgage is purchased to protect
    Huntington’s interests, the charge-off process is the same
    as residential mortgage loans described above.

For non-performing loans and leases, cash receipts are applied
    entirely against principal until the loan or lease has been
    collected in full, after which time any additional cash receipts
    are recognized as interest income. When, in management’s
    judgment, the borrower’s ability to make required interest
    and principal payments resumes and collectability is no longer
    in doubt, the loan or lease is returned to accrual status. When
    interest accruals are suspended, accrued interest income is
    reversed with current year accruals charged to earnings and
    prior year amounts generally charged-off as a credit loss.

Included within loans are $323 million of amounts due from
    borrowers which are in the form of lower floater bonds. The
    bonds are a long-term loan with a short-term adjustable interest
    rate, supported by a letter of credit from a Huntington. The
    bonds were obtained in 2009 in satisfaction of existing letter
    of credit draws to the same borrowers. Because the letters of
    credit on the bonds are with Huntington and Huntington can at
    anytime put the bonds back to the issuer and thereby convert the
    bond to a loan, the company classifies these instruments as
    loans.

Sold Loans and Leases

— For loan or lease sales
    with servicing retained, an asset is recorded for the right to
    service the loans sold, based on the fair value of the servicing
    rights.

Gains and losses on the loans and leases sold and servicing
    rights associated with loan and lease sales are determined when
    the related loans or leases are sold to either a securitization
    trust or third party. Fair values of the servicing rights are
    based on the present value of expected future cash flows from
    servicing the underlying loans, net of adequate compensation to
    service the loans. The present value of expected future cash



flows is determined using assumptions for market interest rates,
    ancillary fees, and prepayment rates. The servicing rights are
    recorded in accrued income and other assets in the consolidated
    balance sheets. Servicing revenues on mortgage and automobile
    loans are included in mortgage banking income and other
    non-interest income, respectively.

Allowance for Credit Losses

— The allowance for
    credit losses (ACL) reflects Management’s judgment as to
    the level of the ACL considered appropriate to absorb probable
    inherent credit losses. This judgment is based on the size and
    current risk characteristics of the portfolio, a review of
    individual loans and leases, historical and anticipated loss
    experience, and a review of individual relationships where
    applicable. External influences such as general economic
    conditions, economic conditions in the relevant geographic areas
    and specific industries, regulatory guidelines, and other
    factors are also assessed in determining the level of the
    allowance.

The determination of the allowance requires significant
    estimates, including the timing and amounts of expected future
    cash flows on impaired loans and leases, consideration of
    current economic conditions, and historical loss experience
    pertaining to pools of homogeneous loans and leases, all of
    which may be susceptible to change. The allowance is increased
    through a provision for credit losses that is charged to
    earnings, based on Management’s quarterly evaluation of the
    factors previously mentioned, and is reduced by charge-offs, net
    of recoveries, and the allowance associated with securitized or
    sold loans.

The ACL consists of two components, the transaction reserve,
    which includes specific reserves related to loans considered to
    be impaired and loans involved in troubled debt restructurings,
    and the economic reserve. The two components are more fully
    described below.

The transaction reserve component of the ACL includes both
    (a) an estimate of loss based on pools of commercial and
    consumer loans and leases with similar characteristics and
    (b) an estimate of loss based on an impairment review of
    each loan greater than $1 million. For commercial loans,
    the estimate of loss based on pools of loans and leases with
    similar characteristics is made through the use of a
    standardized loan grading system that is applied on an
    individual loan level and updated on a continuous basis. The
    reserve factors applied to these portfolios were developed based
    on internal credit migration models that track historical
    movements of loans between loan ratings over time and a
    combination of long-term average loss experience of our own
    portfolio and external industry data. In the case of more
    homogeneous portfolios, such as consumer loans and leases, the
    determination of the transaction reserve is based on reserve
    factors that include the use of forecasting models to measure
    inherent loss in these portfolios. Models and analyses are
    updated frequently to capture the recent behavioral
    characteristics of the subject portfolios, as well as any
    changes in loss mitigation or credit origination strategies.
    Adjustments to the reserve factors are made as needed based on
    observed results of the portfolio analytics.

The reserve incorporates our determination of the impact of
    risks associated with the general economic environment on the
    portfolio. During the 2009 fourth quarter, Management performed
    a review of our ACL practices. The review included an analysis
    of the adequacy of the ACL in light of current economic
    conditions, as well as expected future performance. Based on the
    results of the review, Huntington made the following
    enhancements:

•

Current market conditions, such as higher vacancy rates and
    lower rents, have driven commercial real estate values lower and
    caused loss given default (LGD) experience to rise significantly
    over the past year. Management believes that factors driving the
    higher losses will continue to be evident for at least the next
    18 to 24 months, making it necessary to develop cyclical
    LGD factors that are collateral specific and based in part on
    market projections.

•

Probability of Default (PD) factors have recently migrated
    higher for commercial and commercial real estate loans. Based on
    this change in market conditions, Management has increased the
    loss emergence time frame to 24 months from 12 months.

•

Management has redefined the general reserve in broader terms to
    incorporate: (a) current and likely market conditions along
    with an assessment of the potential impact of those
    conditions,(b) uncertainty



in the risk rating process, and (c) the impact of portfolio
    performance, portfolio composition, origination channels, and
    other factors.

•

PD factors were updated to include current delinquency status
    across all consumer portfolios.

Other Real Estate Owned

— Other real estate
    owned (OREO) is comprised principally of commercial and
    residential real estate properties obtained in partial or total
    satisfaction of loan obligations. OREO also includes government
    insured loans in the process of foreclosure. OREO obtained in
    satisfaction of a loan is recorded at the estimated fair value
    less anticipated selling costs based upon the property’s
    appraised value at the date of transfer, with any difference
    between the fair value of the property and the carrying value of
    the loan charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent
    changes in value are reported as adjustments to the carrying
    amount, not to exceed the initial carrying value of the assets
    at the time of transfer. Changes in value subsequent to transfer
    are recorded in non-interest expense. Gains or losses not
    previously recognized resulting from the sale of OREO are
    recognized in non-interest expense on the date of sale.

Resell and Repurchase Agreements

— Securities
    purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under
    agreements to repurchase are generally treated as collateralized
    financing transactions and are recorded at the amounts at which
    the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. The
    fair value of collateral either received from or provided to a
    third party is continually monitored and additional collateral
    is obtained or is requested to be returned to Huntington as in
    accordance with the agreement.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

— Under
    the acquisition method of accounting, the net assets of entities
    acquired by Huntington are recorded at their estimated fair
    value at the date of acquisition. The excess cost of the
    acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired is
    recorded as goodwill. Other intangible assets are amortized
    either on an accelerated or straight-line basis over their
    estimated useful lives. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on
    an annual basis at October 1st of each year or
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying value may not be recoverable. Other intangible assets
    are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may
    not be recoverable.

Mortgage Banking Activities

— Huntington
    recognizes the rights to service mortgage loans as separate
    assets, which are included in other assets in the consolidated
    balance sheets, only when purchased or when servicing is
    contractually separated from the underlying mortgage loans by
    sale or securitization of the loans with servicing rights
    retained. Servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value.
    All mortgage loan servicing rights (MSRs) are subsequently
    carried at either fair value or amortized cost, and are included
    in other assets.

To determine the fair value of MSRs, Huntington uses a option
    adjusted spread cash flow analysis incorporating market implied
    forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of
    mortgage and market interest rates. The forward rates utilized
    are derived from the current yield curve for U.S. dollar
    interest rate swaps and are consistent with pricing of capital
    markets instruments. The current and projected mortgage interest
    rate influences the prepayment rate; and therefore, the timing
    and magnitude of the cash flows associated with the MSR.
    Expected mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are derived from a
    third party model. Management believes these prepayment
    assumptions are consistent with assumptions used by other market
    participants valuing similar MSRs.

Huntington hedges the value of MSRs using derivative instruments
    and trading account securities. Changes in fair value of these
    derivatives and trading account securities are reported as a
    component of mortgage banking income.

Premises and Equipment

— Premises and equipment
    are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
    amortization. Depreciation is computed principally by the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    related assets. Buildings and building improvements are
    depreciated over an average of 30 to 40 years and 10 to
    20 years, respectively. Land improvements and furniture and
    fixtures are depreciated over 10 years, while equipment is
    depreciated over a range of three to seven years. Leasehold
    improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset’s
    useful life or the term of the related leases, including any
    renewal periods for which renewal is reasonably assured.
    Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred,
    while improvements that extend the useful life of an asset are
    capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful



life. Premises and equipment is evaluated for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.

Bank Owned Life Insurance

— Huntington’s
    bank owned life insurance policies are carried at their cash
    surrender value. Huntington recognizes tax-exempt income from
    the periodic increases in the cash surrender value of these
    policies and from death benefits. A portion of cash surrender
    value is supported by holdings in separate accounts. Huntington
    has also purchased insurance for these policies to provide
    protection of the value of the holdings within these separate
    accounts. The cash surrender value of the policies exceeds the
    value of the underlying holdings in the separate accounts
    covered by these insurance policies by approximately
    $9.1 million at December 31, 2009.

Derivative Financial Instruments

— A variety of
    derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate
    swaps, are used in asset and liability management activities to
    protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate
    movements. These instruments provide flexibility in adjusting
    Huntington’s sensitivity to changes in interest rates
    without exposure to loss of principal and higher funding
    requirements.

Derivative financial instruments are recorded in the
    consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or a liability (in
    other assets or other liabilities, respectively) and measured at
    fair value, with changes to fair value recorded through earnings
    unless specific criteria are met to account for the derivative
    using hedge accounting.

Huntington also uses derivatives, principally loan sale
    commitments, in hedging its mortgage loan interest rate lock
    commitments and its mortgage loans held for sale. Mortgage loan
    sale commitments and the related interest rate lock commitments
    are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with
    changes in fair value reflected in mortgage banking revenue.
    Huntington also uses certain derivative financial instruments to
    offset changes in value of its residential mortgage loan
    servicing assets. These derivatives consist primarily of forward
    interest rate agreements, and forward mortgage securities. The
    derivative instruments used are not designated as hedges.
    Accordingly, such derivatives are recorded at fair value with
    changes in fair value reflected in mortgage banking income.

For those derivatives to which hedge accounting is applied,
    Huntington formally documents the hedging relationship and the
    risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the
    hedge. This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the
    hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged,
    and, unless the hedge meets all of the criteria to assume there
    is no ineffectiveness, the method that will be used to assess
    the effectiveness of the hedging instrument and how
    ineffectiveness will be measured. The methods utilized to assess
    retrospective hedge effectiveness, as well as the frequency of
    testing, vary based on the type of item being hedged and the
    designated hedge period. For specifically designated fair value
    hedges of certain fixed-rate debt, Huntington utilizes the
    short-cut method when certain criteria are met. For other fair
    value hedges of fixed-rate debt, including certificates of
    deposit, Huntington utilizes the regression method to evaluate
    hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis. For fair value hedges
    of portfolio loans, the regression method is used to evaluate
    effectiveness on a daily basis. For cash flow hedges, the
    regression method is applied on a quarterly basis. For hedging
    relationships that are designated as fair value hedges, changes
    in the fair value of the derivative are, to the extent that the
    hedging relationship is effective, recorded through earnings and
    offset against changes in the fair value of the hedged item. For
    cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative
    are, to the extent that the hedging relationship is effective,
    recorded as other comprehensive income and subsequently
    recognized in earnings at the same time that the hedged item is
    recognized in earnings. Any portion of a hedge that is
    ineffective is recognized immediately as other noninterest
    income. When a cash flow hedge is discontinued because the
    originally forecasted transaction is not probable of occurring,
    any net gain or loss in other comprehensive income is recognized
    immediately as other noninterest income.

Like other financial instruments, derivatives contain an element
    of credit risk, which is the possibility that Huntington will
    incur a loss because a counterparty fails to meet its
    contractual obligations. Notional values of interest rate swaps
    and other off-balance sheet financial instruments significantly
    exceed the credit risk associated with these instruments and
    represent contractual balances on which calculations of amounts
    to be exchanged are based. Credit exposure is limited to the sum
    of the aggregate fair value of positions that have become
    favorable to Huntington, including any accrued interest
    receivable due from counterparties. Potential



credit losses are mitigated through careful evaluation of
    counterparty credit standing, selection of counterparties from a
    limited group of high quality institutions, collateral
    agreements, and other contract provisions. Huntington considers
    the value of collateral held and collateral provided in
    determining the net carrying value of it derivatives.

Advertising Costs

— Advertising costs are
    expensed as incurred and recorded as a marketing expense, a
    component of noninterest expense.

Income Taxes

— Income taxes are accounted for
    under the asset and liability method. Accordingly, deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are recognized for the future book and
    tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between
    the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
    liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
    and liabilities are determined using enacted tax rates expected
    to apply in the year in which those temporary differences are
    expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
    assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
    income at the time of enactment of such change in tax rates. Any
    interest or penalties due for payment of income taxes are
    included in the provision for income taxes. To the extent that
    Huntington does not consider it more likely than not that a
    deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is
    recorded. All positive and negative evidence is reviewed when
    determining how much of a valuation allowance is recognized on a
    quarterly basis. In determining the requirements for a valuation
    allowance, sources of possible taxable income are evaluated
    including future reversals of existing taxable temporary
    differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing
    temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in
    appropriate carryback years, and tax-planning strategies.
    Huntington applies a more likely than not recognition threshold
    for all tax uncertainties. Huntington reviews its tax positions
    quarterly.

Treasury Stock

— Acquisitions of treasury stock
    are recorded at cost. The reissuance of shares in treasury is
    recorded at weighted-average cost.

Share-Based Compensation

— Huntington uses the
    fair value recognition concept relating to its share-based
    compensation plans. Compensation expense is recognized based on
    the fair value of unvested stock options and awards over the
    requisite service period.

Segment Results

— Accounting policies for the
    lines of business are the same as those used in the preparation
    of the consolidated financial statements with respect to
    activities specifically attributable to each business line.
    However, the preparation of business line results requires
    management to establish methodologies to allocate funding costs
    and benefits, expenses, and other financial elements to each
    line of business. Changes are made in these methodologies
    utilized for certain balance sheet and income statement
    allocations performed by Huntington’s management reporting
    system, as appropriate.

Statement of Cash Flows

— Cash and cash
    equivalents are defined as “Cash and due from banks”
    which includes amounts on deposit with the Federal Reserve and
    “Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale
    agreements.”

Fair Value Measurements

— The Company records
    certain of its assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value
    is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an
    asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
    principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability
    in an orderly transaction between market participants on the
    measurement date. Fair value measurements are classified within
    one of three levels in a valuation hierarchy based upon the
    transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability
    as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as
    follows:

Level 1

— inputs to the valuation
    methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets
    or liabilities in active markets.

Level 2

— inputs to the valuation
    methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and
    liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable
    for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for
    substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

Level 3

— inputs to the valuation
    methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value
    measurement.



A financial instrument’s categorization within the
    valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that
    is significant to the fair value measurement.

See Note 21 for more information regarding fair value
    measurements.

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENTS

In preparing these financial statements, subsequent events were
    evaluated through the time the financial statements were issued.
    Financial statements are considered issued when they are widely
    distributed to all shareholders and other financial statement
    users, or filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In
    conjunction with applicable accounting standards, all material
    subsequent events have been either recognized in the financial
    statements or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

a replacement of FASB
    Statement No. 162) (ASC 105).

This accounting
    guidance was originally issued in June 2009 and is now included
    in ASC 105. The guidance identifies the FASB Accounting
    Standards Codification (Codification) as the single source of
    authoritative U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
    (GAAP) recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental
    entities. The Codification reorganizes all previous GAAP
    pronouncements into roughly 90 accounting topics and displays
    all topics using a consistent structure. All existing standards
    that were used to create the Codification have been superseded,
    replacing the previous references to specific Statements of
    Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) with numbers used in the
    Codification’s structural organization. The guidance is
    effective for interim and annual periods ending after
    September 15, 2009. After September 15, only one level
    of authoritative GAAP exists, other than guidance issued by the
    Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). All other accounting
    literature excluded from the Codification is considered
    non-authoritative. The adoption of the Codification does not
    have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

ASC Topic 810 — Consolidation (Statement

an amendment of ARB
    No. 51) (ASC 810).

This accounting guidance was
    originally issued in December 2007 and is now included in ASC
    810. The guidance requires that noncontrolling interests in
    subsidiaries be initially measured at fair value and classified
    as a separate component of equity. The guidance is effective for
    fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The
    adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on
    Huntington’s consolidated financial statements.

ASC Topic 805 — Business Combinations (Statement
    No. 141 (Revised 2008), Business Combinations)

(ASC 805).

This accounting guidance was originally
    issued in December 2007 and is now included in ASC 805. The
    guidance requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired,
    the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the
    acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values
    as of that date, with limited exceptions. The guidance requires
    prospective application for business combinations consummated in
    fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The
    Franklin restructuring transaction described in Note 5 and
    the Warren Bank transaction described in Note 4 was
    accounted for under this guidance.

an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 60) (ASC 944).

This accounting guidance was originally issued in May 2008 and
    is now included in ASC 944. This guidance requires that an
    insurance enterprise recognize a claim liability prior to an
    event of default (insured event) when there is evidence that
    credit deterioration has occurred in an insured financial
    obligation. The guidance also clarifies the recognition and
    measurement criteria to be used to account for premium revenue
    and claim liabilities in financial guarantee insurance
    contracts. The guidance also requires expanded disclosures about
    financial guarantee insurance contracts. The guidance is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and
    interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008. The
    adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the
    Huntington’s consolidated financial statements.

This accounting guidance was
    originally issued in April 2009 and is now included in ASC 320.
    The guidance amends the previous

other-than-temporary

impairment (OTTI) guidance for debt securities and included
    additional presentation and disclosure requirements for both
    debt and equity securities. The guidance is effective for
    interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. The
    adoption of this guidance requires an adjustment to retained
    earnings and other comprehensive income (OCI) in the period of
    adoption to reclassify non-credit related impairment to OCI for
    securities that the Company does not intend to sell (and will
    not more likely than not be required to sell). The adoption
    resulted in the reclassification of $3.5 million (net of
    tax) from retained earnings to OCI. (See Consolidated Statements

This accounting guidance was originally issued in
    April 2009 and is now included in ASC 820. The guidance
    reaffirms the exit price fair value measurement concept and also
    provides additional guidance for estimating fair value when the
    volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have
    significantly decreased. The guidance was effective for interim
    reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption
    of this guidance did not have a material impact on the
    Huntington’s consolidated financial statements.

ASC Topic 825 — Financial Instruments (FSP

and APB

28-1,

Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments) (ASC 825).

This accounting guidance was
    originally issued in April 2009 and is now included in ASC 825.
    The guidance requires disclosures about fair value of financial
    instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded
    companies as well as in annual financial statements. This
    guidance was adopted for interim reporting periods ending after
    June 15, 2009 (See Note 21).

ASC Topic 855 — Subsequent Events (Statement
    No. 165,

Subsequent Events) (ASC 855).

This
    accounting guidance was originally issued in May 2009 and is now
    included in ASC 855. The guidance establishes general standards
    of accounting for and disclosure of subsequent events.
    Subsequent events are events that occur after the balance sheet
    date but before financial statements are issued or are available
    to be issued. The guidance is effective for interim or annual
    periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of this
    guidance was not material to Huntington’s consolidated
    financial statements.

ASC Topic 810 — Consolidation (Statement
    No. 167,

Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46R)
    (ASC 810)

This accounting guidance was originally
    issued in June 2009 and is now included in ASC 810. The guidance
    amends the consolidation guidance applicable for variable
    interest entities (VIE). The guidance is effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning
    after November 15, 2009, and early adoption is prohibited.
    Huntington previously transferred automobile loans and leases to
    a trust in a securitization transaction. With adoption of the
    amended guidance, the trust will be consolidated as of
    January 1, 2010. Total net assets are anticipated to
    increase by approximately $600 million. Based upon the
    current regulatory requirements, Huntington anticipates the
    impact of adopting will result in a slight decrease to risk
    weighted capital ratios.

ASC Topic 860 — Transfers and Servicing (Statement
    No. 166,

Accounting for Transfers of Financial
    Assets — an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140)
    (ASC 860).

This accounting guidance was originally
    issued in June 2009 and is now included in ASC 860. The guidance
    removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity and
    changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets.
    Many types of transferred financial assets that would have been
    derecognized previously are no longer eligible for
    derecognition. The guidance is effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning
    after November 15, 2009, and early adoption is prohibited.
    The guidance applies prospectively to transfers of financial
    assets occurring on or after the effective date. The guidance
    will impact structuring of securitizations and other transfers
    of financial assets in order to meet the amended sale treatment
    criteria.

ASC Topic 715 — Compensation — Retirement

Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan
    Assets) (ASC 715).

This accounting guidance was
    originally issued in December 2008 and is now included in ASC
    715. The guidance requires additional disclosures about plan



assets in an employer’s defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement plans. The required disclosures have been
    included in Note 20.

Accounting Standards Update (ASU)

2010-6 —

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820): Improving
    Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements.

The ASU amends
    Subtopic

with
    new disclosure requirements and clarification of existing
    disclosure requirements. New disclosures required include the
    amount of significant transfers in and out of levels 1 and
    2 fair value measurements and the reasons for the transfers. In
    addition, the reconciliation for level 3 activity will be
    required on a gross rather than net basis. The ASU provides
    additional guidance related to the level of disaggregation in
    determining classes of assets and liabilities and disclosures
    about inputs and valuation techniques. The amendments are
    effective for annual or interim reporting periods beginning
    after December 15, 2009, except for the requirement to
    provide the reconciliation for level 3 activity on a gross
    basis which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2010. (See Note 21).

ACQUISITIONS

On October 2, 2009, Huntington assumed the deposits and
    certain assets of Warren Bank located in Macomb County, Michigan
    from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Under the
    agreement, approximately $410.0 million of deposits and
    $66.2 million of other assets (primarily cash and due from
    banks and investment securities) were transferred to Huntington
    for consideration including a premium for the deposits of
    $0.9 million. The FDIC transferred cash to Huntington for
    the difference between the assets purchased and the liabilities
    assumed net of the premium. Goodwill of $0.6 million was
    established related to this transaction.

LOANS AND
    LEASES

At December 31, 2009, $8.5 billion of commercial and
    industrial loans and home equity loans were pledged to secure
    potential discount window borrowings from the Federal Reserve
    Bank, and $8.0 billion of real estate loans were pledged to
    secure advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank.

Huntington’s loan and lease portfolio includes lease
    financing receivables consisting of direct financing leases on
    equipment, which are included in commercial and industrial
    loans, and on automobiles. Net investments in lease financing
    receivables by category at December 31 were as follows:

The future lease rental payments due from customers on direct
    financing leases at December 31, 2009, totaled
    $1.0 billion and were as follows: $0.4 billion in
    2010; $0.3 billion in 2011; $0.2 billion in 2012;
    $0.1 billion in 2013; and less than $0.1 billion in
    2014 and thereafter.

Other than the credit risk concentrations described below, there
    were no other economic, industry, or geographic concentrations
    of credit risk greater than 10% of total loans in the loan and
    lease portfolio at December 31, 2009.

Franklin
    Credit Management relationship

Franklin Credit Management Corporation (Franklin) is a specialty
    consumer finance company primarily engaged in servicing
    residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2008,
    Huntington’s total loans outstanding to Franklin were
    $650.2 million, all of which were on nonaccrual status.
    Additionally, the specific ALLL for the Franklin portfolio was
    $130.0 million, resulting in a net exposure to Franklin at
    December 31, 2008 of $520.2 million. The collateral to
    Huntington’s loans was a Franklin owned portfolio of loans
    secured by first and second liens on 1-4 family residential
    properties.

On March 31, 2009, Huntington entered into a transaction
    with Franklin whereby a Huntington wholly-owned REIT subsidiary
    (REIT) exchanged a non controlling amount of certain equity
    interests for a 100% interest in Franklin Asset Merger Sub, LLC
    (Merger Sub), a wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin. This was
    accomplished by merging Merger Sub into a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of REIT. Merger Sub’s sole assets were two trust
    participation certificates evidencing 83% ownership rights in a
    newly created trust, Franklin Mortgage Asset

Trust 2009-A

(Franklin 2009 Trust) which holds all the underlying consumer
    loans and OREO that were formerly collateral for the Franklin
    commercial loans. The equity interests provided to Franklin by
    REIT were pledged by Franklin as collateral for the Franklin
    commercial loans.

Franklin 2009 Trust is a variable interest entity and, as a
    result of Huntington’s 83% participation certificates,
    Franklin 2009 Trust was consolidated into Huntington’s
    financial results. The consolidation was recorded as a business
    combination with the fair value of the equity interests issued
    to Franklin representing the acquisition price.

ASC 310 (formerly

SOP 03-3)

provides guidance for accounting for acquired loans, such as
    these, that have experienced a deterioration of credit quality
    at the time of acquisition for which it is probable that the
    investor will be unable to collect all contractually required
    payments.

The excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the
    estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable discount
    and is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of
    the loan, or pool of loans, in situations where there is a
    reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows
    expected to be collected. The difference between the
    contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash
    flows expected to be collected at acquisition, considering the
    impact of prepayments, is referred to as the nonaccretable
    discount. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will
    generally result in an increase to the allowance for loan and
    lease losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in
    reversal of any nonaccretable discount (or allowance for loan
    and lease losses to the extent any has been recorded) with a
    positive impact on interest income. The measurement of
    undiscounted cash flows involves assumptions and judgments for
    credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, default rates,
    loss severity, payment speeds, and collateral values. All of
    these factors are inherently subjective and significant changes
    in the cash flow estimates over the life of the loan can result.

At December 31, 2009, there were no additional credit
    losses recorded on the portfolio and no adjustment to the
    accretable yield or nonaccretable yield was required.



The following table reflects the contractually required payments
    receivable, cash flows expected to be collected, and fair value
    of the loans at the acquisition date on March 31, 2009:

$

573,148

The fair values of the acquired mortgage loans and OREO assets
    were based upon a market participant model. Under this market
    participant model, expected cash flows for first-lien mortgages
    were calculated based upon the net expected foreclosure proceeds
    of the collateral underlying each mortgage loan. Appraisals or
    other indicators of value provided the basis for estimating cash
    flows. Sales proceeds from the underlying collateral were
    estimated to be received over a one to three year period,
    depending on the delinquency status of the loan. Expected
    proceeds were reduced assuming housing price depreciation of
    18%, 12%, and 0% over each year of the next three years of
    expected collections, respectively. Principal and interest cash
    flows were estimated to be received for a limited time for non
    delinquent loans. Limited value was assigned to all second-lien
    mortgages because, after considering the house price
    depreciation rates above, little if any proceeds would be
    realized. The resulting cash flows were discounted at an 18%
    rate of return.

The following table presents a rollforward of the accretable
    yield from the beginning of the period to the end of the period:

At December 31, 2009, $129.2 million of the loans
    accrue interest while $314.7 million were on nonaccrual.
    Management has concluded that it cannot reliably estimate the
    timing of collection of cash flows for delinquent first and
    second lien mortgages, because the majority of the expected cash
    flows for the delinquent portfolio will result from the
    foreclosure and subsequent disposition of the underlying
    collateral supporting the loans.

The consolidation of Franklin 2009 Trust at March 31, 2009
    resulted in the recording of a $95.8 million liability,
    representing the 17% of Franklin 2009 Trust certificates not
    acquired by Huntington. At December 31, 2009, the balance
    of the liability was $79.9 million. These certificates were
    retained by Franklin.



In accordance with ASC 805, at March 31, 2009 Huntington
    has recorded a net deferred tax asset of $159.9 million
    related to the difference between the tax basis and the book
    basis in the acquired assets. Because the acquisition price,
    represented by the equity interests in the Huntington
    wholly-owned subsidiary, was equal to the fair value of the 83%
    interest in the Franklin 2009 Trust participant certificate, no
    goodwill was created from the transaction. The recording of the
    net deferred tax asset resulted in a bargain purchase under ASC
    805, and, therefore, was recorded as tax benefit in the 2009
    first quarter.

Single
    Family Home Builders

At December 31, 2009, Huntington had $857.4 million of
    loans to single family homebuilders, including loans made to
    both middle market and small business homebuilders. Such loans
    represented 2% of total loans and leases. Of this portfolio, 67%
    were to finance projects currently under construction, 15% to
    finance land under development, and 18% to finance land held for
    development. The decline from December 31, 2008 was
    primarily the result of a reclassification of loans from
    commercial real estate to commercial and industrial. Other
    factors contributing to the decrease in exposure include no new
    originations in this portfolio segment in 2009, increased
    property sale activity, and substantial charge-offs.

The housing market across Huntington’s geographic footprint
    remained stressed, reflecting relatively lower sales activity,
    declining prices, and excess inventories of houses to be sold,
    particularly impacting borrowers in our eastern Michigan and
    northern Ohio regions. Further, a portion of the loans extended
    to borrowers located within Huntington’s geographic regions
    was to finance projects outside of our geographic regions.

Retail
    properties

Huntington’s portfolio of commercial real estate loans
    secured by retail properties totaled $2.1 billion, or
    approximately 6% of total loans and leases, at December 31,
    2009. Loans to this borrower segment decreased by
    $0.2 billion from $2.3 billion at December 31,
    2008. Credit approval in this loan segment is generally
    dependant on pre-leasing requirements, and net operating income
    from the project must cover interest expense when the loan is
    fully funded.

The weakness of the economic environment in the Company’s
    geographic regions significantly impacted the projects that
    secure the loans in this portfolio segment. Increased
    unemployment levels compared with recent years, and the
    expectation that these levels will continue to increase for the
    foreseeable future, are expected to adversely affect our
    borrowers’ ability to repay these loans.

Home
    Equity and Residential Mortgage Loans (excluding loans in
    Franklin 2009 Trust)

There is a potential for loan products to contain contractual
    terms that give rise to a concentration of credit risk that may
    increase a lending institution’s exposure to risk of
    nonpayment or realization. Examples of these contractual terms
    include loans that permit negative amortization, a

loan-to-value

of greater than 100%, and option adjustable-rate mortgages.

Huntington does not originate mortgage loan products that
    contain these terms. Recent declines in housing prices have
    likely eliminated a portion of the collateral for the home
    equity portfolio, such that some loans originally underwritten
    at an LTV of less than 100% are currently at higher than 100%.
    Home equity loans totaled $7.6 billion at both
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, or 21% and 18% of total loans
    at the end of each respective period. At December 31, 2009,
    84% of the home equity loans had a loan to value ratio at
    origination of less than 90%.

As part of the Company’s loss mitigation process,
    Huntington increased its efforts in 2008 and 2009 to
    re-underwrite, modify, or restructure loans when borrowers are
    experiencing payment difficulties, and these loan restructurings
    are based on the borrower’s ability to repay the loan.



Related
    Party Transactions

Huntington has made loans to its officers, directors, and their
    associates. These loans were made in the ordinary course of
    business under normal credit terms, including interest rate and
    collateralization, and do not represent more than the normal
    risk of collection. These loans to related parties for the year
    ended December 31 are summarized as follows:

Huntington applied the related OTTI guidance as further
    described in Note 1 on the debt security types listed below.

Alt-A mortgage-backed and private-label collateralized
    mortgage obligation (CMO) securities

represent
    securities collateralized by first-lien residential mortgage
    loans. The securities are valued by a third party specialist
    using a discounted cash flow approach and proprietary pricing
    model. The model used inputs such as estimated prepayment
    speeds, losses, recoveries, default rates that were implied by
    the underlying performance of collateral in the structure or
    similar structures, discount rates that were implied by market
    prices for similar securities, collateral structure types, and
    house price depreciation/appreciation rates that were based upon
    macroeconomic forecasts.

Pooled-trust-preferred securities

represent
    collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) backed by a pool of debt
    securities issued by financial institutions. The collateral
    generally consisted of trust-preferred securities and
    subordinated debt securities issued by banks, bank holding
    companies, and insurance companies. A full cash flow analysis
    was used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each
    security within this portfolio. We engaged a third party
    specialist with direct industry experience in pooled trust
    preferred securities valuations to provide assistance in
    estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each
    security in this portfolio.

Relying on cash flows was necessary because there was a lack of
    observable transactions in the market and many of the original
    sponsors or dealers for these securities were no longer able to
    provide a fair value that was compliant with ASC 820.

For the period ended December 31, 2009, the following
    tables summarizes by debt security type, total OTTI losses, OTTI
    losses included in OCI, and OTTI recognized in the income
    statement for securities evaluated for impairment as described

The fair values of these assets have been impacted by various
    market conditions. The unrealized losses were primarily the
    result of wider liquidity spreads on asset-backed securities
    and, additionally, increased market volatility on non-agency
    mortgage and asset-backed securities that are backed by certain
    mortgage loans. In addition, the expected average lives of the
    asset-backed securities backed by trust preferred securities
    have been extended, due to changes in the expectations of when
    the underlying securities would be repaid. The contractual terms

and/or

cash
    flows of the investments do not permit the issuer to settle the
    securities at a price less than the amortized cost. Huntington
    does not intend to sell, nor does it believe it will be required
    to sell these securities until the fair value is recovered,
    which may be maturity and, therefore, does not consider them to
    be

other-than-temporarily

impaired at December 31, 2009.

The following table displays the cumulative credit component of
    OTTI recognized in earnings on debt securities held by
    Huntington for the year ended December 31, 2009 is as

LOAN
    SALES AND SECURITIZATIONS

Residential
    Mortgage Loans

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007,
    Huntington sold $4.3 billion, $2.8 billion and
    $1.9 billion of residential mortgage loans with servicing
    retained, resulting in net pre-tax gains of $87.2 million,
    $27.8 million and $23.9 million, respectively,
    recorded in other non-interest income.

A MSR is established only when the servicing is contractually
    separated from the underlying mortgage loans by sale or
    securitization of the loans with servicing rights retained.

At initial recognition, the MSR asset is established at its fair
    value using assumptions that are consistent with assumptions
    used to estimate the fair value of existing MSRs carried at fair
    value in the portfolio. At the time of initial capitalization,
    MSRs are grouped into one of two categories depending on whether
    Huntington intends to actively hedge the asset. MSR assets are
    recorded using the fair value method if the Company will engage
    in actively hedging the asset or recorded using the amortization
    method if no active hedging will be performed. MSRs are included
    in accrued income and other assets in the Company’s
    consolidated balance



sheet. Any increase or decrease in the fair value or amortized
    cost of MSRs carried under the fair value method during the
    period is recorded as an increase or decrease in mortgage
    banking income, which is reflected in non-interest income in the
    consolidated statements of income.

The following tables summarize the changes in MSRs recorded
    using either the fair value method or the amortization method
    for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008:

MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily
    observable prices. While sales of MSRs occur, the precise terms
    and conditions are typically not readily available. Therefore,
    the fair value of MSRs is estimated using a discounted future
    cash flow model. The model considers portfolio characteristics,
    contractually specified servicing fees and assumptions related
    to prepayments, delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary
    revenues, costs to service, and other economic factors. Changes
    in the assumptions used may have a significant impact on the
    valuation of MSRs.

A summary of key assumptions and the sensitivity of the MSR
    value at December 31, 2009 to changes in these assumptions
    follows:

MSR values are very sensitive to movements in interest rates as
    expected future net servicing income depends on the projected
    outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which
    can be greatly impacted by the level of prepayments. The Company
    hedges against changes in MSR fair value attributable to changes
    in interest rates through a combination of derivative
    instruments and trading securities.



Total servicing fees included in mortgage banking income
    amounted to $48.5 million, $45.6 million, and
    $36.0 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The
    unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans serviced
    for third parties was $16.0 billion, $15.8 billion,
    and $15.1 billion at December 31, 2009, 2008, and
    2007, respectively.

Automobile
    Loans and Leases

During the first quarter of 2009, Huntington transferred
    $1.0 billion automobile loans and leases to a trust in a
    securitization transaction. The securitization qualified for
    sale accounting under ASC 860. Huntington retained a portion of
    the related securities, with par values totaling
    $210.9 million and recorded a $47.1 million retained
    residual interest as a result of the transaction. Subsequent to
    the transaction, in the second quarter of 2009, Huntington sold
    a portion of these securities with par values totaling
    $78.4 million. These amounts were recorded as investment
    securities on Huntington’s consolidated balance sheet.
    Huntington also recorded a $5.9 million loss in other
    noninterest income on the consolidated statement of income and
    recorded a $19.5 million servicing asset in accrued income
    and other assets associated with this transaction.

Automobile loan servicing rights are accounted for under the
    amortization method. A servicing asset is established at fair
    value at the time of the sale using the following assumptions:
    actual servicing income of 0.55% — 1.00%, adequate
    compensation for servicing of 0.50% — 0.65%, other
    ancillary fees of approximately 0.37% — 0.50%, a
    discount rate of 2% — 10% and an estimated return on
    payments prior to remittance to investors. The servicing asset
    is then amortized against servicing income. Impairment, if any,
    is recognized when carrying value exceeds the fair value as
    determined by calculating the present value of expected net
    future cash flows. The primary risk characteristic for measuring
    servicing assets is payoff rates of the underlying loan pools.
    Valuation calculations rely on the predicted payoff assumption
    and, if actual payoff is quicker than expected, then future
    value would be impaired.

Changes in the carrying value of automobile loan servicing
    rights for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, and
    the fair value at the end of each period were as follows:

Huntington has retained servicing responsibilities on sold
    automobile loans and receives annual servicing fees and other
    ancillary fees on the outstanding loan balances. Servicing
    income, net of amortization of capitalized servicing assets,
    amounted to $6.4 million, $6.8 million and
    $11.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The unpaid principal balance of
    automobile loans serviced for third parties was
    $1.1 billion, $0.5 billion , and $1.0 billion at
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

At December 31, 2009, retained interests in automobile
    securitizations totaled $45.9 million. Quoted market prices
    are generally not available for retained interests in automobile
    securitizations. At December 31,



2009, the key economic assumptions used to measure the fair
    value of retained interests and the sensitivity of such fair
    value to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in those
    assumptions were as follows:

ALLOWANCES
    FOR CREDIT LOSSES (ACL)

The Company maintains two reserves, both of which are available
    to absorb possible credit losses: an allowance for loan and
    lease losses (ALLL) and an allowance for unfunded loan
    commitments and letters of credit (AULC). When summed together,
    these reserves constitute the total allowances for credit losses
    (ACL). A summary of the transactions in the allowances for
    credit losses and details regarding impaired loans and leases
    follows for the three years ended December 31, 2009, 2008

2009 includes impaired commercial and industrial loans and

    than $1 million. 2008 and prior periods includes impaired
    commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans
    with outstanding balances greater than $1 million for
    business-banking loans, and $500,000 for all other loans. A loan
    is impaired when it is probable that Huntington will be unable
    to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of
    the loan agreement. Impaired loans are included in
    non-performing assets. The amount of interest recognized in
    2009, 2008 and 2007 on impaired loans while they were considered
    impaired was $0.1 million, $55.8 million, and
    $0.9 million, respectively. The recovery of the investment
    in impaired loans with no specific reserves generally is
    expected from the sale of collateral, net of costs to sell that
    collateral.

(2)

As a result of the troubled debt restructuring , the loans to
    Franklin of $1.2 billion and $0.7 billion are included
    in impaired loans at the end of 2007 and 2008, respectively.

As shown in the table above, in 2008, the economic reserve
    component of the AULC was reclassified to the economic reserve
    component of the ALLL, resulting in the entire economic reserve
    component of the ACL residing in the ALLL.

The $582.3 million increase in the ALLL primarily reflected
    an increase in specific reserves associated with impaired loans
    and an increase associated with risk-grade migration,
    predominantly in the commercial portfolio. The increase is also
    the result of a change in estimate resulting from the 2009
    fourth quarter review of our ACL practices and assumptions,
    consisting of:

•

Approximately $200 million increase in the judgmental
    component.

•

Approximately $200 million allocated primarily to the
    commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio addressing the severity
    of CRE loss-given-default percentages and a longer term view of
    the loss emergence time period.

•

Approximately $50 million from updating the consumer
    reserve factors to include the current delinquency status.

Partially offset by:

•

$130 million of previously established Franklin specific
    reserves utilized to absorb related net charge-offs due to the
    2009 first quarter Franklin restructuring.

GOODWILL
    AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

During the second quarter of 2009, Huntington reorganized its
    internal reporting structure. The Regional Banking reporting
    unit, which through March 31, 2009 had been managed
    geographically, is now managed on a product segment approach.
    Regional Banking was divided into Retail and Business Banking,
    Commercial Banking, and Commercial Real Estate segments.
    Regional Banking goodwill was assigned to the new reporting
    units affected using a relative fair value allocation. Auto
    Finance and Dealer Services (AFDS), Private Financial Group
    (PFG), and Treasury / Other remained essentially
    unchanged. A rollforward of goodwill by



line of business for the years ended December 31, 2009 and

Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment on an
    annual basis at October 1st of each year or whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value may not be recoverable. During the first quarter of 2009,
    Huntington experienced a sustained decline in its stock price,
    which was primarily attributable to the continuing economic
    slowdown and increased market concern surrounding financial
    institutions’ credit risks and capital positions as well as
    uncertainty related to increased regulatory supervision and
    intervention. Huntington determined that these changes would
    more likely than not reduce the fair value of certain reporting
    units below their carrying amounts. Therefore, Huntington
    performed a goodwill impairment test, which resulted in a
    goodwill impairment charge of $2.6 billion in the first
    quarter of 2009. An impairment charge of $4.2 million was
    recorded in the second quarter related to the sale of a small
    payments-related business completed in July 2009. Huntington
    concluded that no other goodwill impairment was required during
    2009.

Goodwill acquired during the period was the result of
    Huntington’s assumption of the deposits and certain assets
    of Warren Bank in October 2009.

There were no goodwill impairment charges recorded prior to
    December 31, 2008. The change in consolidated goodwill for
    the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily related to
    final purchase accounting adjustments of acquired bank branches,
    operating facilities, and other contingent obligations primarily
    from an acquisition made on July 1, 2007. Huntington also
    transferred goodwill between businesses in response to other
    organizational changes. Huntington does not expect a material
    amount of goodwill from mergers in 2009 or 2007 to be deductible
    for tax purposes.

FEDERAL
    HOME LOAN BANK ADVANCES

Huntington’s long-term advances from the Federal Home Loan
    Bank had weighted average interest rates of 0.88% and 1.23% at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These advances,
    which predominantly had variable interest rates, were
    collateralized by qualifying real estate loans. As of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, Huntington’s maximum
    borrowing capacity was $3.0 billion and $4.6 billion,
    respectively. The advances outstanding at December 31, 2009
    of $169.0 million mature as follows: $142.0 million in
    2010; $4.9 million in 2011; none in 2012;

Amounts above are net of unamortized discounts and adjustments
    related to hedging with derivative financial instruments. The
    derivative instruments, principally interest rate swaps, are
    used to hedge the fair values of certain fixed-rate debt by
    converting the debt to a variable rate. See Note 22 for
    more information regarding such financial instruments.

In the 2009 first quarter, the Bank issued $600 million of
    guaranteed debt through the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee
    Program (TLGP) with the FDIC. The majority of the resulting
    proceeds were used to satisfy unsecured other long-term debt
    obligations maturing in 2009.



Other long-term debt maturities for the next five years are as
    follows: $0.2 billion in 2010; none in 2011,
    $0.9 billion in 2012; $0.1 billion in 2013, none in
    2014 and $1.2 billion thereafter. These maturities are
    based upon the par values of long-term debt.

The terms of the other long-term debt obligations contain
    various restrictive covenants including limitations on the
    acquisition of additional debt in excess of specified levels,
    dividend payments, and the disposition of subsidiaries. As of
    December 31, 2009, Huntington was in compliance with all
    such covenants.

Amounts above are reported net of unamortized discounts and
    adjustments related to hedging with derivative financial
    instruments. The derivative instruments, principally interest
    rate swaps, are used to match the funding rates on certain
    assets to hedge the interest rate values of certain fixed-rate
    debt by converting the debt to a variable rate. See Note 22
    for more information regarding such financial instruments. All
    principal is due upon maturity of the note as described in the
    table above.

During 2009, Huntington repurchased $702.4 million of
    junior subordinated debentures, bank subordinated notes and
    medium-term notes resulting in net pre-tax gains of
    $147.4 million. In 2008, $48.5 million of the junior
    subordinated debentures were repurchased resulting in net
    pre-tax gains of $23.5 million.



These transactions have been recorded as gains on early
    extinguishment of debt, a reduction of noninterest expense in
    the consolidated financial statements.

SHAREHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

Issuance
    of Common Stock

During 2009, Huntington completed several transactions to
    increase capital, in particular, common equity.

In the 2009 third quarter, Huntington completed an offering of
    109.5 million shares of its common stock at a price to the
    public of $4.20 per share, or $460.1 million in aggregate
    gross proceeds. In the 2009 second quarter, Huntington completed
    an offering of 103.5 million shares of its common stock at
    a price to the public of $3.60 per share, or $372.6 million
    in aggregate gross proceeds.

Also, during 2009, Huntington completed three separate
    discretionary equity issuance programs. These programs allowed
    the Company to take advantage of market opportunities to issue a
    total of 92.7 million new shares of common stock worth a
    total of $345.8 million. Sales of the common shares were
    made through ordinary brokers’ transactions on the NASDAQ
    Global Select Market or otherwise at the prevailing market
    prices.

Conversion
    of Convertible Preferred Stock

In 2008, Huntington completed the public offering of
    569,000 shares of 8.50% Series A Non-Cumulative
    Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock (Series A Preferred
    Stock) with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share,
    resulting in an aggregate liquidation preference of
    $569 million.



During the 2009 first and second quarters, Huntington entered
    into agreements with various institutional investors exchanging
    shares of common stock for shares of the Series A Preferred
    Stock held by the institutional investors. The table below
    provides details of the aggregate activities:

Each share of the Series A Preferred Stock is non-voting
    and may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder,
    into 83.668 shares of common stock of Huntington, which
    represents an approximate initial conversion price of $11.95 per
    share of common stock (for a total of approximately
    30.3 million shares at December 31, 2009). The
    conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to
    adjustments in certain circumstances. On or after April 15,
    2013, at the option of Huntington, the Series A Preferred
    Stock will be subject to mandatory conversion into
    Huntington’s common stock at the prevailing conversion
    rate, if the closing price of Huntington’s common stock
    exceeds 130% of the conversion price for 20 trading days during
    any 30 consecutive trading day period.

Troubled
    Asset Relief Program (TARP)

In 2008, Huntington received $1.4 billion of equity capital
    by issuing to the U.S. Department of Treasury
    1.4 million shares of Huntington’s 5.00% Series B
    Non-voting Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share
    with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, and a
    ten-year warrant to purchase up to 23.6 million shares of
    Huntington’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at an
    exercise price of $8.90 per share. The proceeds received were
    allocated to the preferred stock and additional

paid-in-capital

based on their relative fair values. The resulting discount on
    the preferred stock is amortized against retained earnings and
    is reflected in Huntington’s consolidated statement of
    income as “Dividends on preferred shares”, resulting
    in additional dilution to Huntington’s earnings per share.
    The warrants are immediately exercisable, in whole or in part,
    over a term of 10 years. The warrants are included in
    Huntington’s diluted average common shares outstanding
    using the treasury stock method. Both the preferred securities
    and warrants were accounted for as additions to
    Huntington’s regulatory Tier 1 and Total capital.

The Series B Preferred Stock is not mandatorily redeemable
    and will pay cumulative dividends at a rate of 5% per year for
    the first five years and 9% per year thereafter. With regulatory
    approval, Huntington may redeem the Series B Preferred
    Stock at par with any unamortized discount recognized as a
    deemed dividend in the period of redemption. The Series B
    Preferred Stock rank on equal priority with Huntington’s
    existing 8.50% Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual
    Convertible Preferred Stock.

A company that participates in the TARP must adopt certain
    standards for executive compensation, including
    (a) prohibiting “golden parachute” payments as
    defined in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008
    (EESA) to senior executive officers; (b) requiring recovery
    of any compensation paid to senior executive officers based on
    criteria that is later proven to be materially inaccurate;
    (c) prohibiting incentive compensation that encourages
    unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the
    financial institution, and (d) accepting restrictions on
    the payment of dividends and the repurchase of common stock. As
    of December 31, 2009, Huntington is in compliance with all
    TARP standards and restrictions.

Share
    Repurchase Program

As a condition to participate in the TARP, Huntington may not
    repurchase any additional shares without prior approval from the
    Department of Treasury. Huntington did not repurchase any shares
    under the 2006



Repurchase Program for the year ended December 31, 2009. On
    February 18, 2009, the board of directors terminated the
    previously authorized program for the repurchase of up to
    15 million shares of common stock (the 2006 Repurchase
    Program).

17.

(LOSS)
    EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic (loss) earnings per share is the amount of (loss) earnings
    (adjusted for dividends declared on preferred stock) available
    to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting
    period. Diluted (loss) earnings per share is the amount of
    (loss) earnings available to each share of common stock
    outstanding during the reporting period adjusted to include the
    effect of potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially
    dilutive common shares include incremental shares issued for
    stock options, restricted stock units, distributions from
    deferred compensation plans, and the conversion of the
    Company’s convertible preferred stock and warrants (See
    Note 16). Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded
    from the computation of diluted earnings per share in periods in
    which the effect would be antidilutive. For diluted (loss)
    earnings per share, net (loss) income available to common shares
    can be affected by the conversion of the Company’s
    convertible preferred stock. Where the effect of this conversion
    would be dilutive, net (loss) income available to common
    shareholders is adjusted by the associated preferred dividends.
    The calculation of basic and diluted (loss) earnings per share
    for each of the three years ended December 31 was as follows:

Due to the loss attributable to common shareholders for the
    years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, no potentially
    dilutive shares are included in loss per share calculations for
    those years as including such shares in the calculation would
    reduce the reported loss per share. Approximately
    23.7 million, 26.3 million and 14.9 million
    options to purchase shares of common stock outstanding at the
    end of 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, were not included in
    the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect
    would be antidilutive. The weighted average exercise price for
    these options was $19.71 per share, $19.45 per share, and $23.20
    per share at the end of each respective period.

SHARE-BASED
    COMPENSATION

Huntington sponsors nonqualified and incentive share-based
    compensation plans. These plans provide for the granting of
    stock options and other awards to officers, directors, and other
    employees. Compensation costs are included in personnel costs on
    the condensed consolidated statements of income. Stock options
    are granted at the closing market price on the date of the
    grant. Options granted typically vest ratably over three years
    or when other conditions are met. Options granted prior to May
    2004 have a term of ten years. All options granted after May
    2004 have a term of seven years.

Huntington uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value
    share-based compensation expense. This model assumes that the
    estimated fair value of options is amortized over the
    options’ vesting periods. Forfeitures are estimated at the
    date of grant based on historical rates and reduce the
    compensation expense recognized. The risk-free interest rate is
    based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the
    date of grant. Expected volatility is based on the estimated
    volatility of Huntington’s stock over the expected term of
    the option. The expected dividend yield is based on the dividend
    rate and stock price at the date of the grant. The following
    table illustrates the weighted-average assumptions used in the
    option-pricing model for options granted in the three years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

As a result of increased employee turnover, during the 2009
    second quarter Huntington updated its forfeiture rate assumption
    and adjusted share-based compensation expense to account for the
    higher forfeiture rate. The following table illustrates total
    share-based compensation expense and related tax benefit for the
    three years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007:

Huntington established an additional paid-in capital pool (APIC
    Pool) on January 1, 2006. With the continued decline in
    Huntington’s stock price, the tax deductions have been less
    than the recorded compensation expense, resulting in the related
    APIC Pool to be reduced to zero. As a result, Huntington is
    required to record tax expense to remove the related deferred
    tax asset in periods in which options are exercised or expire
    unexercised.

The aggregate intrinsic value represents the amount by which the
    fair value of underlying stock exceeds the

“in-the-money”

option exercise price. There were no exercises of stock options
    for the years ended December 31, 2009 or 2008. The total
    intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2007 was
    $4.3 million.

Huntington also grants restricted stock units and awards.
    Restricted stock units and awards are issued at no cost to the
    recipient, and can be settled only in shares at the end of the
    vesting period. Restricted stock awards provide the holder with
    full voting rights and cash dividends during the vesting period.
    Restricted stock units do not provide the holder with voting
    rights or cash dividends during the vesting period and are
    subject to certain service restrictions. The fair value of the
    restricted stock units and awards is the closing market price of
    the Company’s common stock on the date of award.

The following table summarizes the status of Huntington’s
    restricted stock units and restricted stock awards as of

Of the remaining 31.7 million shares of common stock
    authorized for issuance at December 31, 2009,
    26.6 million were outstanding and 5.1 million were
    available for future grants. Huntington issues shares to fulfill
    stock option exercises and restricted stock units from available
    authorized shares. At December 31, 2009, the Company
    believes there are adequate authorized shares to satisfy
    anticipated stock option exercises in 2010.

On January 14, 2009, Huntington announced that Stephen D.
    Steinour, has been elected Chairman, President and Chief
    Executive Officer. In connection with his employment agreement,
    Huntington awarded Mr. Steinour an inducement option to
    purchase 1,000,000 shares of Huntington’s common
    stock, with a per share exercise price equal to $4.95, the
    closing price of Huntington’s common stock on
    January 14, 2009. The option vests in equal increments on
    each of the first five anniversaries of the date of grant, and
    expires on the seventh anniversary.

INCOME
    TAXES

The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the
    U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state, city and
    foreign jurisdictions. Federal income tax audits have been
    completed through 2005. In 2009, the IRS began the audit of
    our consolidated federal income tax returns for tax years 2006
    and 2007. In addition, various state and other jurisdictions
    remain open to examination for tax years 2000 and forward.

The Internal Revenue Service, State of Ohio and other state tax
    officials have proposed adjustments to the Company’s
    previously filed tax returns. Management believes that the tax
    positions taken by the Company related to such proposed
    adjustments were correct and supported by applicable statutes,
    regulations, and judicial authority, and intends to vigorously
    defend them. It is possible that the ultimate resolution of the
    proposed adjustments, if unfavorable, may be material to the
    results of operations in the period it occurs. However, although
    no assurance can be given, we believe that the resolution of
    these examinations will not, individually or in the aggregate,
    have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial
    position.

Huntington accounts for uncertainties in income taxes in
    accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. At December 31,
    2009, Huntington had a net unrecognized tax benefit of
    $13.5 million in income tax liability related to tax
    positions. Huntington does not anticipate the total amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change within the
    next 12 months.



The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning
    and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits.

At December 31, 2009, Huntington’s deferred tax asset
    related to loss and other carry-forwards was $19.2 million.
    This was comprised of net operating loss carry-forward of
    $1.8 million, which will begin expiring in 2023, an
    alternative minimum tax credit carry-forward of
    $0.6 million, a general business credit carryover of
    $15.2 million which will expire in 2029, a charitable
    contribution carry-forward of $0.7 million which will
    expire in 2014 , and a capital loss carry-forward of
    $0.9 million, which will expire in 2010. A valuation
    allowance in the amount of $0.9 million has been
    established for the capital loss carry-forward because
    management believes it is more likely than not that the
    realization of these assets will not occur. The valuation
    allowance on this asset decreased $12.8 million from 2008.
    In Management’s opinion the results of future operations
    will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net
    operating loss and alternative minimum tax credit carry-forward.
    Consequently, management has determined that a valuation
    allowance for deferred tax assets was not required as of
    December 31, 2009 or 2008 relating to these carry-forwards.

At December 31, 2009 federal income taxes had not been
    provided on $139.8 million of undistributed earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries that have been reinvested for an indefinite
    period of time. If the earnings had been distributed, an
    additional $48.9 million of tax expense would have resulted
    in 2009.

20.

BENEFIT
    PLANS

Huntington sponsors the Huntington Bancshares Retirement Plan
    (the Plan or Retirement Plan), a non-contributory defined
    benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees hired
    or rehired prior to January 1, 2010. The Plan provides
    benefits based upon length of service and compensation levels.
    The funding policy of Huntington is to contribute an annual
    amount that is at least equal to the minimum funding



requirements but not more than that deductible under the
    Internal Revenue Code. There was no minimum required
    contribution to the Plan in 2009.

In addition, Huntington has an unfunded defined benefit
    post-retirement plan that provides certain health care and life
    insurance benefits to retired employees who have attained the
    age of 55 and have at least 10 years of vesting service
    under this plan. For any employee retiring on or after
    January 1, 1993, post-retirement health-care benefits are
    based upon the employee’s number of months of service and
    are limited to the actual cost of coverage. Life insurance
    benefits are a percentage of the employee’s base salary at
    the time of retirement, with a maximum of $50,000 of coverage.
    The employer paid portion of the post-retirement health and life
    insurance plan will be eliminated for employees retiring on and
    after March 1, 2010. Eligible employees retiring on and
    after March 1, 2010, who elect retiree medical coverage
    will pay the full cost of this coverage. The company will not
    provide any employer paid life insurance to employees retiring
    on and after March 1, 2010. Eligible employees will be able
    to convert or port their existing life insurance at their own
    expense under the same terms that are available to all
    terminated employees.

Beginning January 1, 2010, there will be changes to the way
    the future early and normal retirement benefit is calculated
    under the Retirement Plan for service on and after
    January 1, 2010. While these changes will not affect the
    benefit earned under the Retirement Plan through
    December 31, 2009, there will be a reduction in future
    benefits. In addition, employees hired or rehired on and after
    January 1, 2010 are not eligible to participate in the
    Retirement Plan.

On January 1, 2008, Huntington transitioned to fiscal
    year-end measurement date of plan assets and benefit
    obligations. As a result, Huntington recognized a charge to
    beginning retained earnings of $4.7 million, representing
    the net periodic benefit costs for the last three months of
    2008, and a charge to the opening balance of accumulated other
    comprehensive loss of $3.8 million, representing the change
    in fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations for the
    last three months of 2008 (net of amortization included in net
    periodic benefit cost).

The following table shows the weighted-average assumptions used
    to determine the benefit obligation at December 31, 2009
    and 2008, and the net periodic benefit cost for the years then
    ended.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is an
    assumption reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on
    the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits
    included in the projected benefit obligation. The expected
    long-term rate of return is established at the beginning of the
    plan year based upon historical returns and projected returns on
    the underlying mix of invested assets.

    was $504.6 million and $433 million at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008. As of December 31, 2009,
    the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of
    Huntington’s plan assets by $50.5 million.

Included in benefit costs are $0.7 million,
    $0.6 million and $0.4 million of plan expenses that
    were recognized in the three years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007. It is Huntington’s policy to recognize
    settlement gains and losses as incurred. Management expects net
    periodic pension cost, excluding any expense of settlements, to
    approximate $16.2 million for 2010. There will be no net
    periodic post-retirement benefits costs in 2010, as the
    postretirement medical and life subsidy was eliminated for
    anyone that retires on or after March 1, 2010.

The estimated transition obligation, prior service cost (credit)
    and net actuarial loss for the plans that will be amortized from
    accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit
    cost over the next fiscal year is less than $1 million,
    $(6.8) million and $13.9 million, respectively.

Under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
    Modernization Act of 2003, Huntington has registered for the
    Medicare subsidy and a resulting $15.5 million reduction in
    the post-retirement obligation is being recognized over a

10-year

period beginning October 1, 2005.



At December 31, 2009 and 2008, The Huntington National
    Bank, as trustee, held all Plan assets. The Plan assets
    consisted of investments in a variety of Huntington mutual funds

Investments of the Plan are accounted for at cost on the trade
    date and are reported at fair value. All of the Plan’s
    investments at December 31, 2009 are classified as
    Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. In general,
    investments of the Plan are exposed to various risks, such as
    interest rate risk, credit risk, and overall market volatility.
    Due to the level of risk associated with certain investments, it
    is reasonably possible that changes in the values of investments
    will occur in the near term and that such changes could
    materially affect the amounts reported in the Plan assets.

The investment objective of the Plan is to maximize the return
    on Plan assets over a long time horizon, while meeting the Plan
    obligations. At December 31, 2009, Plan assets were
    invested 69% in equity investments and 31% in bonds, with an
    average duration of 4 years on bond investments. The
    estimated life of benefit obligations was 11 years.
    Management believes that this mix is appropriate for the current
    economic environment. Although it may fluctuate with market
    conditions, management has targeted a long-term allocation of
    Plan assets of 69% in equity investments and 31% in bond
    investments.

The number of shares of Huntington common stock held by the Plan
    at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was 3,919,986 for both years.
    The Plan has acquired and held Huntington common stock in
    compliance at all times with Section 407 of the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act of 1978.

Dividends and interest received by the Plan during 2009 and 2008
    were $8.4 million and $21.0 million, respectively.



At December 31, 2009, the following table shows when
    benefit payments, which include expected future service, as
    appropriate, were expected to be paid:

There is no expected minimum contribution for 2010 to the Plan.
    However, Huntington may choose to make a contribution to the
    Plan up to the maximum deductible limit in the 2010 plan year.
    Expected contributions for 2010 to the post-retirement benefit
    plan are $3.8 million.

The assumed health-care cost trend rate has an effect on the
    amounts reported. A one percentage point increase would decrease
    service and interest costs and the post-retirement benefit
    obligation by $0.1 million and $0.4 million,
    respectively. A one-percentage point decrease would increase
    service and interest costs and the post-retirement benefit
    obligation by $0.1 million, and $0.4 million
    respectively. The 2010 health-care cost trend rate was projected
    to be 8.5% for pre-65 participants and 9.3% for post-65
    participants compared with an estimate of 8.8% for pre-65
    participants and 9.8% for post-65 participants in 2009. These
    rates are assumed to decrease gradually until they reach 4.5%
    for both pre-65 participants and post-65 participants in the
    year 2028 and remain at that level thereafter. Huntington
    updated the immediate health-care cost trend rate assumption
    based on current market data and Huntington’s claims
    experience. This trend rate is expected to decline over time to
    a trend level consistent with medical inflation and long-term
    economic assumptions.

Huntington also sponsors other retirement plans, the most
    significant being the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and
    the Supplemental Retirement Income Plan. These plans are
    nonqualified plans that provide certain current and former
    officers and directors of Huntington and its subsidiaries with
    defined pension benefits in excess of limits imposed by federal
    tax law. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, Huntington has an
    accrued pension liability of $22.8 million and
    $38.5 million, respectively associated with these plans.
    Pension expense for the plans was $2.8 million,
    $2.4 million, and $2.5 million in 2009, 2008, and
    2007, respectively.

The following table presents the amounts recognized in the

Huntington has a defined contribution plan that is available to
    eligible employees. In the first quarter of 2009, the Plan was
    amended to eliminate employer matching contributions effective
    on or after March 15, 2009. Prior to March 15, 2009,
    Huntington matched participant contributions, up to the first 3%
    of base pay contributed to the plan. Half of the employee
    contribution was matched on the 4th and 5th percent of
    base pay contributed to the plan. The cost of providing this
    plan was $3.1 million in 2009, $15.0 million in 2008,
    and $12.9 million in 2007. The number of shares of
    Huntington common stock held by this plan was 14,714,170 at
    December 31, 2009, and 8,055,336 at December 31, 2008.
    The market value of these shares was $53.7 million and
    $61.7 million at the same respective dates. Dividends
    received by the plan were $5.1 million during 2009 and
    $14.3 million during 2008.

21.

FAIR
    VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

Huntington follows the fair value accounting guidance under ASC
    820 and ASC 825.

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be
    received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit
    price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the
    asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants on the measurement date. A three-level valuation
    hierarchy was established for disclosure of fair value
    measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the
    transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability
    as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as
    follows:

Level 1

— inputs to the valuation
    methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets
    or liabilities in active markets.

Level 2

— inputs to the valuation
    methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and
    liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable
    for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for
    substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

Level 3

— inputs to the valuation
    methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value
    measurement.

A financial instrument’s categorization within the
    valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that
    is significant to the fair value measurement.

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used
    for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general
    classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation
    hierarchy.

Financial Instrument(1)

Hierarchy

Valuation methodology

Mortgage loans

held-for-sale

Level 2

As of January 1, 2008, Huntington elected to apply the fair
    value option for mortgage loans originated with the intent to
    sell which are included in loans held for sale. Mortgage loans
    held-for-sale are estimated using security prices for similar
    product types. At December 31, 2009, mortgage loans held for
    sale had an aggregate fair value of $459.7 million and an
    aggregate outstanding principal balance of $453.9 million.
    Interest income on these loans is recorded in interest and fees
    on loans and leases. Included in mortgage banking income were
    net gains resulting from changes in fair value of these loans,
    including net realized gains of $90.6 million and $32.2 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



Financial Instrument(1)

Hierarchy

Valuation methodology

Investment Securities & Trading Account
    Securities(2)

Level 1

Consist of U.S. Treasury and other federal agency securities,
    and money market mutual funds which generally have quoted prices.

Level 2

Consist of U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed securities
    and municipal securities for which an active market is not
    available. Third-party pricing services provide a fair value
    estimate based upon trades of similar financial instruments.

Level 3

Consist of asset-backed securities, pooled

trust-preferred

securities, certain private label CMOs, and residual interest in
    auto securitizations for which fair value is estimated.
    Assumptions used to determine the fair value of these securities
    have greater subjectivity due to the lack of observable market
    transactions. Generally, there are only limited trades of
    similar instruments and a discounted cash flow approach is used
    to determine fair value.

Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)(3)

Level 3

MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily
    observable prices. Although sales of MSRs do occur, the precise
    terms and conditions typically are not readily available.  Fair
    value is based upon the final month-end valuation, which
    utilizes the month-end curve and prepayment assumptions.

Derivatives(4)

Level 1

Consist of exchange traded options and forward commitments to
    deliver mortgage-backed securities which have quoted prices.

Level 2

Consist of basic asset and liability conversion swaps and
    options, and interest rate caps. These derivative positions are
    valued using internally developed models that use readily
    observable market parameters.

Level 3

Consist primarily of interest rate lock agreements related to
    mortgage loan commitments. The determination of fair value
    includes assumptions related to the likelihood that a commitment
    will ultimately result in a closed loan, which is a significant
    unobservable assumption.

Equity Investments(5)

Level 3

Consist of equity investments via equity funds (holding both
    private and publicly-traded equity securities), directly in
    companies as a minority interest investor, and directly in
    companies in conjunction with our mezzanine lending activities.
    These investments do not have readily observable prices. Fair
    value is based upon a variety of factors, including but not
    limited to, current operating performance and future
    expectations of the particular investment, industry valuations
    of comparable public companies, and changes in market outlook.

    same counterparties.

The tables below present a rollforward of the balance sheet
    amounts for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, for
    financial instruments measured on a recurring basis and
    classified as Level 3. The classification of an item as
    Level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable
    inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However,
    Level 3 measurements may also include observable components
    of value that can be validated externally. Accordingly, the
    gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair
    value due in part to observable factors that are part of the
    valuation methodology. Transfers in and out of Level 3 are
    presented in the tables below at fair value at the beginning of

Assets
    and Liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring
    basis

Certain assets and liabilities may be required to be measured at
    fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to
    their initial recognition. These assets and liabilities are not
    measured at fair value on an ongoing basis; however, they are
    subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such
    as when there is evidence of impairment.

Periodically, Huntington records nonrecurring adjustments of
    collateral-dependent loans measured for impairment when
    establishing the allowance for credit losses. Such amounts are
    generally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral
    supporting the loan. In cases where the carrying value exceeds
    the fair value of the collateral, an impairment charge is
    recognized. During the years ended 2009 and 2008, Huntington
    identified $898.0 million, and $307.9 million,
    respectively, of impaired loans for which the fair value is
    recorded based upon collateral value, a Level 3 input in
    the valuation hierarchy. For the years ended December 31,
    2009 and 2008, nonrecurring fair value losses of
    $305.4 million and $103.3 million, respectively, were
    recorded within the provision for credit losses.

Other real estate owned properties are valued based on
    appraisals and third party price opinions, less estimated
    selling costs. During 2009 and 2008, Huntington recorded
    $140.1 million and $122.5 million, respectively of
    OREO assets at fair value. Losses of $93.9 million and
    $33.5 million were recorded within noninterest expense.

Goodwill at March 31, 2009 with a carrying amount of
    $3.0 billion was written down to its implied fair value of
    $351.3 million. Also during the 2009 second quarter,
    goodwill related to the sale of a small payments-related
    business completed in July 2009,with a carrying amount of
    $8.5 million was written down to its implied fair value of
    $4.2 million.

The short-term nature of certain assets and liabilities result
    in their carrying value approximating fair value. These include
    trading account securities, customers’ acceptance
    liabilities, short-term borrowings, bank acceptances
    outstanding, Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and cash and
    short-term assets, which include cash and due from banks,
    interest-bearing deposits in banks, and federal funds sold and
    securities purchased under resale agreements. Loan commitments
    and letters of credit generally have short-term, variable-rate
    features and contain clauses that limit Huntington’s
    exposure to changes in customer credit quality. Accordingly,
    their carrying values, which are immaterial at the respective
    balance sheet dates, are reasonable estimates of fair value. Not
    all the financial instruments listed in the table above are
    subject to the disclosure provisions of ASC 820.

Certain assets, the most significant being operating lease
    assets, bank owned life insurance, and premises and equipment,
    do not meet the definition of a financial instrument and are
    excluded from this disclosure. Similarly, mortgage and
    non-mortgage servicing rights, deposit base, and other customer
    relationship intangibles are not considered financial
    instruments and are not included above. Accordingly, this fair
    value information is not intended to, and does not, represent
    Huntington’s underlying value. Many of the assets and
    liabilities subject to the disclosure requirements are not
    actively traded, requiring fair values to be estimated by
    management. These estimations necessarily involve the use of
    judgment about a wide variety of factors, including but not
    limited to, relevancy of market prices of comparable
    instruments, expected future cash flows, and appropriate
    discount rates.

The following methods and assumptions were used by Huntington to
    estimate the fair value of the remaining classes of financial
    instruments:

Loans and
    Direct Financing Leases

Variable-rate loans that reprice frequently are based on
    carrying amounts, as adjusted for estimated credit losses. The
    fair values for other loans and leases are estimated using
    discounted cash flow analyses and employ interest rates
    currently being offered for loans and leases with similar terms.
    The rates take into account the position of the yield curve, as
    well as an adjustment for prepayment risk, operating costs, and



profit. This value is also reduced by an estimate of probable
    losses and the credit risk associated in the loan and lease
    portfolio. The valuation of the loan portfolio reflected
    discounts that Huntington believed are consistent with
    transactions occurring in the market place.

Deposits

Demand deposits, savings accounts, and money market deposits
    are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand. The
    fair values of fixed-rate time deposits are estimated by
    discounting cash flows using interest rates currently being
    offered on certificates with similar maturities.

Debt

Fixed-rate, long-term debt is based upon quoted market prices,
    which are inclusive of Huntington’s credit risk. In the
    absence of quoted market prices, discounted cash flows using
    market rates for similar debt with the same maturities are used
    in the determination of fair value.

22.

DERIVATIVE
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Derivative financial instruments are recorded in the
    consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or a liability (in
    other assets or other liabilities, respectively) and measured at
    fair value.

Derivatives
    used in Asset and Liability Management Activities

A variety of derivative financial instruments, principally
    interest rate swaps, are used in asset and liability management
    activities to protect against the risk of adverse price or
    interest rate movements. These instruments provide flexibility
    in adjusting Huntington’s sensitivity to changes in
    interest rates without exposure to loss of principal and higher
    funding requirements. Huntington records derivatives at fair
    value, as further described in Note 21. Collateral
    agreements are regularly entered into as part of the underlying
    derivative agreements with Huntington’s counterparties to
    mitigate counter party credit risk. At December 31, 2009
    and 2008, aggregate credit risk associated with these
    derivatives, net of collateral that has been pledged by the
    counterparty, was $20.3 million and $40.7 million,
    respectively. The credit risk associated with interest rate
    swaps is calculated after considering master netting agreements.

At December 31, 2009, Huntington pledged
    $230.7 million investment security and cash collateral to
    various counterparties, while various other counterparties
    pledged $74.5 million investment security and cash
    collateral to Huntington to satisfy collateral netting
    agreements. In the event of credit downgrades, Huntington could
    be required to provide an additional $1.8 million in
    collateral.

The following table presents the gross notional values of

These derivative financial instruments were entered into for the
    purpose of managing the interest rate risk of assets and
    liabilities. Consequently, net amounts receivable or payable on
    contracts hedging either interest earning assets or interest
    bearing liabilities were accrued as an adjustment to either
    interest income or interest expense. The net amounts resulted in
    an increase/(decrease) to net interest income of
    $167.9 million, $10.5 million, and $(3.0) million
    for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

In connection with securitization activities, Huntington
    purchased interest rate caps with a notional value totaling
    $1.1 billion. These purchased caps were assigned to the
    securitization trust for the benefit of the security holders.
    Interest rate caps were also sold totaling $1.1 billion
    outside the securitization structure. Both the purchased and
    sold caps are marked to market through income.

In connection with the sale of Huntington’s class B
    Visa shares, Huntington entered into a swap agreement with the
    purchaser of the shares. The swap agreement adjusts for dilution
    in the conversion ratio of class B shares resulting from
    the Visa litigation. At December 31, the fair value of the
    swap liability of $3.9 million is an estimate of the
    exposure liability based upon Huntington’s assessment of
    the probability-weighted potential Visa litigation losses.

The following table presents the fair values at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 of Huntington’s derivatives
    that are designated and not designated as hedging instruments.

    obligations to floating rate. The changes in fair value of the
    derivative are, to the extent that the hedging



relationship is effective, recorded through earnings and offset
    against changes in the fair value of the hedged item.

For cash flow hedges, interest rate swap contracts were entered
    into that pay fixed-rate interest in exchange for the receipt of
    variable-rate interest without the exchange of the
    contract’s underlying notional amount, which effectively
    converts a portion of its floating-rate debt to fixed-rate. This
    reduces the potentially adverse impact of increases in interest
    rates on future interest expense. Other LIBOR-based commercial
    and industrial loans were effectively converted to fixed-rate by
    entering into contracts that swap certain variable-rate interest
    payments for fixed-rate interest payments at designated times.

To the extent these derivatives are effective in offsetting the
    variability of the hedged cash flows, changes in the
    derivatives’ fair value will not be included in current
    earnings but are reported as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. These changes
    in fair value will be included in earnings of future periods
    when earnings are also affected by the changes in the hedged
    cash flows. To the extent these derivatives are not effective,
    changes in their fair values are immediately included in
    interest income.

Derivatives
    used in trading activities

Various derivative financial instruments are offered to enable
    customers to meet their financing and investing objectives and
    for their risk management purposes. Derivative financial
    instruments used in trading activities consisted predominantly
    of interest rate swaps, but also included interest rate caps,
    floors, and futures, as well as foreign exchange options.
    Interest rate options grant the option holder the right to buy
    or sell an underlying financial instrument for a predetermined
    price before the contract expires. Interest rate futures are
    commitments to either purchase or sell a financial instrument at
    a future date for a specified price or yield and may be settled
    in cash or through delivery of the underlying financial
    instrument. Interest rate caps and floors are option-based
    contracts that entitle the buyer to receive cash payments based
    on the difference between a designated reference rate and a
    strike price, applied to a notional amount. Written options,
    primarily caps, expose Huntington to market risk but not credit
    risk. Purchased options contain both credit and market risk. The
    interest rate risk of these customer derivatives is mitigated by
    entering into similar derivatives having offsetting terms with
    other counterparties. The credit risk to these customers is
    evaluated and included in the calculation of fair value.

The net fair values of these derivative financial instruments,
    for which the gross amounts are included in other assets or
    other liabilities at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were
    $45.1 million and $41.9 million, respectively. Changes
    in fair value of $10.2 million, $27.0 million, and
    $17.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively, were reflected in other noninterest
    income. The total notional values of derivative financial
    instruments used by Huntington on behalf of customers, including
    offsetting derivatives, were $9.6 billion and
    $10.9 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Huntington’s credit risks from interest rate
    swaps used for trading purposes were $255.7 million and
    $429.9 million at the same dates, respectively.

Derivatives
    used in mortgage banking activities

Huntington also uses certain derivative financial instruments to
    offset changes in value of its residential mortgage servicing
    assets. These derivatives consist primarily of forward interest
    rate agreements and forward mortgage securities. The derivative
    instruments used are not designated as hedges. Accordingly, such



derivatives are recorded at fair value with changes in fair
    value reflected in mortgage banking income. The following table
    summarizes the derivative assets and liabilities used in
    mortgage banking activities:

    notional amount at December 31, 2009 corresponds to trading
    assets with a fair value of $3.2 million and trading
    liabilities with a fair value of $15.5 million. The gains
    and (losses) related to derivative instruments included in
    mortgage banking income for the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007 were ($41.2) million,
    ($19.0) million and ($25.5) million, respectively.
    Total MSR hedging gains and (losses) for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, were
    ($37.8) million, $22.4 million and
    ($1.7) million, respectively, and were also included in
    mortgage banking income.

VARIABLE
    INTEREST ENTITIES

Consolidated
    Variable Interest Entities

Consolidated variable interest entities at December 31,
    2009 consist of the Franklin 2009 Trust (See
    Note 5) and certain loan securitization trusts. Loan
    securitizations include auto loan and lease securitization
    trusts formed in 2008, 2006, and 2000. Huntington has determined
    that the trusts are not qualified special purpose entities and,
    therefore, are variable interest entities (VIEs) based upon
    equity guidelines established in ASC 810. Huntington owns 100%
    of the trusts and is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs,
    therefore, the trusts are consolidated. The carrying amount and
    classification of the trusts’ assets and liabilities
    included in the consolidated balance sheet are as follows:

The auto loans and leases were designated to repay the
    securitized notes. Huntington services the loans and leases and
    uses the proceeds from principal and interest payments to pay
    the securitized notes during the amortization period. Huntington
    has not provided financial or other support that was not
    previously contractually required.

Trust Preferred
    Securities

Huntington has certain wholly-owned trusts that are not
    consolidated. The trusts have been formed for the sole purpose
    of issuing trust preferred securities, from which the proceeds
    are then invested in Huntington junior subordinated debentures,
    which are reflected in Huntington’s condensed consolidated
    balance sheet as subordinated notes. The trust securities are
    the obligations of the trusts and are not consolidated within
    Huntington’s balance sheet. A list of trust preferred
    securities outstanding at December 31, 2009 follows:

Represents the principal amount of debentures issued to each
    trust, including unamortized original issue discount.

Huntington’s investment in the unconsolidated trusts
    represents the only risk of loss.

As mentioned in Note 14, during 2009, Huntington
    repurchased $702.4 million of junior subordinated
    debentures, bank subordinated notes and medium-term notes
    resulting in net pre-tax gains of $147.4 million. In 2008,
    $48.5 million of the junior subordinated debentures were
    repurchased resulting in net pre-tax gains of $23.5 million.

These transactions have been recorded as gains on early
    extinguishment of debt, a reduction of noninterest expense in
    the consolidated financial statements.

Each issue of the junior subordinated debentures has an interest
    rate equal to the corresponding trust securities distribution
    rate. Huntington has the right to defer payment of interest on
    the debentures at any time, or from time to time for a period
    not exceeding five years, provided that no extension period may
    extend beyond the stated maturity of the related debentures.
    During any such extension period, distributions to the



trust securities will also be deferred and Huntington’s
    ability to pay dividends on its common stock will be restricted.
    Periodic cash payments and payments upon liquidation or
    redemption with respect to trust securities are guaranteed by
    Huntington to the extent of funds held by the trusts. The
    guarantee ranks subordinate and junior in right of payment to
    all indebtedness of the company to the same extent as the junior
    subordinated debt. The guarantee does not place a limitation on
    the amount of additional indebtedness that may be incurred by
    Huntington.

Low
    Income Housing Tax Credit Partnerships

Huntington makes certain equity investments in various limited
    partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing
    the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) pursuant to
    Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of
    these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on
    capital, to facilitate the sale of additional affordable housing
    product offerings and to assist us in achieving goals associated
    with the Community Reinvestment Act. The primary activities of
    the limited partnerships include the identification,
    development, and operation of multi-family housing that is
    leased to qualifying residential tenants. Generally, these types
    of investments are funded through a combination of debt and
    equity.

Huntington does not own a majority of the limited partnership
    interests in these entities and is not the primary beneficiary.
    Huntington uses the equity method to account for the majority of
    its investments in these entities. These investments are
    included in accrued income and other assets. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, Huntington has commitments of
    $285.3 million and $216.2 million, respectively of
    which $192.7 million and $166.4 million, respectively
    are funded. The unfunded portion is included in accrued expenses
    and other liabilities.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

Commitments
    to extend credit

In the ordinary course of business, Huntington makes various
    commitments to extend credit that are not reflected in the
    financial statements. The contract amounts of these financial
    agreements at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
    were as follows:

Standby letters of credit

Commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration
    dates, are variable-rate, and contain clauses that permit
    Huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts
    in the event of a significant deterioration in the
    customer’s credit quality. These arrangements normally
    require the payment of a fee by the customer, the pricing of
    which is based on prevailing market conditions, credit quality,
    probability of funding, and other relevant factors. Since many
    of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn
    upon, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of
    future cash requirements. The interest rate risk arising from
    these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of
    their predominantly short-term, variable-rate nature.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to
    guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These
    guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private
    borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond
    financing, and similar transactions. Most of these arrangements
    mature within two years. The carrying amount of deferred revenue
    associated with these guarantees was $2.8 million and
    $4.5 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.



Through the Company’s credit process, Huntington monitors
    the credit risks of outstanding standby letters of credit. When
    it is probable that a standby letter of credit will be drawn and
    not repaid in full, losses are recognized in the provision for
    credit losses. At December 31, 2009, Huntington had
    $0.6 billion of standby letters of credit outstanding, of
    which 60% were collateralized. Included in this
    $0.6 billion total are letters of credit issued by the Bank
    that support securities that were issued by customers and
    remarketed by The Huntington Investment Company (HIC), the
    Company’s broker-dealer subsidiary. As a result of a change
    in credit ratings and pursuant to the letters of credit issued
    by the Bank, the Bank repurchased substantially all of these
    securities, net of payments and maturities, during 2009.

Huntington uses an internal loan grading system to assess an
    estimate of loss on its loan and lease portfolio. The same loan
    grading system is used to help monitor credit risk associated
    with standby letters of credit. Under this risk rating system as
    of December 31, 2009, approximately $83.7 million of
    the standby letters of credit were rated strong with sufficient
    asset quality, liquidity, and good debt capacity and coverage,
    approximately $440.3 million were rated average with
    acceptable asset quality, liquidity, and modest debt capacity;
    and approximately $68.8 million were rated substandard with
    negative financial trends, structural weaknesses, operating
    difficulties, and higher leverage.

Commercial letters of credit represent short-term,
    self-liquidating instruments that facilitate customer trade
    transactions and generally have maturities of no longer than
    90 days. The goods or cargo being traded normally secures
    these instruments.

Commitments
    to sell loans

Huntington enters into forward contracts relating to its
    mortgage banking business to hedge the exposures from
    commitments to make new residential mortgage loans with existing
    customers and from mortgage loans classified as held for sale.
    At December 31, 2009 and 2008, Huntington had commitments
    to sell residential real estate loans of $662.9 million and
    $759.4 million, respectively. These contracts mature in
    less than one year.

Litigation

Between December 19, 2007 and February 1, 2008, two
    putative class actions were filed in the United States
    District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern
    Division, against Huntington and certain of its current or
    former officers and directors purportedly on behalf of
    purchasers of Huntington securities during the periods
    July 20, 2007 to November 16, 2007, or July 20,
    2007 to January 10, 2008. On June 5, 2008, the two
    cases were consolidated into a single action. On August 22,
    2008, a consolidated complaint was filed asserting a class
    period of July 19, 2007 through November 16, 2007,
    alleging that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act),
    and

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange
    Act by issuing a series of allegedly false

and/or

misleading statements concerning Huntington’s financial
    results, prospects, and condition, relating, in particular, to
    its transactions with Franklin. The action was dismissed with
    prejudice on December 4, 2009, and the plaintiffs
    thereafter filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court
    of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Because the case is currently
    being appealed, it is not possible for management to assess the
    probability of an adverse outcome, or reasonably estimate the
    amount of any potential loss.

Three putative derivative lawsuits were filed in the Court of
    Common Pleas of Delaware County, Ohio, the United States
    District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern
    Division, and the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County,
    Ohio, between January 16, 2008, and April 17, 2008,
    against certain of Huntington’s current or former officers
    and directors variously seeking to allege breaches of fiduciary
    duty, waste of corporate assets, abuse of control, gross
    mismanagement, and unjust enrichment, all in connection with
    Huntington’s acquisition of Sky Financial, certain
    transactions between Huntington and Franklin, and the financial
    disclosures relating to such transactions. Huntington is named
    as a nominal defendant in each of these actions. The derivative
    action filed in the United States District Court for the
    Southern District of Ohio was dismissed with prejudice on
    September 23, 2009. The plaintiff in that action thereafter
    filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals
    for the Sixth Circuit, but the appeal was dismissed at the



plaintiff’s request on January 12, 2010. That
    plaintiff subsequently sent a letter to Huntington’s Board
    of Directors demanding that it initiate certain litigation,
    which letter has been taken under advisement. Motions to dismiss
    the other two actions were filed on March 10, 2008, and
    January 26, 2009, and currently are pending. At this stage
    of the proceedings, it is not possible for management to assess
    the probability of an adverse outcome, or reasonably estimate
    the amount of any potential loss.

Between February 20, 2008 and February 29, 2008, three
    putative class action lawsuits were filed in the United States
    District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern
    Division, against Huntington, the Huntington Bancshares
    Incorporated Pension Review Committee, the Huntington Investment
    and Tax Savings Plan (the Plan) Administrative Committee, and
    certain of the Company’s officers and directors purportedly
    on behalf of participants in or beneficiaries of the Plan
    between either July 1, 2007 or July 20, 2007 and the
    present. On May 14, 2008, the three cases were consolidated
    into a single action. On August 4, 2008, a consolidated
    complaint was filed asserting a class period of July 1,
    2007 through the present, alleging breaches of fiduciary duties
    in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
    (ERISA) relating to Huntington stock being offered as an
    investment alternative for participants in the Plan and seeking
    money damages and equitable relief. On February 9, 2009,
    the court entered an order dismissing with prejudice the
    consolidated lawsuit in its entirety, and the plaintiffs
    thereafter filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court
    of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. During the pendency of the
    appeal, the parties to the appeal commenced settlement
    discussions and have reached an agreement in principle to settle
    this litigation on a classwide basis for $1,450,000, subject to
    the drafting of definitive settlement documentation and court
    approval. Because the settlement has not been finalized or
    approved, it is not possible for management to make further
    comment at this time.

On May 7, 2008, a putative class action lawsuit was filed
    in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
    Ohio, Eastern Division, against Huntington (as successor in
    interest to Sky Financial), and certain of Sky Financial’s
    former officers on behalf of all persons who purchased or
    acquired Sky Financial common stock in connection with and as a
    result of Sky Financial’s October 2006 acquisition of
    Waterfield Mortgage Company. The complaint alleged that the
    defendants violated Sections 11, 12, and 15 of the
    Securities Act of 1933 in connection with the issuance of
    allegedly false and misleading registration and proxy statements
    leading up to the Waterfield acquisition and their disclosures
    about the nature and extent of Sky Financial’s lending
    relationship with Franklin. On May 1, 2009, the plaintiff
    filed a stipulation dismissing the lawsuit with prejudice. The
    dismissal entry was approved by the Court on May 5, 2009,
    and the case is now terminated.

Commitments
    Under Capital and Operating Lease Obligations

At December 31, 2009, Huntington and its subsidiaries were
    obligated under noncancelable leases for land, buildings, and
    equipment. Many of these leases contain renewal options and
    certain leases provide options to purchase the leased property
    during or at the expiration of the lease period at specified
    prices. Some leases contain escalation clauses calling for
    rentals to be adjusted for increased real estate taxes and other
    operating expenses or proportionately adjusted for increases in
    the consumer or other price indices.

The future minimum rental payments required under operating
    leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms
    in excess of one year as of December 31, 2009, were
    $44.8 million in 2010, $42.7 million in 2011,
    $41.2 million in 2012, $38.5 million in 2013,
    $35.3 million in 2014, and $155.2 million thereafter.
    At December 31, 2009, total minimum lease payments have not
    been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $36.7 million
    due in the future under noncancelable subleases. At
    December 31, 2009, the future minimum sublease rental
    payments that Huntington expects to receive are
    $14.5 million in 2010; $11.5 million in 2011;
    $3.7 million in 2012; $3.2 million in 2013;
    $2.4 million in 2014; and $1.4 million thereafter. The
    rental expense for all operating leases was $49.8 million,
    $53.4 million, and $51.3 million for 2009, 2008, and
    2007, respectively. Huntington had no material obligations under
    capital leases.



25.

OTHER
    REGULATORY MATTERS

Huntington and its bank subsidiary, The Huntington National
    Bank, are subject to various regulatory capital requirements
    administered by federal and state banking agencies. These
    requirements involve qualitative judgments and quantitative
    measures of assets, liabilities, capital amounts, and certain
    off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory
    accounting practices. Failure to meet minimum capital
    requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that, if
    undertaken, could have a material adverse effect on
    Huntington’s and The Huntington National Bank’s
    financial statements. Applicable capital adequacy guidelines
    require minimum ratios of 4.00% for Tier 1 Risk-based
    Capital, 8.00% for Total Risk-based Capital, and 4.00% for
    Tier 1 Leverage Capital. To be considered
    “well-capitalized” under the regulatory framework for
    prompt corrective action, the ratios must be at least 6.00%,
    10.00%, and 5.00%, respectively.

As of December 31, 2009, Huntington and The Huntington
    National Bank (the Bank) met all capital adequacy requirements
    and had regulatory capital ratios in excess of the levels
    established for

“well-capitalized”

institutions. The period-end capital amounts and capital ratios
    of Huntington and the Bank are as follows:

Tier 1 Risk-based Capital consists of total equity plus
    qualifying capital securities and minority interest, excluding
    unrealized gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive
    income, and non-qualifying intangible and servicing assets.
    Total Risk-based Capital is Tier 1 Risk-based Capital plus
    qualifying subordinated notes and allowable allowances for
    credit losses (limited to 1.25% of total risk-weighted assets).
    Tier 1 Leverage Capital is equal to Tier 1 Capital.
    Both Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios are derived by
    dividing the respective capital amounts by net risk-weighted
    assets, which are calculated as prescribed by regulatory
    agencies. Tier 1 Leverage Capital ratio is calculated by
    dividing the Tier 1 capital amount by average total assets
    for the fourth quarter of 2009 and 2008, less non-qualifying
    intangibles and other adjustments.

The parent company has the ability to provide additional capital
    to the Bank to maintain the Bank’s risk-based capital
    ratios at levels at which would be considered
    “well-capitalized.”

Huntington and its subsidiaries are also subject to various
    regulatory requirements that impose restrictions on cash, debt,
    and dividends. The Bank is required to maintain cash reserves
    based on the level of certain of its deposits. This reserve
    requirement may be met by holding cash in banking offices or on
    deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank. During 2009 and 2008, the
    average balance of these deposits were $1.4 billion and
    $44.8 million, respectively.

Under current Federal Reserve regulations, the Bank is limited
    as to the amount and type of loans it may make to the parent
    company and non-bank subsidiaries. At December 31, 2009,
    the Bank could lend $478.0 million to a single affiliate,
    subject to the qualifying collateral requirements defined in the
    regulations.

Dividends from the Bank are one of the major sources of funds
    for Huntington. These funds aid the parent company in the
    payment of dividends to shareholders, expenses, and other
    obligations. Payment of dividends to the parent company is
    subject to various legal and regulatory limitations. Regulatory
    approval is required prior to the declaration of any dividends
    in excess of available retained earnings. The amount of
    dividends that may be declared without regulatory approval is
    further limited to the sum of net income for the current year
    and retained net income for the preceding two years, less any
    required transfers to surplus or



common stock. At December 31, 2009, the bank could not have
    declared and paid additional dividends to the parent company
    without regulatory approval.

SEGMENT
    REPORTING

In the second quarter of 2009, Huntington reorganized its
    Regional Banking segment to reflect how its assets and
    operations are now managed. The Regional Banking line of
    business, which through March 31, 2009, had been managed
    geographically, is now managed on a product segment approach.
    The five distinct segments are: Retail and Business Banking,
    Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Auto Finance and
    Dealer Services (AFDS), and the Private Financial Group (PFG). A
    sixth group includes the Treasury function and other unallocated
    assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense. All periods have been
    reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

Segment results are determined based upon the Company’s
    management reporting system, which assigns balance sheet and
    income statement items to each of the business segments. The
    process is designed around the Company’s organizational and
    management structure and, accordingly, the results derived are
    not



necessarily comparable with similar information published by
    other financial institutions. An overview of this system is
    provided below, along with a description of each segment and
    discussion of financial results.

Retail and Business Banking:

This segment
    provides traditional banking products and services to consumer
    and small business customers located in its 11 operating regions
    within the six states of Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Indiana,
    West Virginia, and Kentucky. It provides these services through
    a banking network of over 600 branches, and over 1,300 ATMs,
    along with internet and telephone banking channels. It also
    provides certain services on a limited basis outside of these
    six states, including mortgage banking and small business
    administration (SBA) lending. Retail products and services
    include home equity loans and lines of credit, first mortgage
    loans, direct installment loans, small business loans, personal
    and business deposit products, treasury management products, as
    well as sales of investment and insurance services. At
    December 31, 2009, Retail and Business Banking
    accounted for 39% and 71% of consolidated loans and leases and
    deposits, respectively.

Commercial Banking:

This segment provides a
    variety of banking products and services to customers within the
    Company’s primary banking markets who generally have larger
    credit exposures and sales revenues compared with its Retail and
    Business Banking customers. Commercial Banking products include
    commercial loans, international trade, cash management, leasing,
    interest rate protection products, capital market alternatives,
    401(k) plans, and mezzanine investment capabilities. The
    Commercial Banking team also serves customers that specialize in
    equipment leasing, as well as serves the commercial banking
    needs of government entities,

not-for-profit

organizations, and large corporations. Commercial bankers
    personally deliver these products and services by developing
    leads through community involvement, referrals from other
    professionals, and targeted prospect calling.

Commercial Real Estate:

This segment serves
    professional real estate developers or other customers with real
    estate project financing needs within the Company’s primary
    banking markets. Commercial Real Estate products and services
    include CRE loans, cash management, interest rate protection
    products, and capital market alternatives. Commercial real
    estate bankers personally deliver these products and services
    by: (a) relationships with developers in the Company’s
    footprint who are recognized as the most experienced,
    well-managed, and well-capitalized, and are capable of operating
    in all phases of the real estate cycle

(“top-tier

developers”), (b) leads through community involvement,
    and (c) referrals from other professionals.

Auto Finance and Dealer Services (AFDS):

This
    segment provides a variety of banking products and services to
    approximately 2,200 automotive dealerships within the
    Company’s primary banking markets. During the first quarter
    of 2009, AFDS discontinued lending activities in Arizona,
    Florida, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Also, all lease
    origination activities were discontinued during the 2008 fourth
    quarter. AFDS finances the purchase of automobiles by customers
    at the automotive dealerships; finances dealerships’ new
    and used vehicle inventories, land, buildings, and other real
    estate owned by the dealership; finances dealership working
    capital needs; and provides other banking services to the
    automotive dealerships and their owners. Competition from the
    financing divisions of automobile manufacturers and from other
    financial institutions is intense. AFDS’ production
    opportunities are directly impacted by the general automotive
    sales business, including programs initiated by manufacturers to
    enhance and increase sales directly. Huntington has been in this
    line of business for over 50 years.

Private Financial Group (PFG):

This segment
    provides products and services designed to meet the needs of
    higher net worth customers. Revenue results from the sale of
    trust, asset management, investment advisory, brokerage,
    insurance, and private banking products and services including
    credit and lending activities. PFG also focuses on financial
    solutions for corporate and institutional customers that include
    investment banking, sales and trading of securities, and
    interest rate risk management products. To serve high net worth
    customers, we use a unique distribution model that employs a
    single, unified sales force to deliver products and services
    mainly through Retail and Business Banking distribution channels.

In addition to the Company’s five business segments, the
    Treasury/Other group includes revenue and expense related to
    assets, liabilities, and equity that are not directly assigned
    or allocated to one of the five business segments. Assets in
    this group include investment securities and bank owned life
    insurance. Net interest income/(expense) includes the net impact
    of administering the Company’s investment securities



portfolios as part of overall liquidity management. A
    match-funded transfer pricing (FTP) system is used to attribute
    appropriate funding interest income and interest expense to
    other business segments. As such, net interest income includes
    the net impact of any over or under allocations arising from
    centralized management of interest rate risk. Furthermore, net
    interest income includes the net impact of derivatives used to
    hedge interest rate sensitivity. Non-interest income includes
    miscellaneous fee income not allocated to other business
    segments, including bank owned life insurance income. Fee income
    also includes asset revaluations not allocated to business
    segments, as well as any investment securities and trading
    assets gains or losses. The non-interest expense includes
    certain corporate administrative, merger costs, and other
    miscellaneous expenses not allocated to business segments. This
    group also includes any difference between the actual effective
    tax rate of Huntington and the statutory tax rate used to
    allocate income taxes to the other segments.

In 2009, a comprehensive review of the FTP methodology resulted
    in changes to various assumptions, including liquidity premiums.
    Business segment financial performance for 2009 reflect the
    methodology changes, however, financial performance for 2008 was
    not restated to reflect these changes, as the changes for that
    year were not material. As a result of this change, business
    segment performance for net interest income comparisons between
    2009 and 2008 are affected.

The management accounting process used to develop the business
    segment reporting utilized various estimates and allocation
    methodologies to measure the performance of the business
    segments. During 2009, Huntington implemented a full-allocation
    methodology, where all Treasury/Other expenses, except those
    related to servicing Franklin assets, reported “Significant
    Items” (excluding the goodwill impairment), and a small
    residual of other unallocated expenses, are allocated to the
    other five business segments. Prior to this implementation, only
    certain expenses were allocated to the five business segments.
    Business segment financial performance for 2009 reflect the
    implementation, however, financial performance for 2008 was not
    restated to reflect these changes, as the methodology in place
    at that time was appropriate. As a result of this change,
    business segment performance comparisons for noninterest expense
    between 2009 and 2008 are affected.

    reconciled to Huntington’s 2009, 2008, and 2007 reported

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

Huntington maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed
    to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the
    reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934, as amended, are recorded, processed, summarized,
    and reported within the time periods specified in the
    Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
    procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
    designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
    an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act
    is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management,
    including its principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, as
    appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure. Huntington’s Management, with the participation
    of its Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer,

    this report. Based upon such evaluation, Huntington’s Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
    that, as of the end of such period, Huntington’s disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective.

There have not been any significant changes in Huntington’s
    internal control over financial reporting (as such term is
