PART I

This Report contains forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than
statements of historical fact, including statements regarding
industry prospects and future results of operations or financial
position, made in this Report are forward looking. We use words
such as “anticipate”, “believe”,
“expect”, “intend”, “estimate”
(and the negative of any of these terms), “future” and
similar expressions to help identify forward-looking statements.
These forward-looking statements are subject to business and
economic risk and reflect management’s current
expectations, and are inherently uncertain and difficult to
predict. Our actual results could differ materially. We will not
necessarily update information if any forward-looking statement
later turns out to be inaccurate. Risks and uncertainties that

Item 1:     Business

Overview

Electronic Arts develops, markets, publishes and
distributes interactive software games that are playable by
consumers on the following platforms:

•

home videogame machines (such as the PlayStation
    2, Microsoft Xbox, Nintendo GameCube and PlayStation consoles),

•

personal computers,

•

hand-held game machines (such as the Game Boy
    Advance) and

•

online, over the Internet.

One of our strengths is our ability to publish
interactive software games for multiple platforms, which
provides cost efficiencies in developing and marketing our
products. Our products designed to play on consoles and
handhelds are published under license from the manufacturers of
these platforms (for example, Sony for the PlayStation and
PlayStation 2, Microsoft for the Xbox and Nintendo for the
GameCube and Game Boy Advance) and we pay a fee to these console
manufacturers for the right to publish products on their
platforms. Since our inception, we have published games for over
42 different platforms.

We publish our interactive software games under
three major brands:

•

EA SPORTS – examples of some of our
    recent products published under the EA SPORTS brand are

Madden NFL

™


(professional football),

NCAA® Football 2003

,

FIFA Soccer 2003

,

NBA
    Live 2003

(professional basketball),

NHL® 2003

(hockey),

MVP Baseball

™


and

NASCAR Thunder

™


•

EA GAMES – examples of some of our
    recent products published under the EA GAMES brand are

Harry
    Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

™,

The Lord of the
    Rings

™, The Two Towers™, James Bond 007™

:
    Nightfire

™,

The Sims

™

Superstar,
    SimCity

™


,

Need for Speed

™

Hot
    Pursuit 2

and

Command & Conquer

™

Generals

•

EA SPORTS BIG — examples of some of our
    recent products published under the EA SPORTS BIG brand are

Def Jam Vendetta

(wrestling) and

NBA Street
    Volume 2

(basketball).

Another strength of our business is that we have
developed many of our products to become franchise titles that
can be regularly iterated. For example, every year we release
new versions of most of our EA SPORTS titles. Likewise,
several of the EA GAMES products listed above are part of new or
continuing product franchises. We also release products called
“expansion packs” that provide additional content
(characters, storylines, settings, missions) for games that we
have previously published. For example, we have published
several expansion packs for

The Sims,

including

The
Sims Unleashed Expansion Pack

and

The Sims Vacation
Expansion Pack,

each of which expands the characters,
settings and gameplay of the original

The Sims

game. We
consider titles that iterate, sequel or spawn expansion packs to
be franchise titles.



Our product development methods and organization
are modeled on those used in other sectors of the entertainment
industry. Employees whom we call “producers” are
responsible for overseeing the development of one or more
products. The interactive software games that we publish under
our brands are developed by:

•

EA Studios, our own development and production
    studios located near San Francisco, Los Angeles, Orlando
    (Florida), Vancouver, London and Tokyo, which develop games
    internally and also engage third-parties to develop games on our
    behalf,

•

other game developers who develop their own
    interactive software games with our assistance, which products
    we then publish, market and distribute, referred to as
    “co-publishing products”. An example of a recent
    co-publishing product is

Battlefield 1942

™, which
    was developed by Digital Illusions, C.E.

We invest in the creation of state-of-the-art
software tools that we use in product development. These tools
allow for more cost-effective product development and the
ability to more efficiently convert products from one platform
to another. We have also made investments in facilities and
equipment that allow us to create and edit video and audio
recordings that are used in our games.

We also distribute interactive software games
that are published by other companies, which we refer to as
“distribution products”. An example of a recent
distribution product is

Kingdom Hearts,

which is
published by Square Co. Ltd.

The console, PC and hand-held games that we
publish are made available to consumers on a disk (usually a CD
or DVD format) or a cartridge that is packaged and typically
sold in retail stores and through our own online store. We refer
to these as packaged goods products. In North America and
Europe, our largest markets, these packaged goods products are
sold primarily to retailers that may be mass market retailers
(such as Wal-Mart), electronics specialty stores (such as Best
Buy) or game software specialty stores (such as Electronics
Boutique). In Japan, we also sell a significant volume of our
products through a distributor, who in turn sells them to
retailers. Our products are available in approximately 80,000
retail locations worldwide. We also maintain a smaller business
in which we license to manufacturers of products in related
industries (for example, makers of personal computers or
computer accessories) rights to include certain of our products
with the manufacturer’s product, or offer our products to
consumers who have purchased the manufacturer’s product. We
call these combined products “OEM bundles”.

There are three ways in which we publish games
that are playable online by consumers. First, we include online
features in our PC and PlayStation 2 products, for example by
enabling consumers to play against one another over the
Internet. We also publish games that are playable only online.
One type of these online-only games is called “persistent
state worlds” or massively multiplayer games. Consumers
experience these games as interactive virtual worlds where
thousands of other consumers can interact with one another.
Examples of our persistent state world products are

Ultima
Online, Earth & Beyond

and

The Sims Online

. These
persistent state world games are often sold to consumers in the
form of a CD or DVD that contains much of the software necessary
to play the game online. The other type of online-only games
that we publish are electronic card games, puzzle games and word
games (marketed under the “Pogo” brand) that we make
available to consumers on our website, www.ea.com, and on
certain online services provided by America Online, Inc.

In fiscal 2003, we operated and reported our
business in two business segments:

•

EA Core business segment: creation, marketing and
    distribution of interactive entertainment software.

•

EA.com business segment: creation, marketing and
    distribution of interactive entertainment software which can be
    played or sold online, ongoing management of subscriptions of
    online games and website advertising.

As of April 1, 2003, we are no longer
managing these segments separately. We consider online
functionality to be integral to our existing and future products.



During fiscal 2003, our business was comprised of
the following:

•

Publishing approximately 70 titles that we
    developed and/or published under one of our brands in North
    America, including older titles marketed as Classics.

•

Publishing localized versions of our products in
    the rest of the world.

•

Distribution of co-publishing and distribution
    titles. In North America, we distributed approximately 34
    co-publishing and distribution titles.

Of the titles shipped in fiscal 2003, there were
22 titles that sold over one million units (aggregated across
all platforms). In fiscal 2003, approximately 42 percent of
our net revenue was generated by international operations,
compared to approximately 37 percent in both fiscal 2002
and 2001.

We were initially incorporated in California in
1982. In September 1991, we were reincorporated under the laws
of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 209
Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City, California 94065 and our
telephone number is (650) 628-1500. We file various reports
with, or furnish them to, the SEC. These reports are available
free of charge on our website, www.ea.com, as soon as reasonably
practicable after we electronically file the reports with, or
furnish them to, the SEC.

Intellectual Property

Like other entertainment companies, our business
is based on the creation, acquisition, exploitation and
protection of intellectual property. Each of our products
embodies a number of separately protected intellectual
properties: our products are copyrighted both as software and as
audiovisual works; our product names are trademarks of ours or
others; our products may contain voices and likenesses of third
parties and the musical compositions and performances of third
parties. Our products may also contain other content licensed
from third parties, such as trademarks, fictional characters,
storylines and software code.

We acquire intellectual property rights to
include in our products through license agreements such as those
with the sports leagues and player associations, with movie
studios and performing talent, with music labels and musicians.
These licenses are typically limited to use of the licensed
rights in specific products for specific time periods. In
addition, our products for play on videogame platforms such as
the Sony PlayStation 2 console include intellectual properties
owned by the platform company and licensed non-exclusively to us
for use. While we may have renewal rights for some licenses, our
business is significantly dependent on our ability to continue
to obtain the intellectual property rights from third parties
needed for many of our products.

Our products are susceptible to unauthorized
copying. Our primary protection against unauthorized use,
duplication and distribution of our products is copyright and
trademark. We typically own the copyright to the software code
as well as the brand or title name trademark under which our
products are marketed. We register our copyrights in the United
States, and register our significant trademarks in multiple
countries including the United States. In addition, console
manufacturers such as Sony typically incorporate security
devices in their consoles in an effort to prevent unlicensed use
of products.

Joint Ventures and Investments

Joint
Ventures

In May 1998, we entered into a joint venture with
Square Co., Ltd. (“Square”), a leading developer and
publisher of entertainment software in Japan.

•

In Japan, the companies had established
    Electronic Arts Square KK (“EA Square KK”), which
    localized and published in Japan our games that were originally
    created in North America and Europe, as well as original video
    games developed specifically for the Japanese market. We owned a
    70 percent majority interest in EA Square KK, while Square
    owned the remaining 30 percent.

•

In North America, the companies formed Square
    Electronic Arts, LLC (“Square EA”), which had
    exclusive publishing rights in North America for future
    interactive entertainment titles created by Square.
    Additionally, we obtained the exclusive right to distribute in
    North America products published by this joint venture. We owned
    a 30 percent minority interest in Square EA while



Square owned the remaining 70 percent. This joint
    venture was accounted for under the equity method.

Our joint venture agreements with Square expired
as of March 31, 2003. As provided in the EA Square KK joint
venture agreement, we have purchased Square’s
30 percent interest in EA Square KK for $2.5 million
representing the return of their capital contribution and
renamed the entity Electronic Arts KK. Electronic Arts KK is now
a wholly owned subsidiary of Electronic Arts. See Note 13 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in
Item 8 hereof. As a further result of the termination of
the joint venture agreements, our distribution of Square
products in North America will terminate on June 30, 2003.
We generated $84.5 million, $80.8 million and
$106.6 million in net revenue from sales of Square products
in North America during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Investments

We have made investments as part of our overall
strategy and currently hold minority equity interests in several
companies. As of March 31, 2003, our minority equity
investments include investments in Digital Illusions, C.E.,
NovaLogic, Inc. and Firaxis Software, Inc.

Market

Historically, there have been multiple consoles
available in the market and vigorous competition between console
manufacturers. While Sony has for the past several years been
the clear market leader (with its PlayStation and PlayStation 2
consoles), Microsoft and Nintendo are large and viable
competitors, and PCs continue to be strong interactive game
platform. We develop and publish products for multiple
platforms, and this diversification continues to be a
cornerstone of our strategy.

The following table details select information on
a sample of the console platforms for which we have published
titles:

PlayStation

Sony released the PlayStation 2 console in Japan
in March 2000, in North America in October 2000 and in Europe in
November 2000. The PlayStation 2 console is a 128-bit, DVD-based
system that is Internet and cable ready, as well as backward
compatible with games published for its predecessor, the
PlayStation. We have published and are currently developing
numerous products for the Sony PlayStation 2.

GameCube

Nintendo launched the Nintendo GameCube console
in Japan in September 2001, North America in November 2001 and
in Europe in May 2002. The Nintendo GameCube plays games that
are manufactured on a proprietary optical disk. We have
published and are currently developing several products for the
Nintendo GameCube.



Xbox

Microsoft launched the Xbox console in North
America in November 2001, in Japan in February 2002 and in
Europe in March 2002. The Microsoft Xbox is a 128-bit, DVD-based
system. We have published and are currently developing several
products for the Microsoft Xbox.

Our early investment in products designed for
play on 32-bit PCs and consoles (such as the PlayStation), has
been strategically important in positioning us for the current
generation of 128-bit machines. We believe that such investment
continues to be important. During fiscal years 2003, 2002 and
2001, the video and computer games industry has experienced a
platform transition from 32-bit CD-based and 64-bit
cartridge-based consoles to the current generation of 128-bit,
DVD-based game consoles and related software. The transition to
the current generation systems was initiated by the launch of
Sony’s PlayStation 2 in fiscal 2001, and continued with the
launches of the Nintendo GameCube and Microsoft’s Xbox in
fiscal 2002. As the market continues to shift to the current
generation systems, our sales of 32-bit and 64-bit products have
been declining and we expect a continued significant decline in
fiscal 2004.

Online
Games

The market for online games is still in its early
stages. To date, we have had limited success in finding ways of
generating revenue and profits from online games, including
subscription fees, “pay-to-play fees” and advertising.
In addition, we have had limited experience with developing
optimal pricing strategies or predicting usage patterns for our
online games. In our history, we have launched five persistent
state world products with mixed results. While we have achieved
success with

Ultima Online,

the launch of our other
persistent state world products, most notably

The Sims Online

and

Earth & Beyond,

have been below our
expectations. In fiscal 2003, we also launched a free EA SPORTS
online offering in connection with seven of our PC sports
titles. Despite our limited success to date, we believe that
online functionality is integral to our existing and future
products. The continued growth of the online sector of our
industry will depend on the following key factors:

•

Increasing popularity of PC games;

•

Growing interest in multiplayer games;

•

Willingness by consumers to pay for online
    content;

•

Rapid innovation of new online entertainment
    experiences;

•

Mass market adoption of broadband technologies;
    and

•

Convergence of online capabilities in
    next-generation consoles.

Competition

The interactive entertainment software business
is highly competitive. It is characterized by the continuous
introduction of new titles and the development of new
technologies. Our competitors vary in size from very small
companies with limited resources to very large, diversified
corporations with greater financial and marketing resources than
ours. Our business is driven by hit titles, which require
ever-increasing budgets for development and marketing.
Therefore, the availability of significant financial resources
has become a major competitive factor in our industry, primarily
as a result of the costs associated with the development and
marketing of game software. Competition in our industry is also
based on product quality and features, timing of product
releases, brand-name recognition, access to distribution
channels, effectiveness of marketing, and price.

We compete with Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo,
which each publish software for their respective console
platforms. We also compete with numerous companies which are,
like us, licensed by the console manufacturers to develop and
publish software games that operate on their consoles. These
competitors include Acclaim Entertainment, Activision, Capcom,
Eidos, Infogrames, Konami, Lucas Arts, Midway, Namco, Sega,
Take-Two Interactive, THQ, 3DO, Ubi Soft and Vivendi Universal
Games, among others. In addition, we believe that large software
companies and media companies are increasing their focus in the
interactive entertainment software market. Our titles also
compete with other forms of entertainment, such as motion
pictures, television and music for the leisure time and
discretionary spending of consumers.



In addition, the market for our products is
characterized by significant price competition, and we face
increasing pricing pressures from our competitors. These
pressures have, from time to time, required us to reduce our
prices on certain products. The experience of our industry is
that software game prices decline once a generation of consoles
have been in the market for a significant period of time,
because of the increasing number of software titles competing
for acceptance by consumers. Accordingly, we expect lower
overall pricing of games for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and
Nintendo GameCube during fiscal 2004, in comparison to fiscal
2003. However, we believe that highly-anticipated
“hit” titles, based on popular sports and
entertainment properties, will maintain premium pricing in the
market in fiscal 2004, as they have done in fiscal 2003.

During calendar 2002, we were a market leader in
sales of interactive entertainment software products for the
Sony PlayStation 2, the Nintendo GameCube, the Microsoft Xbox
and personal computers (in the aggregate), in the U.S. and
European markets. In the U.S., together with our affiliates, we
published three of the top-10-selling titles for play on
videogame consoles, and five of the top-10 PC titles (according
to NPDFunworld and NPD Techworld). Our nearest competitors had
two of the top-10 videogame and PC titles for the same period
(according to NPDFunworld and NPD Techworld). While similar
comprehensive data are not available for Europe, we believe that
our titles had similar chart strength for the PlayStation 2 and
PC in that territory in calendar year 2002.

Relationships with Significant Hardware
Platform Companies

Sony

In fiscal 2003, approximately 37 percent of
our net revenue was derived from sales of EA Studio software for
the PlayStation 2, compared to 28 percent in fiscal 2002.
We released 19 titles worldwide in fiscal 2003 for the
PlayStation 2, compared to 18 titles in fiscal 2002. Key
releases for the year included

Medal of Honor
Frontline

™

, The Lord of the Rings

™

, The
Two Towers

™

, Harry Potter and the Chamber of
Secrets

™ and

The Sims

. PlayStation 2 product
revenue increased for fiscal 2003 due to the higher installed
base of PlayStation 2 hardware, net revenue on key titles
released in multiple territories during the current fiscal year
and higher net revenue on current year franchise title releases
versus prior year releases of these titles. We expect revenue
from PlayStation 2 products to continue to grow in fiscal 2004,
but as revenue for these products increase, we expect our growth
rates to decrease. We expect that hit titles will continue to
hold their current price points, however, we expect lower price
points for other titles. Under the terms of a licensing
agreement entered into with Sony Computer Entertainment of
America as of April 2000, as amended, we are authorized to
develop and distribute DVD-based software products compatible
with the PlayStation 2. Pursuant to this agreement, we engage
Sony to supply PlayStation 2 DVDs for our products.

We also announced in May 2003 that we would make
many of our sports games available for the PlayStation 2 online
service. Through that service, customers who have any online
adaptor for their PlayStation 2 consoles will be able to play
our PlayStation 2 sports products online.

In fiscal 2003, approximately four percent of our
net revenue was derived from sales of EA Studio software for the
PlayStation, compared to 11 percent in fiscal 2002. During
fiscal 2003, we released six PlayStation games, compared to five
in fiscal 2002. As expected, PlayStation product sales decreased
for fiscal 2003 compared to the prior year primarily
attributable to the market transition to next generation console
systems. Although our PlayStation products are playable on the
PlayStation 2 console, we expect sales of current PlayStation
products to continue to decline in fiscal 2004. Under the terms
of a licensing agreement entered into with Sony Computer
Entertainment of America in July 1994, as amended, we are
authorized to develop and distribute CD-based software products
compatible with the PlayStation. Pursuant to this agreement, we
engage Sony to supply PlayStation CDs for our products.

Nintendo

In fiscal 2003, approximately seven percent of
our net revenue was derived from sales of EA Studio software for
the Nintendo GameCube, compared to three percent in fiscal 2002.
We released 17 titles worldwide in fiscal 2003 for the Nintendo
GameCube, compared to five titles in fiscal 2002. Key releases



for the year included

Harry Potter and the
Chamber of Secrets, Medal of Honor Frontline, Need for Speed:
Hot Pursuit 2,

and

The Lord of the Rings, The Two
Towers

. Revenue from Nintendo GameCube products increased
for fiscal 2003 due to the higher installed base of the Nintendo
GameCube platform, which is now available in every major market
in which we operate. In the prior fiscal year, the Nintendo
GameCube platform was only available in North America beginning
in November 2001 and in Japan beginning in September 2001. We
expect revenue from Nintendo GameCube products to continue to
grow in fiscal 2004, but as revenue for these products
increases, we expect our growth rates to decrease. We expect
that hit titles will continue to hold their current price
points, however, we expect lower price points for other titles.

Under the terms of a licensing agreement entered
into with Nintendo of America (effective as of November 1,
2001), we are authorized to develop and distribute proprietary
optical format disk products compatible with the Nintendo
GameCube. Pursuant to this agreement, we engage Nintendo to
supply Nintendo GameCube proprietary optical format disk
products for our products.

Microsoft

In fiscal 2003, approximately nine percent of our
net revenue was derived from sales of EA Studio software for the
Xbox, compared to five percent in fiscal 2002. We released 16
titles worldwide in fiscal 2003 for the Xbox, compared to ten
titles in fiscal 2002. Key releases for the year included

Medal of Honor Frontline, NCAA Football 2003, The Lord of the
Rings, The Two Towers

and

FIFA 2003

. Revenue from
Xbox products increased for fiscal 2003 due to the higher
installed base of the Xbox platform, which was available for a
full twelve months versus five months in fiscal 2002. We expect
net revenue from Xbox products to continue to grow in fiscal
2004, but as net revenue for these products increases, we expect
our growth rates to decrease. We expect that hit titles will
continue to hold their current price points, however we expect
lower price points for other titles.

Under the terms of a licensing agreement entered
into with Microsoft as of December 8, 2000, as amended, we
are authorized to develop and distribute DVD-based software
products compatible with the Xbox.

In May 2003, we announced that we have no plans
to support the online service for Xbox. It is unclear whether
the absence of online functionality in our Xbox products will be
important enough to consumers to affect sales of our Xbox
products.

Relationship with AOL

Our carriage agreement with AOL establishes the
basis for our creation and distribution of game sites on the
world wide web that are available to AOL subscribers via the
Games Channel on AOL’s flagship ISP service and to other
consumers who use other AOL portals (

AOL.com, CompuServe,
Netscape/ Netcenter and ICQ

). Users can also access our
online games website directly from the world wide web at
www.ea.com. We are AOL’s exclusive provider of a broad
aggregation of online games and programs and we manage all of
the Games Channel content within AOL’s flagship ISP service
and other AOL portals in the United States. Within any of these
AOL properties, users will be able to find a games channel or
area which will provide the user access to our online games. See
Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
included in Item 8 hereof, for a discussion of the
significant terms of our relationship with AOL.

Products and Product Development

In fiscal 2003, we generated approximately
68 percent of our revenue from EA Studio-produced products
released during the year. As of March 31, 2003, we were
actively marketing approximately 70 titles, comprising over
135 stock keeping units, or SKUs, that were produced by EA
Studios. During fiscal 2003, we introduced 31 EA Studios titles,
representing 86 SKUs, compared to 32 EA Studios titles,
comprising 64 SKUs, in fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2003, we had 22
titles that sold over one million units (aggregated across all
platforms). In fiscal 2002, we had 16 titles and in fiscal 2001,
we had 14 titles that



sold over one million units (aggregated across
all platforms). A SKU is a version of a title designed for play
on a particular platform and intended for distribution in a
particular territory.

The products produced by EA Studios are
designed and created by our employee designers and artists and
by non-employee software developers (“independent
artists”). We typically advance development funds to the
independent artists during development of our games, which
payments are considered advances against subsequent royalties
based on the sales of the products. These terms are typically
set forth in written agreements entered into with the
independent artists.

For fiscal 2003, we had one title,

Harry
Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,

published on seven
different platforms, which represented approximately
10 percent of our total fiscal 2003 net revenue. For fiscal
2002,

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone™

,
published on four different platforms, represented approximately
12 percent of our total fiscal 2002 net revenue. For fiscal
2001, no title represented more than 10 percent of our
total fiscal 2001 net revenue.

We publish products in a number of categories
such as sports, action, strategy, simulations, role playing and
adventure, each of which is becoming increasingly competitive.
Our sports-related products, marketed under the
EA SPORTS™ brand name, accounted for a significant
percentage of net revenue in fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our
market share in the sports category.

The front-line retail selling prices in North
America of our products, excluding older titles marketed as
“Classics”, typically range from $30.00 to $50.00.
“Classics” titles have retail selling prices that
range from $10.00 to $30.00. The retail selling prices of our
titles outside of North America vary widely based on local
market conditions.

We currently develop or publish products for six
different hardware platforms. In fiscal 2003, our product
releases were for PlayStation 2, PC, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo
GameCube, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Color and online Internet
play. Our planned product introductions for fiscal 2004 are for
the PlayStation 2, PC, Nintendo GameCube, Xbox, PlayStation and
Game Boy Advance.

Our goal is to be the market leader of games
played on the current generation of 128-bit video game consoles.
We are investing in the development of tools and technologies
designed to facilitate development of our products for these
platforms. We had research and development expenditures of
$401.0 million in fiscal 2003, $380.6 million in fiscal
2002 and $376.2 million in fiscal 2001.

offerings within each brand incorporate some or all of the
following:

•

Pogo.

We currently
    offer approximately 37 free online games under this brand.
    The games offering, geared towards family entertainment,
    includes card games, board games, casino games, word games,
    trivia games, puzzles and Bingo. This category leverages prizes,
    tournaments, community and Pogo’s strength and popularity
    in free, familiar games to significantly increase the appeal of
    our online games service to the broad consumer market.

•

EA GAMES.

We
    currently offer 17 free online games under this brand. The
    EA Games offering consists of original arcade-style games
    and other original games designed solely for online play, such
    as

Hammerhead Pool, Tank Hunter

.



Paid Content.

In
addition to free online games, we offer premium pay-to-play
persistent state world games. In order to access these premium
games, the player must purchase a CD-ROM through retail stores
or through our online store. After an initial free trial period,
the player must pay a subscription fee in order to continue
playing. These persistent state world games are designed to
appeal to avid gamers: teens and adults looking to participate
in multi-player online games made up of fantastic worlds,
characters, adventures or activities – big or small, real
or imagined – as well as new forms of cutting-edge online
entertainment targeted to mass market gamers. Current persistent
state world game offerings include

Ultima Online, The Sims
Online

and

Earth & Beyond

.

We launched both

Earth & Beyond

and

The Sims Online

in fiscal 2003.

The Sims Online

was expected to be our flagship online subscription
offering. Through March 31, 2003, however, the number of
units sold and number of subscribers for

The Sims Online

and

Earth & Beyond

have been below our
expectations. See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for a discussion of the restructuring and asset
impairment charges, included in Item 8 hereof.

Each of the categories above focuses on targeting
and serving its specific consumer group by:

•

Offering engaging and accessible online games;

•

Building a community in which consumers can
    interact with one another via chat, bulletin boards, events and
    match-making services for multi-player games and other contests;

•

Delivering innovative content that continually
    entertains; and

•

Establishing a direct relationship with each
    audience member through personalization and customization of
    user experiences.

Marketing and Distribution

Electronic
Arts Distribution

EA Studio Products. We market the products
produced by our EA Studios under the EA GAMES, EA SPORTS and EA
SPORTS BIG brands. Products marketed under the EA SPORTS brand
typically simulate professional and collegiate sports and
include titles such as

Madden NFL, FIFA

and

NBA
Live

. Products marketed under the EA SPORTS BIG brand
typically simulates extreme sports and include such titles as

SSX, Def Jam Vendetta

and

NBA Street

.

Co-Publishing and Distribution Products.
Co-publishing products are games that are conceived and
developed by independent developers and for which we provide
production assistance and marketing and distribution services.
We publish some of these products under an EA brand.
Distribution products are titles that are published by another
publisher and delivered to us as completed products, for which
we provide distribution services. As of March 31, 2003, we
distributed approximately 34 co-publishing and distribution
titles in North America.

Our largest relationship relating to distribution
products is with Square. In May 1998, Electronic Arts and Square
formed a joint venture in North America, creating Square EA, as
discussed in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, included in Item 8 hereof. In conjunction with
the formation of this joint venture, we have since that time had
the exclusive right in North America to distribute products
published by this joint venture. Our joint venture agreements
with Square expired as of March 31, 2003, and our
distribution of Square products in North America will cease on
June 30, 2003. In fiscal 2003, Square EA published

Kingdom Hearts

for the PlayStation 2, which was a top-ten
selling SKU, selling over one million units.

The interactive software game business has become
increasingly “hits” driven, requiring significantly
greater expenditures for marketing and advertising of our
products, particularly for television advertising. There can be
no assurance that we will continue to produce “hit”
titles, or that advertising for any product will increase sales
sufficiently to recoup those advertising expenses.

We generated approximately 95 percent of our
North American net revenue from direct sales to retailers
through a field sales organization of professionals and a group
of telephone sales representatives. The remaining 5 percent of
our North American sales were made through a limited number of
specialized



and regional distributors and rack jobbers in
markets where we believe direct sales would not be economical.
We had sales to one customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., which
represented 12 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2003,
14 percent in fiscal 2002 and 12 percent in fiscal
2001.

Outside of North America, we derive revenues
primarily from direct sales to retailers. Our largest
distributor relationship is with Sony in Japan. Sales of our
PlayStation and PlayStation 2 products through Sony make up
approximately 60 percent of our net revenue in Japan. Under
the terms of our distribution agreement with Sony, we are not
required to accept returns or grant price protection. In a few
of our smaller markets we also sell our products through
distributors with whom we have written agreements or informal
arrangements, depending on the business customs of the
territories.

In North America, we have stock-balancing
programs for our PC products, which allow for the exchange of PC
products by resellers under certain circumstances. In all of our
major geographical markets (other than Japan), we may decide to
provide price protection under certain circumstances for both
our PC and console products after we analyze: inventory
remaining in the channel, the rate of inventory sell-through in
the channel, and our remaining inventory on hand. It is our
policy to exchange products or give credits, rather than give
cash refunds. Moreover, the risk of product returns for our
products on mature platforms (such as the PlayStation) may
increase as newer hardware platforms, such as the Xbox, Nintendo
GameCube and PlayStation 2, become more popular. We monitor and
manage the volume of our sales to retailers and distributors and
their inventories as substantial overstocking in the
distribution channel can result in high returns or the
requirement for substantial price protection in subsequent
periods. We believe that we provide adequate reserves for
returns and price protection which are based on estimated future
returns of products, taking into account historical returns,
current sell-through of distributor and retailer inventory of
our products, current trends in the interactive game market and
the overall economy, changes in customer demand and acceptance
of our products and other related factors. We believe our
current reserves will be sufficient to meet return and price
protection requirements for current in-channel inventory.
However, we cannot be certain that actual returns or price
protection will not exceed our reserves.

The distribution channels through which our games
are sold have been characterized by change, including
consolidations and financial difficulties of certain
distributors and retailers. The bankruptcy or other business
difficulties of a distributor or retailer could render our
accounts receivable from such entity uncollectible, which could
have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial
condition. In January 2002, one of our retail customers, Kmart,
declared bankruptcy. We believe we have adequately reserved for
our exposure to Kmart. In addition, an increasing number of
companies are competing for access to our distribution channels.
Our arrangements with our distributors and retailers may be
terminated by either party at any time without cause.
Distributors and retailers often carry products that compete
with ours. Retailers of our products typically have a limited
amount of shelf space and promotional resources that they are
willing to devote to the software games category, and there is
intense competition for these resources. There can be no
assurance that distributors and retailers will continue to
purchase our products or provide our products with adequate
levels of shelf space and promotional support.

Within our website, we offer visitors the
opportunity to purchase our packaged goods software products
directly from us. We use our existing distribution network to
fulfill consumers’ online orders. We also have a
fulfillment group that sells product directly to consumers
through a toll-free number and through our websites listed in
advertising by us and our co-publishing and distribution
affiliates. This group is also responsible for targeted
direct-mail marketing and sells product backups and accessories
to registered customers.

Inventory and Working Capital

Our management focuses considerable attention to
managing our inventories and other working-capital-related
items. We manage inventories by communicating with our customers
prior to the release of our products, and then using our
industry experience to forecast demand on a product-by-product
and territory-by-territory basis. We then place manufacturing
orders for our products that match this forecasted



demand. We do not maintain substantial
inventories of our products because (1) historically, most
of the sales of a particular product occur within the first
60 – 90 days after the product’s release,
and (2) the lead times on re-orders of our products are
generally short, approximately two to three weeks. Further, as
discussed in “Marketing and Distribution”, we have
practices in place with our customers (such as stock balancing
and price protection) that reduce product returns.

As shown in our Consolidated Balance Sheets
included in this Report, we had approximately
$950.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $637.6
million in short-term investments as of March 31, 2003. We
believe that this amount is sufficient to meet our working
capital needs for the coming year.

Segment Reporting

In fiscal 2003, we operated and reviewed our
business in two business segments:

•

EA Core business segment: creation, marketing and
    distribution of interactive entertainment software.

•

EA.com business segment: creation, marketing and
    distribution of interactive entertainment software which can be
    played or sold online, ongoing management of subscriptions of
    online games and website advertising.

As of April 1, 2003, we are no longer
managing these segments separately. We consider online
functionality to be integral to our existing and future
products. Please see the discussion regarding segment reporting
in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 18 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in
Items 7 and 8 hereof.

International Operations

We have wholly-owned subsidiaries throughout the
world, including offices in the United Kingdom, France, Spain,
Germany, Australia, Canada, South Africa, Singapore, Sweden,
Japan, Malaysia, Brazil and Holland. Our joint venture in Japan
has recently been converted to a wholly owned subsidiary as a
result of our buy-out of our joint venture partner (see the
discussion under “Joint Ventures and Investments”
included above). The amounts of net revenue, operating profit
and identifiable assets attributable to each of our geographic
regions for each of the last three fiscal years are set forth in
Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
included in Item 8 hereof.

International net revenue increased by
66 percent to $1,046.5 million, or 42 percent of
consolidated fiscal 2003 net revenue, compared to
$631.4 million, or 37 percent of consolidated fiscal
2002 net revenue due to the following:

•

Net revenue from sales in Europe increased by
    69 percent compared to the prior year due to higher
    PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, Xbox and PC net revenue,
    partially offset by the expected decrease of net revenue from
    Sony PlayStation. PlayStation 2 net revenue increased by
    181 percent due to strong sales of titles released in the
    current year, most notably

Medal of Honor Frontline, The Lord
    of the Rings, The Two Towers, Harry Potter and the Chamber of
    Secrets

and

The Sims,

as well as a higher installed
    base of the PlayStation 2 hardware, due in part to
    Sony’s hardware price cut in Europe in August 2002

.

Nintendo GameCube and Xbox net revenue increased due to a
    higher installed base of the platforms, which both launched in
    Europe in the spring of 2002. PC net revenue increased due to
    higher net revenue for

The Sims

franchise titles. Net
    revenue from sales in Europe comprised 35 percent,
    30 percent and 29 percent of our total net revenue for
    fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and has been a
    significant region in our business.

•

Net revenue from sales in the Asia Pacific region
    increased by 64 percent compared to the prior year due to higher
    PlayStation 2, co-publishing and distribution and Xbox net
    revenue. PlayStation 2 net revenue increased by 244 percent
    due to strong current year releases including

The Lord of the
    Rings, The Two Towers, Medal of Honor Frontline

and

Harry
    Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

. Co-publishing and
    distribution net revenue increased due to net revenue from

Final Fantasy X

and

Battlefield 1942.

Xbox net
    revenue increased due to a higher installed base of the platform



with 20 titles available in fiscal 2003 versus
    three titles in fiscal 2002. Net revenue from sales in Asia
    Pacific comprised four percent, three percent and four percent
    of our total net revenue for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001,
    respectively.

•

Net revenue from sales in Japan increased by
    37 percent compared to the prior year due to a higher
    installed base and strong sales of titles associated with the
    PlayStation 2, most notably

Medal of Honor Frontline,
    2002 FIFA World Cup

and

Project FIFA World Cup,

and
    also due to an increase in co-publishing and distribution
    titles, partially offset by the expected decrease in PlayStation
    net revenue. Net revenue from sales in Japan comprised three
    percent of our total net revenue for fiscal 2003, and four
    percent of our total net revenue for each of fiscal 2002 and
    2001.

Although we expect international revenue to grow
in fiscal 2004, we do not believe it will continue to grow at
the same rate as in the prior year.

Manufacturing and Suppliers

The suppliers we use for manufacture of our games
can be characterized in three types:

•

the manufacturing entities that press our game
    disks,

•

the entities that print our game instruction
    booklets, and

•

the entities that package the disks and printed
    game instruction booklets into the jewel cases and boxes for
    shipping to customers.

In many instances, we are able to acquire
materials on a volume-discount basis. We have multiple potential
sources of supply for most materials, except with respect to our
PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube
products, as discussed in “Relationships with Significant
Hardware Platform Companies” above. We also have alternate
sources for the manufacture and assembly of most of our
products. To date, we have not experienced any material
difficulties or delays in production of our software and related
documentation and packaging. However, a shortage of components
or other factors beyond our control could impair our ability to
manufacture, or have manufactured, our products.

Backlog

We typically ship orders immediately upon
receipt. To the extent that any backlog may or may not exist at
the end of a reporting period, it would be both coincidental and
an unreliable indicator of future results of any period.

Seasonality

Our business is highly seasonal. We typically
experience our highest revenue and profits in the calendar
year-end holiday season and a seasonal low in revenue and
profits in the quarter ending in June.

Employees

As of March 31, 2003, we employed
approximately 4,000 people, of whom over 1,700 were outside the
United States. We believe that our ability to attract and retain
qualified employees is an important factor in our growth and
development and that our future success will depend, in large
measure, on our ability to continue to attract and retain
qualified employees. To date, we have been successful in
recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified
personnel to conduct our business successfully. We believe that
our relationships with our employees are good. None of our
employees are represented by a union, guild or other collective
bargaining organization.

Tracking Stock

On March 22, 2000, the stockholders of
Electronic Arts authorized the issuance of a new series of
common stock, designated as Class B Common Stock
(“Tracking Stock”). The Tracking Stock was intended to
reflect the performance of our online and e-Commerce business
segment. When we adopted the Tracking Stock, our intention was
to provide liquidity for our online business through access to
the



public markets. However, as a result of the
disappointing performance of our online business, we have no
plans, nor do we see meaningful prospects, for the creation of a
public market for our Class B Common Stock. Therefore, we
will discontinue separate reporting of our Tracking Stock in
future reporting periods. We expect this decision to simplify
our reporting and enable us to provide our online products and
services more efficiently. Maintaining separate reporting for
the Tracking Stock and managing our online business as a
separate reporting business segment required a complex
organization and management structure. In addition, a variety of
intercompany agreements between Electronic Arts Inc. and EA.com
Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Electronic Arts Inc. that is
the holder of all of our online business related assets) have
required us to maintain duplicate functions, to routinely charge
each organization for goods and services that it provided to the
other organization, and to manage our online business in a
manner that is generally unlike the way in which we manage our
other businesses. We now consider online functionality to be
integral to our existing and future products. Accordingly, as of
April 1, 2003, we have consolidated the reporting related
to our online products and services into that of our core
business and now manage these online products and services as
part of the overall development and publication of our other
products. We believe that this better reflects the way in which
our chief operating decision maker reviews and manages our
business and the importance of our online products and services
relative to the rest of our business. At the same time, in light
of the disappointing launch of

The Sims Online,

we
evaluated our online products and services, and the assets
associated with EA.com, for impairment in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 144. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we recorded a
restructuring and asset impairment charge of $72.1 million,
(which included charges related to studio consolidation that
were unrelated to our online business). See Note 19 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in
Item 8 hereof, for a discussion of the restructuring
charges.

Item 2: Properties

We own or lease the following facilities. We
believe that these facilities are adequate for our current
needs. We believe that suitable additional or substitute space
will be available as needed to accommodate our future needs.

Redwood City, California Headquarters
Campus

Our principal administrative, sales and
marketing, research and development, and support facility is
located in Redwood City, California.

In February 1995, we entered into a build-to-suit
lease with Keybank National Association on our headquarters
facility in Redwood City, California, which was extended in July
2001 and expires in July 2006. We accounted for this arrangement
as an operating lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13,

“Accounting for Leases”

, as amended. Existing
campus facilities developed in phase one comprise a total of
350,000 square feet and provide space for sales, marketing,
administration and research and development functions. We have
an option to purchase the property (land and facilities) for
$145.0 million, or, at the end of the lease, to arrange for
(1) an additional extension of the lease or (2) sale
of the property to a third party with us retaining an obligation
to the owner for the difference between the sale price and the
guaranteed residual value of up to $128.9 million if the
sales price is less than this amount. The lease also provides
that a sale of the property to a third party is subject to
remarketing conditions including marketing assistance, requisite
repairs and maintenance, appropriate notice and seller’s
indemnities and warranties.

In December 2000, we entered into a second
build-to-suit lease with Keybank National Association for a
five-year term beginning December 2000 to expand our Redwood
Shores, California headquarters facilities and develop adjacent
property adding approximately 310,000 square feet to our campus.
Construction was completed in June 2002. We accounted for this
arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with SFAS
No. 13, as amended. The facilities provide space for
marketing, sales and research and development. We have an option
to purchase the property for $127.0 million or, at the end
of the lease, to arrange for (1) an extension of the lease
or (2) sale of the property to a third party with us
retaining an obligation to the owner for the difference between
the sale price and the guaranteed residual value of up to $118.8
million if the sales price is less than this amount. The lease
also provides that a sale of the property to a third party is
subject to remarketing conditions including marketing
assistance, requisite repairs and maintenance, appropriate
notice and seller’s indemnities and warranties.

Lease rates are based upon the Commercial Paper
Rate. The two lease agreements described above require us to
maintain certain financial covenants related to consolidated net
worth, fixed charge coverage ratio, total consolidated debt to
total consolidated capital and quick ratio, all of which we were
in compliance with as of March 31, 2003.

Louisville, Kentucky Distribution
Center

Our North American distribution is supported by a
centralized and expanded warehouse facility that we lease in
Louisville, Kentucky occupying 250,000 sq. ft. Another
distribution center that we maintained in Hayward, California
was closed in fiscal 2001 in conjunction with the expansion of
our Louisville, Kentucky facility.

North American Development
Studios

In addition to the product development studio
facility located in our Redwood City headquarters campus,

•

we own a 206,000 sq. ft. product development
    studio facility in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada,

•

we own a 173,500 sq. ft. development facility in
    Austin, Texas and

•

Item 7: Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND
ESTIMATES

Our financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial
statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
contingent assets and liabilities, and revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. The policies discussed below are
considered by management to be critical because they are not
only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and
results of operations but also because application and
interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and
estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown.
As a result, actual results may differ materially from our
estimates.

Sales allowances and bad debt
reserves

We principally derive revenue from sales of
packaged interactive software games designed for play on
videogame consoles (such as the PlayStation 2, Xbox and
Nintendo GameCube), PCs and hand-held game machines (such as the
Nintendo Game Boy Advance). Product revenue is recognized net of
sales allowances. We also have stock-balancing programs for our
personal computer products, which allow for the exchange of
personal computer products by resellers under certain
circumstances. We may decide to provide price protection for
both our personal computer and video game system products. In
making this determination we evaluate: inventory remaining in
the channel, the rate of inventory sell-through in the channel,
and our remaining inventory on hand. It is our policy to
exchange products or give credits, rather than give cash refunds.

We estimate potential future product returns,
price protection and stock-balancing programs related to current
period product revenue. We analyze historical returns, current
sell-through of distributor and retailer inventory of our
products, current trends in the video game market and the
overall economy, changes in customer demand and acceptance of
our products and other related factors when evaluating the
adequacy of the sales returns and price protection allowances.
In addition, management monitors and manages the volume of our
sales to retailers and distributors and their inventories, as
substantial overstocking in the distribution channel can result
in high returns or the requirement for substantial price
protection in subsequent periods. In the past, actual returns
have not generally exceeded our reserves. However, actual
returns and price protections may materially exceed our
estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are
exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market
conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms,
product updates or competing products. For example, the risk of
product returns for our products may increase as the Xbox,
Nintendo GameCube and PlayStation 2 consoles pass the
midpoint of their lifecycle and an increasing number and
aggregate amount of competitive products heighten pricing and
competitive pressures. While management believes it can make
reliable estimates for these matters, if we changed our
assumptions and estimates, our returns reserves would change,
which would impact the net revenue we report. For example, if
actual returns were significantly greater than the reserves we
have established, the actual results would decrease our reported
revenue. Conversely, if actual returns were significantly less
than our reserves, this would increase our reported revenue.

Similarly, significant judgment is required to
estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting
period. We determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by
evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current
economic trends. Depending upon the overall economic climate and
the financial condition of our customers, the amount and timing
of our bad debt expense could change significantly.

We cannot predict customer bankruptcies or an
inability of any of our customers to meet their financial
obligations to us. Therefore, our estimates could differ
materially from actual results.

Our gross accounts receivable balance was
$246.7 million and our allowance for product returns,
pricing allowances and doubtful accounts was $164.6 million
as of March 31, 2003. As of March 31, 2002, our gross
accounts receivable balance was $306.4 million and our
allowance for product returns, pricing



allowances and doubtful accounts was
$115.9 million. Reserves for bad debts and sales allowances
increased 42 percent from $115.9 million at
March 31, 2002 to $164.6 million at March 31,
2003. The increase in the overall reserves as of March 31,
2003 is due to the increase in gross revenue in the six and
12 months ended March 31, 2003 compared to the same
periods in the prior fiscal year. Net revenue increased
44 percent during fiscal 2003 due to the higher installed
base of PlayStation 2 consoles and having a full year of
sales of games for the Xbox and Nintendo GameCube. The increase
in price protection and sales returns is directly attributable
to the increase in sales that occurred during fiscal 2003. Sales
return and price protection requirements as a percentage of
gross revenue in the six and 12 months ended March 31,
2003 have remained relatively constant compared to the same
periods in the prior fiscal year. We have recorded reserves for
returns of product and price protection credits issued for
products sold in prior periods. We believe these reserves are
adequate based on historical experience and our current estimate
of potential returns and allowances.

Prepaid royalties

Prepaid royalties consist primarily of
prepayments we make for manufacturing royalties, advances paid
to our co-publishing and/or distribution affiliates and license
fees paid to celebrities, professional sports organizations and
other organizations for our use of their trade name and content.
Also included in prepaid royalties are prepayments made to
independent software developers under development arrangements
that have alternative future uses. Prepaid royalties are
expensed at the contractual or effective royalty rate as cost of
goods sold based on actual net product sales. We evaluate the
future realization of prepaid royalties quarterly and charge to
cost of goods sold any product post-launch amounts we deem
unlikely to be realized through product sales. Any impairments
on pre-launch advances are charged to research and development
expense. We rely on forecasted revenue to evaluate the future
realization of prepaid royalties. If actual revenue, or revised
sales forecasts, fall below the initial forecasted sales, the
charge may be larger than anticipated in any given quarter. Once
the charge has been taken, that amount will not be expensed in
future quarters when the product has shipped. The current
portion of prepaid royalties, included in other current assets,
was $39.9 million at March 31, 2003 and
$65.5 million at March 31, 2002. The long-term portion
of prepaid royalties, included in other assets, was
$7.4 million at March 31, 2003 and $1.2 million
at March 31, 2002.

Valuation of long-lived assets, including
goodwill and other intangible assets

We evaluate both purchased intangible assets and
long-lived assets in order to determine if events or changes in
circumstances indicate an other-than-temporary impairment in
value. This evaluation requires us to estimate, among other
things, the remaining useful lives along with future estimates
of cash flows of the business. All require the use of judgment
and estimates. Our actual results could differ materially from
our current estimates.

Under current accounting standards, we make
judgments about the remaining useful lives of purchased
intangible assets and other long-lived assets whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate an other-than-temporary
impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our
balance sheet. In order to determine if an other-than-temporary
impairment has occurred, management makes various assumptions
about the future value of the asset, by evaluating future
business prospects and estimated cash flows. Our future net cash
flows are primarily dependent on the sale of products for play
on proprietary video game platforms. The success of our products
is affected by our ability to accurately predict which platforms
and which products we develop will be successful. Also, our
revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our
product release schedules. Due to product sales shortfalls, we
may not realize the future net cash flows necessary to recover
our long-lived assets, which may result in an impairment charge
recorded in the future. We recorded asset impairment charges of
$66.3 million during fiscal 2003 and $12.8 million
during fiscal 2002. See Note 19 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8
hereof, for a discussion of the asset impairment charges
recorded.

On April 1, 2002, we adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”

. As a
result of adopting this standard, we will continue to amortize
finite-lived intangibles, but no longer amortize certain other
intangible assets, most notably goodwill. In



lieu of amortization, SFAS No. 142 requires
a two-step approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each
reporting unit. The first step, which was required to be
completed by September 30, 2002, tests for impairment by
applying fair value-based tests at the Company’s reporting
unit level. The second step (if necessary), required to be
completed by March 31, 2003, measures the amount of
impairment by applying fair value-based tests to individual
assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. We completed
the first step of transitional goodwill impairment testing
during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and found no indicators
of impairment of our recorded goodwill. As a result, we have
recognized no transitional impairment loss in fiscal 2003 in
connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142. We completed
the annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003
with a measurement date of January 1, 2003 and found no
indicators of impairment of our recorded goodwill. Future
impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings and there is
a potential for a write down of goodwill in connection with the
annual impairment test. Following adoption of SFAS No. 142,
we continue to evaluate whether any event has occurred which
might indicate that the carrying value of an intangible asset is
not recoverable.

Income taxes

In the ordinary course of the Company’s
business, there are many transactions and calculations where the
ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As part of the process
of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are
required to estimate our income taxes in each of the
jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves
estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction
including the impact, if any, of additional taxes resulting from
tax examinations and making judgments regarding the
recoverability of deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is
established to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not
likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each
jurisdiction. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may
require an extended period to resolve. To determine the
quarterly tax rate, we are required to estimate full-year income
and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction. The
estimated effective tax rate is adjusted for the tax related to
significant unusual items. Changes in the geographic mix or
estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall
effective tax rate.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Comparison of Fiscal 2003 to 2002:

Revenue

We principally derive revenue from sales of
packaged interactive software games designed for play on
videogame consoles (such as the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo
GameCube), PCs and hand-held game machines (such as the Nintendo
Game Boy Advance). We also derive additional revenue from
selling subscriptions to some of our online games, selling
advertisements on our online web pages, selling our packaged
goods through our online store and by allowing other companies
to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other
products.

Geographically, our net revenue for the fiscal
years ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 break down as follows
(in thousands):

Net Revenue

Net Revenue for fiscal 2003 increased by
44 percent as compared to fiscal 2002. The increase in net
revenue was driven by the following:

•

Increase in PlayStation 2 net revenue of
    $427.8 million driven by strong sales of key titles
    released in multiple territories including

Medal of Honor
    Frontline

,

The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers

,

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

and

The
    Sims.

•

Higher installed base of game consoles, most
    notably the PlayStation 2. Net revenue from sales associated
    with the PlayStation 2 platform increased 89 percent to
    $910.7 million versus $482.9 million in the prior
    fiscal year.

•

Higher installed base of the Xbox console, which
    is now available in every major market in which we operate.
    Fiscal 2003 contains 12 months of revenue from Xbox titles
    versus five months in fiscal 2002 due to the launch of this
    platform in November 2001. In fiscal 2003, we generated
    $219.4 million in net revenue from Xbox titles versus
    $78.4 million a year ago.

•

Higher installed base of the Nintendo GameCube
    console, which is now available in every major market in which
    we operate. In fiscal 2002, Nintendo GameCube was only available
    in North America and Japan. In addition, fiscal 2003 contains
    12 months of revenue from GameCube titles versus seven
    months in fiscal 2002 due to the launch of this platform in
    September 2001 in Japan and November 2001 in North America. In
    fiscal 2003, we generated $176.7 million in net revenue
    from Nintendo GameCube titles versus approximately
    $51.7 million a year ago.

•

Net revenue from co-publishing and distribution
    products increased by 40 percent to $375.8 million
    versus $269.0 million in the prior fiscal year. The
    increase was due in large part to sales of

Kingdom
    Hearts

,

1503 A.D. The New World

and higher

Battlefield 1942

franchise net revenue for an aggregate
    increase of $105.0 million in fiscal 2003.

•

Net revenue from PC products increased by nine
    percent, mainly due to an increase in sales of

The Sims

franchise titles and new net revenue from

SimCity 4

,
    released in the fourth quarter of fiscal



2003, for an aggregate increase of
    $71.0 million in net revenue. This increase was partially
    offset by lower net revenue on prior year releases

Black and
    White

and

Dune Emperor

totaling $32.2 million.

•

Net revenue for the older generation PlayStation
    declined year over year as customers migrated to newer consoles.

We expect lower overall industry pricing in
fiscal 2004.

North America

For fiscal 2003, net revenue from sales in North
America increased by 31 percent to $1.4 billion versus
$1.1 billion in fiscal 2002. Growth in North American net
revenue was driven by:

•

Higher installed base of the PlayStation 2,
    resulting in an increase of $208.0 million in revenue from
    PlayStation 2 products, due in part to Sony’s price cut of
    the hardware in North America in May 2002. This was reflected in
    strong sales of

Medal of Honor Frontline

,

The Lord of
    the Rings, The Two Towers

,

The Sims, Harry Potter and the
    Chamber of Secrets

and

Need for Speed: Hot
    Pursuit 2

which generated a total of
    $201.2 million in net revenue in North America.

•

Higher installed base of Xbox consoles resulting
    in an increase in revenue from Xbox titles of
    $89.2 million. The launch of the Xbox platform in North
    America occurred in November 2001. Consequently, fiscal 2002
    contained only five months of Xbox revenue versus 12 months
    of revenue in fiscal 2003.

•

Higher installed base of Nintendo GameCube
    consoles resulting in increased revenue from Nintendo GameCube
    titles of $64.7 million. Fiscal 2003 contains
    12 months of revenue from Nintendo GameCube titles versus
    five months in fiscal 2002 due to the launch of this platform in
    November 2001. Additionally, in 2003 we released 17 games on the
    Nintendo GameCube platform compared to five releases in the
    prior year.

•

Revenue from co-publishing and distribution
    revenue increased by $37.3 million in fiscal 2003. The
    increase was primarily due to sales of

Kingdom Hearts

,

Ty the Tasmanian Tiger

and higher current year net
    revenue for the

Battlefield 1942

franchise titles, for an
    aggregate increase of $89.8 million, partially offset by a
    decrease in revenue on

Final Fantasy

franchise titles,
    $59.8 million.

•

Net revenue from titles associated with
    PlayStation declined $49.4 million year over year as customers
    migrated to newer consoles.

Our agreement to distribute Square products in
North America will terminate on June 30, 2003 (see Joint
Ventures and Investments, included in Item 1 hereof). We
recorded $84.5 million in net revenue in fiscal 2003 and
$80.8 million in net revenue in fiscal 2002 from sales of
Square products in North America.

International

Europe

For fiscal 2003, net revenue from sales in Europe
increased by 69 percent to $878.9 million versus
$519.5 million in fiscal 2002. Net revenue growth in Europe
was driven by:

•

Increase of $185.8 million from sales of
    titles for the PlayStation 2, most notably

Medal of Honor
    Frontline

,

The Lord of the Rings

,

The Two
    Towers

,

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

and

The Sims

for an aggregate of $145.3 million in net
    revenue, as well as a higher installed base of the PlayStation 2
    hardware, due in part to Sony’s hardware price cut in
    Europe in August 2002.

•

Revenue from sales of titles designed for the
    Nintendo GameCube and Xbox platforms. We released 17 titles
    worldwide for the Nintendo GameCube, which launched in May 2002
    in Europe, resulting in revenues of $57.7 million. Revenue
    from sales of Xbox products increased by $46.5 million with
    19 Xbox titles available in Europe in fiscal 2003 versus three
    in 2002. The launch of Xbox in Europe occurred in March 2002.
    Consequently, our fiscal 2002 results contained only one month
    of revenue from sales of Xbox products versus 12 months in
    fiscal 2003.



•

Increase of $52.4 million in sales of PC
    titles primarily due to higher current year net revenue for

The Sims

franchise titles, and current year sales of

SimCity 4

and

2002 FIFA World Cup

for an aggregate
    increase of $47.9 million.

Asia Pacific

For fiscal 2003, net revenue from sales in the
Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan, increased by
64 percent to $87.6 million versus $53.4 million
in fiscal 2002. Growth in net revenue in Asia Pacific was driven
by:

•

Sales of PlayStation 2 titles increased by
    $15.7 million, due to strong sales of

The Lord of the
    Rings

,

The Two Towers

,

Medal of Honor Frontline

and

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

totaling
    $10.9 million in net revenue.

•

Sales of co-publishing and distribution titles
    increased $11.1 million mainly due to sales of

Final Fantasy
    X

and

Battlefield 1942

totaling $4.2 million in
    the current fiscal year.

•

Additionally, revenue from sales of Xbox titles
    increased $6.3 million due to higher installed base and 20 Xbox
    titles available in the Asia Pacific region in 2003 versus three
    in 2002. Significant Xbox titles released in fiscal 2003
    included

Medal of Honor Frontline

,

Harry Potter and
    the Chamber of Secrets

,

Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2

and

FIFA 2003

which generated a total of
    $3.2 million in net revenue.

Japan

For fiscal 2003, net revenue from sales in Japan
increased by 37 percent to $80.1 million versus
$58.6 million in fiscal 2002. Growth in net revenue in
Japan was driven by:

•

Higher PlayStation 2 installed base and strong
    sales of PlayStation 2 titles, most notably

Medal of Honor
    Frontline

,

2002 FIFA World Cup

and

Project FIFA
    World Cup

, which generated a total of $15.7 million in
    net revenue in fiscal 2003.

•

Increase in revenues from co-publishing and
    distribution products of $11.0 million due in large part to
    sales of

Final Fantasy 11

.

•

These increases were offset by the expected
    decrease in PlayStation revenue of $5.7 million.

Revenue by Product Line

Information about our worldwide net revenue by
product line for fiscal 2003 and 2002 is presented below (in
thousands):



Net revenue from PlayStation 2 titles increased
in fiscal 2003 by 89 percent to $910.7 million versus
$482.9 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase was
primarily due to the following:

•

Strong consumer acceptance of the PlayStation 2
    game console in every major market in which we operate.

•

Higher installed base of the PlayStation 2
    console due in part to Sony’s hardware price cut in North
    America in May 2002 and in Europe in August 2002.

•

Sales of

Medal of Honor Frontline

,

The
    Lord of the Rings

,

The Two Towers

,

Harry Potter
    and the Chamber of Secrets

and

The Sims

which
    generated a total of $343.7 million of net revenue in
    multiple territories.

•

Strength of other PlayStation 2 franchise titles
    with higher net revenue on current year releases versus prior
    year releases including:

James Bond 007

,

FIFA

,

Madden NFL

,

Tiger PGA Tour

and

NCAA Football

for an aggregate increase of $96.0 million.

We expect revenue from PlayStation 2 products to
continue to grow in fiscal 2004, but not at the same rate as in
fiscal 2003.

Net revenue from sales of titles for the PC
increased in fiscal 2003 by nine percent to $499.6 million
versus $456.3 million in the prior fiscal year. The
increase was primarily due to strong sales of

The Sims

franchise titles, and the release of

SimCity 4

, for a
combined increase of $71.0 million, partially offset by
lower net revenue on prior year releases

Black and White

and

Dune Emperor

totaling $32.2 million

.

We expect revenue from PC products to be relatively flat in
fiscal 2004.

Net revenue from sales of Xbox products increased
in fiscal 2003 by 180 percent to $219.4 million versus
$78.4 million in the prior fiscal period. The increase was
primarily due to the following:

•

The Xbox was launched in the United States in
    November 2001 and in Europe in March 2002. Therefore, in fiscal
    2002, there was only a short period (five months in the United
    States and one month in Europe) during which we were able to
    release Xbox titles. We released fewer Xbox titles (10 in fiscal
    2002 versus 16 in fiscal 2003) and the installed base of Xbox
    hardware was significantly smaller in fiscal 2002 than in fiscal
    2003.

•

Sales of

Medal of Honor Frontline

,

NCAA
    Football 2003

and

The Lord of the Rings

,

The Two
    Towers

, which generated an aggregate of $41.2 million
    of net revenue in North America.

•

Sales of

FIFA 2003

,

James Bond 007:
    Nightfire

,

Medal of Honor Frontline

and

Harry
    Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

, which generated an
    aggregate of $27.4 million of net revenue in Europe.

We expect net revenue from Xbox products to
continue to grow in fiscal 2004, but for the rate of growth to
decrease.



Net revenue from sales of Nintendo GameCube
titles increased in fiscal 2003 by 241 percent to
$176.7 million versus $51.7 million in the prior
fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to the following:

•

Higher installed base of the Nintendo GameCube
    platform, which is now available in every major market in which
    we operate. The Nintendo GameCube was launched in North America
    in November 2001 and in Japan in September 2001. The Nintendo
    GameCube was not launched in Europe until May 2002.

•

In total, we released 17 Nintendo GameCube titles
    during fiscal 2003 versus five Nintendo GameCube titles a year
    ago. Significant titles released in fiscal 2003 were

Harry
    Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

,

Medal of Honor
    Frontline

,

Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2

and

Lord
    of the Rings, The Two Towers

which generated an aggregate of
    $68.7 million in net revenue. Significant titles in the
    prior year were

Madden NFL 2002

and

James Bond 007
    in . . . Agent Under Fire

TM

.

We expect net revenue from Nintendo GameCube
products to continue to grow in fiscal 2004, but for the rate of
growth to decrease.

As we expected, the decrease in revenue from
sales of PlayStation titles in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal
2002 was attributable to the market transition to newer
generation console systems. Although our PlayStation products
are playable on the PlayStation 2 console, we expect sales of
current PlayStation products to continue to decline in fiscal
2004.

•

Net revenue from sales of Game Boy Advance titles
    increased in fiscal 2003 by 81 percent to
    $79.1 million versus $43.7 million in the prior fiscal
    year primarily due to an increased number of Game Boy Advance
    titles available in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2003, seven titles
    were released on the Game Boy Advance platform compared to three
    in 2002. Also due to strong current year sales of

The Lord of
    the Rings, The Two Towers

and higher net revenue on the
    fiscal 2003 release of the Harry Potter franchise title,
    generating an aggregate increase of $30.8 million.

•

Net revenue from sales of Game Boy Color titles
    decreased 31 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to the prior
    fiscal year primarily due to the release of the hit title last
    year,

Harry Potter and the Sorceror’s Stone

, as well
    as revenues from

The World is Not Enough

and

Madden
    NFL 2002

, versus only one new title released in the current
    year,

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

.
    Additionally, the decrease in Game Boy Color net revenue for
    fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 compared to the prior year
    was attributable to the market transition to next generation
    console systems. We expect sales of current Game Boy Color
    products to continue to decline in fiscal 2004.



•

Net revenue from subscription fees for our online
    games increased 22 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to the prior
    fiscal year primarily due to the launch in fiscal 2003 of

Earth & Beyond

, and

The Sims Online

, and
    higher subscription revenue from

Motor City Online

,
    generating an aggregate increase of $8.6 million. These
    increases were partially offset by $1.1 million in Platinum
    and Sports subscription offerings, which we discontinued in
    November 2001.

•

Revenue derived from advertising on our online
    games sites decreased 16 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to
    the prior fiscal year primarily due to $3.8 million in
    lower advertising revenue generated from AOL and co-branded AOL
    online properties, and a $1.8 million decrease in online
    advertising purchased by online game companies who link their
    games sites to ours. We expect advertising revenue to decline in
    fiscal 2004 as we have been advised by AOL to expect significant
    declines in future advertising-related revenue.

We expected

The Sims Online

to be our
flagship online subscription offering. Through March 31,
2003, however, the number of units sold and number of
subscribers for

The Sims Online

and

Earth & Beyond

have been below our expectations. As a result, we canceled
most of our plans to develop similar online products and have
consolidated the operations of our online games business into
our core business. See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, included in Item 8 hereof.

Net revenue from co-publishing products and
distribution products increased 40 percent to
$375.8 million in fiscal 2003 compared to
$269.0 million in the prior fiscal year primarily due to
strong sales of hit titles including

Kingdom Hearts, 1503
A.D. The New World

and higher

Battlefield 1942

franchise net revenue, for an aggregate increase of
$105.0 million in fiscal 2003.

Operations by Segment

In fiscal 2003 and 2002, we operated and reported
our business in two business segments:

•

EA Core business segment: creation, marketing and
    distribution of interactive entertainment software.

•

EA.com business segment: creation, marketing and
    distribution of interactive entertainment software which can be
    played or sold online, ongoing management of subscriptions of
    online games and website advertising.

The EA.com business segment represented our
online and e-Commerce businesses. The EA.com business segment
included subscription revenue collected for Internet game play
on our websites, website advertising, sales of packaged goods
for Internet-only games and sales of our packaged goods games
sold through the our web store. The Consolidated Statements of
Operations includes all revenue and costs directly and
indirectly attributable to the EA.com business segment,
including charges for shared facilities, functions and services.
Certain costs and expenses are subjective and allocations were
based on management’s estimates. See Note 18 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in
Item 8 hereof.

In March 2003, we consolidated the operations of
the EA.com business segment into our core business. We now
consider online functionality to be integral to our existing and
future products. Accordingly,



beginning April 1, 2003, we no longer manage
our online products and services as a separate business segment,
and we will consolidate the reporting related to our online
products and services into reporting for the overall development
and publication of our core products for all reporting periods
ending after that date. We believe that this will better reflect
the way in which our Chief Operating Decision Maker reviews and
manages our business and reflects the importance of our online
products and services relative to the rest of our business. We
believe we will only have one reportable segment in fiscal 2004
as a result of restructuring the EA.com business. Concurrently,
we will also eliminate separate reporting for our Class B
Common Stock for all reporting periods ending after
April 1, 2003.

Our view and reporting of business segments may
change due to changes in the underlying business facts and
circumstances and the evolution of our reporting to our Chief
Operating Decision Maker.

Information about our operations by segment for
fiscal 2003 and 2002 is presented below (in thousands):



(a)

EA.com Marketing and Sales includes
    $17.9 million of Carriage Fee in fiscal 2003 and fiscal
    2002.

(b)

EA.com Research and Development includes
    $43.0 million of Network Development and Support for fiscal
    2003 and $59.5 million in fiscal 2002; and includes
    $10.0 million of Customer Relationship Management for
    fiscal 2003 and $10.6 million in fiscal 2002.

(c)

Results for fiscal 2003 do not include
    amortization of goodwill as a result of adopting SFAS
    No. 142. Amortization of intangibles for fiscal 2002
    includes goodwill amortization of $7.4 million for
    EA Core and $5.7 million for EA.com.

Costs and Expenses, Interest and Other
Income, Net, Income Taxes and Net Income (Loss) for both
EA Core and EA.com Segments

Cost of Goods Sold.

Cost of goods sold for our disk-based
and cartridge-based products consists of actual product costs,
royalties expense for celebrities, professional sports and other
organizations and independent software developers, manufacturing
royalties, net of volume discounts, expense for defective
products, write-off of post-launch prepaid royalty costs, and
operations expense. Cost of goods sold for our online product
subscription business consists primarily of data center and
bandwidth costs associated with hosting our websites, credit
card fees and royalties for use of EA and third party
properties. Cost of goods sold for our website advertising
business consists primarily of ad serving costs.



Marketing and Sales.

Marketing and sales expenses consist
of personnel-related costs, advertising and marketing and
promotional expenses, net of coop advertising expense
reimbursements. In addition, marketing and sales includes the
amortization of the fees payable under our agreement with AOL
for the distribution, or “carriage”, of our online
games on their network, which began with the launch of our
online games service in October 2000. See Note 5 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in
Item 8 hereof.

General and Administrative.

General and administrative expenses
consist of personnel and related expenses of executive and
administrative staff, fees for professional services such as
legal and accounting, and allowances for bad debts.

Research and Development.

Research and development expenses
consist of personnel-related costs, consulting, equipment
depreciation, customer relationship management expenses
associated with our products and write-offs of pre-launch
prepaid royalties. Research and development expenses for the
EA.com business segment include expenses incurred by EA Studios
consisting of direct development costs and related overhead
costs in connection with the development and production of our
online games. Research and development expenses also include
network development and support costs directly incurred by the
EA.com business segment. Network development and support costs
consist of expenses associated with development of website
content, depreciation on server equipment to support online
games, network infrastructure direct expenses, software licenses
and maintenance, and network and management overhead.

Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue
decreased by 4 percentage points to 43.2 percent in
fiscal 2003 from 47.2 percent in fiscal 2002 primarily due
to:

•

Higher PC margins contributing a
    1.7 percentage point increase to the total gross margins,
    due to higher sales of wholly-owned intellectual properties such
    as

SimCity 4

and

Command & Conquer Generals,

lower developer royalties in general and higher average sales
    prices.

•

Higher margins on co-publishing and distribution
    products contributing 0.9 percent to the total gross
    margins, due to higher volume of co-publishing products, which
    have a higher gross margin than distribution products, released
    in fiscal 2003, such as

Battlefield 1942, Ty the Tasmanian
    Tiger

and

The Simpsons Road Rage.

•

Higher margins on PlayStation 2 products
    contributing 0.8 percent to the total gross margins due to
    volume discounts received from Sony and lower average
    manufacturing royalty rates.

Marketing and sales expenses increased by
37.9 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002
primarily due to:

•

The release of 86 SKUs in fiscal 2003 versus
    64 SKUs last year. The primary increase in marketing and
    sales expense in fiscal 2003 related to higher advertising
    spending of $46.1 million to support product releases on
    multiple platforms and across multiple territories including

Madden NFL 2003

,

NBA Live 2003

,

The Lord of the
    Rings, The Two Towers, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,
    The Sims

franchise titles and

The Sims Online

.

•

Increase in headcount and related expenses of
    $20.5 million to support the growth of our marketing and
    sales functions worldwide.



As a percentage of net revenue, marketing and
sales expenses declined from 14.0 percent of net revenue in
fiscal 2002 to 13.4 percent of revenue in fiscal 2003.
Marketing and sales includes vendor reimbursements for
advertising expenses of $28.2 million in fiscal 2003 and
$8.9 million in fiscal 2002 to support key titles.

General and administrative expenses increased by
22.2 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002
primarily due to an increase in payroll costs of
$26.9 million to support the increased growth of these
functions worldwide.

As a percentage of net revenue, general and
administrative expenses declined from 6.2 percent of net
revenue in fiscal 2002 to 5.3 percent of net revenue.

Research and development expenses increased by
5.4 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002
primarily due to:

•

Higher EA Core business segment expenses, which
    increased by $48.7 million, or 19 percent, due to
    additional headcount-related expenses, offset by lower advance
    write-offs of $27.2 million in fiscal 2003.

•

Partially offset by lower EA.com business segment
    spending, which decreased by $28.3 million, or
    22 percent, as a result of lower salary expense and
    development spending on discontinued products. The decrease in
    spending was partially offset by higher development spending
    associated with

The Sims Online

.

As a percentage of revenue, research and
development expenses declined from 22.0 percent of net
revenue in fiscal 2002 to 16.1 percent of net revenue in
fiscal 2003. Research and development includes vendor
reimbursements for development expenses of $15.0 million in
fiscal 2003 and $17.0 million in fiscal 2002 to support key
titles.

We expect research and development spending to
increase in fiscal 2004 due to an increase in development
spending for next generation console products including the
PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube, as well as
extending our investment in the PC platform.

Amortization of intangibles results primarily
from our acquisitions of Westwood, Kesmai, DreamWorks
Interactive, ABC Software, Pogo and other acquisitions.
Amortization of intangibles was $3.5 million for the EA
Core business segment and $4.0 million for the EA.com
business segment for fiscal 2003. Amortization of intangibles
was $12.9 million for the EA Core business segment and
$12.5 million for the EA.com business segment for fiscal
2002.

The decrease in amortization in fiscal 2003 of
$17.9 million, was driven by:

•

Adoption of SFAS No. 142 in fiscal 2003. For
    fiscal 2002, amortization of goodwill totaled $13.1 million.



•

Certain identifiable intangible assets related to
    Westwood and DreamWorks were amortized in fiscal 2002 resulting
    in a decrease of $3.5 million.

•

Impairment of Pogo and Kesmai finite-lived
    intangible assets as a result of the restructuring of the EA.com
    segment in fiscal 2003 and 2002 resulting in a decrease of
    $2.9 million.

In addition, we recorded intangible impairment
charges relating to our restructuring of the EA.com business
segment of $12.4 million in fiscal 2003 and
$1.6 million in fiscal 2002 (see our discussion under
“Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges” below).

EA Core Business Segment

During fiscal 2003, we closed our office located
in San Francisco, California and our studio located in Seattle,
Washington. The office and studio closures were a result of our
strategic decision to consolidate local development efforts in
Redwood City, California and Vancouver, Canada. We recorded
total pre-tax restructuring charges of $7.9 million and
asset impairment charges of $1.5 million. This charge
consists of $7.3 million for consolidation of facilities,
$1.5 million for the write-off of non-current assets and
$0.6 million for workforce reductions. The facilities
charge was net of a reduction in deferred rent of
$0.5 million.

The exit plans resulted in a workforce reduction
of approximately 33 personnel in development and administrative
departments. The estimated costs for consolidation of facilities
included contractual rental commitments under the real estate
lease for vacated office space, offset by estimated future
sub-lease income. In addition, the exit plans resulted in the
write-off of certain non-current fixed assets, primarily
leasehold improvements.

Additionally, during fiscal 2003, we consolidated
our Los Angeles, Irvine and Las Vegas studios into one major
game development studio in Los Angeles. These measures were
taken in order to maximize efficiencies and streamline the
creative development process and operations of our studios. In
connection with these consolidation activities, we recorded a
total pre-tax restructuring charge of $3.1 million and
asset impairment charges of $2.0 million. This charge
includes $1.6 million for the shutdown of facilities
related to non-cancelable lease payments for permanently vacated
properties and associated costs, $2.0 million for the
write-off of abandoned equipment and leasehold improvements at
facilities that were permanently vacated and $1.5 million
for employee severance expenses related to involuntary
terminations.

EA.com Business Segment

Fiscal 2003 Restructuring

During fiscal 2003, we consolidated the
operations of the EA.com business segment into our core
business, and have eliminated separate reporting for our
Class B common stock for all future reporting periods after
fiscal 2003. As a result of this restructuring, we recorded a
pre-tax charge of $67.0 million in fiscal 2003, consisting
of $1.8 million for workforce reductions, $2.3 million
for consolidation of facilities and other administrative
charges, and $62.9 million for the write-off of non-current
assets. We will make adjustments to the restructuring reserves
in future periods, if necessary, based upon the then-current
events and circumstances.

The restructuring plan resulted in the
termination of approximately 50 employees, mostly in research
and development. The estimated costs for consolidation of
facilities and other administrative charges included contractual
rental commitments under real estate leases for unutilized
office space offset by estimated future sub-lease income and
costs to close the facilities.



We performed an evaluation of asset impairment
under SFAS No. 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”

, to adjust the
depreciable assets and remaining finite-lived identifiable
intangibles utilized in the EA.com business segment to their
estimated fair value. This test was performed in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003 and the measurement date was
January 1, 2003. In February 2003, our only outside holder
of Class B common stock, AOL, exercised its right to
exchange its Class B shares for shares of Class A
common stock. In late December 2002, we launched

The Sims
Online,

an online game based on our very popular

The Sims

line of PC games, which have sold over 20 million units
worldwide.

The Sims Online

was expected to be our
flagship online subscription offering. Through March 31,
2003, the number of units sold and number of subscribers for

The Sims Online,

along with other EA.com business segment
revenue, were significantly below our expectations. As a result
of these triggering events in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003,
we canceled most of our plans to develop similar online products
and substantially reduced our expected future undiscounted cash
flows related to these long-lived assets. We recorded impairment
charges on long-lived assets of $62.9 million, including
$24.9 million relating to impaired customized internal-use
software systems for our online games and website
infrastructure, $25.6 million for other long-lived assets
and $12.4 million of finite-lived intangibles impairment
charges relating to our Kesmai and Pogo online game studios.
There are no assurances that the impairment factors evaluated by
management will not change in subsequent periods and
accordingly, we may record additional impairment charges in
future periods.

In conjunction with our annual policy to reassess
the remaining useful lives of goodwill and certain
indefinite-lived intangibles and to test the recoverability of
these long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”

, as of
January 1, 2003, we also performed fair-value-based tests
to evaluate impairment of assets included in the EA.com
reporting unit. Under this test, the fair-value-based tests did
not indicate an impairment of our recorded goodwill and certain
indefinite-lived intangibles at the EA.com reporting unit level.
However, future impairment tests could result in a charge to
earnings and a corresponding write down of goodwill and certain
indefinite-lived intangibles.

The following table reflects our unaudited pro
forma consolidated basic earnings (loss) per share for the
years ended 2003, 2002 and 2001 as if the consolidation of the
operations of our EA.com business segment into our core business
had occurred at the beginning of each of the periods presented
(in thousands, except per share data):

Fiscal 2002 Restructuring

During fiscal 2002, we announced a restructuring
plan for our EA.com business segment to reduce its workforce and
consolidate facilities. These restructuring and resulting asset
impairment charges were necessary in order to focus on key
online priorities and reduce the EA.com business segment’s
operating cost structure. As a result of this restructuring, we
recorded a pre-tax charge of $20.3 million in fiscal 2002,
consisting of $4.2 million for workforce reductions,
$3.3 million for consolidation of facilities and other
administrative charges and $12.8 million for the write-off
of non-current assets. We will make



adjustments to the restructuring reserves in
future periods, if necessary, based upon the-then current events
and circumstances.

The restructuring plan resulted in the
termination of approximately 270 employees, or one-third of the
EA.com business segment workforce, which affected all
departments across the organization. The estimated costs for
consolidation of facilities are comprised of contractual rental
commitments under real estate leases for vacated office space
offset by estimated future sub-lease income. Included in these
costs are estimated costs to close offices or consolidate
facilities in various locations and costs to write off a portion
of the assets from these facilities.

In addition, our restructuring efforts required
an evaluation of asset impairment in accordance with SFAS
No. 121,

“Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
Of”

, to adjust these depreciable assets and certain
intangibles to their estimated fair value. We evaluated the
impact of consolidating or abandoning certain online
technologies and processes and reviewed the effect of changes to
our subscription online product offerings in relation to the
asset base of the EA.com business segment. As a result, it was
determined that certain long-lived assets would be abandoned or
were related to products or services that had been discontinued
and would therefore be written-down to their estimated net
disposal value. Impairment charges on long-lived assets amounted
to $12.8 million, including $11.2 million relating to
abandoned technologies consisting of customized internal-use
software systems for our online infrastructure,
$1.0 million of intangibles impairment charges related to
our Kesmai online development studio resulting from
discontinuing associated products and services and
$0.6 million of goodwill charges relating to our San Diego
online game studio closure. We may change these impairment
factors in subsequent periods and accordingly, we could record
additional impairment charges in future periods.

Interest and other income, net, in fiscal 2003
decreased from fiscal 2002 primarily due to:

•

Other-than-temporary impairment of investments in
    affiliates of $10.6 million in fiscal 2003.

•

Partially offset by higher interest income in
    fiscal 2003 of $5.1 million, as a result of higher average
    cash balances in the current year.

Our effective tax rate was 31.0 percent for
fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002.

Reported net income increased in fiscal 2003
compared to fiscal 2002 primarily related to:

•

Higher revenues and gross profits.

•

Partially offset by an increase in expenses
    compared to fiscal 2002. The increase in expenses was primarily
    due to increases in marketing and advertising costs to support a
    higher number of key releases in multiple territories and
    spending on our products for the Xbox and Nintendo GameCube
    consoles which, in fiscal 2003, have been available in all of
    our significant geographical markets. In



addition, there was an increase in expenses due
    to higher charges for restructuring and asset impairment in
    fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002.

Although the dollar amount of expenses rose in
fiscal 2003 versus fiscal 2002, net income as a percentage of
sales increased to 12.8 percent versus 5.9 percent as
expenses grew at a slower rate than did our revenues.

Comparison of Fiscal 2002 to 2001:

Revenue

Geographically, our net revenue for the fiscal
years ended March 31, 2002 and 2001 break down as follows:
(in thousands):

North America Net Revenue

The increase in North America net revenue for
fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily attributable
to:

•

A 111 percent increase in PlayStation 2
    revenue for the year due to the shipment of key titles such as

Madden NFL 2002

,

James Bond 007
    in . . . Agent Under Fire

,

NBA
    Street

,

NBA Live 2002

and

SSX Tricky

, a
    higher installed base of hardware and a strong catalogue
    business. PlayStation 2 launched in October 2000.
    Consequently, fiscal 2001 includes six months of
    PlayStation 2 product revenue as compared to 12 months
    of revenue for PlayStation 2 titles in fiscal 2002.

•

The launch of the Xbox platform in North America
    in November 2001, which generated $73.6 million in revenue
    from Xbox titles such as

Madden NFL 2002

,

NBA
    Live 2002

,

James Bond 007
    in . . . Agent Under Fire

,

NASCAR
    Thunder 2002

,

NHL 2002

and

SSX
    Tricky

.

•

The launch of Nintendo GameCube in North America
    in November 2001, which generated $48.7 million for the
    year from key GameCube titles such as

Madden NFL 2002

,

James Bond 007 in . . . Agent Under
    Fire

,

SSX Tricky

,

NBA Street

and

FIFA
    Soccer 2002

.

•

Revenue was generated for the first time in
    fiscal 2002 by Game Boy Advance titles, amounting to
    $26.0 million for the year from key titles including

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone

,

Madden
    NFL

and

NHL 2002

. Also, revenue was generated for the
    first time in fiscal 2002 by Game Boy Color titles, amounting to
    $16.9 million for the year from titles such as

Harry
    Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone

,

Madden NFL 2002

and

The World Is Not Enough

.

•

Advertising revenue increased by
    $31.8 million for fiscal 2002, because we had
    12 months of advertising revenue in fiscal 2002 compared to
    only six months of advertising revenue in fiscal 2001. This was
    because we commenced generating advertising revenue immediately
    following the launch of our online games website in October
    2000. In addition, subsequent to our February 2001 acquisition
    of Pogo Corporation, advertising revenue generated from Pogo
    websites was included in our revenues.

•

These increases were partially offset by the
    continued expected decreases in revenue for PlayStation and
    Nintendo 64 titles due to the declining markets for those
    platforms and fewer titles shipped in fiscal 2002 compared to
    fiscal 2001.



International Net Revenue

The increase in international net revenue for
fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was attributable to the
following:

•

Net revenue from operations in Europe increased
    by 34 percent compared to fiscal 2001 primarily due to
    higher sales of PlayStation 2, PC, co-publishing and
    distribution products, partially offset by the expected decrease
    of revenue from Sony PlayStation products. PlayStation 2
    launched in November 2000. Consequently, fiscal 2001 includes
    five months of revenue from PlayStation 2 titles as
    compared to 12 months of revenue from PlayStation 2
    titles in fiscal 2002, resulting in an 80 percent increase
    in revenues from PlayStation 2 titles.

•

Net revenue in our Asia Pacific territory,
    excluding Japan, increased by five percent compared to fiscal
    2001 primarily due to higher sales of PlayStation 2, Game
    Boy Color and PC titles, partially offset by the expected
    decrease in PlayStation and Nintendo 64 title sales, and an
    unfavorable exchange rate comparison of approximately
    10 percent. Revenue from PlayStation 2 titles
    increased by 46 percent, partially offset by a
    34 percent decrease in revenue from PlayStation titles in
    fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001.

•

Net revenue from operations in Japan increased by
    11 percent compared to fiscal 2001 primarily due to higher
    revenue from our co-publishing and distribution titles, and
    revenue generated from sales of PlayStation, Nintendo GameCube
    and Xbox products, offset by the strong sales of our first
    PlayStation 2 title,

FIFA Soccer World Championship

,
    in the prior year and weakness in the Yen currency during fiscal
    2002 resulting in a rate decrease of approximately
    14 percent from fiscal 2001. Also, our operations in Japan
    did not benefit from our primary PlayStation 2 releases
    during fiscal 2002, which had more appeal to the North American
    market. Revenue from PlayStation 2 titles decreased by 50
    percent in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001.

Information about our worldwide net revenue by
product line for fiscal 2002 and 2001 is presented below (in
thousands):

PlayStation 2 Net
Revenue

(in thousands)

Net revenue increased in fiscal 2002 due to the
higher installed base of PlayStation 2 consoles and more titles,
including catalogue titles, available on the platform compared
to fiscal 2001. Major releases in fiscal 2002 included

Madden
NFL 2002

,

James Bond 007
in . . . Agent Under Fire, FIFA 2002, NBA
Street, NBA



Live 2002, NCAA Football

,

SSX Tricky

,

NHL

and

NASCAR Thunder 2002.

We released 18
PlayStation 2 titles in fiscal 2002 compared to 15 in the prior
fiscal year.

Personal Computer Net
Revenue

(in thousands)

The increase in sales of PC products in fiscal
2002 compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the
continued strong sales of

The Sims,

which shipped in
fiscal 2000. Key fiscal 2002 product releases were

Harry
Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, The Sims Hot Date
Expansion Pack, Medal of Honor: Allied Assault™, Command
& Conquer Renegade™

and

Madden NFL 2002

. We
released 16 PC titles in the fiscal 2002 compared to 18 in the
prior fiscal year.

PlayStation Net
Revenue

(in thousands)

We released five PlayStation titles in fiscal
2002 compared to 17 titles in the prior fiscal year. As
expected, PlayStation sales decreased in fiscal 2002 compared to
the prior year primarily due to the transition to 128-bit
console systems (such as the PlayStation 2) and fewer titles
released for the PlayStation during fiscal 2002.

Xbox Net Revenue

(in
thousands)

Following the launch of the Xbox console in North
America in November 2001, we released our first ten Xbox titles
during fiscal 2002. Titles released included

Madden NFL 2002,
NBA Live 2002, James Bond 007 in . . . Agent
Under Fire, NASCAR Thunder 2002, NHL 2002, Triple Play™
2002, SSX Tricky, Knockout Kings 2002

and

F1 2001

.

Nintendo GameCube Net
Revenue

(in thousands)

We released our first five Nintendo GameCube
titles,

Madden NFL 2002, James Bond 007
in . . . Agent Under Fire, SSX Tricky, NBA
Street

and

FIFA Soccer 2002

, during fiscal 2002
following the platform’s launch in Japan in September 2001
and in North America in November 2001.

Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Color Net
Revenue

(in thousands)

•

We released our first three Game Boy Advance
    titles,

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, Madden
    NFL 2002

and

NHL 2002

during fiscal 2002.



•

We released three Game Boy Color titles,

Harry
    Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, Madden NFL 2002

and

The World is Not Enough

during fiscal 2002.

Online Subscription and Advertising Net
Revenue

(in thousands)

•

The increase in online subscription revenue in
    fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to the
    continued strong sales of

Ultima Online Third Dawn,

the
    release of

Ultima Online Lord Blackthorn’s Revenge

in February 2002 and the launch of

Motor City Online

in October 2001, which contributed $1.5 million in
    subscription revenue for fiscal 2002. This increase was offset
    by a decrease in subscription revenue of $5.0 million for
    Gamestorm, Kesmai Corporation (“Kesmai”) and Worldplay
    online games (most of which were transferred to our free service
    when the EA/ AOL site went live in October 2000) in fiscal 2002
    as compared to fiscal 2001.

•

We began generating advertising revenue in the
    third quarter of fiscal 2001 following the launch of our online
    games site on the world wide web and on the AOL Games Channel in
    October 2000. In addition, we generated advertising revenue from
    games websites operated by Pogo Corporation after our purchase
    of Pogo Corporation in February 2001. Because we launched our ad
    business in late fiscal 2001, we experienced significant revenue
    growth in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001.

Co-publishing and Distribution Product Net
Revenue

(in thousands)

Co-publishing and distribution product sales
increased for fiscal 2002 compared to the prior fiscal year
primarily due to strong sales in fiscal 2002 of hit titles
including

Devil May Cry, Resident Evil: Code Veronica

and

The Simpsons™

Road Rage

. This was partially
offset by lower revenue from shipment of Square EA products due
to fewer titles released in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001.

Operations by Segment

In fiscal 2002 and 2001, we operated and reported
our business in two business segments:

•

EA Core business segment: creation, marketing and
    distribution of interactive entertainment software.

•

EA.com business segment: creation, marketing and
    distribution of interactive entertainment software which can be
    played or sold online, ongoing management of subscriptions of
    online games and website advertising.

The Consolidated Statements of Operations break
out all revenue and costs directly and indirectly attributable
to the EA.com business segment, including charges for shared
facilities, functions and services. Certain costs and expenses
were determined on a subjective basis and allocations were based
on our estimates. See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, included in Item 8 hereof



regarding changes to the EA.com business segment.

Information about our operations by segment for
fiscal 2002 and 2001 is presented below (in thousands):



(a)

EA.com Marketing and Sales includes
    $17.9 million of Carriage Fee for fiscal 2002 and
    $8.9 million of Carriage Fee for fiscal 2001.
    “Carriage Fee” is the amount paid to AOL for the right
    to distribute our online games site on their online services and
    thereby reach AOL’s subscribers and users.

(b)

EA.com Research and Development includes
    $59.5 million of Network Development and Support for fiscal
    2002 and $51.8 million in fiscal 2001; and includes
    $10.6 million of Customer Relationship Management for
    fiscal 2002 and $11.4 million in fiscal 2001.

Costs and Expenses, Interest and Other
Income, Net, Income Taxes and Net Income (Loss) for
both

EA Core and EA.com Segments

Cost of Goods
Sold

(in thousands)

Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue
decreased in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 due to:

•

Revenue from Xbox and Nintendo GameCube titles
    with lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue.

•

Higher revenue from PlayStation 2 titles in
    fiscal 2002.

•

Higher advertising revenue, which has low cost of
    goods sold as a percentage of revenue.



•

Lower revenue on Nintendo 64 products with high
    cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue.

•

Higher margins in our co-publishing and
    distribution business due to a higher number of co-publishing
    titles with lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue.

•

Higher average margins on our PC products.

These items were partially offset by:

•

Higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of
    revenue on our PlayStation and PlayStation 2 products as
    compared to fiscal 2001.

•

Revenue from Nintendo Game Boy Advance and Game
    Boy Color titles with higher cost of goods sold as a percentage
    of revenue.

•

Lower revenues from high-margin PC titles in
    fiscal 2002.

Marketing and
Sales

(in thousands)

As a percent of revenue, marketing and sales
expense in fiscal 2002 was 14 percent, that same percentage as
fiscal 2001. Marketing and sales expenses for fiscal 2002
increased 30.1 percent, primarily attributed to:

•

Higher marketing and advertising in North America
    and Europe for programs to support

Madden NFL 2002

,

James Bond 007 in

Agent Under Fire

,

SSX
    Tricky

,

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone

,

FIFA Soccer 2002

and

NBA Live 2002

.

•

Higher marketing and sales expenses for our
    online business due to increased consumer promotions and
    advertising media placement costs to promote new game offerings,
    particularly

Majestic

and

Motor City Online

, and
    higher expenditures associated with selling advertising on both
    the EA.com and Pogo games websites.

•

The amortization of the AOL Carriage Fee, which
    began with the launch of the online games site in October 2000.

These items were partially offset by vendor
reimbursements for advertising expenses of $8.9 million in
fiscal 2002 to support key titles. There were no vendor
reimbursements received in fiscal 2001.

General and
Administrative

(in thousands)

General and administrative expenses increased
2.9 percent in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001,
primarily attributed to:

•

$1.0 million contribution to charity
    organizations providing support for the September 11th
    tragedy.

•

Increase in payroll and occupancy costs to
    support the increased growth in North America.

•

Increase in bad debt expense of $1.8 million
    due to higher product sales.

Research and
Development

(in thousands)



Research and development expenses increased
slightly in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001, primarily
attributable to:

•

Increased payroll costs due to higher headcount
    in EA Studios, net of co-development arrangements.

•

Increased spending on online projects in
    development, primarily

The Sims Online

and

Earth &
    Beyond

™.

•

Increased depreciation related to both hardware
    and internally developed software that began when our online
    games site went live in October 2000.

•

Increased headcount and network-related costs
    associated with our Pogo development studio and online games
    site.

These increases were offset by:

•

Headcount reductions in our online business in
    October 2001 (see Charge for Restructuring and Impairment
    discussion below).

•

Replacement of the free online games channel,
    that had been on our online games site, with Pogo free games
    acquired as part of our acquisition of Pogo Corporation in
    February 2001.

•

Vendor reimbursements for development expenses of
    $17.0 million in fiscal 2002 to support key titles. There
    were no vendor reimbursements received in fiscal 2001.

Amortization of
Intangibles

(in thousands)

Amortization of intangibles results primarily
from amortizing purchased goodwill and intangibles associated
with acquisitions, including Westwood, Kesmai, DreamWorks
Interactive, ABC Software and Pogo Corporation. Amortization of
purchased goodwill and intangibles was $12.9 million for
the EA Core business segment and $12.5 million for the
EA.com business segment for fiscal 2002. Amortization of
intangibles was $12.8 million for the EA Core business
segment and $6.5 million for the EA.com business segment
for fiscal 2001. The increase in amortization of intangibles in
fiscal 2002 for the EA.com business segment, compared to the
prior year, was due to our acquisition of Pogo Corporation in
February 2001. In addition, we recorded intangible impairment
charges of $1.6 million in fiscal 2002 relating to our
restructuring of our online business.

Charge for Acquired In-Process
Technology

(in thousands)

In connection with the acquisition of Pogo
Corporation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we allocated
and expensed $2.7 million of the $43.3 million
purchase price to acquired in-process technology. At the date of
the closing of the acquisition, this amount was expensed as a
non-recurring charge as the in-process technology had not yet
reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future
uses. Pogo had various projects in progress at the time of the
acquisition. As of the acquisition date, costs to complete Pogo
projects acquired were expected to be approximately
$1.2 million in future periods. During fiscal 2002, all of
these development projects were completed and launched on our
Pogo online games sites. In conjunction with the acquisition of
Pogo, we accrued approximately $0.1 million related to
direct transaction and other related costs.

We recorded this charge after concluding that the
in-process technology had not reached technological feasibility
and had no alternative future use after taking into
consideration the potential for usage of the software in
different products and resale of the software.



Restructuring and Asset Impairment
Charges

(in thousands)

During fiscal 2002, we announced a restructuring
plan for the EA.com business segment to reduce its workforce and
consolidate facilities. The restructuring and resulting asset
impairment charges were necessary in order to focus on key
online priorities and reduce the EA.com segment’s operating
cost structure. A pre-tax charge of $20.3 million was
recorded in fiscal 2002, consisting of $4.2 million for
workforce reductions, $3.3 million for consolidation of
facilities and other administrative charges and
$12.8 million for the write-off of non-current assets as a
direct result of the restructuring. We will make adjustments to
the restructuring reserves in future periods, if necessary,
based upon events and circumstances that we encounter in the
future.

The restructuring plan resulted in the
termination of approximately 270 employees, or one-third of the
workforce of the EA.com business segment, which affected all
departments across the organization. The estimated costs for
consolidation of facilities are comprised of contractual rental
commitments under real estate leases for unutilized office space
offset by estimated future sub-lease income. Included in these
costs are estimated costs to close offices or consolidate
facilities in various locations and costs to write off a portion
of the assets from these facilities.

In addition, the restructuring efforts required
an evaluation of asset impairment in accordance with SFAS
No. 121,

“Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
Of”

, to adjust these depreciable assets and certain
intangibles to their estimated fair value. Management evaluated
the impact of consolidating or abandoning certain online
technologies and processes and reviewed the effect of changes to
our subscription online product offerings in relation to the
EA.com segment’s asset base. As a result, it was determined
that certain long-lived assets would be abandoned or were
related to products or services that had been discontinued and
would therefore be written-down to their estimated net disposal
value. We recorded impairment charges on long-lived assets of
$12.8 million, including $11.2 million relating to
consolidated or abandoned technologies for our online game site
infrastructure and $1.6 million of goodwill and intangibles
impairment charges relating to our San Diego and Kesmai online
games development studios. These impairment factors may change
in subsequent periods and accordingly, we may record additional
impairment charges in future periods.

Interest and Other Income,
Net

(in thousands)

Interest and other income, net, decreased by
23.9 percent primarily due to lower interest income as a
result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2002 and an increase in
the cost of utilizing foreign exchange hedge contracts.

Income Taxes

(in thousands)

Our effective tax rate was 31.0 percent for
fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001. At March 31, 2002, we
generated a federal income tax net operating loss. This loss
will be carried forward to future tax years. At March 31,
2001, we also generated a federal income tax net operating loss.
We used a substantial portion of this loss in a carryback claim
with the remainder being carried forward. The net operating
losses for both fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 resulted from losses
from our EA.com business segment operations as well as stock



option deductions. We did not establish a
valuation allowance on these loss carryforwards or other net
deferred tax assets as we believe it is more likely than not
that the results of future operations will generate sufficient
taxable income to realize them.

Net Income
(loss)

(in thousands)

Reported net income (loss) increased in
fiscal 2002 primarily due to higher net revenue, partially
offset by higher expenses compared to fiscal 2001. The increase
in expenses was primarily due to increases in marketing and
advertising costs to support a higher number of franchise
titles. Expenses were also higher in fiscal 2002 due to
restructuring and asset impairment charges discussed above.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of March 31, 2003, our working capital
was $1.34 billion compared to $699.6 million at
March 31, 2002. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments increased by $790.7 million in fiscal 2003. We
generated $714.5 million of cash from operations,
$131.7 million of cash through the sale of equity
securities under our stock plans, and used $59.1 million of
cash in capital expenditures during fiscal 2003.

Our principal source of liquidity is
$1.59 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments and $1.1 million in marketable securities at
March 31, 2003. We believe the existing cash, cash
equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated from
operations will be sufficient to meet cash and investment
requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, our
ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected by
various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to,
those related to customer demand and acceptance of titles on new
platforms and new title versions on existing platforms, our
ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due,
successfully achieving our product release schedules and
attaining our forecasted sales objectives, the impact of
competition, the economic conditions in the domestic and
international markets, seasonality in operating results, risks
of product returns and the other risks listed in the “Risk
Factors” section.

EA.com Business Segment

Included in the amounts above is the following
for the EA.com business segment:

•

The EA.com business segment has been funded
    solely by Electronic Arts, with the exception of
    $20.0 million in proceeds from the sale of equities to AOL
    in fiscal 2000. This funding has been accounted for as capital
    contributions from Electronic Arts. Excess cash generated from
    EA.com business segment operations has been transferred to
    Electronic Arts, and has been accounted for as a return of
    capital. In March 2003, we consolidated the operations of EA.com
    into our core business. As such, our online products and
    services will no longer have separate funding needs in the
    foreseeable future. We do not expect this consolidation to have
    a material impact on our future liquidity and capital resource
    needs. The majority of outstanding Class B options, shares
    and warrants were retired or exchanged for Class A shares
    and warrants during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.

•

During fiscal 2003, the EA.com business segment
    used $35.9 million of cash in operations, $0.8 million
    in capital expenditures for computer equipment, offset by
    $35.1 million in capital contributions received from
    Electronic Arts. As a result of the $157.5 million net
    operating loss generated in the EA.com business segment, we
    realized a tax benefit of approximately $48.8 million.

•

During fiscal 2002, the EA.com business segment
    used $99.7 million of cash in operations, $13.1 million in
    capital expenditures for computer equipment, internal-use
    software and third-party technology licenses, offset by
    $114.8 million in capital contributions received from
    Electronic Arts. As a result of the $151.6 million net
    operating loss generated in the EA.com business segment, we
    realized a tax benefit of approximately $47.0 million.

Under our carriage agreement with AOL entered
into in November 1999, we are required to pay $81.0 million
to AOL over the life of the five-year agreement. Of this amount,
$36.0 million was paid upon signing the agreement with the
remainder due in four equal annual installments beginning with
the first anniversary of the initial payment. We made carriage
payments to AOL of $11.25 million in each of the fiscal
years 2003, 2002 and 2001. As of March 31, 2003, we have
$11.25 million remaining on this commitment. See
Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
included in Item 8 hereof, for additional information.



Other Commitments

Advertising Commitments

AOL

In our carriage agreement with AOL, we also made
a commitment to spend $15.0 million in offline media
advertisements prior to March 31, 2005 consisting of:

•

$10.0 million on television, radio, print
    and outdoor advertising that promotes the availability of our
    online games on certain AOL online services; and

•

$5.0 million ($1.0 million per year
    over the five year agreement) on television, radio, print and
    outdoor advertising that promotes the availability of a specific
    category of our online games (so- called “parlor
    games”) on certain AOL online services.

As of March 31, 2003, we have spent
approximately $4.3 million against this commitment. We are
not required to purchase any of the advertising from AOL or its
affiliates.

News America Corporation

In addition, under an agreement amended on
August 30, 2002, we made a commitment to spend
$17.0 million in advertising with News America Corporation
and its affiliates through the period ended December 31,
2006. As of March 31, 2003, we have fulfilled approximately
$8.5 million of this commitment. See “News America
Corporation Exchange” below.

Lease Commitments

We lease certain of our current facilities and
certain equipment under non-cancelable capital and operating
lease agreements. We are required to pay property taxes,
insurance and normal maintenance costs for certain of our
facilities and will be required to pay any increases over the
base year of these expenses on the remainder of our facilities.

In February 1995, we entered into a build-to-suit
lease with Keybank National Association on our
headquarter’s facility in Redwood City, California, which
was extended in July 2001 and expires in July 2006. We accounted
for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with
SFAS No. 13,

“Accounting for Leases”

, as
amended. Existing campus facilities developed in phase one
comprise a total of 350,000 square feet and provide space for
sales, marketing, administration and research and development
functions. We have an option to purchase the property (land and
facilities) for $145.0 million or, at the end of the lease,
to arrange for (1) an additional extension of the lease or
(2) sale of the property to a third party with us retaining
an obligation to the owner for the difference between the sale
price and the guaranteed residual value of up to
$128.9 million if the sales price is less than this amount.
The lease also provides that a sale of the property to a third
party is subject to remarketing conditions including marketing
assistance, requisite repairs and maintenance, appropriate
notice and seller’s indemnities and warranties.

In December 2000, we entered into a second
build-to-suit lease with Keybank National Association for a
five-year term beginning December 2000 to expand our Redwood
City, California headquarters facilities and develop adjacent
property adding approximately 310,000 square feet to our campus.
Construction was completed in June 2002. We accounted for this
arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with SFAS
No. 13, as amended. The facilities provide space for
marketing, sales and research and development. We have an option
to purchase the property for $127.0 million or, at the end
of the lease, to arrange for (1) an extension of the lease
or (2) sale of the property to a third party with us
retaining an obligation to the owner for the difference between
the sale price and the guaranteed residual value of up to $118.8
million if the sales price is less than this amount. The lease
also provides that a sale of the property to a third party is
subject to remarketing conditions including marketing
assistance, requisite repairs and maintenance, appropriate
notice and seller’s indemnities and warranties.

Lease rates are based upon the Commercial Paper
Rate. The two lease agreements described above require us to
maintain certain financial covenants related to consolidated net
worth, fixed charge coverage



ratio, total consolidated debt to total
consolidated capital and quick ratio, all of which we were in
compliance with as of March 31, 2003.

Letters of Credit

In connection with our purchases of optical disks
for our Nintendo GameCube titles distributed in North America,
Nintendo requires us to provide irrevocable letters of credit
prior to Nintendo’s acceptance of purchase orders from us
for purchases of these optical disks. For purchases of optical
disks for our Nintendo GameCube products distributed in Japan
and Europe, Nintendo typically requires us to make cash deposits.

In July 2002, we provided an irrevocable standby
letter of credit to Nintendo of Europe. The standby letter of
credit guarantees performance of our obligations to pay Nintendo
of Europe for trade payables of up to 8.0 million Euros.
The standby letter of credit expires in July 2005. At
March 31, 2003, we had $0.3 million of payables to
Nintendo of Europe covered by this standby letter of credit.

Development, Celebrity, League and Content
Licenses: Payments and Commitments

The products produced by EA Studios are designed
and created by our employee designers and artists and by
non-employee software developers (“independent
artists”). We typically advance development funds to the
independent artists during development of our games, usually in
installment payments made upon the completion of specified
development milestones, which payments are considered advances
against subsequent royalties based on the sales of the products.
These terms are typically set forth in written agreements
entered into with the independent artists. In addition, we have
certain celebrity, league and content license contracts that
contain minimum guarantee payments and marketing commitments
that are not dependent on any deliverables. Celebrities and
organizations with whom we have contracts include: FIFA
(soccer), NASCAR (stock car racing), John Madden (professional
football), National Basketball Association, PGA TOUR (golf),
Tiger Woods (golf), National Hockey League, Warner Bros. (Harry
Potter), MGM/ Danjaq (James Bond), National Football League,
Collegiate Licensing Company (collegiate football and
basketball), ISC (stock car racing), Major League Baseball
Properties, MLB Players Association (baseball) and Island Def
Jam (wrestling). These developer and content license commitments
represent the sum of (1) the cash payments due under
non-royalty-bearing licenses and services agreements, and
(2) the minimum payments and advances against royalties due
under royalty-bearing licenses and services agreements. These
minimum guarantee payments and marketing commitments are
included in the table below.

The following table summarized our minimum
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of
March 31, 2003 (in thousands), and the effect we expect
them to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods:

As of March 31, 2003, we had
$1.59 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments. We believe that the existing cash, cash
equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by our
business



are adequate to enable us to meet our future
minimum contractual obligations and commercial commitments for
at least the next 12 months.

Transactions with Related
Parties

News America
Corporation Exchange

On February 7, 2000, we acquired Kesmai from
News America Corporation (“News Corp”) in exchange for
$22.5 million in cash and approximately 206,000 shares of
our existing common stock valued at $8.65 million. Under
the original agreements, we agreed to spend $12.5 million
through the period ended June 1, 2002 in advertising with
News Corp or any of its affiliates. In addition, under these
agreements if certain conditions were met, including that a
qualified public offering of Class B common stock did not
occur within twenty-four months of News Corp’s purchase of
such shares and all of the Class B outstanding shares had
been converted to Class A common stock, then (1) News
Corp would have the right to (i) exchange Class B
common stock for approximately 206,000 shares of Class A
common stock, and (ii) receive cash from us in the amount
of $9.65 million, and (2) we would agree to spend an
additional $11.675 million in advertising with News Corp
and its affiliates.

On August 30, 2002, we entered into a new
agreement with News Corp under which (i) News Corp
exchanged its 2,000,000 shares of Class B common stock for
206,454 shares of Class A common stock and (ii) we
paid News Corp $1.0 million in cash and committed to spend
an additional $17.0 million in advertising with News Corp
and its affiliates through the period ended December 31,
2006. All of our other obligations to News Corp under the
original agreements were terminated.

AOL
Exchange

In November 1999, we entered into a five-year
carriage agreement which gave us the exclusive right to provide
online games and interactive entertainment content on the
“Games” channels/areas of certain AOL online services
and gain access to and sell our products to AOL subscribers and
users. As part of this agreement, we sold to AOL 4,000,000
shares of Class B common stock for $20.0 million and a
warrant to purchase an additional 2,000,000 shares of
Class B common stock for $1.3 million. These shares
were issued upon the authorization of the Class B common
stock in March 2000. If a qualified public offering did not
occur within one year following the initial sale of the shares
to AOL, then at any time within four years thereafter, AOL had
the right to exchange all shares of Class B common stock
then owned for shares of Class A common stock. The exchange
ratio was set at the ratio of the consideration paid for each
share of Class B common stock and the average closing price
of Class A common stock during the fifteen day period
ending two days prior to execution of the carriage fee agreement
with us. In the event of an exchange, the AOL warrant would be
cancelled and exchanged for Class A common stock based on
the price paid by AOL for the warrant divided by the average
closing price of Class A common stock as described above.

In February 2003, AOL exchanged its
4 million shares of Class B common stock for 446,323
shares of Class A common stock. As a result, the warrant
issued to AOL to purchase an additional 2,000,000 shares of
Class B common stock was automatically exchanged for 31,027
shares of Class A common stock. In total, AOL received
477,350 shares of Class A common stock in this exchange.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting
Standards

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 143,

“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations”

.
SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting
for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs.
This statement applies to legal obligations associated with the
retirement of long-lived assets that result from the
acquisition, construction, development or normal use of the
asset. SFAS No. 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS
No. 143 to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial position or results of operations.



In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 46,

“Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities”

(“FIN 46”). This
interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,

“Consolidated Financial Statements,

” addresses
consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest
entities (“VIEs”) that either: (i) do not have
sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to
finance its activities without additional subordinated financial
support, or (ii) the equity investors lack an essential
characteristic of a controlling financial interest. This
interpretation applies immediately to VIEs created after
January 31, 2003. It applies in the first fiscal year or
interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to VIEs in
which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired
before February 1, 2003. FIN 46 requires disclosure of VIEs
in financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, if
it is reasonably possible that as of the transition date:
(i) the company will be the primary beneficiary of an
existing VIE that will require consolidation or, (ii) the
company will hold a significant variable interest in, or have
significant involvement with, an existing VIE. We do not believe
that we will have any entities that will require disclosure or
new consolidation as a result of adopting the provisions of
FIN 46.

In January 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) reached consensus on Issue No. 00-21,

“Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables”

. EITF 00-21 provides guidance on how
to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple
deliverables requires that such deliverables be accounted for
separately. EITF 00-21 allows for prospective adoption for
arrangements entered into after June 15, 2003 or adoption
via a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principal. We
are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of
EITF 00-21 will have on our consolidated results of
operations and financial position.



________________________________________________________________________________

RISK FACTORS

Electronic Arts’ business is subject to many
risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial
performance. These risks and uncertainties are discussed below.
There may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently
known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If
any of the events or circumstances described below occurs, our
business and financial performance could be harmed and the
market value of our securities could decline.

If we do not develop products for
widely-accepted new video game platforms, our business will
suffer.

We derive most of our revenue from the sale of
products for play on proprietary video game platforms of third
parties, such as Sony’s PlayStation 2. Therefore, the
success of our products is driven in large part by the success
of new video game hardware systems and our ability to accurately
predict which platforms will be most successful in the
marketplace. We must make product development decisions and
commit significant resources well in advance of the anticipated
introduction of a new platform. A new platform for which we are
developing products may be delayed, may not succeed or may have
a shorter life cycle than anticipated. If the platforms for
which we are developing products are not released when
anticipated or do not attain wide market acceptance, our revenue
growth will suffer.

If we do not accurately predict the importance
to consumers of online game play for different console products,
our sales may be limited in the future.

Sony and Microsoft have introduced online game
play for their respective PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles.
We anticipate that Nintendo will do so for its GameCube console.
We have agreed to support online game features for our Sony
PlayStation 2 products but do not currently offer similar
capability for our Xbox products. We currently cannot predict
the importance to consumers of these features. If consumers
consider online play capability to be a significant component of
games for the Xbox, our sales of products for the Xbox would
decline.

Our business is both seasonal and cyclical. If
we fail to deliver our products at the right times, our sales
will suffer.

Our business is highly seasonal, with the highest
levels of consumer demand, and a significant percentage of our
revenue, occurring in the December quarter. The timing of
hardware platform introduction is often tied to the year-end
holiday season and is not within our control. If we miss this
key selling period, due to product delays or delayed
introduction of a new platform for which we have developed
products, our sales will suffer disproportionately. Our industry
is also cyclical. Video game platforms have historically had a
life cycle of four to six years. As one group of platforms is
reaching the end of its cycle and new platforms are emerging,
consumers often defer game software purchases until the new
platforms are available, causing sales to decline. This decline
may not be offset by increased sales of products for the new
platform. For example, the market for products for Sony’s
older PlayStation game console has dropped faster than expected
since the launch of the PlayStation 2 platform.

Our business is intensely competitive and
increasingly “hit” driven. If we do not continue to
deliver “hit” products, our success will be
limited.

Competition in our industry is intense, and new
products are regularly introduced. During calendar year 2002,
approximately 22 percent of the sales of videogames in
North America consisted of only 20 “hit” products out
of thousands published. These “hit” titles are
increasingly expensive to produce. If our competitors develop
more successful products, or if we do not continue to develop
consistently high-quality products, our revenue will decline.



If we are unable to maintain or acquire
licenses to intellectual property, we will publish fewer hit
titles and our revenue will decline.

Many of our products are based on or incorporate
intellectual property owned by others. For example, our

EA
SPORTS

products include intellectual property licenses from
the major sports leagues and players associations. Similarly,
many of our hit

EA Games

titles such as

James Bond,
Harry Potter

and

Lord of the Rings,

are based on key
film and literary licenses. Competition for these licenses is
intense. If we are unable to maintain these licenses and obtain
additional licenses with significant commercial value, we will
be unable to increase our revenue in the future.

If patent claims continue to be asserted
against us, we may be unable to sustain our current business
models or profits.

Many patents have been issued that may apply to
widely used game technologies. Additionally, infringement claims
under many recently issued patents are now being asserted
against Internet implementations of existing games. Several such
claims have been asserted against us. Such claims can harm our
business. We incur substantial expenses in evaluating and
defending against such claims, regardless of the merits of the
claims. In the event that there is a determination that we have
infringed a third-party patent, we could incur significant
monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the
future.

Other intellectual property claims may
increase our product costs or require us to cease selling
affected products.

Many of our products include extremely realistic
graphical images, and we expect that as technology continues to
advance, images will become even more realistic. Some of the
images and other content are based on real-world examples that
may inadvertently infringe upon the intellectual property rights
of others. Although we believe that we make reasonable efforts
to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual
property rights of others, it is possible that third parties
still may claim infringement. From time to time, we receive
communications from third parties regarding such claims.
Existing or future infringement claims against us, whether valid
or not, may be time consuming and expensive to defend. Such
claims or litigations could require us to stop selling the
affected products, redesign those products to avoid
infringement, or obtain a license, all of which would be costly
and harm our business.

Our business, our products and our
distribution are subject to increasing regulation in key
territories of content, consumer privacy and online delivery. If
we do not successfully respond to these regulations, our
business may suffer.

Legislation is continually being introduced that
may affect both the content of our products and their
distribution. For example, privacy laws in the United States and
Europe impose various restrictions on our web sites. Those rules
vary by territory although the Internet recognizes no
geographical boundaries. Other countries, such as Germany, have
adopted laws regulating content both in packaged goods and those
transmitted over the Internet that are stricter than current
United States laws. In the United States, the federal and
several state governments are considering content restrictions
on products such as ours, as well as restrictions on
distribution of such products. Any one or more of these factors
could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to
offer to our customers and by requiring additional
differentiation between products for different territories to
address varying regulations. This additional product
differentiation would be costly.

If we do not consistently meet our product
development schedules, we will experience fluctuations in our
operating results.

Product development schedules, particularly for
new hardware platforms, high-end multimedia PCs and the
Internet, are difficult to predict because they involve creative
processes, use of new development tools for new platforms and
the learning process, research and experimentation associated
with



development for new technologies. We have in the
past experienced development delays for several of our products.
Failure to meet anticipated production or “go live”
schedules may cause a shortfall in our revenue and profitability
and cause our operating results to be materially different from
expectations. Delays that prevent release of our products during
peak selling seasons may reduce lifetime sales of those products.

Technology changes rapidly in our business, and
if we fail to anticipate new technologies, the quality,
timeliness and competitiveness of our products will suffer.

Rapid technology changes in our industry require
us to anticipate, sometimes years in advance, which technologies
our products must take advantage of in order to make them
competitive in the market at the time they are released.
Therefore, we usually start our product development with a range
of technical development goals that we hope to be able to
achieve. We may not be able to achieve these goals, or our
competition may be able to achieve them more quickly than we
can. In either case, our products may be technologically
inferior to competitive products, or less appealing to
consumers, or both. If we cannot achieve our technology goals
within the original development schedule of our products, then
we may delay products until these technology goals can be
achieved, which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our
development expenses. Alternatively, we may increase the
resources employed in research and development in an attempt to
accelerate our development of new technologies, either to
preserve our product launch schedule or to keep up with our
competition, which would increase our development expenses.

If we do not continue to attract and retain
key personnel, we will be unable to effectively conduct our
business.

The market for technical, creative, marketing and
other personnel essential to the development of our products and
management of our businesses is extremely competitive. In the
last fiscal year, notwithstanding the downturn of the economy
generally, competitive recruiting efforts aimed at our employees
and executives continued. For example, in fiscal 2003, a team of
employees that developed one of our hit

Medal of Honor

products left the company to develop products for a
competitor. Our leading position within the interactive
entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of
executives and key creative talent. In addition, the cost of
real estate in the San Francisco Bay area – the location of
our headquarters and one of our largest studios – remains
high, and has made recruiting from other areas and relocating
employees to our headquarters more difficult. If we cannot
successfully recruit and retain the employees we need, our
ability to develop and manage our businesses will be impaired.

Our platform licensors are our chief
competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of and/or
access to our video game products. If they do not approve our
products, we will be unable to ship to our customers.

Our agreements with hardware licensors (such as
Sony for the PlayStation 2, Microsoft for the Xbox and
Nintendo for the GameCube), who are also our chief competitors,
typically give significant control to the licensor over the
approval and manufacturing of our products, which could, in
certain circumstances, leave us unable to get our products
approved, manufactured and shipped to customers. In most events,
control of the approval and manufacturing process by the
platform licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times
and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently.
While we believe that our relationships with our hardware
licensors are currently good, the potential for delay or refusal
to approve or manufacture our products exists. Such occurrences
would harm our business and our financial performance.

In addition, as online capabilities for videogame
platforms emerge, our platform licensors will control our
ability to provide online game capabilities for our console
platform products. Currently, both Microsoft and Sony provide
online capabilities for Xbox and PlayStation 2 products,
respectively. In each case, compatibility code and the consent
of the licensor are required for us to include online
capabilities in our products. In addition, the business model
for Microsoft’s and Sony’s online businesses for their
videogame



products may compete with our online business. As
these capabilities become more significant, the failure or
refusal of our licensors to approve our products, or the
successful deployment by these licensors of services competitive
to ours may harm our business.

Our international revenues are subject to
currency fluctuations.

For the year ended March 31, 2003
international net revenue comprised 42 percent of total
consolidated net revenue. For the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2002, international net revenue comprised
37 percent of total consolidated net revenue. We expect
foreign sales to continue to account for a significant and
growing portion of our revenue. Such sales are subject to
unexpected regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers.
Additionally, foreign sales are primarily made in local
currencies, which may fluctuate against the dollar. While we
hedge against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot control
translation issues.

Our reported financial results could be
affected if significant changes in current accounting principles
are adopted.

Recent actions and public comments from the SEC
have focused on the integrity of financial reporting generally.
Similarly, Congress has considered a variety of bills that could
affect certain accounting principles. The FASB and other
regulatory accounting agencies have recently introduced several
new or proposed accounting standards, such as accounting for
stock options, some of which represent a significant change from
current practices. Changes in our accounting for stock options
could materially increase our reported expenses.

Our stock price has been volatile and may
continue to fluctuate significantly.

As a result of the factors discussed in this
report and other factors that may arise in the future, the
market price of our common stock historically has been, and we
expect will continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations.
These fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us, to
changes in analysts’ earnings estimates, or to factors
affecting the computer, software, Internet, entertainment, media
or electronics businesses.



Item 7A:     Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risk

We are exposed to various market risks, including
the changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest
rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in
market rates and prices. Foreign exchange contracts used to
hedge foreign currency exposures and short-term investments are
subject to market risk. We do not consider our cash and cash
equivalents to be subject to interest rate risk due to their
short maturities. We do not enter into derivatives or other
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We utilize foreign exchange contracts to hedge
foreign currency exposures of underlying assets and liabilities,
primarily certain intercompany receivables that are denominated
in foreign currencies, thereby, limiting our risk. Our foreign
exchange contracts are accounted for as derivatives whereby the
gains and losses on these contracts are reflected in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gains and losses on open
contracts at the end of each accounting period resulting from
changes in the forward rate are recognized in earnings and are
designed to offset gains and losses on the underlying foreign
currency denominated assets and liabilities. At March 31,
2003, we had foreign exchange contracts, all with maturities of
less than one month to purchase and sell approximately
$155.5 million in foreign currencies, primarily British
Pounds, Swedish Krona, European Currency Units
(“Euro”) and other currencies.

Fair value represents the difference in value of
the contracts at the spot rate and the forward rate. The
counterparties to these contracts are substantial and
creditworthy multinational commercial banks. The risks of
counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are
not considered to be material. Notwithstanding our efforts to
manage foreign exchange risks, there can be no assurances that
our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the
risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.

The following table below provides information
about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts at
March 31, 2003. The information is provided in U.S. dollar
equivalents and presents the notional amount (forward amount),
the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates
and fair value.



While the contract amounts provide one
measurement of the volume of these transactions, they do not
represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. The amounts
(arising from the possible inabilities of counterparties to meet
the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the
amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations
exceed our obligations as these contracts can be settled on a
net basis at our option. We control credit risk through credit
approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in
interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. We
do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment
portfolio. We manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an
investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments of
high credit quality and relatively short average maturities. We
also manage our interest rate risk by maintaining sufficient
cash and cash equivalent balances such that we are typically
able to hold our investments to maturity. At March 31, 2003, our
cash equivalents and short-term investments included debt
securities of $1,270.2 million. Notwithstanding our efforts
to manage interest rate risks, there can be no assurances that
we will be adequately protected against the risks associated
with interest rate fluctuations.

The table below presents the amounts and related
weighted average interest rates of our investment portfolio at
March 31, 2003:

(1)

See definition in Note 1 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Maturity dates for short-term investments range
    from 4 months to 36 months with call dates ranging
    from 0 months to 12 months.



Item 8:     Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data

The Report of Independent Auditors, Consolidated
Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements follow below on pages 61 through 103.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Electronic Arts Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Electronic Arts Inc. and subsidiaries (the
Company) as of March 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2003. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Electronic Arts Inc. and
subsidiaries as of March 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended March 31, 2003, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting for goodwill, effective April 1, 2002.

March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

A summary of the significant accounting policies
applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated
financial statements of Electronic Arts Inc. and its
wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries (the
“Company”) follows:

(a)     Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

(b)     Fiscal
Year

The Company’s fiscal year is reported on a
52/53-week period that ends on the Saturday nearest to
March 31 in each year. The results of operations for fiscal
2003 and 2002 contain 52 weeks, respectively. The results
of operations for fiscal 2001 contain 53 weeks. For
simplicity of presentation, all fiscal periods are treated as
ending on a calendar month end.

(c)     Revenue
Recognition

The Company’s revenue recognition policies
are in compliance with American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition”

, as amended by
SOP 98-9,

“Modification of SOP 97-2, Software
Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
Transactions”

, which provide guidance on generally
accepted accounting principles for recognizing revenue on
software transactions and Staff Accounting Bulletin
(“SAB”) No. 101,

“Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements”

, which outlines the basic
criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides
guidance for presentation of revenue and for disclosure related
to revenue recognition policies in financial statements filed
with the SEC.

Product Sales: The Company recognizes revenue
upon shipment of its packaged goods products based on “FOB
Shipping” terms. Under FOB Shipping terms, title and risk
of loss are transferred when the products are delivered to the
customer. In order to recognize revenue, the Company must not
have any continuing obligations and it must also be probable
that the Company will collect the accounts receivable. Subject
to certain limitations, the Company permits customers to obtain
exchanges within certain specified periods and provides price
protection on certain unsold merchandise. Revenue is recognized
net of an allowance for returns and price protection.

Shipping and Handling: In accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue
No. 00-10,

“Accounting for Shipping and Handling
Fees and Costs”

, the Company recognizes as revenue
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling.
Additionally, shipping and handling costs incurred by the
Company are included in cost of goods sold.

Online Subscription Revenue: Online subscription
revenue is derived principally from subscription revenue
collected from customers for online play, who are only
contractually obligated to pay on a month-to-month basis.
Prepaid monthly subscription revenue, including revenue
collected from credit card sales as well as sales of

Gametime

subscription cards, are deferred and subsequently recognized
ratably over the period for which the hosting services are
provided.

Advertising Revenue and Revenue Sharing:
Advertising revenue is derived principally from the sale of
banner and in-game advertisements. Banner and in-game
advertising is typically generated from contracts in which
either the Company or AOL provides a minimum number of
impressions over the term of the agreed upon commitment. Revenue
is recognized as the impressions are delivered, provided that no
significant obligations remain and collection of the related
receivable is probable. Advertising revenue



generated on the AOL Games Channel is recorded
net of the applicable revenue share owed to AOL under the AOL
carriage fee agreement.

The Company’s carriage agreement with AOL
provides that AOL will pay the Company 50 percent of all
revenues collected by AOL from the sale of advertisements on the
Company’s online games sites, until revenue reaches $16.0
million in a year (measured from October 1 through the
following September 30). Thereafter, the agreement provides
that AOL will pay the Company 70 percent of all revenues
collected by AOL from the sale of advertisements on the
Company’s online games sites.

The Company records net revenue as earned (i.e.
when the advertisements are displayed on the Company’s game
sites) in accordance with EITF No. 99-19,

“Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an
Agent”

. AOL maintains the primary relationship with the
customer, manages advertising placement and billing processes
and maintains responsibility for ad fulfillment for joint
advertising properties. In addition, the Company earns a fixed
amount per advertising transaction. Accordingly, the Company
records these advertising revenues on a net basis.

The Company recorded net AOL advertising revenue
in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 of $25.1 million,
$27.8 million and $5.4 million, respectively.

Because AOL is responsible under the carriage fee
agreement for collecting all revenue from third-party
advertisers, the Company did not owe AOL any advertising revenue
for any of the periods mentioned above. Total gross advertising
revenue, including AOL’s share of the revenue, in fiscal
2003, 2002 and 2001 was $40.5 million, $46.3 million
and $10.7 million, respectively.

Software Licenses: For those agreements which
provide the customers the right to multiple copies in exchange
for guaranteed minimum royalty amounts, revenue is recognized at
delivery of the product master or the first copy. Per copy
royalties on sales that exceed the guarantee are recognized as
earned.

(d)     Sales Returns
and Other Reserves

The Company estimates potential future product
returns, price protection and stock-balancing programs related
to current period product revenue. The Company analyzes
historical returns, current sell-through of distributor and
retailer inventory of the Company’s products, current
trends in the video game market and the overall economy, changes
in customer demand and acceptance of the Company’s products
and other related factors when evaluating the adequacy of the
sales returns and price protection allowances. In addition, the
Company monitors and manages the volume of sales to retailers
and distributors and monitors their inventories as substantial
overstocking in the distribution channel can result in high
returns or the requirement for substantial price protection in
subsequent periods.

Similarly, significant judgment is required to
estimate the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts in
any accounting period. The Company analyzes customer
concentrations, customer credit-worthiness and current economic
trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for
doubtful accounts.

(e)     Vendor
Consideration

In January 2003, the EITF reached a final
consensus on EITF No. 02-16,

“Accounting by a
Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration
Received from a Vendor”

, which addresses how a reseller
of a vendor’s products should account for cash
consideration received from a vendor. The EITF issued guidance
on the following two issues: (1) cash consideration
received from a vendor should be recognized as a reduction of
cost of sales in the reseller’s income statement, unless
the consideration is a reimbursement for selling costs or
payment for assets or services delivered to the vendor, and
(2) performance-driven vendor rebates or refunds (e.g.,
minimum purchase or sales volumes) should be recognized as a
reduction of cost of sales only if the payment is considered
probable, and the method of allocating such payments in the
financial statements should be systematic and rational based on
the reseller’s progress in achieving the underlying
performance targets. During fiscal 2003, the Company adopted the
recognition and measurement provisions of EITF No. 02-16.
The adoption did not have a material effect on the
Company’s results of operations or financial position.



(f)     Cash and
Investments

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid
investments with insignificant rate risk and with maturities of
three months or less at the date of purchase. Short-term
investments include securities with maturities greater than
three months and less than one year, except for certain
investments with stated maturities greater than one year that
are callable within one year. Long-term investments consist of
securities with maturities greater than one year.

The Company accounts for investments under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 115,

“Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities”

. The Company’s policy
is to protect the value of its investment portfolio and to
minimize principal risk by earning returns based on current
interest rates. Management determines the appropriate
classification of its debt and equity securities at the time of
purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance
sheet date. Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity
when the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the
securities to maturity. Securities classified as
held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, which is
adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts
to maturity. Such amortization is included in interest income.
Debt securities, not classified as held-to-maturity, are
classified as available-for-sale and are stated at fair value.
Unrealized gains and losses are included as a separate component
of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
stockholders’ equity, net of any tax related effect.
Realized gains and losses are calculated based on the specific
identification method.

(g)     Prepaid
Royalties

Prepaid royalties consist primarily of
prepayments for manufacturing royalties, advances paid to
co-publishing and/or distribution affiliates and license fees
paid to celebrities, professional sports organizations and other
organizations for use of their trade name and content. Also
included in prepaid royalties are prepayments made to
independent software developers under development arrangements
that have alternative future uses. Prepaid royalties are
expensed at the contractual or effective royalty rate as cost of
goods sold based on actual net product sales. Management
evaluates the future realization of prepaid royalties quarterly
and charges to costs of goods sold any post-launch amounts
(expenses incurred after the product has been released for
general sales) that management deems unlikely to be realized
through product sales. Any impairments on product pre-launch
advances are charged to research and development expense. Once
the charge has been taken, that amount will not be expensed in
future quarters when the product has shipped. Royalty advances
are classified as current and non-current assets based upon
estimated net product sales for the following year. The current
portion of prepaid royalties, included in other current assets,
was $39.9 million and $65.5 million at March 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. The long-term portion of prepaid
royalties, included in other assets, was $7.4 million and
$1.2 million at March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

(h)     Software
Development Costs

Research and development costs, which consist
primarily of software development costs, are expensed as
incurred. SFAS No. 86,

“Accounting for the Cost of
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
Marketed”

, provides for the capitalization of certain
software development costs incurred after technological
feasibility of the software is established or for development
costs that have alternative future uses. Under the
Company’s current practice of developing new products, the
technological feasibility of the underlying software is not
established until substantially all product development is
complete, which generally includes the development of a working
model. The software development costs that have been capitalized
to date have been insignificant.



(i)     Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out method) or market. Inventories at
March 31, 2003 and 2002 consisted of (in thousands):

(j)     Advertising
Costs

The Company generally expenses advertising costs
as incurred, except for production costs associated with media
campaigns which are deferred and charged to expense at the first
run of the ad. Cooperative advertising with distributors and
retailers is accrued when revenue is recognized and such amounts
are included in sales and marketing expense to the extent that
qualifying claims are submitted. Cooperative advertising credits
are reimbursed when qualifying claims are submitted. The Company
has adopted the provisions of EITF No. 01-09,

“Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
Customer or a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products”

.
The adoption of EITF No. 01-09 did not have a material
impact in the Company’s consolidated financial position or
results of operations. For the fiscal years ended March 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, advertising expenses totaled approximately
$151.6 million, $105.7 million and $75.4 million,
respectively.

(k)     Property and
Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation is calculated using the accelerated and
straight-line methods over the following useful lives:

Under the provisions of SOP 98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed
or Obtained for Internal Use”,

the Company capitalizes
costs associated with customized internal-use software systems
that have reached the application stage and meet recoverability
tests. Such capitalized costs include external direct costs
utilized in developing or obtaining the applications and payroll
and payroll-related expenses for employees who are directly
associated with the applications. Capitalization of such costs
begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases
at the point in which the project is substantially complete and
ready for its intended purpose. Capitalized costs associated
with internal-use software amounted to $87.4 million and $121.0
million at March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and are
being depreciated on a straight-line basis over each
project’s estimated useful life that ranges from four to
seven years.

(l)     Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets

Effective April 1, 2002, the Company adopted
the provisions of SFAS No. 141,

“Business
Combinations”

, which requires business combinations
initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting and acquired intangible assets
meeting certain criteria to be recorded apart from goodwill. The
Company evaluated its goodwill and intangibles acquired prior to
June 30, 2001 using the criteria of SFAS No. 141,
which resulted in $41.5 million of other intangibles to be
recorded separately from goodwill and $4.0 million of acquired
workforce intangibles being subsumed into goodwill at April 1,
2002. In addition, effective April 1, 2002, the Company
adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142,



“Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets”

. SFAS No. 142
requires that purchased goodwill and certain indefinite-lived
intangibles no longer be amortized; rather, goodwill will be
subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by
applying a fair-value-based test. SFAS No. 142 also
requires, among other things, reassessment of the useful lives
of existing recognized intangibles and the testing for
impairment of existing goodwill and other indefinite-lived
intangibles. The Company evaluated the estimated useful lives of
existing recognized intangibles and determined that the
estimated useful lives of all such assets were appropriate.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company
has ceased to amortize goodwill (see goodwill information in
table below). In lieu of amortization, SFAS No. 142 requires a
two-step approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each
reporting unit. The first step, required to be completed by
September 30, 2002, tests for impairment by applying fair
value-based tests at the Company’s reporting unit level.
The second step (if necessary), required to be completed by
March 31, 2003, measures the amount of impairment by
applying fair value-based tests to individual assets and
liabilities within each reporting unit. The Company completed
the first step of transitional goodwill impairment testing
during the quarter ended June 30, 2002 and found no
indicators of impairment of its recorded goodwill. As a result,
the Company has recognized no transitional impairment loss in
fiscal 2003 in connection with the adoption of SFAS
No. 142. The Company completed its annual impairment test
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 with a measurement date of
January 1, 2003 and found no indicators of impairment of
its recorded goodwill. There can be no assurance that future
impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings and
there is a potential for a write down of goodwill in connection
with the annual impairment test.

The following table presents comparative
information showing the effects that non-amortization of
goodwill would have had on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations for fiscal 2002 and 2001 (in thousands, except per
share amounts):

Class A Common Stock – Basic

Class A common stock – Diluted



During fiscal 2003, the Company recorded an
additional $16.1 million of goodwill as a result of an
acquisition of a software development company. The Company
operated in two business segments, EA Core and EA.com (see
Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
Goodwill information for each business segment is as follows (in
thousands):

Intangible assets net of accumulated amortization
at March 31, 2003 and 2002, of $21.3 million and
$41.5 million, respectively, include costs such as costs of
obtaining product technology and noncompete covenants.
Amortization expense for fiscal years ended March 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001 was $7.5 million, $12.3 million and
$10.1 million, respectively. Other intangible assets are
amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of
their estimated useful lives or the agreement terms, typically
from two to twelve years.

As part of the restructuring efforts, the Company
performed impairment tests under SFAS No. 144 to evaluate
the recoverability of its long-lived assets and remaining
finite-lived identifiable intangibles utilized in the EA.com
business. This test was performed in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2003 in conjunction with the overall valuation of the
EA.com legal entity and its Class B common stock. The Company
assessed the recoverability of its long-lived assets related to
the EA.com business by determining whether the carrying amount
of the assets was recoverable through estimated future
undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the
group of assets attributable to the EA.com business. The Company
measured the impairment loss as the amount that the carrying
value of these long-lived assets exceeded the discounted future
cash flows for individual asset groups. Due to significant
interdependencies of the operating activities among the asset
base, there are not specific identifiable cash flows and thus,
the long-lived assets were combined into one asset grouping for
the purposes of the test. The Company utilized a present value
technique in determining the fair value of the asset grouping
over the disposition period, which was determined to be four
years. As a result, the Company recorded $12.4 million of
finite-lived intangibles impairment charges relating to
EA.com’s Kesmai and Pogo studios. As of March 31,
2003, there were no finite-lived intangible balances remaining
related to Kesmai and Pogo studios. There are no assurances that
the impairment factors evaluated by management will not change
in subsequent periods and accordingly, this could result in
additional impairment charges in future periods. See
Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Other intangibles consisted of the following (in
thousands):

As of March 31, 2003, future intangible
asset amortization expense is estimated as follows (in
thousands):

(m)     Long-Lived
Assets

The Company evaluates long-lived assets and
certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is
measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to
future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by
the asset. This may include assumptions about future prospects
for the business that the asset relates to and typically
involves computations of the estimated future cash flows to be
generated by these businesses. Based on these judgments and
assumptions, the Company determines whether it needs to take an
impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on the
balance sheet to reflect its actual fair value. Judgments and
assumptions about future values and remaining useful lives are
complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety
of factors, including but not limited to, significant negative
industry or economic trends, significant changes in the manner
of the Company’s use of the acquired assets or the strategy
of the Company’s overall business and significant
under-performance relative to expected historical or projected
future operating results. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its
fair value.

In April 2002, the Company adopted SFAS
No. 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets”

, which addresses financial
accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of
long-lived assets. During fiscal 2003, the Company recorded a
$66.3 million asset impairment charge in accordance with
SFAS No. 144. See Note 1(l) of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

(n)     Income
Taxes

The Company uses the asset and liability method
of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability
method, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and
the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are based on temporary differences
resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and
accounting purposes. The Company records a valuation allowance
to reduce tax assets to an amount whose realization is more
likely than not. The valuation allowance is



based on the Company’s estimates of taxable
income by jurisdiction in which the Company operates and the
period over which the Company’s deferred tax assets will be
recoverable.

(o)     Foreign
Currency Translation

For each of the Company’s foreign
subsidiaries the functional currency is its local currency.
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into
U.S. dollars using current exchange rates, and revenue and
expenses are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange
rates. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments
are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) in stockholders’ equity.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are
a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.
Included in interest and other income in the consolidated
statements of operations are foreign currency transaction losses
of $3.3 million, $0.4 million and $0.9 million for the
fiscal years ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

On April 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS
No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities”

. SFAS No. 133 establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments
and hedging activities and requires the Company to recognize
these as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and
measure them at fair value. As described in Note 3 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, gains and losses
resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending
on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and
qualifies for hedge accounting. The adoption of this accounting
standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

(p)     Net Earnings
(Loss) Per Share

The following summarizes the computations of
Basic Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) and Diluted EPS.
Basic EPS is computed as net earnings divided by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could
occur from common shares issuable through stock-based
compensation plans including stock options, restricted stock
awards, warrants and other convertible securities using the
treasury stock method.

Net income (loss) per share is computed
individually for Class A common stock and Class B
common stock. Please see the discussion regarding segment
reporting in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.



The Diluted EPS calculation for Class A
common stock, presented above, includes the potential dilution
from the conversion of Class B common stock to Class A
common stock in the event that the initial public offering for
Class B common stock does not occur. Net income used for
the calculation of Diluted EPS for Class A common stock is
$317.1 million and $101.5 million for the fiscal years
ended March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This net
income includes the remaining interest in EA.com
(100 percent of EA.com losses) which is directly
attributable to outstanding Class B shares owned by third
parties, which would be included in the Class A common
stock EPS calculation in the event that an initial public
offering for Class B common stock does not occur.

Due to the net loss attributable for the twelve
months ended March 31, 2001 on a diluted basis to
Class A Stockholders, stock options have been excluded from
the Diluted EPS calculation as their inclusion would have been
antidilutive. Had net income been reported for this period, an
additional 5,971,000 shares would have been added to diluted
potential common shares for Class A common stock for the
twelve months ended March 31, 2001.

Excluded from the above computation of
weighted-average shares for Class A Diluted EPS for the
fiscal years ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were
options to purchase 3,152,000, 1,515,000 and 2,705,000



shares of common stock, respectively, as the
options’ exercise price was greater than the average market
price of the common shares. For fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, the
weighted-average exercise price of these respective options was
$62.32, $57.65 and $48.63 per share.

Due to the net loss attributable for the twelve
months ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 on a diluted
basis to Class B Stockholders, stock options have been
excluded from the Diluted EPS calculation as their inclusion
would have been antidilutive. Had net income been reported for
these periods, an additional 1,405,000, 842,000 and 472,000
shares would have been added to diluted potential common shares
for Class B common stock for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

(q)     Employee
Benefits

The Company has a 401(k) Plan covering
substantially all of its U.S. employees. The 401(k) Plan permits
the Company to make discretionary contributions to
employees’ accounts based on the Company’s financial
performance. The Company contributed $5.1 million,
$4.8 million and $1.1 million to the Plan in fiscal
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

(r)     Stock-based
Compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based awards to
employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with
APB No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees”

and Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 44 (“FIN 44”),

“Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation (an interpretation of APB Opinion
No. 25)

”. The Company has adopted the
disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”

.
Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for
options granted under the Company’s employee-based stock
option plans.

In fiscal 2003, the Company adopted the
disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148,

“Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and
Disclosure — an Amendment of FASB Statement
No. 123”,

which provides alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method
of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. The
Statement also amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS
No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and
interim financial statements about the method of accounting for
stock-based compensation and the effect of the methods used on
reported results.

Had compensation cost for the Company’s
stock option plans and employee stock purchase plans been
determined based on the fair value at the grant dates in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the
Company’s reported net income (loss) and net earnings
(loss) per share would have been the amounts indicated
below. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The
following weighted-average assumptions are used for grants made
in 2003, 2002 and 2001 under the stock plans: risk-free interest
rates of 1.23 percent to 3.86 percent in 2003;
2.22 percent to 4.51 percent in 2002; and
4.59 percent to 6.55 percent in 2001; expected
volatility of 62 percent in fiscal 2003, 72 percent in
fiscal 2002 and 74 percent in fiscal 2001; expected lives
of 2.27 years in fiscal 2003, 2.25 years in fiscal
2002 and 2.32 years in fiscal 2001 under the Option Plans
and six months for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. No
dividends are assumed in the expected term. The



Company’s calculations are based on a
multiple option valuation approach and forfeitures are
recognized when they occur.



(s)     Guarantees

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 45,

“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others”

(“FIN 45”).
FIN 45 requires a guarantor to (i) include disclosure
of certain obligations, and (ii) if applicable, at the
inception of the guarantee, recognize a liability for the fair
value of other certain obligations undertaken in issuing a
guarantee. The disclosure provisions of the Interpretation are
effective for financial statements of interim or annual reports
that end after December 15, 2002 and the Company has
adopted those requirements in its Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements and in the Liquidity and Capital Resources
section of the MD&A, included in Item 7 hereof.
However, the provisions for initial recognition and measurement
are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are
issued or modified after December 31, 2002, irrespective of
the guarantor’s year-end. The adoption of FIN 45 did
not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

(t)     Use of
Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, contingent assets and liabilities, and revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include
provisions for doubtful accounts, sales returns and allowances,
long-lived assets, deferred income taxes, warranty provisions,
and estimates regarding the recoverability of prepaid royalty
advances and inventories. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

(u)     Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified
to conform to fiscal 2003 presentation.

(2) TRACKING STOCK

On March 22, 2000, the stockholders of
Electronic Arts authorized the issuance of a new series of
common stock, designated as Class B common stock
(“Tracking Stock”). The Tracking Stock was intended to
reflect the performance of the EA.com business segment. As a
result of the approval of the Tracking Stock Proposal,
Electronic Arts’ existing common stock has been
re-classified as Class A common stock (“Class A
Stock”) and was intended to reflect the performance of the
EA Core business segment. With the authorization of the
Class B common stock, the Company transferred a portion of
its consolidated assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash
flows to EA.com Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Electronic
Arts.



In March 2003, the Company consolidated the
operations of EA.com into the Company’s core operations in
order to increase efficiency, simplify the Company’s
reporting structure and more directly integrate the
Company’s online activities into its core console and PC
business. As a result, the Company will eliminate dual class
reporting starting in fiscal 2004. The majority of outstanding
Class B options and warrants not directly held by the
Company have been acquired or converted to Class A shares
and warrants.

(3) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

(a) Cash and Investments

In fiscal 2002, short-term held-to-maturity
investments include commercial notes with original maturities of
less than one year secured by U.S. Treasury Notes which
enabled the Company to take advantage of certain tax incentives
from its Puerto Rico operation. These investments were treated
as held-to-maturity for financial reporting purposes and matured
in March 2003.

The fair value of held-to-maturity securities at
March 31, 2002 was $8.7 million, which included gross
unrealized gains of $0.3 million.

(b) Marketable Securities

Marketable securities are comprised of equity
securities. The Company has accounted for investments in equity
securities as “available-for-sale” and has stated
applicable investments at fair value, with net unrealized
appreciation (depreciation) reported as a separate
component of accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) in stockholders’ equity. Marketable securities
had an aggregate cost of $1.1 million and $7.0 million
at March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. At March 31,
2003, marketable securities included gross unrealized losses of
$28,000. At March 31, 2002, marketable securities included
gross unrealized losses of $85,000. The sale of marketable
securities produced a gain of $2.1 million in fiscal 2003.
There were no sales of marketable securities in fiscal 2002.

(c) Foreign Currency Forward Exchange
Contracts

The Company utilizes foreign exchange contracts
to hedge foreign currency exposures of underlying assets and
liabilities, primarily certain intercompany receivables that are
denominated in foreign currencies, thereby limiting its risk.
The Company does not use forward exchange contracts for
speculative or trading purposes. The Company’s accounting
policies for these instruments are based on the Company’s
designation of such instruments as hedging transactions. The
criteria the Company uses for designating an instrument as a
hedge include the instrument’s effectiveness in risk
reduction and one-to-one matching of



forward exchange contracts to underlying
transactions. Gains and losses on currency forward contracts
that are designated and effective as hedges of existing
transactions are recognized in income in the same period as
losses and gains on the underlying transactions are recognized
and generally offset.

Net Loss Recognized in Other Income Relating to
Fair Value Hedging of the Balance Sheet (in thousands):

The Company transacts business in various foreign
currencies. At March 31, 2003, the Company had foreign
exchange contracts, all with maturities of less than three
months, to purchase and sell approximately $155.5 million
in foreign currencies, primarily in British Pounds, Swedish
Krona, European Currency Units (“Euros”) and other
currencies.

Fair value represents the difference in value of
the contracts at the contract rate and the forward rate. At
March 31, 2003, fair value of these contracts is not
significant. The counterparties to these contracts are
substantial and creditworthy multinational commercial banks. The
risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these
contracts are not considered to be material. Notwithstanding the
Company’s efforts to manage foreign exchange risk, there
can be no assurances that its hedging activities will adequately
protect against the risks associated with foreign currency
fluctuations.

(4) LEASE COMMITMENTS

The Company leases certain of its current
facilities and certain equipment under non-cancelable capital
and operating lease agreements. The Company is required to pay
property taxes, insurance and normal maintenance costs for
certain of its facilities and will be required to pay any
increases over the base year of these expenses on the remainder
of the Company’s facilities.

In February 1995, the Company entered into a
build-to-suit lease with Keybank National Association on its
headquarter’s facility in Redwood City, California, which
was extended in July 2001 and expires in July 2006. The Company
accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in
accordance with SFAS No. 13,

“Accounting for
Leases”

, as amended. Existing campus facilities
developed in phase one comprise a total of 350,000 square feet
and provide space for sales, marketing, administration and
research and development functions. The Company has an option to
purchase the property (land and facilities) for
$145.0 million or, at the end of the lease, to arrange for
(1) an additional extension of the lease or (2) sale
of the property to a third party with the Company retaining an
obligation to the owner for the difference between the sales
price and the guaranteed residual value of up to
$128.9 million if the sales price is less than this amount.
The lease also provides that a sale of the property to a third
party is subject to remarketing conditions including marketing
assistance, requisite repairs and maintenance, appropriate
notice and seller’s indemnities and warranties.

In December 2000, the Company entered into a
second build-to-suit lease with Keybank National Association for
a five-year term beginning December 2000 to expand its Redwood
City, California headquarters facilities and develop adjacent
property adding approximately 310,000 square feet to its campus.
Construction was completed in June 2002. The Company accounted
for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with
SFAS No. 13, as amended. The facilities provide space for
marketing, sales and research and development. The Company has
an option to purchase the property for $127.0 million or,
at the end of the lease, to arrange for (1) an extension of
the lease or (2) sale of the property to a third party with
the Company retaining an obligation to the owner for the
difference between



the sales price and the guaranteed residual value
of up to $118.8 million if the sales price is less than
this amount. The lease also provides that a sale of the property
to a third party is subject to remarketing conditions including
marketing assistance, requisite repairs and maintenance,
appropriate notice and seller’s indemnities and warranties.

Lease rates are based upon the Commercial Paper
Rate. The two lease agreements described above require the
Company to maintain certain financial covenants related to
consolidated net worth, fixed charge coverage ratio, total
consolidated debt to total consolidated capital and quick ratio,
all of which the Company was in compliance with as of
March 31, 2003.

Total future minimum lease commitments as of
March 31, 2003 are (in thousands):

Total rent expense for all operating leases was
$19.1 million, $25.2 million and $27.5 million,
for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

(5) AMERICA ONLINE, INC.
(“AOL”) AGREEMENT

In November 1999, Electronic Arts Inc., EA.com
and AOL entered into a five-year $81.0 million carriage fee
agreement which gave EA.com the exclusive right to provide
online games and interactive entertainment content on the
“Games” channels/areas of certain AOL online services
and gain access to and sell its products to AOL subscribers and
to users of AOL properties. This agreement provides for
carriage, advertising commitments, advertising revenue sharing
and other fees.

•

Carriage

In establishing the fair value of the carriage, the Company
    used a discounted cash flow model based on forecasted revenue
    and cost assumptions of its online games service on AOL
    properties. Based on this assessment, the Company determined
    that the fair value of the agreement was $81.0 million and
    negotiated with AOL on an arms-length basis to pay this amount
    over the life of the five-year agreement.

Of this amount, $36.0 million was paid upon
signing the agreement with the remainder due in four equal
annual installments of $11.25 million beginning with the
first anniversary of the initial payment. The Company made
carriage payments to AOL of $11.25 million in each of the
fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Carriage fee amounts have been capitalized as a
prepaid asset as payments were made to AOL. The total carriage
fee of $81.0 million is being expensed using the
straight-line method over the remaining life of the agreement
subsequent to EA.com’s site launch in October 2000. As the
carriage fee is expensed, the Company applies the portion that
has been paid against the prepaid asset and records the
remaining amount as a liability. Amortization expense is
classified as “marketing and sales” expense in the
Company’s consolidated statement of operations. The prepaid
asset and liability balances are classified as “other
assets” and “accrued and other liabilities” on
the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. As of
March 31, 2003, the Company has included advances of
$30.7 million in other long-term assets and
$6.25 million in accrued and other liabilities. As of
March 31, 2002, the Company has included advances of
$38.6 million in other long-term assets and
$7.5 million in accrued and other liabilities.



•

Advertising Commitment

In conjunction with the carriage fee agreement with AOL, the
    Company also made a commitment to spend $15.0 million in
    offline media advertisements prior to March 31, 2005
    consisting of:

•

$10.0 million on television, radio, print
    and outdoor advertising that promotes the availability of EA.com
    games on certain AOL online services; and

•

$5.0 million ($1.0 million per year
    over the five year agreement) on television, radio, print and
    outdoor advertising that promotes the availability of a specific
    category of EA.com games (so-called “parlor games”) on
    certain AOL online services.

The Company is free to purchase this advertising
from any television, radio, print or outdoor media property that
it chooses, not necessarily from any AOL-affiliated media
property. To date, the Company has not purchased any
advertisements from AOL, though it has purchased some qualifying
advertising from AOL affiliates. In accordance with SOP
No. 93-7,

“Reporting on Advertising
Costs”

, the Company expenses the advertising as it is
incurred. These costs are classified as “marketing and
sales” expense in the Company’s consolidated statement
of operations. As of March 31, 2003, the Company has spent
approximately $4.3 million against this commitment. See
Note 1(c) for additional discussion regarding AOL revenues.

•

Advertising Revenue and Revenue Sharing

Advertising revenue is derived principally from the sale of
    banner and in-game advertisements. Banner and in-game
    advertising is typically generated from contracts in which
    either the Company or AOL provides a minimum number of
    impressions over the term of the agreed upon commitment. Revenue
    is recognized as the impressions are delivered, provided that no
    significant obligations remain and collection of the related
    receivable is probable. Advertising revenue generated on the AOL
    Games Channel is recorded net of the applicable revenue share
    owed to AOL under the AOL carriage fee agreement. See
    Note 1(c) for additional discussion regarding advertising
    revenues.

•

Other Fee Arrangements

In accordance with the carriage fee agreement, the Company is
    also required to pay AOL a percentage of its subscription,
    e-commerce and anchor tenancy revenue that exceed certain
    amounts. To date, these amounts have been approximately
    $0.3 million, $0.5 million and $46,000 in fiscal 2003,
    2002 and 2001, respectively. These costs are expensed as
    incurred and are classified as “cost of goods sold” in
    the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. In
    accordance with EITF No. 99-19, the Company does not net
    these costs against revenue because it maintains responsibility
    for providing e-commerce products and subscription services
    directly to the consumer and retains the primary inventory risk
    for its products and games service.

Sale of Class B Common Stock and Warrant
to AOL

In connection with the agreement with AOL, the
Company sold 4,000,000 shares of Class B common stock to
AOL (the “AOL Shares”) representing 10 percent of
the initial equity value attributable to EA.com valued at
$18.7 million.

In addition to the AOL Shares, the Company sold
AOL a warrant (the “AOL Warrant”) to purchase an
additional 2,000,000 shares of Class B common stock
representing an additional 5 percent of the initial equity
value attributable to EA.com for $1.3 million. The
aggregate exercise price of the AOL Warrant was
$40.0 million. The AOL Warrant was to expire at the latest
at the fifth anniversary of its date of issuance, and under
certain conditions may expire at an earlier date.

AOL Exchange Rights

AOL had the option to exchange their Class B
common shares for a number of Class A common shares based
on the ratio of the per share price paid by AOL for the
Class B stock relative to $41.89. In fiscal 2003, AOL
elected to exchange all of its 4,000,000 shares of Class B
common stock for 446,323 shares of



Class A common stock. In addition, the AOL
Warrant has automatically been exchanged for further issuance of
31,027 shares of Class A common stock.

(6) CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT
RISK

The Company extends credit to various companies
in the retail and mass merchandising industry. Collection of
trade receivables may be affected by changes in economic or
other industry conditions and may, accordingly, impact the
Company’s overall credit risk. Although the Company
generally does not require collateral, the Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and reserves for
potential credit losses are maintained. As of the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2003 and 2001, there were no customers with
receivable balances greater than 10 percent of total gross
accounts receivables. As of the fiscal year ended March 31,
2002, the Company had receivable balances from one customer
which represented 13 percent of total gross accounts
receivables.

Short-term investments are placed with high
credit-quality financial institutions or in short-duration high
quality securities. The Company limits the amount of credit
exposure in any one financial institution or type of investment
instrument.

(7) LITIGATION

The Company is subject to pending claims and
litigation. Management, after review and consultation with legal
counsel, considers that any liability from the disposition of
such lawsuits would not have a material adverse effect upon the
consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the
Company.

(8) PREFERRED STOCK

At March 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had
10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock authorized but unissued.
The rights, preferences, and restrictions of the Preferred Stock
may be designated by the Board of Directors without further
action by the Company’s stockholders.

(9) TREASURY STOCK

In September 2001, the Board of Directors
approved a plan to repurchase up to two million shares of the
Company’s Class A common stock. For the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2002, the Company repurchased 280,000
shares for approximately $11.9 million under the program.
In February 2002, all of the 280,000 shares were retired.

(10) STOCK PLANS

(a)     Employee
Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan
program whereby eligible employees may authorize payroll
deductions of up to 10 percent of their compensation to
purchase shares at 85 percent of the lower of the fair
market value of the Class A Common Stock on the date of
commencement of the offering or on the last day of the six-month
purchase period. The program commenced in September 1991. A new
Employee Stock Purchase Plan program, the “2000
Class A Employee Stock Purchase Plan” was approved by
the Board of Directors in May 2000 and commenced in August 2000.
In addition, the Company had a stock purchase plan which was
adopted without stockholder approval, the International Employee
Stock Purchase Plan, which was terminated by the Board of
Directors in connection with the amendment of the
stockholder-approved Plan discussed below as of February 2003.

The International Employee Stock Purchase Plan
was adopted by the Board of Directors in June 1996 and amended
in October 1998, February 1999 and February 2002 and is in all
material respects identical to the 2000 Class A Employee
Stock Purchase Plan approved by the stockholders for U.S.
employees. In February 2003, the Board of Directors approved an
amendment to the 2000 Class A Employee Stock Purchase Plan
to segregate provisions of the Plan for purchases intended to
qualify under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”) for participants
residing in the U.S., from



those that are not intended to qualify under
Section 423 of the Code for participants residing outside
of the U.S. Accordingly, the Company will no longer issue
Class A Common Stock under the International Employee Stock
Purchase Plan. At March 31, 2003, the Company had 91,760
shares of Class A Common Stock reserved for future issuance
under the International Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In fiscal
2003, 348,948 shares were purchased by the Company and
distributed to employees at prices ranging from $44.87 to
$45.74. In fiscal 2002, 313,240 shares were purchased by the
Company and distributed to employees at prices ranging from
$42.45 to $45.05. In fiscal 2001, 350,164 shares were purchased
by the Company and distributed to employees at prices ranging
from $29.14 to $42.50. The weighted average fair value of the
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 awards was $19.57, $18.88 and $18.31,
respectively, as estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model assumptions described in
Note 1(r) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. At March 31, 2003, the Company had 568,965
shares of Class A Common Stock reserved for future issuance
under the 2000 Class A Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

(b)     Stock Option
Plans

The Company’s 2000 Class A Equity
Incentive Plan, 1995 Stock Option Plan, and Directors’ Plan
(“Option Plans”) provide options for employees,
officers and directors to purchase the Company’s
Class A common stock. Pursuant to these Option Plans, the
Board of Directors may grant non-qualified and incentive stock
options to employees and officers and non-qualified options to
directors, at not less than the fair market value on the date of
grant.

At the Company’s Annual Meeting of
Stockholders, held on August 1, 2002, the stockholders
elected to amend the 2000 Class A Equity Incentive Plan to
increase by 5,500,000 the number of shares of the Company’s
Class A common stock reserved for issuance under the Plan.

Together with the Tracking Stock Proposal, the
stockholders approved the Electronic Arts Inc. 2000 Class B
Equity Incentive Plan. The Class B equity plan allows the
award of stock options or restricted stock for up to an
aggregate of 6,000,000 shares of Class B common stock. The
Class B equity plan included a provision for automatic
option grants to the Company’s outside directors. In
February 2003, the Board of Directors amended the Class B
equity plan to eliminate automatic grants to directors and to
preclude any further awards under the Class B equity plan.
As of March 31, 2003 there were 225,130 restricted shares
issued and no shares available for future issuance under the
Class B equity plan. See Note 2 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The options generally expire ten years from the
date of grant and are generally exercisable in monthly
increments over 50 months. Class B common stock grants
will generally vest over 50 months with 2 percent
vesting per month.

In fiscal year 2001, the Board of Directors
approved the Key Partner Class B Equity Incentive Program
which allows for the issuance of warrants to key business
partners to purchase up to 750,000 shares of Class B common
stock. As of March 31, 2002, there were 121,000 warrants
outstanding under this program. These warrants expire not later
than five years from issuance. In February 2003, the Company
caused a “Warrant Holder Exchange” of the Class B
warrant stock and terminated the program. Accordingly, all of
the 121,000 Class B warrants were exchanged for 30,504
Class A warrants, and there are no shares allocated for
issuance under the program.

The Company has an equity compensation stock plan
which was adopted without stockholder approval, the Celebrity
and Artist Stock Option Plan. The Celebrity and Artist Stock
Option Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in July 1994
and amended in May 1997, October 1997, September 1998 and July
1999. The terms under this plan are substantially similar to the
terms of the 2000 Class A Equity Incentive Plan.

The Company accounts for stock-based awards to
employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with
APB No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees”

and FIN 44,

“Accounting for
Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation (an
interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25)

”. In fiscal
2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 148,

“Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and



Disclosure – an Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123”,

which
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary
change to the fair value based method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation. The Statement also amends the
disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require
prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial
statements about the method of accounting for stock-based
compensation and the effect of the methods used on reported
results.

The Company has adopted the disclosure-only
provisions of SFAS No. 123,

“Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation”.

Accordingly, no compensation
expense has been recognized for options granted under the
Company’s employee-based stock option plans. Pursuant to
SFAS No. 123, the Company discloses the pro forma effects
of using the fair value method of accounting for stock-based
compensation arrangements. See Note 1(r) of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma effects of
using the fair value method of accounting for stock-based
compensation arrangements.

The following summarizes the activity under the
Company’s Class B stock option plan during the fiscal
years ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001:

(a)

In February 2003, the Board of Directors amended
    the Class B plan to preclude any further awards under the
    Class B plan.



(11) PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property and equipment at March 31, 2003 and
2002 consisted of (in thousands):

Depreciation and amortization expenses associated
with property and equipment amounted to $66.3 million,
$67.6 million and $50.3 million for the fiscal years
ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

(12) ACCRUED AND OTHER
LIABILITIES

Accrued and other liabilities at March 31,
2003 and 2002 consisted of (in thousands):

(13) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

(a)     Pogo
Corporation

On February 28, 2001, EA.com acquired Pogo
Corporation (now referred to as “Pogo”) for
$43.3 million, including an initial investment of
$42.0 million and the redemption of Pogo preferred stock of
$1.3 million. Pogo operates an ad-supported games service
that reaches a broad consumer market. Pogo’s internet-based
family games focus on easy-to-play card, board and puzzle games.

The acquisition has been accounted for under the
purchase method. The results of operations of Pogo and the
estimated fair market values of the acquired assets and
liabilities have been included in the consolidated financial
statements from the date of acquisition. The adjusted allocation
of the excess purchase price over the net tangible assets
acquired was $40.5 million, of which, based on
management’s estimates, $2.7 million was allocated to
purchased in-process research and development and
$37.8 million was allocated to other intangible assets.
Amounts allocated to other intangibles include goodwill of
$16.9 million, existing technology of $12.5 million,
and other intangibles of $8.4 million. The allocation of
intangible assets is being amortized on a straight-line basis
over lives ranging from three to seven years.

As part of the restructuring plan announced in
fiscal 2003 for EA.com, the Company evaluated its finite-lived
identifiable intangible assets for impairment in accordance with
SFAS No. 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”

as of January 1,
2003. The Company assessed the recoverability of its intangibles
by determining whether the carrying amount of the assets were
recoverable through estimated future undiscounted net cash
flows. The Company calculated the impairment loss as the amount
that the carrying value of the asset exceeded the discounted
future cash flows. Included in asset



impairment charges is a write-off of
$10.9 million relating to Pogo’s remaining
finite-lived intangible assets. These intangibles had remaining
lives ranging from 14 to 38 months.

Purchased in-process research and development
includes the value of products in the development stage that are
not considered to have reached technological feasibility or to
have alternative future use. Accordingly, this non-recurring
item was expensed in the Consolidated Statement of Operations
upon consummation of the acquisition. The non-recurring charge
for in-process research and development increased diluted loss
per share by approximately $0.01 and $0.07 in the fiscal year
2001 for Class A and Class B, respectively.

Pogo had various projects in progress at the time
of the acquisition. As of the acquisition date, costs to
complete Pogo projects acquired were expected to be
approximately $1.2 million in future periods. During fiscal
2002, all of these development projects were completed and
launched on Pogo gamesites. In conjunction with the acquisition
of Pogo, the Company accrued approximately $0.1 million
related to direct transaction costs and other related costs.

The purchase price for the Pogo transaction was
allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed as set
forth below (in thousands):

(b)     Square Co.,
Ltd.

In May 1998, the Company and Square Co., Ltd.
(“Square”), a leading developer and publisher of
entertainment software in Japan, completed the formation of two
new joint ventures in North America and Japan. In North America,
the companies formed Square Electronic Arts, LLC (“Square
EA”), which had exclusive publishing rights in North
America for future interactive entertainment titles created by
Square. Additionally, the Company had the exclusive right to
distribute in North America products published by this joint
venture. The Company contributed $3.0 million and owned a
30 percent minority interest in this joint venture while
Square owned 70 percent. This joint venture was accounted
for under the equity method. The joint venture agreements with
Square expired as of March 31, 2003. Our distribution of
Square products in North America will terminate on June 30,
2003.

In Japan, the companies established Electronic
Arts Square KK (“EA Square KK”), which localized and
published in Japan the Company’s properties originally
created in North America and Europe, as well as developed and
published original video games in Japan. The Company contributed
cash and had a 70 percent majority ownership interest,
while Square contributed cash and owned 30 percent.
Accordingly, the assets, liabilities and results of operations
for EA Square KK were included in the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheets and Results of Operations since
June 1, 1998, the date of formation. Square’s
30 percent interest in EA Square KK has been reflected
as “Minority interest in consolidated joint venture”
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Effective March 31, 2003, the Company and
Square terminated their joint venture agreement and reached
agreement for the Company to purchase Square’s
30 percent interest in Electronic Arts Square KK. In
May, 2003, the Company acquired such 30 percent ownership
interest in Electronic Arts Square KK from Square for
approximately $2.5 million in cash. As a result of the
acquisition, Electronic Arts Square KK has become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and has been renamed
Electronic Arts KK. The acquisition was accounted for as a
step acquisition purchase and the excess purchase price over
fair value of the net tangible assets acquired of
$1.2 million was allocated to goodwill.



(14) INCOME TAXES

The Company’s pretax income (loss) from
operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001 consisted of the following components:

Income tax expense (benefit) for the fiscal
years ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 consisted of:



The components of the net deferred tax assets as
of March 31, 2003 and 2002 consist of:

At March 31, 2003, deferred tax assets of
$117.2 million and $13.5 million were classified as
current assets and long-term assets, respectively.

The Company has research and experimental tax
credit carryforwards aggregating approximately
$42.0 million and $21.0 million for federal and
California purposes, respectively. The federal credit
carryforwards expire from 2006 to 2023. The California credits
carry over indefinitely until utilized. The Company also has
foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $11.0 million,
which expire from 2004 to 2008.

The differences between the statutory income tax
rate and the Company’s effective tax rate, expressed as a
percentage of income (loss) before provision for (benefit
from) income taxes, for the years ended March 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001 were as follows:

The Company provides for U.S. taxes on an
insignificant portion of the undistributed earnings of its
foreign subsidiaries and does not provide taxes on the
remainder. The Company has not provided for Federal income tax
on approximately $494.0 million of undistributed earnings
of its foreign subsidiaries, since the Company intends to
reinvest this amount in foreign subsidiary operations
indefinitely.

At March 31, 2003, the Company believes it
is more likely than not that the results of future operations
will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net
deferred tax assets.

During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003,
the Company successfully prevailed in Tax Court proceedings with
respect to previously-contested deficiencies issued by the
Internal Revenue Service in conjunction with its audit of the
Company’s US income tax returns for the years 1992 through
1995. The



IRS is examining the Company’s U.S. income
tax returns for 1996 through 1998 and has proposed certain
adjustments. While the ultimate resolution of tax audits
involves a degree of uncertainty, management believes that
adequate amounts of tax accruals have been provided for any
adjustments that are expected to result for these years.

(15) INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME,
NET

Interest and other income, net for the years
ended March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 consisted of (in
thousands):

(16) COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

SFAS No. 130,

“Reporting
Comprehensive Income”

, requires classification of other
comprehensive income in a financial statement and display of
other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and
additional paid-in capital. Other comprehensive income includes
primarily foreign currency translation adjustments and
unrealized gains (losses) on investments.

The change in the components of comprehensive
income, net of tax, is summarized as follows (in thousands):

Change in unrealized gains (losses) on
investments, net are shown net of taxes of $1.3 million,
$(1.6) million and $1.4 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively.



The currency translation adjustments are not
adjusted for income taxes as they relate to indefinite
investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries.

(17) DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following methods and assumptions were used
to estimate the fair value of each class of financial
instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:

Cash, cash equivalents, short-term
investments, receivables, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities –

the carrying
amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity of
these instruments.

Long-term investments, investments classified
as held-to-maturity and marketable securities –

fair value is based on quoted market
prices.

(18) SEGMENT INFORMATION

SFAS No. 131,

“Disclosures About
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information”

,
establishes standards for the reporting by public business
enterprises of information about product lines, geographic areas
and major customers. The method for determining what information
to report is based on the way that management organizes the
operating segments within the Company for making operational
decisions and assessments of financial performance.

The Company’s chief operating decision maker
is considered to be the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
(“CEO”). The CEO reviews financial information
presented on a consolidated basis accompanied by disaggregated
information about revenue by geographic region and by product
lines for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing
financial performance.

In fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company
operated and reviewed its business in two business segments:

•

EA Core business segment: creation, marketing and
    distribution of entertainment software.

•

EA.com business segment: creation, marketing and
    distribution of entertainment software which can be played or
    sold online, ongoing management of subscriptions of online games
    and website advertising.

In March 2003, the Company consolidated the
operations of EA.com into its core business, and has eliminated
separate reporting for its Class B common stock for all
future reporting periods after fiscal 2003. The Company now
considers online functionality to be integral to its existing
and future products. Accordingly, in fiscal 2004, the Company
will no longer manage EA.com as a separate business segment. As
of April 1, 2003, the Company will consolidate the
reporting related to its online products and services as part of
the overall development and publication of its other products.
The Company believes that this will better reflect the way in
which the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker reviews
and manages its business and the importance of its online
products and services relative to the rest of its business.
Based on the Company’s preliminary assessment of this
intended consolidation, management believes that it will only
have one reportable segment in fiscal 2004 as a result of
restructuring the EA.com business.

In order to prepare the segment information for
EA.com, the Company has allocated certain of its consolidated
assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows to EA.com.
The Consolidated Statements of Operations includes all revenue
and costs directly and indirectly attributable to EA.com,
including charges for shared facilities, functions and services
used by EA.com and provided by Electronic Arts. Certain costs
and expenses have been consistently allocated based on
management’s estimates of the cost of services provided to
EA.com by Electronic Arts. Such costs include corporate research
and development expenses, corporate selling, marketing and
distribution expenses and corporate general and administrative
expenses. Such allocations and charges are based on direct cost
pass-through or percentage of total costs for the services
provided based on factors such as headcount or activity-based
allocation. The Company does not allocate interest charges
between EA Core and EA.com. Management believes that these
allocations have been consistently applied and are based on
assumptions that are reasonable.



The Company’s view and reporting of business
segments may change due to changes in the underlying business
facts and circumstances and the evolution of the Company’s
reporting to its Chief Operating Decision Maker. Please see the
discussion regarding segment reporting in the MD&A.

Information about Electronic Arts business
segments is presented below for the fiscal years ended
March 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (in thousands):

(19) RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT
CHARGES

EA Core

During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, the
Company closed its office located in San Francisco, California
and its studio located in Seattle, Washington. The office and
studio closures were a result of the Company’s strategic
decision to consolidate local development efforts in Redwood
City, California and Vancouver, Canada. The Company recorded
total pre-tax charges of $9.4 million, consisting of
$7.3 million for consolidation of facilities, $1.5 million
for the write-off of non-current assets and $0.6 million
for workforce reductions. The facilities charge was net of a
reduction in deferred rent of $0.5 million.

The exit plans resulted in a workforce reduction
of approximately 33 personnel in development and administrative
departments. The estimated costs for consolidation of facilities
included contractual rental commitments under the real estate
lease for unutilized office space, offset by estimated future
sub-lease income. In addition, the exit plans resulted in the
write-off of certain non-current fixed assets, primarily
leasehold improvements.

Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2003, the Company approved a plan to consolidate its Los
Angeles, Irvine and Las Vegas studios into one major game studio
in Los Angeles. These measures were taken in order to maximize
efficiencies and streamline the creative development process and
operations of the Company’s studios. In connection with
these consolidation activities, the Company recorded a total
pre-tax restructuring charge of $5.1 million. This charge
includes $1.6 million for the shutdown of facilities
related to non-cancelable lease payments for permanently vacated
properties and associated costs, $2.0 million for the
write-off of abandoned equipment and leasehold improvements at
facilities that were permanently vacated and $1.5 million for
employee severance expenses related to involuntary terminations.
The consolidation of the studios discussed above, as well as
other activities related to this plan, was completed by the end
of March 2003.



The following table summarizes the restructuring
accrual activity related to EA Core during fiscal 2003 (in
thousands):

The Company expects the remaining accrued
restructuring balance of $7.5 million to be fully utilized
by December 31, 2006.

EA.com

Fiscal 2003 Restructuring

In March 2003, the Company consolidated the
operations of EA.com into its core business, and has eliminated
separate reporting for its Class B common stock for all
future reporting periods after fiscal 2003. The Company
considers online functionality to be an integral component of
its existing and future products. The workforce reduction
resulted in the termination of approximately 50 positions.

During fiscal 2003, the Company recorded
restructuring charges, including asset impairment, of
$67.0 million, consisting of $1.8 million for
workforce reductions, $2.3 million for consolidation of
facilities and other administrative charges, and
$62.9 million for the write-off of non-current assets. The
estimated costs for workforce reduction included severance
charges for terminated employees, costs for certain outplacement
service contracts and costs associated with the tender offer to
retire employee Class B options. The consolidation of
facilities resulted in the closure of EA.com’s Chicago and
Virginia facilities and an adjustment for the closure of
EA.com’s San Diego studio in fiscal 2002. The estimated
costs for consolidation of facilities and other administrative
charges included contractual rental commitments under real
estate leases for unutilized office space reduced by estimated
future sub-lease income and costs to close the facilities.

The Company recorded restructuring charges for
EA.com in accordance with SFAS No. 146,

“Accounting
for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”

.
Adjustments to the restructuring reserves will be made in future
periods, if necessary, based upon the then current events and
circumstances.

As part of the restructuring efforts, the Company
performed impairment tests under SFAS No. 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets”

, to evaluate the recoverability of its
long-lived assets and remaining finite-lived identifiable
intangibles utilized in the EA.com business. This test was
performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 in conjunction
with the overall valuation of the EA.com legal entity and its
Class B common stock. In February 2003, the Company’s
only outside holder of Class B common stock, AOL, exercised
its right to exchange its Class B shares for shares of
Class A common stock. In late December 2002, EA.com
launched

The Sims Online,

an online game based on the
Company’s very popular “The Sims” line of PC
games, which have sold over 20 million units worldwide.

The Sims Online

was expected to be EA.com’s flagship
online subscription offering. Through mid-March 31, 2003,
the number of units sold and subscribers for this product along
with other EA.com revenue were significantly below the
Company’s expectations. The Company considered these
developments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 to be a
triggering event under SFAS No. 144, which caused the
Company to cancel most of its plans to develop similar online
products that would have utilized long-lived assets associated
with the EA.com business. As a result, the Company substantially
reduced its expected future undiscounted cash flows related to
these long-lived assets. These assets were not impaired in
earlier



periods because the expected future undiscounted
cash flows for the asset groups relating to EA.com were in
excess of the related asset carrying amount.

The Company assessed the recoverability of its
long-lived assets by comparing the carrying amount of the assets
to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated
by the group of assets attributable to the EA.com business. The
Company measured the impairment loss as the amount that the
carrying value of these long-lived assets exceeded the
discounted future cash flows for individual asset groups. Due to
significant interdependencies of the operating activities among
the asset base, there were not specific identifiable cash flows
and thus, the long-lived assets were combined into one asset
grouping for the purposes of the test. The Company utilized a
present value technique in determining the fair value of the
asset grouping over the disposition period, which was determined
to be four years. In evaluating the reasonableness of the
discounted cash flow approach, the liquidation value of
individual long-lived assets was also assessed. Impairment
charges on long-lived assets amounted to $62.9 million and
included $24.9 million relating to impaired customized
internal-use software systems for the EA.com infrastructure,
$25.6 million for other long-lived assets and
$12.4 million of finite-lived intangibles impairment
charges relating to EA.com’s Kesmai and Pogo studios. (See
other intangibles table in Note 1(l) for additional detail.) As
of March 31, 2003, there were no finite-lived intangible
balances remaining related to Kesmai and Pogo studios. There are
no assurances that the impairment factors evaluated by
management will not change in subsequent periods and
accordingly, this could result in additional impairment charges
in future periods.

In conjunction with the Company’s annual
policy to reassess the remaining useful lives of goodwill and
certain indefinite-lived intangibles and test the recoverability
of these long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”

, as of
January 1, 2003, the Company also performed fair value
based tests to evaluate impairment of the EA.com reporting unit.
This test was performed after the Company tested for impairment
under SFAS No. 144 as described above. Under this test, the
fair value based tests did not indicate an impairment of the
Company’s recorded goodwill and certain indefinite-lived
intangibles at the EA.com reporting unit level. The remaining
portion of Kesmai goodwill assets at March 31, 2003 was
$13.8 million. The remaining portion of Pogo goodwill
assets at March 31, 2003 was $15.9 million. There are
no assurances that future impairment tests will not result in a
charge to earnings and a corresponding write down of goodwill
and certain indefinite-lived intangibles.

Fiscal 2002 Restructuring

In October 2001, the Company announced a
restructuring plan for EA.com. The restructuring initiatives
involved strategic decisions to discontinue certain product
offerings and focus only on key online priorities that align
with its fiscal 2003 operational objectives. The workforce
reduction resulted in the termination of approximately 270
positions.

During fiscal 2002, the Company recorded
restructuring charges of $20.3 million, consisting of
$4.2 million for workforce reductions, $3.3 million
for consolidation of facilities and other administrative
charges, and $12.8 million for the write-off of non-current
assets and facilities. The estimated costs for workforce
reduction included severance charges for terminated employees
and costs for certain outplacement service contracts. The
consolidation of facilities resulted in the closure of
EA.com’s San Diego studio and consolidation of its San
Francisco and Virginia facilities. The estimated costs for
consolidation of facilities included contractual rental
commitments under real estate leases for unutilized office space
offset by estimated future sub-lease income, costs to close or
consolidate facilities, and costs to write off a portion of the
assets from these facilities.

The Company recorded restructuring charges for
EA.com in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
No. 94-03,

“Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring)

”, Emerging Issues Task Force
No. 95-03,

“Recognition of Liabilities in
Connection with a Purchase Business Combination”

, and
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100,

“Restructuring
and Impairment Charges”

. Adjustments to the
restructuring reserves will be made in future periods, if
necessary, based upon the then current events and circumstances.



As part of the restructuring efforts, the Company
assessed the remaining useful lives of goodwill, purchased
intangible assets and other long-lived assets and tested the
recoverability of its long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS
No. 121. Management evaluated the impact of consolidating
or abandoning certain EA.com technologies and processes and
reviewed the effect of changes to EA.com’s subscription
product offerings in relation to EA.com’s asset base. As a
result, it was determined that certain long-lived assets would
be abandoned or were related to products or services that had
been discontinued and would therefore be written-down to their
estimated net disposal value. Impairment charges on long-lived
assets amounted to $12.8 million and included $11.2 million
relating to abandoned technologies consisting of customized
internal-use software systems for the EA.com infrastructure,
$1.0 million of Kesmai intangibles impairment because
associated products and services were discontinued and
$0.6 million of goodwill charges relating to EA.com’s
San Diego studio closure. The remaining portion of Kesmai assets
at March 31, 2002 was $15.9 million, consisting of
$13.1 million of goodwill and $2.8 million of
intangibles relating to Kesmai’s developed and core
technology and acquired workforce. There are no assurances that
the impairment factors evaluated by management will not change
in subsequent periods and accordingly, this could result in
additional impairment charges in future periods.

The following table summarizes the activity in
the accrued restructuring account for EA.com in fiscal 2002 and
2003 (in thousands):

For fiscal 2003, the pre-tax restructuring charge
of $67.0 million, consisted of $4.1 million in cash
outlays and $62.9 million in non-cash charges related to
the write-off of non-current assets. For fiscal 2002, the
pre-tax restructuring charge of $20.3 million consisted of
$6.9 million in cash outlays and $13.4 million in
non-cash charges related to the write-offs of non-current assets
and facilities.

As of March 31, 2003, an aggregate of
$7.1 million in cash had been paid out under the
restructuring plan. In addition, there have been subsequent
adjustments of approximately $0.6 million relating to
future cash outlays under the fiscal 2002 restructuring plan. Of
the remaining cash outlay of $3.2 million, $2.5 million is
expected to occur in fiscal 2004 while the remaining
$0.7 million will occur in fiscal years 2005 and beyond.

The restructuring accrual is included in accrued
expenses in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.



(20) CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

Residual Value Guarantees

In February of 1995, the Company entered into a
build-to-suit lease with Keybank National Association on its
headquarter’s facility in Redwood City, California, which
was extended in July 2001 and expires in July 2006. The Company
accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in
accordance with SFAS No. 13,

“Accounting for
Leases”

, as amended. Existing campus facilities
developed in phase one comprise a total of 350,000 square feet
and provide space for sales, marketing, administration and
research and development functions. The Company has an option to
purchase the property (land and facilities) for
$145.0 million or, at the end of the lease, to arrange for
(1) an additional extension of the lease or (2) sale
of the property to a third party with the Company retaining an
obligation to the owner for the difference between the sale
price and the guaranteed residual value of up to $128.9 million
if the sales price is less than this amount, subject to certain
provisions of the lease.

In December 2000, the Company entered into a
second build-to-suit lease with Keybank National Association for
a five year term from December 2000 to expand its
headquarter’s facilities and develop adjacent property
adding approximately 310,000 square feet to its campus.
Construction was completed in June 2002. The Company accounted
for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with
SFAS No. 13, as amended. The facilities will provide space
for marketing, sales and research and development. The Company
has an option to purchase the property for $127.0 million
or, at the end of the lease, to arrange for (1) an
extension of the lease or (2) sale of the property to a
third party with the Company retaining an obligation to the
owner for the difference between the sale price and the
guaranteed residual value of up to $118.8 million if the
sales price is less than this amount, subject to certain
provisions of the lease. The Company believes the estimated fair
value of the properties under the operating leases are in excess
of the guaranteed residual values as of March 31, 2003,
based in part on an independent third party appraisal.

Director Indemnity Agreements

The Company has entered into an indemnification
agreement with the members of its Board of Directors to
indemnify its Directors to the extent permitted by law against
any and all liabilities, costs, expenses, amounts paid in
settlement and damages incurred by the Directors as a result of
any lawsuit, or any judicial, administrative or investigative
proceeding in which the Directors are sued as a result of their
service as members of the Board of Directors of the Company.

See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section
of the MD&A, included in item 7 hereof, for a schedule
of the Company’s contractual obligations and commitments.

(21) INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES

In accordance with APB No. 18,

“The
Equity Method Of Accounting For Investments In Common
Stock”,

management evaluates equity and cost
investments to determine if events or changes in circumstances
indicate an other-than-temporary impairment in value. The
Company has cost and equity investments in affiliates. Based on
several factors, such as the financial performance of the
affiliate, the Company’s decision to no longer acquire or
continue investing in these affiliates, the limited cash flow
from future business arrangements and other information
available during fiscal 2003, the Company determined that some
of its investments in affiliates contained an
other-than-temporary impairment and recorded a charge in the
amount of $10.6 million to write-down these investments to
their estimated fair market value. This write-down was recorded
in interest and other income, net in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations.

(22) OTHER RELATED PARTY
TRANSACTIONS

Indebtedness of Management

On June 24, 2002, the Company hired Warren
Jenson as its Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer and agreed to loan Mr. Jenson $4.0 million, to be
forgiven over fours years based on his continuing



employment. Two million dollars of the note will
be forgiven after two years employment, and the remainder
forgiven after four years. The entire balance of the loan is
outstanding as of June 1, 2003.

In May and June 2000, the following executive
officers entered into secured full recourse promissory notes to
purchase EA’s Class B common stock under Restricted
Stock Purchase Agreements: Mr. Riccitiello, $449,500;
Mr. Mattrick, $224,750; Mr. McKee, $134,850;
Mr. J. Russell (Rusty) Rueff, Jr., $134,850, and
Mr. David Carbone, $44,950. The term of the notes is five
years and the interest, set at a market rate as determined under
guidelines set forth in the Internal Revenue Code and state
statutes, was due and payable quarterly. In December 2002 and
January 2003, Mr. Riccitiello, Mr. Mattrick,
Mr. McKee, Mr. Rueff and Mr. Carbone paid in full all
principal and accrued interest owed under these notes.

News America Corporation Exchange

On February 7, 2000, the Company acquired
Kesmai from News America Corporation (“News Corp”) in
exchange for $22.5 million in cash and approximately
206,000 shares of our existing common stock valued at
$8.65 million. Under the original agreements, the Company
agreed to spend $12.5 million through the period ended
June 1, 2002 in advertising with News Corp or any of its
affiliates. In addition, under these agreements if certain
conditions were met, including that a qualified public offering
of Class B common stock did not occur within twenty-four
months of News Corp’s purchase of such shares and all of
the Class B outstanding shares had been converted to
Class A common stock, then (1) News Corp would have
the right to (i) exchange Class B common stock for
approximately 206,000 shares of Class A common stock, and
(ii) receive cash from the Company in the amount of
$9.65 million, and (2) the Company would agree to
spend an additional $11.675 million in advertising with
News Corp and its affiliates.

On August 30, 2002, the Company entered into
a new agreement with News Corp under which (i) News Corp
exchanged its 2,000,000 shares of Class B common stock for
206,454 shares of Class A common stock and (ii) the
Company paid News Corp $1.0 million in cash and committed
to spend an additional $17.0 million in advertising with
News Corp and its affiliates through the period ended
December 31, 2006. All of the Company’s other
obligations to News Corp under the original agreements were
terminated.

(23) IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING
STANDARDS

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 143,

“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations”

.
SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting
for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs.
This statement applies to legal obligations associated with the
retirement of long-lived assets that result from the
acquisition, construction, development or normal use of the
asset. SFAS No. 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2002. The Company does not expect the
adoption of SFAS No. 143 to have a material impact on its
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 46,

“Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities”

(“FIN 46”). This
interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,

“Consolidated Financial Statements,

” addresses
consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest
entities (“VIEs”) that either: (i) do not have
sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to
finance its activities without additional subordinated financial
support, or (ii) the equity investors lack an essential
characteristic of a controlling financial interest. This
interpretation applies immediately to VIEs created after
January 31, 2003. It applies in the first fiscal year or
interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to VIEs in
which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired
before February 1, 2003. FIN 46 requires disclosure of
VIEs in financial statements issued after January 31, 2003,
if it is reasonably possible that as of the transition date:
(i) the company will be the primary beneficiary of an
existing VIE that will require consolidation or, (ii) the
company will hold a significant variable interest in, or have
significant involvement with, an existing VIE. The Company does
not believe that it will have any entities that will require
disclosure or new consolidation as a result of adopting the
provisions of FIN 46.



In January 2003, the EITF reached consensus on
Issue No. 00-21,

“Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables”

. EITF 00-21 provides
guidance on how to determine whether an arrangement involving
multiple deliverables requires that such deliverables be
accounted for separately. EITF 00-21 allows for prospective
adoption for arrangements entered into after June 15, 2003
or adoption via a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principal. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the
adoption of EITF 00-21 will have on its consolidated
results of operations and financial position.

the effectiveness of the Company’s “disclosure
controls and procedures” (as defined in the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-14(c) and 15-d-14(c)) as of

certification requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and new
Securities and Exchange Commission Regulations, the Company has
enhanced its internal controls and disclosure systems, through
various measures including: detailing its internal accounting
policies; establishing a formal disclosure committee for
preparation of all periodic reports; and requiring
certifications from various trial balance controllers and other
financial personnel responsible for the Company’s financial
statements.
