Item 1:

Business

Overview

Electronic Arts develops, markets, publishes and distributes
interactive software games (we sometimes refer to them as
“titles”) that are playable by consumers on the
following devices:

We refer to consoles, PCs, mobility and online collectively as
“platforms”.

We were initially incorporated in California in 1982. In
September 1991, we reincorporated under the laws of Delaware.
Our principal executive offices are located near
San Francisco, California at 209 Redwood Shores
Parkway, Redwood City, California 94065 and our telephone number
is (650) 628-1500.

One of our strengths is our ability to publish interactive
software games for multiple platforms. Our products that are
designed to play on consoles and mobile platforms are published
under license from the manufacturers of these platforms (for
example, Sony for the PlayStation 2 and PSP, Microsoft for
the Xbox and Nintendo for the Nintendo GameCube, Game Boy
Advance and Nintendo DS) and we pay a fee to these platform
manufacturers for technology and intellectual property, which
enables us to publish products on their platforms. We invest in
the creation of software tools to more efficiently develop games
for multiple platforms. We also make investments in facilities
and equipment that allow us to create and edit video and audio
recordings that are used in our games. Since our inception, we
have published games for over 45 different platforms.

Our product development methods and organization are modeled on
those used in other sectors of the entertainment industry.
Employees whom we call “producers” are responsible for
overseeing the development of one or more products. The
interactive software games that we develop and publish are
broken down into three major categories: (1) EA studio
products, (2) co-publishing products and
(3) distribution products.

EA Studio Products

We develop games internally at our development and production
studios located near San Francisco, Los Angeles, Orlando
(Florida), Chicago, Vancouver, Montreal, London and Tokyo. We
also engage third parties to develop games on our behalf at
their own development and production studios. We publish our EA
Studio products under three major brands:

•

EA
    SPORTS

tm

    We publish realistic sports simulation games under our EA SPORTS
    brand. Some of our recent products published under the EA SPORTS

    sports games under our EA SPORTS BIG brand. Some of our
    recent products published under the EA SPORTS BIG brand
    include

NFL STREET 2: Unleashed

(football),

Def
    Jam®

Fight for
    NY

tm

(wrestling),

NBA STREET Vol. 3

(basketball) and

FIFA STREET

(soccer).

Co-publishing and
Distribution Products

Through our EA Partners global business unit, we team with other
game development companies that develop their own interactive
software games with our assistance, which we then publish,
market and distribute. An example of one of our recent
co-publishing products is

TimeSplitters Future
Perfect

tm

,
which was developed by Free Radical Design, a game development
company located near London. We also distribute interactive
software games that are developed by other companies. An example
of one of our recent distribution products is

Star Wars
Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords

,
published by LucasArts, which we distributed in Japan.

Another strength of our business is that we develop product
families (we call them “franchises”) around many of
our products. For example, every year we release new versions of
most of our EA SPORTS titles. Likewise, we have been successful
in developing, marketing, publishing and distributing sequels to
several of our EA GAMES and EA SPORTS BIG products. We also
release products called “expansion packs” for PC
titles that provide additional content (characters, storylines,
settings, missions) for games that we have previously published.
For example, we have published an expansion pack

The
Sims 2: University

, which expands the characters,
settings and gameplay of the original

The Sims 2

game. We consider titles that iterate, sequel or spawn
expansion packs to be franchise titles.

Method of Delivery

The console, PC and some mobile games that we publish are made
available to consumers on a disk (usually CD, DVD or Universal
Media Disc (“UMD”) format) or a cartridge that is
packaged and typically sold in retail stores and through online
stores (including our own online store). We refer to these as
“packaged goods” products. In North America and
Europe, our largest markets, these packaged goods products are
sold primarily to retailers that may be mass market retailers
(such as Wal-Mart), electronics specialty stores (such as Best
Buy) or game software specialty stores (such as GameStop). We
also maintain a smaller business where we license to
manufacturers of products in related industries (for example,
makers of personal computers or computer accessories) rights to
include certain of our products with the manufacturer’s
product or offer our products to consumers who have purchased
the manufacturer’s product. We call these combined products
“OEM bundles”.

There are three ways in which we publish games that are playable
online by consumers: (1) we publish games that are playable
only online. One type of these online-only games is called
“persistent state worlds” or “massively
multiplayer online games”. Players experience these games
as interactive virtual worlds where thousands of other players
can interact with one another. An example of our persistent
state world products is

Ultima Online

. These persistent
state world games are often sold to consumers in the form of a
CD or DVD that contains much of the software necessary to play
the game online. After loading the game disk on their PCs,
players are able to log-on to servers that we make available in
order to interact with other players; (2) other types of
online-only games that we publish are available on the World
Wide Web and include card games, puzzle games and word games
(marketed under our
“pogo

tm

”
brand), all of which are made available to consumers on our web
site, www.pogo.com, and on certain online services provided by
America Online, Inc.; and (3) we include online capability
features in certain of our PC, PlayStation 2 and Xbox
products, which enable consumers to participate in online
communities and play against one another via the Internet.



Intellectual Property

Like other entertainment companies, our business is based on the
creation, acquisition, exploitation and protection of
intellectual property. Some of this intellectual property is in
the form of software code, patented technology, and other
technology and trade secrets that we use to develop our games
and to make them run properly on the platforms. Other
intellectual property is in the form of audio-visual elements
that consumers can see, hear and interact with when they are
playing our games — we call this form of intellectual
property “content”.

Each of our products embodies a number of separate forms of
intellectual property protection: the software and the content
of our products are copyrighted; our product brands and names
may be trademarks of ours or others; our products may contain
voices and likenesses of actors, athletes and/or commentators
(protected by personal publicity rights) and often contain
musical compositions and performances that are also copyrighted.
Our products also may contain other content licensed from
others, such as trademarks, fictional characters, storylines and
software code.

We acquire the rights to include these kinds of intellectual
property in our products through license agreements such as
those with sports leagues and player associations, movie studios
and performing talent, music labels, music publishers and
musicians. These licenses are typically limited to use of the
licensed rights in products for specific time periods. In
addition, our products that play on consoles, such as the Sony
PlayStation 2, include technology that is owned by the
console manufacturer and licensed non-exclusively to us for use.
While we may have renewal rights for some licenses, our business
and the justification for the development of many of our
products is dependent on our ability to continue to obtain the
intellectual property rights from the owners of these rights at
reasonable rates.

Our products are susceptible to unauthorized copying. We
typically distribute our PC products using copy protection
technology that we license from other companies. In addition,
console manufacturers, such as Sony, typically incorporate
security devices in their consoles in an effort to prevent
unlicensed use of products. Our primary protection against
unauthorized use, duplication and distribution of our products
is enforcement of our copyright and trademark interests. We
typically own the copyright to the software code as well as the
brand or title name trademark under which our products are
marketed. We register our copyrights in the United States, and
register our significant trademarks in multiple countries
including the United States.

Market Segment

Historically, there have been multiple consoles available that
play interactive software games like ours, and there has been
vigorous competition between console manufacturers. While Sony
has for the past several years been the clear business segment
leader (with its PlayStation® and PlayStation 2
consoles), Microsoft and Nintendo are large and viable
competitors, and PCs continue to be a strong interactive game
platform. We develop and publish products for multiple
platforms, and this diversification continues to be a
cornerstone of our product strategy.

We currently develop or publish products for eleven different
hardware platforms. In fiscal 2005, we released games designed
to play on the PlayStation 2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube,
PlayStation, PC, Game Boy Advance, Nokia
N-Gage

tm

,
Sony PSP, Nintendo DS and the Internet. In fiscal 2006, we plan
to release games designed for play on the PlayStation 2,
Xbox, Xbox 360, Nintendo GameCube, PC, Game Boy Advance, Nokia
N-Gage, Sony PSP, Nintendo DS, the Internet and cellular phones
(among others).



Video Game Consoles

The current-generation of systems was initiated by the launch of
Sony’s PlayStation 2 in fiscal 2001, and continued
with the launches of the Nintendo GameCube and Microsoft’s
Xbox in fiscal 2002. The following table details select
information on a sample of the console platforms for which we
have published titles:

PlayStation 2.

Sony released the PlayStation 2
console in Japan in March 2000, in North America in October 2000
and in Europe in November 2000. The PlayStation 2 console
is a 128-bit, DVD-based system that, with a network adaptor, is
Internet ready, as well as backward compatible with games
published for its predecessor, the PlayStation. We have
published and are currently developing numerous products for the
Sony PlayStation 2.

Nintendo GameCube.

Nintendo launched the Nintendo
GameCube console in Japan in September 2001, in North America in
November 2001 and in Europe in May 2002. The Nintendo GameCube
plays games that are manufactured on a proprietary optical disk.
We have published and are currently developing numerous products
for the Nintendo GameCube.

Xbox.

Microsoft launched the Xbox console in North
America in November 2001, in Japan in February 2002 and in
Europe in March 2002. The Microsoft Xbox is a 128-bit, DVD-based
system that is Internet ready. In May 2004, we began to support
the Xbox Live service with features including Quickmatch,
Optimatch, gamertags, Xbox Live friends list, voice
communication and EA messenger service. We have published and
are currently developing numerous products for the Microsoft
Xbox.

Mobile Video Game Platforms

While Nintendo has been the leading manufacturer of mobile video
game platforms, Sony has recently entered this market with its
PSP. The following table details select information on a sample
of the mobile platforms for which we have published titles:

Nintendo DS.

Nintendo launched the Nintendo DS in North
America in November 2004, in Japan in December 2004 and in
Europe in March 2005. We have published several products and are
currently developing several more products for the Nintendo DS.

Sony PSP.

Sony launched the PSP in Japan in December 2004
and in North America in March 2005. The Sony PSP is a UMD based
system. We have published several products and are currently
developing and expect to develop numerous products for the Sony
PSP.



Online Games

To date, we have had limited success in finding ways of
generating revenue and profits from online games, including
subscription fees, “pay-to-play fees”, micro
transactions and advertising. In addition, we have had limited
experience with developing optimal pricing strategies or
predicting usage patterns for our online games. In our history,
we have launched five persistent state world products with mixed
results. While we have achieved success with

Ultima
Online

, our other persistent state world products, most
notably

The Sims Online,

have not met our expectations.

In fiscal 2004, we launched Club
Pogo

tm

,
a subscription service for Pogo, offering exclusive games and
premium features. We have over 800,000 paying subscribers as of
March 31, 2005 up from 308,000 paying subscribers as of
March 31, 2004.

Despite our limited success to date, we believe that online
capability is integral to our existing and future products. The
continued growth of the online sector of our industry will
depend on the following key factors:

Next-Generation Consoles

During the next 18 months, we expect the next-generation of
consoles to be released by Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo. Our
early investment in products designed for play on 32 and 128-bit
consoles, such as the PlayStation and PlayStation 2,
respectively, has been strategically important in positioning us
for the next-generation of consoles. We believe that such
investment continues to be important as the next-generation of
consoles is expected to introduce new complexities such as
Blu-ray Disk-Read Only Memory (“BD-ROM”) and/or
High-Definition video technologies. As we move through the life
cycle of current-generation consoles, we will continue to devote
resources to developing games for these consoles, while at the
same time increasing our investment in tools and technologies
for the next-generation of consoles.

Competition

We compete in the entertainment industry. At the most
fundamental level, our products compete with other forms of
entertainment, such as motion pictures, television and music,
for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers. We
believe that the software games segment is best viewed as a
segment of the overall entertainment market. We believe that
large software companies and media companies are increasing
their focus on the software games segment of the entertainment
market and as a result, may become more direct competitors.
Several large software companies and media companies (e.g.,
Microsoft and Sony) have been publishing products that compete
with ours for a long time, and other diversified
media/entertainment companies (e.g., Time Warner and Disney)
have announced their intent to significantly expand their
software game publishing efforts in the future.

The software games business is highly competitive. It is
characterized by the continuous introduction of new titles and
the development of new technologies. Our competitors vary in
size from very small companies with limited resources to very
large, diversified corporations with greater financial and
marketing resources than ours. Our business is driven by hit
titles, which require ever-increasing budgets for development
and marketing. As a result, the availability of significant
financial resources has become a major competitive factor in
developing and marketing software games. Competition is also
based on product quality and features, timing of product
releases, brand-name recognition, quality of in-game content,
access to distribution channels, effectiveness of marketing and
price.



We currently compete with Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, each of
which develop and publish software for their respective console
platforms. We also compete with numerous companies which are,
like us, licensed by the console manufacturers to develop and
publish software games that operate on their consoles. These
competitors include Activision, Atari, Capcom, Eidos, Koei,
Konami, LucasArts, Midway, Namco, Sega, Take-Two Interactive,
THQ, Ubisoft and Vivendi Universal Games, among others. As
discussed above, diversified media companies such as Time Warner
and Disney have also indicated their intent to significantly
expand their software game publishing efforts in the future.

In addition to competing for product sales, we face heavy
competition from other software game companies to obtain license
agreements granting us the right to use intellectual property
included in our products; and some of these content licenses are
controlled by the diversified media companies, which intend to
expand their software game publishing divisions.

Finally, the market for our products is characterized by
significant price competition and we regularly face pricing
pressures from our competitors. These pressures have, from time
to time, required us to reduce our prices on certain products.
Our experience has been that software game prices tend to
decline once a generation of consoles has been in the market for
a significant period of time due to the increasing number of
software titles competing for acceptance by consumers and the
anticipation of the next-generation of consoles.

Significant Relationships

Content Licensors

Many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual
property owned by others. For example, our EA SPORTS products
include rights licensed from the major sports leagues and
players associations. Similarly, many of our hit EA GAMES
franchises, such as James Bond, Harry Potter and Lord of the
Rings, are based on key film and literary licenses. In fiscal
2005, we entered into exclusive license agreements with ESPN,
the NFL, PLAYERS, Inc. (the NFL players’ association),
Collegiate Licensing Company (the licensing authority for NCAA
football) and the Arena Football League. In addition, we have
long-standing, exclusive relationships with various sports
organizations and celebrities, including FIFA, UEFA
(professional soccer), NASCAR, Tiger Woods and the PGA TOUR,
and, in the future, we may enter into other exclusive
relationships with other partners.

Products and Product Development

In fiscal 2005, we generated approximately 71 percent of
our net revenue from EA Studio-produced products released during
the year as compared to approximately 69 percent in fiscal
2004. During fiscal 2005, we introduced 35 EA Studios
titles, representing 109 stock keeping units, or SKUs,
compared to 32 EA Studios titles, comprising 97 SKUs,
in fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2005, we had 31 titles that sold over
one million units (aggregated across all platforms). In fiscal
2004, we had 27 titles and in fiscal 2003 we had
22 titles that sold over one million units (aggregated
across all platforms). A SKU is a version of a title designed
for play on a particular platform and intended for distribution
in a particular territory. In fiscal 2005, we had one title,

Need for Speed Underground 2

, published on five
different platforms which represented approximately
11 percent of our total net revenue. No title represented
more than 10 percent of our total net revenue in fiscal
2004 while in fiscal 2003, we had one title,

Harry Potter and
the Chamber of
Secrets

tm

,
published on seven different platforms, which represented
approximately 10 percent of our total net revenue.

The products produced by EA Studios are designed and created by
our employee designers and artists and by non-employee software
developers (we call them “independent artists” or
“third-party developers”). We typically advance
development funds to the independent artists and third-party
developers during development of our games, which payments are
considered advances against subsequent royalties based on the
sales of the products. These terms are typically set forth in
written agreements entered into with the independent artists and
third-party developers.

The retail selling prices of our newly released products in
North America typically range from $29.99 to $49.99. Other
titles, including re-releases of older titles marketed as
“Classics”, have retail selling prices that range from
$9.99 to $29.99. The retail selling prices of our titles outside
of North America vary widely depending on factors such as local
market conditions.

Our goal is to maintain our position as a leading publisher of
games sold for play on the current-generation of 128-bit video
game consoles and to extend our success into the next-generation
of consoles and mobile platforms. We will continue to invest in
tools and technologies designed to facilitate development of our
products for current-generation platforms while also investing
in tools and technologies for the next-generation of consoles
and mobile platforms. These investments are recorded in research
and development in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. We
had research and development expenditures of $633 million
in fiscal 2005, $511 million in fiscal 2004 and
$401 million in fiscal 2003.

Marketing and Distribution

We market the products produced by our EA Studios under the EA
GAMES, EA SPORTS and EA SPORTS BIG brands. Products marketed
under the EA GAMES brand typically feature challenging games and
include franchises such as Need for Speed, The Lord of the Rings
and Medal of Honor. Products marketed under the EA SPORTS brand
typically simulate professional and collegiate sports and include



franchises such as Madden NFL, FIFA Soccer and NBA Live.
Products marketed under the EA SPORTS BIG brand typically
feature extreme sports or modified traditional sports in an
arcade-style game and include such titles as

Def Jam Fight
for NY

,

FIFA STREET

and

NFL STREET 2:
Unleashed.

Formerly known as Electronic Arts Distribution, our EA Partners
global business unit operates under a variety of deal types and
structures with the intent of generating, leveraging and/or
owning intellectual properties conceived by other developers,
publishers or licensors worldwide. Through EA Partners we
provide direct development expertise to our partners via an
internal production staff, while also making available our
publishing resources to provide sales, marketing and
distribution services on a global basis. EA Partners currently
has relationships with Lionhead, Crytek, Free Radical Design and
Eurocom Entertainment Software, among others.

EA Partners also distributes finished goods on behalf of other
publishers. These titles are developed and manufactured by other
publishers and delivered to us as completed products, for which
we provide distribution services. In fiscal 2005, our
distribution partners included Capcom and Namco.

The interactive software game business is “hit”
driven, requiring significantly greater expenditures for
marketing and advertising of our products. There can be no
assurance that we will continue to produce “hit”
titles, or that advertising for any product will increase sales
sufficiently to recoup those advertising expenses.

We generated approximately 95 percent of our North American
net revenue from direct sales to retailers. The remaining
5 percent of our North American sales were made through a
limited number of specialized and regional distributors and rack
jobbers in markets where we believe direct sales would not be
economical. We had direct sales to one customer, Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc., which represented 14 percent of total net
revenue in fiscal 2005, 13 percent in fiscal 2004 and
12 percent in fiscal 2003.

Outside of North America, we derive revenues primarily from
direct sales to retailers. Our largest indirect sales
relationship is with Pinnacle in Europe. Sales of our products
through Pinnacle make up approximately 10 percent of our
total net revenue. We use Pinnacle to provide logistical and
collection services to our retail customers. Under the terms of
our distribution agreement with Pinnacle, product is held by
Pinnacle on consignment until shipment to the retailer. In
addition, we authorize returns from, or price protection to,
retailers and are obliged to give Pinnacle the corresponding
credit. In a few of our smaller markets, we sell our products
through distributors with whom we have written agreements or
informal arrangements, depending on the business customs of the
territories.

In North America, we have stock-balancing programs for our PC
products, which allow for the exchange of PC products by
resellers under certain circumstances. In all of our major
geographical markets, we accept product returns on our PC
products and we may decide to accept product returns or provide
price protection under certain circumstances for our console
products after we analyze inventory remaining in the channel,
the rate of inventory sell-through in the channel, and our
remaining inventory on hand. It is our policy to exchange
products or give credits, rather than give cash refunds. We
actively monitor and manage the volume of our sales to retailers
and distributors and their inventories as substantial
overstocking in the distribution channel can result in high
returns or the requirement for substantial price protection in
subsequent periods.

The distribution channels through which our games are sold have
been characterized by change, including consolidations and
financial difficulties of certain distributors and retailers.
The bankruptcy or other business difficulties of a distributor
or retailer could render our accounts receivable from such
entity uncollectible, which could have an adverse effect on our
operating results and financial condition. In addition, an
increasing number of companies are competing for access to our
distribution channels. Our arrangements with our distributors
and retailers may be terminated by either party at any time
without cause. Distributors and retailers often carry products
that compete with ours. Retailers of our products typically have
a limited amount of shelf space and promotional resources that
they are willing to devote to the software games category, and
there is intense competition for these resources. There can be
no assurance that distributors and retailers will continue to
purchase our products or provide our products with adequate
levels of shelf space and promotional support.



Inventory and Working Capital

We manage inventories by communicating with our customers prior
to the release of our products, and then using our industry
experience to forecast demand on a product-by-product and
territory-by-territory basis. We then place manufacturing orders
for our products that match this forecasted demand.
Historically, we have experienced high turnover of our products,
and the lead times on re-orders of our products are generally
short, approximately two to three weeks. Further, as discussed
in “Marketing and Distribution” and in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations”, we have practices in
place with our customers (such as stock balancing and price
protection) that reduce product returns.

International Operations

We conduct business and have wholly-owned subsidiaries
throughout the world, including offices in Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, Denmark,
England, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy,
Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal,
Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Taiwan, and Thailand. International net revenue
increased by nine percent to $1.464 billion, or
47 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2005, compared to
$1.347 billion, or 46 percent of total net revenue in
fiscal 2004. Our increase in international net revenue was
primarily driven by sales in Europe and Asia Pacific, including
the benefit of foreign exchange.

We believe that in order to increase our sales in Asia, we will
need to devote significant resources to hire local development
talent and expand our infrastructure, most notably, the
expansion and creation of studio facilities to develop content
locally for each market. In addition, we may establish online
game marketing, publishing and distribution functions in China.
As part of this strategy, we may seek to partner with
established local companies through acquisitions, joint ventures
or other similar arrangements.

The amounts of net revenue and identifiable assets attributable
to each of our geographic regions for each of the last three
fiscal years are set forth in Note 17 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of
this report.

Manufacturing and Suppliers

The suppliers we use to manufacture our games can be
characterized in three types:

•

Manufacturing entities that press our game disks,

•

Entities that print our game instruction booklets, and

•

Entities that package the disks and printed game instruction
    booklets into the jewel cases and boxes for shipping to
    customers.

In many instances, we are able to acquire materials on a
volume-discount basis. We have multiple potential sources of
supply for most materials, except for the disk component of our
PlayStation 2, PSP and Nintendo GameCube disk products, as
discussed in “Significant Relationships”. We also have
alternate sources for the manufacture and assembly of most of
our products. To date, we have not experienced any material
difficulties or delays in production of our software and related
documentation and packaging. However, a shortage of components,
manufacturing delays by Sony or Nintendo, or other factors
beyond our control could impair our ability to manufacture, or
have manufactured, our products.

Backlog

We typically ship orders immediately upon receipt. To the extent
that any backlog may or may not exist at the end of a reporting
period, it would be both coincidental and an unreliable
indicator of future results of any period.

Seasonality

Our business is highly seasonal. We typically experience our
highest revenue and profits in the holiday season quarter ending
in December and a seasonal low in revenue and profits in the
quarter ending in June. Our



results however can vary based on title release dates, consumer
demand for our products and shipment schedules, among other
factors.

Employees

As of March 31, 2005, we employed approximately 6,100
people, of whom over 3,400 were outside the United States. We
believe that our ability to attract and retain qualified
employees is a critical factor in the successful development of
our products and that our future success will depend, in large
measure, on our ability to continue to attract and retain
qualified employees. To date, we have been successful in
recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified
personnel to conduct our business successfully. We believe that
our relationships with our employees are strong. Less than four
percent of our employees, each of whom is employed by one of our
Swedish subsidiaries, are represented by a union, guild or other
collective bargaining organization.

facility in Chertsey, England. In addition to the properties we
own, we lease approximately 2.3 million square feet of
facilities, including our



headquarters in Redwood City, California, our studios in Los
Angeles, California and Orlando, Florida, and our distribution
center in Louisville, Kentucky. Our leased space is summarized

Redwood City, California Headquarters

In February 1995, we entered into a build-to-suit lease with a
third party for our headquarters facility in Redwood City,
California, which was refinanced with Keybank National
Association in July 2001 and expires in July 2006. We accounted
for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 13,

“Accounting for Leases”

, as
amended. Existing campus facilities developed in phase one
comprise a total of 350,000 square feet and provide space
for sales, marketing, administration and research and
development functions. We have an option to purchase the
property (land and facilities) for a maximum of
$145 million or, at the end of the lease, to arrange for
(i) an extension of the lease or (ii) sale of the
property to a third party while we retain an obligation to the
owner for approximately 90 percent of the difference
between the sale price and the guaranteed residual value of up
to $129 million if the sales price is less than this
amount, subject to certain provisions of the lease.

In December 2000, we entered into a second build-to-suit lease
with Keybank National Association for a five and one-half year
term beginning December 2000 to expand our Redwood City,
California headquarters facilities and develop adjacent property
adding approximately 310,000 square feet to our campus.
Construction was completed in June 2002. We accounted for this
arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with
SFAS No. 13, as amended. The facilities provide space
for marketing, sales and research and development. We have an
option to purchase the property for a maximum of
$130 million or, at the end of the lease, to arrange for
(i) an extension of the lease, or (ii) sale of the
property to a third party while we retain an obligation to the
owner for approximately 90 percent of the difference
between the sale price and the guaranteed residual value of up
to $119 million if the sales price is less than this
amount, subject to certain provisions of the lease.

Los Angeles, California and Orlando, Florida Studios;
    Louisville, Kentucky Distribution Center

In July 2003, we entered into a lease agreement with an
independent third party (the “Landlord”) for a studio
facility in Los Angeles, California, which commenced in October
2003 and expires in September 2013 with two five-year options to
extend the lease term. Additionally, we have options to purchase
the property after five and ten years based on the fair market
value of the property at the date of sale, a right of first
offer to purchase the property upon terms offered by the
Landlord, and a right to share in the profits from a sale of the
property. Existing campus facilities comprise a total of
243,000 square feet and provide space for research and
development functions. Our rental obligation under this
agreement is $50 million over the initial ten-year term of
the lease. This commitment is offset by sublease income of
$6 million for the sublet to an affiliate of the Landlord
of 18,000 square feet of the Los Angeles facility, which
commenced in October 2003 and expires in September 2013, with
options of early termination by the affiliate after five years
and by us after four and five years.

In June 2004, we entered into a lease agreement with an
independent third party for a studio facility in Orlando,
Florida, which commenced in January 2005 and expires in June
2010, with one five-year option to extend the lease term. The
campus facilities comprise a total of 117,000 square feet,
which we intend to use for research and development functions.
Our rental obligation over the initial five-and-a-half year term
of the lease is $13 million.

Our North American distribution is supported by a centralized
warehouse facility that we lease in Louisville, Kentucky
occupying 250,000 square feet.



In addition to the properties discussed above, we have other
properties under lease which have been included in our
restructuring costs as discussed in Note 6 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
this report. While we continually evaluate our facility
requirements, we believe that suitable additional or substitute
space will be available as needed to accommodate our future
needs.

Item 3:

Legal Proceedings

On July 29, 2004, a class action lawsuit,

Kirschenbaum v. Electronic Arts Inc.

, was filed
against us in Superior Court in San Mateo, California. The
complaint alleges that we improperly classified “Image
Production Employees” in California as exempt employees and
seeks injunctive relief, unspecified monetary damages, interest
and attorneys’ fees. The complaint was first amended on or
about November 30, 2004 to add two former employees as
named-plaintiffs, and amended again on or about January 5,
2005 to add another former employee as a named-plaintiff. The
allegations in the complaint were not materially changed by the
amendments.

On February 14, 2005, a second employment-related class
action lawsuit,

Hasty v. Electronic Arts Inc.

, was
filed against us in Superior Court in San Mateo,
California. The complaint alleges that we improperly classified
“Engineers” in California as exempt employees and
seeks injunctive relief, unspecified monetary damages, interest
and attorneys’ fees. On or about March 16, 2005, we
received a first amended complaint, which contains the same
material allegations as the original complaint. We answered the
first amended complaint on April 20, 2005.

On March 24, 2005, a purported class action lawsuit was
filed against us and certain of our officers and directors. The
complaint, which asserts claims under Section 10(b) and
20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based on allegedly
false and misleading statements, was filed in the United States
District Court, Northern District of California, by an
individual purporting to represent a class of purchasers of EA
common stock. Additional purported class action lawsuits have
been filed in the same court by other individuals asserting the
same claims against us. We have not yet responded to any of the
complaints. In addition, on April 12, 2005, a shareholder
derivative action was filed against certain of our officers and
directors. This suit asserts claims based on substantially the
same factual allegations set forth in the federal class action
lawsuits. The complaint was filed in San Mateo Superior
Court. On April 13, 2005, a second shareholder derivative
action was filed in San Mateo Superior Court based on the
same claims as the first complaint. On May 16, 2005, a
shareholder derivative action based on substantially the same
allegations was filed in the United States District Court,
Northern District of California. We have not responded to the
shareholder derivative complaints.

In addition, we are subject to other claims and litigation
arising in the ordinary course of business. Our management
considers that any liability from any reasonably foreseeable
disposition of such other claims and litigation, individually or
in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on
our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operation

OVERVIEW

The following overview is a top-level discussion of our
operating results as well as some of the trends and drivers that
affect our business. Management believes that an understanding
of these trends and drivers is important in order to understand
our results for fiscal 2005, as well as our future prospects.
This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it
intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and
analysis provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including in
“Business”, the remainder of “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations”, “Risk Factors” or the consolidated
financial statements and related notes.

About Electronic Arts

We develop, market, publish and distribute interactive software
games that are playable by consumers on home video game consoles
(such as the Sony PlayStation 2, Microsoft Xbox and
Nintendo GameCube consoles), personal computers, mobile
platforms — including hand-held game players (such as
the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS and Sony PSP) and cellular
handsets — and online, over the Internet and other
proprietary online networks. Some of our games are based on
content that we license from others (e.g., Madden NFL Football,
Harry Potter and FIFA Soccer), and some of our games are based
on our own wholly-owned intellectual property (e.g., The Sims
and Need for Speed). Our goal is to develop titles which appeal
to the mass markets, which often means translating and
localizing them for sale in non-English speaking countries. In
addition, we also attempt to create software game
“franchises” that allow us to publish new titles on a
recurring basis that are based on the same property. Examples of
this are the annual iterations of our sports-based franchises
(e.g., NCAA Football and FIFA Soccer), titles based on
long-lived movie properties (e.g., James Bond and Harry Potter)
and wholly-owned properties that can be successfully sequeled
(e.g., The Sims and Need for Speed).

Overview of Financial Results

Total net revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005
was $3.129 billion, up 5.8 percent, as compared to the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. Six franchises sold more
than five million units in the fiscal year ended March 31,
2005: The Sims, Need for Speed, Madden, FIFA, The Lord of the
Rings and Harry Potter. We published three titles each on the
Nintendo DS and the Sony PSP, two new platforms released during
the year ended March 31, 2005. Net revenue on these
platforms increased our net revenue by approximately
$41 million and we expect to continue to develop titles for
both platforms in fiscal 2006.

Net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 was
$504 million, a 12.7 percent decrease as compared to
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 and diluted earnings
per share were $1.59 as compared with $1.87 for the prior year.

We generated $634 million in cash from operations during
the year ended March 31, 2005 as compared to
$669 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004.
The decrease in cash flow was primarily the result of
(1) our overall decline in net income for fiscal 2005,
(2) higher accounts receivable balances due to the timing
of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and
(3) higher cash payments for income taxes. These declines
were partially offset by higher balances in our current
liabilities.

Management’s Overview of Historical and Prospective
    Business Trends

Transition to Next-Generation Consoles.

Our industry is
cyclical and we believe it has entered into a transition stage
heading into the next cycle. Over the course of the next
eighteen months, we expect Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo to
introduce new video game consoles into the market. During this
transition, we intend to continue developing new titles for the
current generation of video game consoles while we also make
significant investments as we prepare to introduce products that
operate on the next-generation consoles. We have and expect to
continue to incur higher costs during this transition to
next-generation consoles. We also expect development costs for
next-generation video games to be greater on a per-title basis
than development costs for current-generation video games. In
addition, sales of video games for current generation consoles
may begin to decline and consumers may defer game software
purchases until the next-generation consoles become



available. While we expect our sales and gross profit to
increase in fiscal 2006, such increases may not offset the
increased costs we have and expect to continue to incur during
the transition. As we move through the transition, we expect our
operating results to be more volatile and difficult to predict,
which could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly.

Increasing Cost of Titles.

Titles have become
increasingly expensive to produce and market as the platforms on
which they are played continue to advance technologically and
consumers demand continual improvements in the overall gameplay
experience. We expect this trend to continue throughout the
transition from current generation to next generation platforms
as (1) we require larger production teams to create our
titles, (2) the technology needed to develop titles becomes
more complex, (3) the number and nature of the platforms
for which we develop titles increases and becomes more diverse,
(4) the cost of licensing the third-party intellectual
property we use in many of our titles increases, and (5) we
develop new methods to distribute our content via the Internet
and on hand-held and wireless devices.

Software Prices.

As current-generation console prices
continue to decrease, we expect more value-oriented consumers to
purchase consoles and software. We experienced this trend
several years ago when prices were reduced on
previous-generation consoles (e.g., Sony PlayStation and
Nintendo 64). As a result of a more value-oriented consumer
base, and a greater number of software titles being published,
we expect average software prices to continue to decline on
current-generation consoles, which may have a negative impact on
our gross margin but not necessarily our gross profit.

Sales of “Hit” Titles.

Sales of “hit”
titles, several of which were top sellers across a number of
international markets, continued to contribute to our revenue
growth. Our top five selling titles across all platforms
worldwide during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 were

Need for Speed Underground 2

,

Madden NFL 2005,
FIFA Soccer 2005, The Sims 2

and

Harry Potter and
the Prisoner of Azkaban.

Hit titles are important to our
financial performance because they benefit from overall
economies of scale. We have developed, and it is our objective
to continue to develop, many of our hit titles to become
franchise titles that can be regularly iterated.

Increased Console Installed Base.

As consumers purchase
the current-generation of consoles, either as a first-time buyer
or by upgrading from a previous generation, the console
installed base increases. As the installed base for a particular
console increases, we generally are able to increase our unit
volume; however, these unit volumes often begin to decrease as
consumers anticipate the release of the next-generation of
consoles. In March 2004, Microsoft reduced the retail price of
its Xbox console in the U.S. and in May 2004 Sony did the same
with its PlayStation 2 console. In August 2004, both
companies also reduced their console retail prices in Europe.
Although these price reductions drove an increase in console
sales in the United States and Europe, hardware shortages during
the holiday season limited the growth of the installed base in
fiscal 2005. Nonetheless, we believe the significant increase in
the installed base for current-generation consoles was a
contributing factor to our total net revenue growth during
fiscal 2005. Provided that the console manufacturers are able to
deliver an adequate supply of consoles, we expect the installed
base of current-generation consoles to increase during fiscal
2006 and unit sales of current-generation titles to remain
strong.

International Operations and Sales Growth.

In fiscal
2005, net revenue from international sales accounted for
approximately 47 percent of our total net revenue, up from
46 percent during fiscal 2004. Our increase in
international net revenue was primarily driven by sales in
Europe and Asia Pacific, including the benefit of foreign
exchange. We anticipate that international net revenue will
continue to increase during fiscal 2006 as the console installed
base continues to expand outside of North America. In
particular, we believe that in order to succeed in China and
Japan, it is important to develop content locally. As such, we
expect to devote resources to hire local development talent and
expand our infrastructure in each country, most notably, the
expansion and creation of local studio facilities. In addition,
we anticipate establishing online game marketing, publishing and
distribution functions in China. As part of this strategy, we
may seek to partner with established local companies through
acquisitions, joint ventures or other similar arrangements.

Foreign Exchange Impact.

Given that a significant portion
of our business is conducted internationally in foreign
currency, fluctuations in currency prices can have a material
impact on our results of operations. For example, the average
exchange rate for the Euro, as compared to the U.S. dollar,
increased from $1.17 per Euro during the twelve months
ended March 31, 2004 to $1.25 per Euro during the
twelve months ended March 31, 2005. As a result of the
fluctuations in currency prices, we had a total foreign exchange
benefit on



net revenue of approximately $95 million during the twelve
months ended March 31, 2005. Although we intend to continue
to utilize foreign exchange forward and option contracts to
either mitigate or hedge against some foreign currency
exposures, we cannot predict the effect foreign currency
fluctuations will have on us during fiscal 2006.

Expansion of Studio Resources and Technology.

In fiscal
2005, we devoted significant resources to the overall expansion
of our studio facilities in North America and Europe. We expect
to continue to make significant investments in our studio
facilities in North America in fiscal 2006. As we move through
the life cycle of current-generation consoles, we will continue
to devote significant resources to the development of
current-generation titles while at the same time we continue to
invest heavily in tools and technologies for the next-generation
of platforms and technology.

Leader in Interactive Sports Entertainment.

We are a
leading developer and publisher of interactive sports
entertainment. We generate a significant portion of our revenue
from sports-related product franchises such as FIFA Soccer,
Madden NFL Football, NCAA Football, Tiger Woods Golf, NASCAR,
NBA Basketball, and NCAA Basketball. We recently have taken a
number of steps to enhance our products in the interactive
sports category by entering into exclusive license agreements
with ESPN, the NFL, PLAYERS, Inc. (the NFL players’
association), Collegiate Licensing Company (NCAA football), and
the Arena Football League. In addition, we have long-standing,
exclusive relationships with various sports organizations and
celebrities, including FIFA (the worldwide soccer governing body
and sponsor of the soccer World Cup), UEFA (the European soccer
governing body and sponsor of the soccer Euro Cup), NASCAR,
Tiger Woods and the PGA TOUR, and, in the future, we may enter
into other exclusive relationships with other sports partners.
While we expect to generate increased revenue as a result of
these agreements, it may not be enough to offset the impact of
the associated costs on our gross profit, which could negatively
affect our gross margin on these products.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial
statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
contingent assets and liabilities, and revenue and expenses
during the reporting periods. The policies discussed below are
considered by management to be critical because they are not
only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and
results of operations but also because application and
interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and
estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown.
As a result, actual results may differ materially from our
estimates.

Revenue Recognition, Sales Returns, Allowances and Bad
    Debt Reserves

We principally derive revenue from sales of packaged interactive
software games designed for play on video game consoles (such as
the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube), PCs and
mobile platforms including hand-held game players (such as the
Nintendo Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS and Sony PSP) and
cellular handsets. We evaluate the recognition of revenue based
on the criteria set forth in Statement of Position
(“SOP”) 97-2,

“Software Revenue
Recognition”

, as amended by SOP 98-9,

“Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions”

and
Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 101,

“Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements”

,
as revised by SAB No. 104,

“Revenue
Recognition”

. We evaluate revenue recognition using the
following basic criteria and recognize revenue when all four
criteria are met:

•

Evidence of an arrangement: We recognize revenue when we have
    evidence of an agreement with the customer reflecting the terms
    and conditions to deliver products.

•

Delivery: Delivery is considered to occur when the products are
    shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer.
    For online games and services, revenue is recognized as the
    service is provided.

•

Fixed or determinable fee: If a portion of the arrangement fee
    is not fixed or determinable, we recognize that amount as
    revenue when the amount becomes fixed or determinable.



•

Collection is deemed probable: At the time of the transaction,
    we conduct a credit review of each customer involved in a
    significant transaction to determine the creditworthiness of the
    customer. Collection is deemed probable if we expect the
    customer to be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as
    those amounts become due. If we determine that collection is not
    probable, we recognize revenue when collection becomes probable
    (generally upon cash collection).

Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been
satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have
a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we
report. For example, for multiple element arrangements, we must
make assumptions and judgments in order to: (1) determine
whether and when each element has been delivered;
(2) determine whether undelivered products or services are
essential to the functionality of the delivered products and
services; (3) determine whether vendor-specific objective
evidence of fair value (“VSOE”) exists for each
undelivered element; and (4) allocate the total price among
the various elements we must deliver. Changes to any of these
assumptions or judgments, or changes to the elements in a
software arrangement, could cause a material increase or
decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular
period.

Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors
(“channel partners”), is recognized when the above
criteria are met. We reduce product revenue for estimated future
returns, price protection, and other offerings, which may occur
with our customers and channel partners. In certain countries,
we have stock-balancing programs for our PC products, which
allow for the exchange of PC products by resellers under certain
circumstances. It is our general practice to exchange products
or give credits, rather than give cash refunds.

In certain countries, from time to time, we decide to provide
price protection for both our PC and video game system products.
In our decision, we analyze historical returns, current
sell-through of distributor and retailer inventory of our
products, current trends in the video game market and the
overall economy, changes in consumer demand and acceptance of
our products and other related factors when evaluating the
adequacy of the sales returns and price protection allowances.
In addition, we monitor the volume of our sales to our channel
partners and their inventories, as substantial overstocking in
the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher
price protection costs in subsequent periods. While historically
actual returns and price protection have not generally exceeded
our reserves, as we have previously publicly stated, in the
quarter ended March 31, 2005 we incurred higher actual
returns and price protection than we had anticipated. We have
reviewed current sell-through information through the date of
this filing and do not intend to accept sales returns or provide
price protection on unsold product in our distribution channels
existing as of March 31, 2005 in amounts in excess of our
March 31, 2005 allowances.

In the future, actual returns and price protections may
materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the
distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer
preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due
to new platforms, product updates or competing products. For
example, the risk of product returns and/or price protection for
our products may increase as the PlayStation 2, Xbox and
Nintendo GameCube consoles move through their lifecycles and an
increasing number and aggregate amount of competitive products
heighten pricing and competitive pressures. While management
believes it can make reliable estimates regarding these matters,
these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our
estimates changed, our returns and price protection reserves
would change, which would impact the total net revenue we
report. For example, if actual returns and/or price protection
were significantly greater than the reserves we have
established, our actual results would decrease our reported
total net revenue. Conversely, if actual returns and/or price
protection were significantly less than our reserves, this would
increase our reported total net revenue.

Significant judgment is required to estimate our allowance for
doubtful accounts in any accounting period. We determine our
allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer
creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends.
Depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial
condition of our customers, the amount and timing of our bad
debt expense and cash collection could change significantly.

Royalties and Licenses

Our royalty expenses consist of payments to (1) content
licensors, (2) independent software developers, and
(3) co-publishing and/or distribution affiliates. License
royalties consist of payments made to celebrities,



professional sports organizations, movie studios and other
organizations for our use of their trademark, copyright,
personal publicity rights, content and/or other intellectual
property. Royalty payments to independent software developers
are payments for the development of intellectual property
related to our games. Co-publishing and distribution royalties
are payments made to third parties for delivery of product.

Royalty-based payments made to content licensors and
distribution affiliates generally are capitalized as prepaid
royalties and expensed to cost of goods sold at the greater of
the contractual or effective royalty rate based on net product
sales. Prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent
software developers and co-publishing affiliates are generally
in connection with the development of a particular product and,
therefore, we are generally subject to development risk prior to
the general release of the product. Accordingly, payments that
are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed
as research and development as the services are incurred.
Payments due after completion of the product (primarily
royalty-based in nature) are generally expensed as cost of goods
sold at the higher of the contractual or effective royalty rate
based on net product sales.

Minimum guaranteed royalty obligations are initially recorded as
an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no
significant performance remains with the licensor. When
significant performance remains with the licensor, we record
royalty payments as an asset when actually paid rather than upon
execution of the contract. Minimum royalty payment obligations
are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty
payments are contractually due within the next twelve months. As
of March 31, 2005 and March 31, 2004, approximately
$51 million and $63 million, respectively, of minimum
guaranteed royalty obligations had been recognized.

Each quarter, we also evaluate the future realization of our
royalty-based assets as well as any unrecognized minimum
commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely
to be realized through product sales. Any impairments determined
before the launch of a product are charged to research and
development expense. Impairments determined post-launch are
charged to cost of goods sold. In either case, we rely on
estimated revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid
royalties. If actual sales or revised revenue estimates fall
below the initial revenue estimate, then the actual charge taken
may be greater in any given quarter than anticipated. As of
March 31, 2005, we had $135 million of royalty-related
assets and $1,483 million of unrecognized minimum
commitments not yet paid that could be impaired if our revenue
estimates change.

Valuation of Long-Lived
Assets

We evaluate both purchased intangible assets and other
long-lived assets in order to determine if events or changes in
circumstances indicate a potential impairment in value exists.
This evaluation requires us to estimate, among other things, the
remaining useful lives of the assets and future cash flows of
the business. These evaluations and estimates require the use of
judgment. Our actual results could differ materially from our
current estimates.

Under current accounting standards, we make judgments about the
recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other
long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate a potential impairment in the remaining value of the
assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. In order to
determine if a potential impairment has occurred, management
makes various assumptions about the future value of the asset by
evaluating future business prospects and estimated cash flows.
Our future net cash flows are primarily dependent on the sale of
products for play on proprietary video game consoles, hand-held
game players and PCs (collectively referred to as
“platforms”). The success of our products is affected
by our ability to accurately predict which platforms and which
products we develop will be successful. Also, our revenue and
earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product
release schedules. Due to product sales shortfalls, we may not
realize the future net cash flows necessary to recover our
long-lived assets, which may result in an impairment charge
being recorded in the future. We did not record any asset
impairment charges in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2004 and 2003,
we recognized less than $1 million and $66 million,
respectively, of asset impairment charges.



Income Taxes

In the ordinary course of our business, there are many
transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax
determination is uncertain. As part of the process of preparing
our consolidated financial statements, we are required to
estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which
we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for
such periods. This process requires estimating both our
geographic mix of income and our current tax exposures in each
jurisdiction where we operate. These estimates involve complex
issues, require extended periods of time to resolve, and require
us to make judgments, such as anticipating the positions that we
will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the
returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities. We
are also required to make determinations of the need to record
deferred tax liabilities and the recoverability of deferred tax
assets. A valuation allowance is established to the extent
recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our
estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction.

In addition, changes in our business, such as acquisitions,
changes in our international structure, changes in the
geographic location of business functions or assets, changes in
the geographic mix of income, as well as changes in, or
termination of, our agreements with tax authorities, valuation
allowances, applicable accounting rules, applicable tax laws and
regulations, rulings and interpretations thereof, developments
in tax audit and other matters, and variations in the estimated
and actual level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall
effective income tax rate for future fiscal years. For example,
in the three months ended March 31, 2004, we resolved
certain tax-related matters with the Internal Revenue Service,
which lowered our income tax expense by approximately
$20 million and resulted in a 2.5 percent rate
reduction for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. By
contrast, adverse developments in audits or applicable law
result in increases in our tax expense. Similarly, we could
experience an increase in our tax expense if we take advantage
of a new election that we are entitled to make under the
U.S. income tax rules regarding the allocation between U.S.
and foreign jurisdictions of tax deductions attributable to
employee stock option compensation.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our fiscal year is reported on a 52/53-week period that,
historically, has ended on the final Saturday of March in each
year. The results of operations for the fiscal years ended
March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 each contain 52 weeks
and ended on March 26, 2005, March 27, 2004 and
March 29, 2003, respectively. For simplicity of
presentation, all fiscal periods are treated as ending on a
calendar month end. Beginning with the fiscal year ending
March 31, 2006, we will end our fiscal year on the Saturday
nearest March 31. As a result, our fiscal 2006 will be
reported as a 53 week year with the first quarter
containing 14 weeks. Although certain amounts presented
have been rounded to the nearest million, corresponding
percentage changes have been calculated on the basis of amounts
rounded to the nearest thousand.

Comparison of Fiscal 2005 to Fiscal 2004

Net Revenue

We principally derive net revenue from sales of packaged
interactive software games designed for play on video game
consoles (such as the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo
GameCube), PCs and mobile platforms which include hand-held game
players (such as the Nintendo Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS and
Sony PSP) and cellular handsets. Additionally, in Europe and
Asia Pacific, we generate a significant portion of net revenue
by marketing and selling third-party interactive software games
through our established distribution network. We also derive net
revenue from selling subscriptions to some of our online games,
programming third-party web sites with our game content,
allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in
conjunction with other products, and selling advertisements on
our online web pages.



From a geographical perspective, our total net revenue for the
fiscal years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 was as follows
(in millions):

North America

For fiscal 2005, net revenue in North America increased by
3.4 percent as compared to fiscal 2004. From a franchise
perspective, the net revenue increase was primarily due to
higher sales of products in our Need for Speed franchise. The
net revenue increase was also driven by sales of titles in our
Fight Night and Burnout franchises, neither of which had
corresponding titles released in the prior fiscal year.
Together, these items resulted in a net revenue increase of
$180 million during the fiscal year ended March 31,
2005 as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004.
This increase was partially offset by lower sales of products in
our Medal of Honor, SSX and Lord of the Rings franchises, which
reduced net revenue by $135 million in the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2005 as compared to the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2004. As part of this overall increase in net
revenue, we benefited from the launch of the Nintendo DS and
Sony PSP in November 2004 and March 2005, respectively.

Europe

For fiscal 2005, net revenue in Europe increased by
8.8 percent as compared to fiscal 2004. We estimate foreign
exchange rates (primarily the Euro and the British pound
sterling) strengthened reported European net revenue by
approximately $86 million, or 7 percent, for the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. Excluding the effect of
foreign exchange rates, we estimate that European net revenue
increased by approximately $18 million, or 2 percent,
for the year ended March 31, 2005. From a franchise
perspective, the net revenue increase was primarily due to
(1) higher sales of products in our Need for Speed and The
Sims franchises, (2) sales of products in our Burnout
franchise which did not have a corresponding title release in
the prior fiscal year and (3) sales of

UEFA Euro

, which was released during the three months ended
June 30, 2004 in conjunction with the UEFA Euro 2004
football tournament held in Europe. Together, these items
resulted in a net revenue increase of $241 million during
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 as compared to the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. This increase was
partially offset by lower sales of products in our Medal of
Honor, Final Fantasy, SSX and Lord of the Rings franchises,
which reduced net revenue by $143 million in the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2005 as compared to the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2004.

Asia Pacific

For fiscal 2005, net revenue from sales in Asia Pacific
increased by 7.6 percent as compared to fiscal 2004. The
increase in net revenue was driven primarily by higher sales of
products in our Need for Speed franchise and sales of products
in our Burnout franchise, which did not have a corresponding
title release in the prior fiscal year, partially offset by
declines in our Medal of Honor franchise. We estimate foreign
exchange rates strengthened reported Asia Pacific net revenue by
approximately $9 million, or 5 percent, for the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2005. Excluding the effect of foreign
exchange rates, we estimate that Asia Pacific net revenue
increased by approximately $4 million, or 3 percent,
for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005.



Our total net revenue by product line for fiscal years 2005 and
2004 was as follows (in millions):

PlayStation 2

Net revenue from PlayStation 2 products increased from
$1,315 million in fiscal 2004 to $1,330 million in
fiscal 2005. As a percentage of total net revenue, sales of
PlayStation 2 products decreased by 1.9 percent in fiscal
2005.

Xbox

Net revenue from Xbox products increased from $384 million
in fiscal 2004 to $516 million in fiscal 2005. As a
percentage of total net revenue, sales of Xbox products
increased by 3.5 percent in fiscal 2005. The increase in
net revenue was primarily due to the continued growth in the
Xbox installed base driven by Microsoft’s price reductions
in the U.S. in March 2004 and in Europe in August 2004, as
well as the overall greater demand for our products.

Nintendo GameCube

Net revenue from Nintendo GameCube products increased from
$200 million in fiscal 2004 to $212 million in fiscal
2005. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth in
the installed base of the Nintendo GameCube.

PC

Net revenue from PC-based products increased from
$470 million in fiscal 2004 to $531 million in fiscal
2005. As a percentage of total net revenue, sales of PC products
increased by 1.1 percent in fiscal 2005. The increase



in PC net revenue was primarily due to higher sales of products
in The Sims, Lord of the Rings and Need for Speed franchises,
partially offset by a decrease in sales of products in our
Command and Conquer and SimCity franchises.

Mobility

Net revenue from mobile products increased from $78 million
in fiscal 2004 to $118 million in fiscal 2005. Mobile
products include all mobile devices such as hand-helds and
cellular handsets. The increase in mobility net revenue was
primarily due to the release of titles in conjunction with the
launch of the Nintendo DS and PSP platforms in North America and
Japan.

Co-Publishing and Distribution

In fiscal 2005, net revenue from co-publishing and distribution
products decreased by $115 million to $283 million as
compared to fiscal 2004. The decrease was primarily due to a
significant decrease in the number of co-publishing and
distribution titles we released in fiscal 2005. We released six
co-publishing titles in fiscal 2005 as compared to 11 titles in
fiscal 2004.

Subscription Services

In fiscal 2005, net revenue from subscription services products
increased by $6 million to $55 million as compared to
fiscal 2004. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to an
increase in the number of paying subscribers to Club Pogo,
partially offset by a decrease in subscription net revenue from

Earth &
Beyond

tm

and

The
Sims

tm

Online subscription services.

Licensing, Advertising and Other

In fiscal 2005, net revenue from licensing, advertising and
other products increased by $41 million to $74 million
as compared to fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to
licensing revenue related to the Nokia N-Gage platform.

Cost of Goods Sold

Cost of goods sold for our disk-based and cartridge-based
products consists of (1) product costs, (2) certain
royalty expenses for celebrities, professional sports and other
organizations and independent software developers,
(3) manufacturing royalties, net of volume discounts,
(4) expenses for defective products, (5) write-offs of
post-launch prepaid royalty costs, (6) amortization of
certain intangible assets, and (7) operations expenses.
Cost of goods sold for our online product subscription business
consists primarily of data center and bandwidth costs associated
with hosting our web sites, credit card fees and royalties for
use of third-party properties. Cost of goods sold for our web
site advertising business primarily consists of ad-serving costs.

In fiscal 2005, cost of goods sold as a percentage of total net
revenue increased 0.9 percent from 37.3 percent to
38.2 percent. As a percentage of total net revenue, the
increase was primarily due to a 2.3 percent increase for:
(1) pricing actions taken in both North America and Europe
due to higher than anticipated channel inventory,
(2) inventory-related costs due to non-recurring rebates
across several titles, and (3) incremental costs incurred
to produce our titles for the Nintendo DS and Sony PSP. In
addition, warranty and online costs increased by
0.8 percent.



Offsetting these increases was a decrease of 2.2 percent,
primarily the result of lower co-publishing and distribution
royalties due to the lower mix of co-publishing and distribution
net revenue during the year ended March 31, 2005 as
compared to the year ended March 31, 2004.

We expect cost of goods sold as a percentage of total net
revenue to remain flat during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal
2005. We expect margin pressure as a result of a decrease in
average selling prices as current-generation platforms mature
and our industry transitions to next-generation technology and
higher license royalty rates. Although there can be no
assurance, and our actual results could differ materially, we
expect this pressure to be essentially offset by lower
manufacturing royalty rates, lower outside development expense
and, to some extent, product mix.

Marketing and Sales

Marketing and sales expenses consist of personnel-related costs

Marketing and sales expenses increased by 5.4 percent, but
remained flat as a percentage of net revenue, in fiscal 2005 as
compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to:

•

An increase of $21 million in headcount and
    facilities-related expenses, both to help support the growth of
    our marketing and sales functions worldwide.

•

An increase of $12 million in marketing-related costs to
    support our fiscal 2005 releases.

The increase in marketing and sales expenses was partially
offset by the following:

•

A decrease of $9 million in advertising expense as compared
    to the prior fiscal year.

•

A decrease of $4 million in bonus expense as compared to
    the prior fiscal year.

Marketing and sales expenses included vendor reimbursements for
advertising expenses of $42 million and $45 million in
fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses consist of personnel and
related expenses of executive and administrative staff, fees for
professional services such as legal and accounting, gains
(losses) on fixed asset disposals, and allowances for bad debts.

•

An increase of $48 million in employee-related costs
    primarily due to (1) charges taken in connection with
    certain employee-related litigation matters and (2) an
    increase in headcount and other personnel-related costs to help
    support our administrative functions worldwide.

•

An increase of $20 million in professional and contracted
    services, such as Sarbanes-Oxley compliance costs, business
    development expenses and legal fees, along with other costs to
    support our business.



The increase in general and administrative expenses was
partially offset by the following:

•

A decrease of $17 million in facilities-related expenses
    primarily due to accelerated depreciation on equipment and
    software that were replaced and due to write-offs of assets that
    were taken out of service in the prior fiscal year.

•

A decrease of $8 million in bonus expense as compared to
    the prior fiscal year.

•

A decrease of $8 million in our investment in strategic
    university relationships.

Research and Development

Research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred
by our production studios for personnel-related costs,
consulting, equipment depreciation and any impairment of prepaid
royalties for pre-launch products. Research and development
expenses for our online business include expenses incurred by
our studios consisting of direct development costs and related
overhead costs in connection with the development and production
of our online games. Research and development expenses also
include expenses associated with development of web site
content, network infrastructure direct expenses, software
licenses and maintenance, and network and management overhead.

Research and development expenses increased by

•

An increase of $103 million in personnel-related costs
    resulting from a 30 percent increase in employee headcount
    primarily in our Canadian and European studios, which included
    $6 million of stock-based employee compensation related to
    our acquisition of Criterion Software Group Ltd
    (“Criterion”). These increases were partially offset
    by a $20 million reduction in bonus expense as compared to
    the prior fiscal year.

•

An increase of $19 million in external development expenses
    due to the development of new products with our co-publishing
    partners and development costs for Renderware and mobile
    platforms.

•

An increase of $18 million in facilities-related expenses
    to help support the growth of our research and development
    functions worldwide.

We expect research and development spending to continue to
increase in total dollars and as a percentage of net revenue in
fiscal 2006 as we continue to invest in next-generation tools
and technologies, products for new platforms, and, to a lesser
extent, as we increase spending on titles for the PC and
current-generation console products.

Our effective income tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from
significant operations outside the U.S., which are generally
taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate of
35 percent. The effective income tax rate was
30.5 percent for fiscal 2005 and 27.5 percent for
fiscal 2004. Our increased effective income tax rate in fiscal
2005 primarily reflects the fact that we resolved certain
tax-related matters with the Internal Revenue Service during
fiscal 2004, which lowered our fiscal 2004 income tax expense by
approximately $20 million and resulted in a
2.5 percent rate reduction. Additionally, adjustments
related to certain tax audit developments, a change in valuation
allowance, and non-deductible acquisition-related costs,
partially offset by the geographic mix of taxable income subject
to lower tax rates for fiscal 2005, increased our effective
income tax rate in fiscal 2005.

We currently intend to indefinitely reinvest our accumulated
foreign earnings outside the United States, and, accordingly,
have not provided for U.S. taxes that would be incurred if
such earnings were repatriated back to the
U.S. Undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries
amounted to approximately $896 million as of March 31,
2005.

Our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2006 and future
periods will depend on a variety of factors. For example,
changes in our business, including acquisitions, changes in our
international structure, changes in the geographic location of
business functions or assets, changes in the geographic mix of
income, as well as changes in, or termination of, our agreements
with tax authorities, valuation allowances, applicable
accounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, rulings
and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audit and other
matters, and variations in the estimated and actual level of
annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective income
tax rate for future fiscal years. In addition, we may incur
additional tax expense to the extent we undertake certain
international restructurings that we are considering.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Jobs
Act”), enacted on October 22, 2004, provides for a
temporary 85 percent dividends received deduction on
certain foreign earnings repatriated in fiscal 2005 or fiscal
2006. The deduction would result in an approximate
5.25 percent federal tax on a portion of the foreign
earnings repatriated. State, local and foreign taxes could apply
as well. To qualify for this federal tax deduction, the earnings
must be reinvested in the United States pursuant to a domestic
reinvestment plan established by our chief executive officer and
approved by the Board of Directors. Certain other criteria in
the Jobs Act must be satisfied as well. The maximum amount of
our foreign earnings that we may repatriate subject to the Jobs
Act deduction is $500 million.

We historically have considered undistributed earnings of our
foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and,
accordingly, no U.S. taxes have been provided thereon. As a
result of the Jobs Act, we are in the process



of evaluating whether we will change our intentions regarding a
portion of our foreign earnings and take advantage of the
repatriation provisions of the Jobs Act, and if so, the amount
that we would repatriate. We may not take advantage of the new
law at all. In addition to not having made a decision to
repatriate any foreign earnings, we are not yet in a position to
accurately determine the impact of a qualifying repatriation,
should we choose to make one, on our income tax expense for
fiscal 2006. If we decide to repatriate a portion of our foreign
earnings, we would be required to recognize income tax expense
related to the federal, state, local and foreign taxes that we
would incur on the repatriated earnings when the decision is
made. We estimate that the reasonably possible amount of the
income tax expense could be up to $35 million. We expect to
be in a position to finalize our analysis no later than February
2006.

North America

For fiscal 2004, net revenue in North America increased by
12.1 percent as compared to fiscal 2003. From a franchise
perspective, the net revenue increase was primarily driven by
higher sales of products released during the year ended
March 31, 2004 in the following eight franchises: Need for
Speed, NBA STREET, NFL STREET, Madden NFL, Def Jam, SSX, Tiger
Woods/ PGA TOUR and MVP Baseball. Increased sales in these
franchises resulted in an increase in net revenue of
$353 million for the year ended March 31, 2004 as
compared to the year ended March 31, 2003. Increases in net
revenue from these franchises were partially offset by
(1) a decrease in our Harry Potter franchise, as the fiscal
2004 title,

Harry Potter

tm

:

Quidditch

tm

World Cup

, had no associated movie release, while our
fiscal 2003 product,

Harry Potter and the Chamber of
Secrets,

was released in conjunction with the blockbuster
movie of the same title, (2) the termination of our Square
EA joint venture agreement, and (3) a decrease in net
revenue in our Bond franchise as a result of the timing of the
release of

James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing

(on all
platforms except the Game Boy Advance) in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004, as compared to the strong sales of

James Bond
007: NIGHTFIRE,

which was released in the third quarter of
fiscal 2003. Together, lower sales in these franchises



reduced net revenue by $177 million for the year ended
March 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended March 31,
2003.

Europe

For fiscal 2004, net revenue in Europe increased by
34.3 percent as compared to fiscal 2003. We estimate
foreign exchange rates (primarily the Euro and the British pound
sterling) strengthened reported European net revenue by
approximately $136 million or 15 percent for the year
ended March 31, 2004. From a franchise perspective, the net
revenue increase was primarily driven by higher sales of
products released during the year ended March 31, 2004 in
the following eleven franchises: Need for Speed, The Sims, FIFA
Soccer, Lord of the Rings, Medal of Honor, Final Fantasy, SSX,
Football Manager, Freedom Fighters, Tiger Woods/ PGA TOUR and
Rugby. Increased sales in these franchises resulted in an
increase in net revenue of $373 million for the year ended
March 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended March 31,
2003. The increase was partially offset by (1) a decrease
in our Harry Potter franchise, as the fiscal 2004 title,

Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup,

had no associated
movie release, while our fiscal 2003 product,

Harry Potter
and the Chamber of Secrets,

was released in conjunction with
the blockbuster movie of the same title, and (2) an
expected decrease in sales of our World Cup franchise due to
strong sales in the year ended March 31, 2003 in
conjunction with the World Cup event and no similar event in the
year ended March 31, 2004. Together, the two items noted
above, reduced net revenue by $92 million for the year
ended March 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended
March 31, 2003.

Asia Pacific

For fiscal 2004, net revenue from sales in our Asia Pacific
region remained flat as compared to fiscal 2003. Although there
were net revenue increases from our Need for Speed,

The
Sims and other franchises, these increases were offset by
declines in the sales of products in our Harry Potter, World Cup
and Final Fantasy franchises. We estimate foreign exchange rates
strengthened reported Asia Pacific net revenue by approximately
$21 million or 12.4 percent, for the year ended
March 31, 2004. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange
rates, we estimate that Asia Pacific net revenue decreased by
approximately $21 million or 12.6 percent, for the
year ended March 31, 2004.



Our net revenue by product line for fiscal years 2004 and 2003
is as follows (in millions):

PlayStation 2

Net revenue from PlayStation 2 products increased from
$911 million in fiscal 2003 to $1,315 million in
fiscal 2004. As a percentage of total net revenue, sales of
PlayStation 2 products increased by 7.7 percent in fiscal
2004. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth in
the installed base and greater demand for our products.

Xbox

Net revenue from Xbox products increased from $219 million
in fiscal 2003 to $384 million in fiscal 2004. As a
percentage of total net revenue, sales of Xbox products
increased by 4.2 percent in fiscal 2004. The increase in
net revenue was primarily due to growth in the installed base
and greater demand for our products.

Nintendo GameCube

Net revenue from Nintendo GameCube products increased from
$177 million in fiscal 2003 to $200 million in fiscal
2004. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth in
the installed base of the Nintendo GameCube.

Other consoles

In fiscal 2004, net revenue from Other consoles, primarily the
PlayStation, decreased by $70 million to $30 million
as compared to fiscal 2003. We anticipated the decline in net
revenue from PlayStation products as we continued to transition
away from that platform.



PC

Net revenue from PC-based products decreased from
$499 million in fiscal 2003 to $470 million in fiscal
2004. As a percentage of total net revenue, sales of PC products
decreased by 4.3 percent in fiscal 2004. PC net revenue
declined, largely due to declines of sales in the Harry Potter,
World Cup and Bond franchises as discussed above, which were
partially offset by an increase in sales of the Lord of the
Rings franchise.

Mobility

Net revenue from mobile products decreased from
$105 million in fiscal 2003 to $78 million in fiscal
2004. The decrease in mobility was primarily due to the expected
decline in our Game Boy Color net revenue as we transitioned
away from that platform.

Co-Publishing and Distribution

In fiscal 2004, net revenue from co-publishing and distribution
products increased by $22 million to $398 million as
compared to fiscal 2003. The increase was due to a
$75 million increase in Europe primarily from increased
sales in the Final Fantasy, Freedom Fighters and Battlefield
franchises, partially offset by a decline in the Kingdom Hearts
franchise in North America. Although co-publishing and
distribution net revenue increased, it declined as a percentage
of total net revenue.

Subscription Services

In fiscal 2004, net revenue from subscription services products
increased by $4 million to $49 million as compared to
fiscal 2003. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to
the number of subscribers to Club Pogo (launched in July
2003) and purchasers of Pogo Downloadables (launched in May
2003), partially offset by a decrease in subscription net
revenue from

The
Sims

tm

Online

,

Ultima
Online

tm

,
and

Earth & Beyond

tm

subscription services.

Licensing, Advertising and Other

In fiscal 2004, net revenue from licensing, advertising and
other products decreased by $17 million to $33 million
as compared to fiscal 2003. The decrease was a result of
expected declines in our advertising and programming net revenue
following our renegotiation of the terms of our relationship
with AOL during the three months ended June 30, 2003.

Operations by Segment

In March 2003, we consolidated the operations of the EA.com
business segment into our core business because we began to
consider online capability and gameplay as integral to our
existing and future products. Accordingly, beginning
April 1, 2003, we no longer managed our online products and
services as a separate business segment, and we consolidated the
reporting related to our online products and services into
reporting for the overall development and publication of our
core products for all reporting periods ending after that date.
This change better reflected the way in which our Chief
Executive Officer (our chief operating decision maker) reviews
and manages our business and reflects the importance of our
online products and services relative to the rest of our
business. Concurrently, we eliminated separate reporting for our
Class B common stock for all reporting periods ending after
April 1, 2003. Fiscal 2003 has been restated to conform
with fiscal 2004 presentation. See Note 6 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of
this report.

Our view and reporting of business segments may change due to
changes in underlying business facts and circumstances and the
evolution of our reporting to our Chief Executive Officer.

In fiscal 2004, cost of goods sold as a percentage of net
revenue decreased by 5.9 percentage points to
37.3 percent, from 43.2 percent for fiscal 2003,
primarily due to a 3.3 percent decrease in product costs
and a 2.8 percent decrease in royalty rates.

The 3.3 percent decrease in product costs was primarily a
result of:

•

Lower co-publishing and distribution product costs, as a
    percentage of net revenue, due to a higher mix of co-publishing
    titles relative to distribution titles in fiscal 2004.
    Co-publishing titles generally have higher gross margins than
    distribution titles. Lower co-publishing and distribution costs,
    as a percentage of net revenue, increased total gross margin by
    1.6 percent in fiscal 2004.

•

Lower average manufacturing costs increased total gross margin
    by 1.0 percent in fiscal 2004.

•

Lower period costs primarily due to improved inventory
    management in North America. Lower period costs increased total
    gross margin by 0.5 percent in fiscal 2004.

The 2.8 percent decrease in royalty rates was primarily the
result of:

•

Decreased third-party development royalties primarily due to a
    higher mix of titles developed internally rather than externally
    in fiscal 2004. Significant titles that were developed
    internally in fiscal 2004 for which a comparable title had been
    developed externally in fiscal 2003 included

James Bond 007:
    Everything or Nothing

and

The Lord of the Rings; The
    Return of the King.

We estimate that lower development
    royalties increased gross margin by 1.9 percent, which was
    spread across multiple platforms.

•

Lower license royalties, as a percentage of net revenue, as

Need for Speed Underground

, our highest grossing title of
    fiscal 2004, had a significantly lower license royalty rate than

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

, our highest
    grossing title of fiscal 2003. Lower license royalties, as a
    percentage of net revenue, increased total gross margin by
    1.1 percent in fiscal 2004.

Marketing and Sales

In fiscal 2003, marketing and sales expense included the

    increased our advertising campaigns to support the release of
    new titles.

•

A 13.6 percent increase in average headcount to further
    support the growth of our marketing and sales functions
    worldwide, which resulted in an increase to personnel-related
    costs of approximately $17 million.

The increase in marketing and sales expenses was partially
offset by the discontinuance of carriage fee payments to AOL,
which resulted in a decrease of $18 million.



As a percentage of net revenue, marketing and sales expenses
declined from 13.4 percent in fiscal 2003 to
12.5 percent in fiscal 2004. Marketing and sales expenses
included vendor reimbursements for advertising expenses of

    headcount.

•

An overall increase in external development expenses of

The increase in research and development expenses was partially
offset by a decrease in depreciation and other operating
expenses due to asset impairments recognized in the third and

Fiscal 2004 Studio Restructuring

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we closed the majority
of our leased studio facility in Walnut Creek, California and
our entire owned studio facility in Austin, Texas in order to
consolidate local development efforts in Redwood City,
California. We recorded total pre-tax charges of
$9 million, consisting of $7 million for consolidation
of facilities (net of expected future sublease income),
$2 million for workforce reductions of approximately 117
personnel and less than $1 million for the write-off of
non-current assets, primarily leasehold improvements.

Fiscal 2003 Studio Restructuring

During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we closed our office
located in San Francisco, California and our studio located
in Seattle, Washington in order to consolidate local development
efforts in Redwood City, California and Vancouver, British
Columbia, Canada. We recorded total pre-tax charges of
$9 million, consisting of $7 million for consolidation
of facilities (net of expected future sublease income),
$1 million for the write-off of non-current assets,
primarily leasehold improvements, and $1 million for
workforce reductions of approximately 33 personnel.

Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we
approved a plan to consolidate the Los Angeles, California,
Irvine, California and Las Vegas, Nevada, studios into one major
game studio in Los Angeles. We recorded a total pre-tax
restructuring charge of $5 million, including
$2 million for the shutdown of facilities and associated
costs, $2 million for the write-off of non-current assets,
primarily leasehold improvements and $1 million for
workforce reductions.

Fiscal 2003 Online Restructuring

In March 2003, we consolidated the operations of EA.com into our
core business, and eliminated separate reporting for our
Class B common stock for all future reporting periods after
fiscal 2003. We recorded restructuring charges, including asset
impairment, of $67 million, consisting of $2 million
for workforce reductions of approximately 50 personnel,
$2 million for consolidation of facilities and
$63 million for the write-off of non-current assets. The
consolidation of facilities resulted in the closure of
EA.com’s Chicago and Virginia facilities and an adjustment
for the closure of EA.com’s San Diego studio in fiscal
2002.

As part of the restructuring efforts, we performed impairment
tests under SFAS No. 144,

“Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”

, to
evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets and
remaining finite-lived identifiable intangible assets utilized
in the EA.com business. This test was performed in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003 in conjunction with the overall valuation
of the EA.com legal entity and its Class B common stock. As
of March 31, 2003, the unit sales and the number of
subscribers for

The Sims Online,

our flagship EA.com
product, and overall EA.com performance were significantly below
our expectations, which we considered to be a triggering event
under SFAS No. 144. These results caused us to cancel
most of our plans to develop similar online products that would
have utilized the long-lived assets associated with the EA.com
business. Impairment charges on long-lived assets amounted to
$63 million and included $25 million relating to
impaired customized internal-use software systems for the EA.com
infrastructure, $26 million for other long-lived assets and
$12 million of finite-lived intangibles impairment charges
relating to EA.com’s acquisitions of Kesmai Corporation and
Pogo Corporation.



Fiscal 2002 Online Restructuring

In October 2001, we announced restructuring initiatives
involving EA.com and the closure of EA.com’s San Diego
studio and consolidation of our San Francisco and Virginia
facilities. As a result, we recorded restructuring charges of
$20 million, consisting of $4 million for workforce
reductions, $3 million for consolidation of facilities and
other administrative charges and $13 million for the
write-off of non-current assets and facilities.

All restructuring charges recorded prior to December 31,
2002 were recorded in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) No. 94-3,

“Liability Recognition
for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to
Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring)

”, EITF No. 95-03,

“Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a
Purchase Business Combination”

, and
SAB No. 100,

“Restructuring and Impairment
Charges”

. All restructuring charges recorded subsequent
to December 31, 2002, were recorded in accordance with
SFAS No. 146,

“Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities”

. Adjustments to the
restructuring reserves will be made in future periods, if
necessary, based upon the then-current events and circumstances.

The following table reflects our unaudited pro forma
consolidated basic earnings per share for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2003 as if the consolidation of the operations of
our EA.com business segment into our core business had occurred
at the beginning of the period (in millions, except per share
data):

Interest and other income, net, in fiscal 2004 increased from

•

Interest income increased by $8 million in fiscal 2004 as a
    result of higher average cash balances in that year.

•

During the year ended March 31, 2003, we recorded
    $11 million for other-than-temporary impairments of
    investments in affiliates, offset by income of $5 million

fiscal 2003. The reduced effective income tax rate in fiscal
2004 primarily reflected the resolution of certain tax-related
matters with the Internal Revenue Service in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2004, which lowered our income tax expense by
$20 million and resulted in a 2.5 percent rate
reduction, and also reflected a change in the geographic mix of
taxable income subject to lower tax rates.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) ratified the other-than-temporary impairment
measurement and recognition guidance and certain disclosure
requirements for impaired securities as described in EITF Issue
No. 03-1,

“The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments”

.
In September 2004, the FASB issued a proposed Staff Position
(“FSP”) EITF Issue No. 03-1-a,

“Implementation Guidance for the Application of
Paragraph 16 of EITF 03-1

”. The proposed FSP
will provide measurement and recognition guidance with respect
to debt securities that are impaired solely due to interest
rates and/or sector spreads. In October 2004, the FASB delayed
the effective date for the other-than-temporary impairment
measurement and recognition guidance contained in
paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue No. 03-1 until FSP
Issue No. 03-1-a is issued. However, this delay does not
suspend the requirement to recognize other-than-temporary
impairments as required by existing authoritative literature;
nor does it delay the required disclosures about unrealized
losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary
impairments in paragraphs 21-22 of EITF Issue
No. 03-1. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. Management is unable to determine what
impact the adoption of the measurement and recognition guidance
in EITF Issue No. 03-1 will have on our consolidated
financial statements.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,

“Inventory Costs — an amendment of ARB
No. 43, Chapter 4”

. SFAS No. 151
amends the guidance in Accounting Research Bulletin
(“ARB”) No. 43, Chapter 4,

“Inventory Pricing”

, to clarify the accounting
for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling
costs, and wasted material (spoilage) and requires that
those items be recognized as current-period charges.
SFAS No. 151 also requires that allocation of fixed
production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the
normal capacity of the production facilities.
SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred
during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005.
Management believes the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will
not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,

“Exchange of Non-monetary Assets — an
amendment of APB Opinion No. 29”

.
SFAS No. 153 amends Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) No. 29,

“Accounting



for Non-monetary Transactions”

, to eliminate the
exception for non-monetary exchanges of similar productive
assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of
non-monetary assets that do not have commercial substance.
SFAS No. 153 is effective for non-monetary exchanges
occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005.
Management believes the adoption of SFAS No. 153 will
not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123
(revised 2004) (“SFAS No. 123R”),

“Share-Based Payment”

. SFAS No. 123R
requires that the cost resulting from all share-based payment
transactions be recognized in financial statements using a
fair-value-based method. The statement replaces
SFAS No. 123, supersedes APB No. 25, and amends
SFAS No. 95,

“Statement of Cash
Flows”

. While the fair value method under
SFAS No. 123R is very similar to the fair value method
under SFAS No. 123 with regards to measurement and
recognition of stock-based compensation, management is currently
evaluating the impact of several of the key differences between
the two standards on our consolidated financial statements. For
example, SFAS No. 123 permits us to recognize
forfeitures as they occur while SFAS No. 123R will
require us to estimate future forfeitures and adjust our
estimate on a quarterly basis. SFAS No. 123R also will
require a classification change in the statement of cash flows,
whereby a portion of the tax benefit from stock options will
move from operating cash flow activities to financing cash flow
activities (total cash flows will remain unchanged).

In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) released SAB No. 107,

“Share-based Payment”

, which provides the views
of the staff regarding the interaction between
SFAS No. 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations
for public companies. In April 2005, the SEC adopted a rule that
amends the compliance dates of SFAS No. 123R. Under
the revised compliance dates, we will be required to adopt the
provisions of SFAS No. 123R no later than the first
interim period of fiscal 2007. While management continues to
evaluate the impact of SFAS No. 123R on our
consolidated financial statements, we currently believe that the
expensing of stock-based compensation will have an impact on our
Consolidated Statements of Operations similar to our pro forma
disclosure under SFAS No. 123, as amended.

Changes in Cash Flow

During the year ended March 31, 2005, we generated
$634 million of cash from operating activities as compared
to $669 million for the year ended March 31, 2004.
This decline was primarily the result of (1) our



overall decline in net income for fiscal 2005, (2) higher
accounts receivable balances due to the timing of sales in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and (3) higher cash payments
for income taxes. These declines were partially offset by higher
balances in our current liabilities. We expect to continue to
generate significant operating cash flow in fiscal 2006. For the
year ended March 31, 2005, our primary use of cash in
non-operating activities consisted of net purchases of
$1,446 million in short-term investments, $126 million
in capital expenditures, primarily related to the expansions of
our Los Angeles and Vancouver studios as well as upgrades to our
worldwide ERP systems, $90 million for our purchase of a
19.9 percent investment in Ubisoft, $81 million for
our acquisitions of 100 percent of Criterion and an
additional 44 percent of DICE, and $41 million towards
the repurchase and retirement of our common stock. These
non-operating expenditures were partially offset by
$241 million in proceeds from the sale of our common stock
through stock plans and $16 million in proceeds from the
sale of property during the year ended March 31, 2005. We
anticipate making continued capital investments in our Vancouver
studio during fiscal 2006 as well as completing the remaining
$709 million of our $750 million share repurchase
program by September 30, 2005.

Short-term investments and marketable equity
    securities

The composition of our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments changed from primarily cash equivalents,
which were $1.991 billion as of March 31, 2004, to
primarily short-term investments, which were $1.688 billion
as of March 31, 2005 and, therefore, our portfolio is more
susceptible to changes in short-term interest rates. As of
March 31, 2005, our short-term investments had gross
unrealized losses of approximately $22 million or
1.3 percent of the total in short-term investments. From
time-to-time, we may liquidate some or all of our short-term
investments to fund operational needs or other activities, such
as capital expenditures, business acquisitions, or stock
repurchase programs. Depending on the short-term investments
that we liquidate to fund these activities, we could recognize a
portion of the gross unrealized losses.

Marketable equity securities increased to $140 million as
of March 31, 2005, from $1 million as of
March 31, 2004, primarily due to our purchase of a 19.9
percent investment in Ubisoft Entertainment.

Receivables, net

Our gross accounts receivable balance was $458 million and
$367 million as of March 31, 2005 and March 31,
2004, respectively. The increase in our accounts receivable
balance was primarily due to an increase in our fourth quarter
gross sales (prior to reserve adjustments) versus the prior year
and the timing of those sales, which occurred later in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 than in the prior year. We expect
to collect a substantial portion of these amounts in the three
months ended June 30, 2005. Reserves for sales returns,
pricing allowances and doubtful accounts increased from
$155 million as of March 31, 2004 to $162 million
as of March 31, 2005. Both the sales return and price
protection reserves increased in absolute dollars and as a
percentage of trailing six month net revenue and remained
relatively flat as a percentage of trailing nine month net
revenue as of March 31, 2005. We believe these reserves are
adequate based on historical experience and our current estimate
of potential returns and allowances.

Inventories

Inventories increased to $62 million as of March 31,
2005 from $55 million as of March 31, 2004 primarily
due to overall growth in Europe. We typically have a higher
inventory balance, as a percentage of net revenue, on hand in
Europe than in North America, due to the need to provide
multiple language versions of each title in that region. No
single title represented more than $4 million of inventory
as of March 31, 2005.

Other current assets

Other current assets increased to $164 million as of
March 31, 2005, from $163 million as of March 31,
2004, primarily due to the amortization of certain prepaid
amounts and collections of advertising credits owed to us by our
suppliers offset by higher prepaid royalties as we continue to
invest in our product development.



Accounts payable

Accounts payable increased to $134 million as of
March 31, 2005, from $114 million as of March 31,
2004, primarily due to higher gross sales volumes and an
extension of payment terms with our vendors in fiscal 2005.

Accrued and other liabilities

Our accrued and other liabilities increased to $694 million
as of March 31, 2005 from $630 million as of
March 31, 2004. The increase was due to increases in income
taxes payable, accruals for pending litigation and increases to
our deferred rent and deferred revenue, offset by a decrease in
royalties payable and accrued payroll and related expenses. We
anticipate our accrued and other liabilities balance will
decline following our bonus payments during the three months
ended June 30, 2005.

Financial Condition

We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term
investments, marketable equity securities and cash generated
from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating
requirements for at least the next twelve months, including
working capital requirements, capital expenditures, potential
future acquisitions or strategic investments, and funding of our
stock repurchase program. We may choose at any time to raise
additional capital to strengthen our financial position,
facilitate expansion, pursue strategic investments or to take
advantage of business opportunities as they arise. There can be
no guarantee that such additional capital will be available to
us on favorable terms, if at all, or that it will not result in
substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.

Our two lease agreements with Keybank National Association,
described in the “Off-Balance Sheet Commitments”
section below, are scheduled to expire in June 2006 and July
2006. We currently are evaluating whether to extend the leases,
purchase the properties under lease, or identify a third party
buyer for the properties when the leases expire. Should we
choose to renew the leases, we would not expect a material
change in our lease payments from the amounts under the current
lease agreements. Should we choose to purchase the properties,
we could incur a cash outflow of at least $200 million. We
have not yet determined the course of action that we will take.

A portion of our cash that was generated from operations
domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions (approximately
$987 million as of March 31, 2005) is designated as
indefinitely reinvested in the respective tax jurisdiction.
While we have no plans to repatriate these funds to the United
States in the short-term, if we were required to do so in order
to fund our operations in the United States, we would accrue and
pay additional taxes in connection with their repatriation. We
are in the process of evaluating whether we will repatriate
foreign earnings under the repatriation provisions of the Jobs
Act.

On October 18, 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a
program to repurchase up to an aggregate of $750 million of
shares of our common stock. Pursuant to the authorization, we
may repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in
the open market or through privately negotiated transactions
over the course of a twelve-month period. During the year ended
March 31, 2005, we repurchased and retired
805,500 shares of our common stock for approximately
$41 million.

We have a “shelf” registration statement on
Form S-3 on file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. This shelf registration statement, which includes a
base prospectus, allows us at any time to offer any combination
of securities described in the prospectus in one or more
offerings up to a total amount of $2.0 billion. Unless
otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the
base prospectus, we will use the net proceeds from the sale of
any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration
statement for general corporate purposes, including for working
capital, financing capital expenditures, research and
development, marketing and distribution efforts and, if
opportunities arise, for acquisitions or strategic alliances.
Pending such uses, we may invest the net proceeds in
interest-bearing securities. In addition, we may conduct
concurrent or other financings at any time.

Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected
by various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited
to, those related to customer demand and acceptance of our
titles on new platforms and new



versions of our titles on existing platforms, our ability to
collect our accounts receivable as they become due, successfully
achieving our product release schedules and attaining our
forecasted sales objectives, the impact of competition, the
economic conditions in the domestic and international markets,
seasonality in operating results, risks of product returns and
the other risks described in the “Risk Factors”
section below.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments

Letters of Credit

In July 2002, we provided an irrevocable standby letter of
credit to Nintendo of Europe. The standby letter of credit
guarantees performance of our obligations to pay Nintendo of
Europe for trade payables of up to

€

18 million.
The standby letter of credit expires in July 2005. As of
March 31, 2005, we had

€

0.5 million
payable to Nintendo of Europe covered by this standby letter of
credit.

In August 2003, we provided an irrevocable standby letter of
credit to 300 California Associates II, LLC in replacement
of our security deposit for office space. The standby letter of
credit guarantees performance of our obligations to pay our
lease commitment up to approximately $1 million. The
standby letter of credit expires in December 2006. As of
March 31, 2005, we did not have a payable balance on this
standby letter of credit.

Development, Celebrity, League and Content Licenses:
    Payments and Commitments

The products produced by our studios are designed and created by
our employee designers, artists, software programmers and by
non-employee software developers (“independent
artists” or “third-party developers”). We
typically advance development funds to the independent artists
and third-party developers during development of our games,
usually in installment payments made upon the completion of
specified development milestones. Contractually, these payments
are considered advances against subsequent royalties on the
sales of the products. These terms are set forth in written
agreements entered into with the independent artists and
third-party developers. In addition, we have certain celebrity,
league and content license contracts that contain minimum
guarantee payments and marketing commitments that are not
dependent on any deliverables. Celebrities and organizations
with whom we have contracts include: ESPN (content in EA SPORTS
games); FIFA and UEFA (professional soccer); NASCAR (stock car
racing); John Madden (professional football); National
Basketball Association (professional basketball); PGA TOUR
(professional golf); Tiger Woods (professional golf); National
Hockey League and NHLPA (professional hockey); Warner Bros.
(Harry Potter, Batman and Superman); MGM/ Danjaq (James Bond);
New Line Productions (The Lord of the Rings); National Football
League, Arena Football League and PLAYERS Inc. (professional
football); Collegiate Licensing Company (collegiate football and
basketball); ISC (stock car racing); Island Def Jam (fighting);
and Viacom Consumer Products (The Godfather). These developer
and content license commitments represent the sum of
(i) the cash payments due under non-royalty-bearing
licenses and services agreements, and (ii) the minimum
payments and advances against royalties due under
royalty-bearing licenses and services agreements, the majority
of which are conditional upon performance by the counterparty.
These minimum guarantee payments and any related marketing
commitments are included in the table below.



The following table summarizes our minimum contractual
obligations and commercial commitments as of March 31,
2005, and the effect we expect them to have on our liquidity and
cash flow in future periods (in millions):

(1)

See discussion on operating leases in the “Off-Balance
    Sheet Commitments” section herein and Note 9 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in
    Item 8 of this report, for additional information.

(2)

Developer/licensor commitments include $50 million of
    commitments to developers or licensors that have been included
    in both current and long-term assets and liabilities in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2005 because
    the developer or licensor does not have any performance
    obligations to us. In addition, our developer/licensor and
    marketing commitments increased significantly in the latter half
    of fiscal 2005 primarily as a result of agreements we renewed
    with the National Football League and PLAYERS Inc., as well as
    an exclusive, long-term agreement we entered into with ESPN Inc.
    (“ESPN”) for the development and integrated marketing
    of ESPN content in EA SPORTS games beginning in calendar 2006.
    While our commitments with ESPN are not contractually due until
    fiscal 2011 and beyond and are presented as such in the table
    above, we anticipate paying these commitments earlier as we
    publish titles associated with the agreement.

The lease commitments disclosed above exclude commitments
included in our restructuring activities for contractual rental
commitments of $23 million under real estate leases for
unutilized office space, offset by $13 million of estimated
future sub-lease income. These amounts were expensed in the
periods of the related restructuring and are included in our
accrued and other liabilities reported on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2005. See Note 6 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in
Item 8 of this report, for additional information.

Transactions with Related Parties

On June 24, 2002, we hired Warren Jenson as our Chief
Financial and Administrative Officer and agreed to loan him
$4,000,000, to be forgiven over four years based on his
continuing employment. The loan does not bear interest. On
June 24, 2004, pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement,
we forgave two million dollars of the loan and provided
Mr. Jenson approximately $1.6 million to offset the
tax implications of the forgiveness. As of March 31, 2005,
the remaining outstanding loan balance was $2,000,000, which
will be forgiven on June 24, 2006, provided that
Mr. Jenson has not voluntarily resigned his employment with
us or been terminated for cause prior to that time. No
additional funds will be provided to offset the tax implications
of the forgiveness of the remaining two million dollars.



OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS

Lease Commitments

We lease certain of our current facilities and certain equipment
under non-cancelable operating lease agreements. We are required
to pay property taxes, insurance and normal maintenance costs
for certain of our facilities and will be required to pay any
increases over the base year of these expenses on the remainder
of our facilities.

In February 1995, we entered into a build-to-suit lease with a
third party for our headquarters facility in Redwood City,
California, which was refinanced with Keybank National
Association in July 2001 and expires in July 2006. We accounted
for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with
SFAS No. 13,

“Accounting for Leases”

,
as amended. Existing campus facilities developed in phase one
comprise a total of 350,000 square feet and provide space
for sales, marketing, administration and research and
development functions. We have an option to purchase the
property (land and facilities) for a maximum of
$145 million or, at the end of the lease, to arrange for
(i) an extension of the lease or (ii) sale of the
property to a third party while we retain an obligation to the
owner for approximately 90 percent of the difference
between the sale price and the guaranteed residual value of up
to $129 million if the sales price is less than this
amount, subject to certain provisions of the lease.

In December 2000, we entered into a second build-to-suit lease
with Keybank National Association for a five and one-half year
term beginning December 2000 to expand our Redwood City,
California headquarters facilities and develop adjacent property
adding approximately 310,000 square feet to our campus.
Construction was completed in June 2002. We accounted for this
arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with
SFAS No. 13, as amended. The facilities provide space
for sales, marketing, administration and research and
development functions. We have an option to purchase the
property for a maximum of $130 million or, at the end of
the lease, to arrange for (i) an extension of the lease, or
(ii) sale of the property to a third party while we retain
an obligation to the owner for approximately 90 percent of
the difference between the sale price and the guaranteed
residual value of up to $119 million if the sales price is
less than this amount, subject to certain provisions of the
lease.

We believe the estimated fair values of both properties under
these operating leases are in excess of their respective
guaranteed residual values as of March 31, 2005.

For the two lease agreements with Keybank National Association,
as described above, the lease rates are based upon the
Commercial Paper Rate and require us to maintain certain
financial covenants as shown below, all of which we were in
compliance with as of March 31, 2005.

As our two lease agreements with Keybank National Association
are scheduled to expire in June 2006 and July 2006, we currently
are evaluating whether to extend the leases, purchase the
properties under lease, or identify a third party buyer for the
properties when the leases expire. We have not yet determined
the course of action that we will take. See the “Liquidity
and Capital Resources” section above for additional
information.

In July 2003, we entered into a lease agreement with an
independent third party (the “Landlord”) for a studio
facility in Los Angeles, California, which commenced in October
2003 and expires in September 2013 with two five-year options to
extend the lease term. Additionally, we have options to purchase
the property after five and ten years based on the fair market
value of the property at the date of sale, a right of first
offer to purchase the property upon terms offered by the
Landlord, and a right to share in the profits from a sale of the
property.



We have accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in
accordance with SFAS No. 13, as amended. Existing
campus facilities comprise a total of 243,000 square feet
and provide space for research and development functions. Our
rental obligation under this agreement is $50 million over
the initial ten-year term of the lease. This commitment is
offset by sublease income of $6 million for the sublet to
an affiliate of the Landlord of 18,000 square feet of the
Los Angeles facility, which commenced in October 2003 and
expires in September 2013, with options of early termination by
the affiliate after five years and by us after four and five
years.

In June 2004, we entered into a lease agreement with an
independent third party for a studio facility in Orlando,
Florida, which commenced in January 2005 and expires in June
2010, with one five-year option to extend the lease term. The
campus facilities comprise a total of 117,000 square feet,
which we intend to use for research and development functions.
We have accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in
accordance with SFAS No. 13, as amended. Our rental
obligation over the initial five-and-a-half year term of the
lease is $13 million.

Litigation

On July 29, 2004, a class action lawsuit,

Kirschenbaum v. Electronic Arts Inc.

, was filed
against us in Superior Court in San Mateo, California. The
complaint alleges that we improperly classified “Image
Production Employees” in California as exempt employees and
seeks injunctive relief, unspecified monetary damages, interest
and attorneys’ fees. The complaint was first amended on or
about November 30, 2004 to add two former employees as
named-plaintiffs, and amended again on or about January 5,
2005 to add another former employee as a named-plaintiff. The
allegations in the complaint were not materially changed by the
amendments.

On February 14, 2005, a second employment-related class
action lawsuit,

Hasty v. Electronic Arts Inc.

, was
filed against us in Superior Court in San Mateo,
California. The complaint alleges that we improperly classified
“Engineers” in California as exempt employees and
seeks injunctive relief, unspecified monetary damages, interest
and attorneys’ fees. On or about March 16, 2005, we
received a first amended complaint, which contains the same
material allegations as the original complaint. We answered the
first amended complaint on April 20, 2005.

On March 24, 2005, a purported class action lawsuit was
filed against us and certain of our officers and directors. The
complaint, which asserts claims under Section 10(b) and
20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based on allegedly
false and misleading statements, was filed in the United States
District Court, Northern District of California, by an
individual purporting to represent a class of purchasers of EA
common stock. Additional purported class action lawsuits have
been filed in the same court by other individuals asserting the
same claims against us. We have not yet responded to any of the
complaints. In addition, on April 12, 2005, a shareholder
derivative action was filed against certain of our officers and
directors. This suit asserts claims based on substantially the
same factual allegations set forth in the federal class action
lawsuits. The complaint was filed in San Mateo Superior
Court. On April 13, 2005, a second shareholder derivative
action was filed in San Mateo Superior Court based on the
same claims as the first complaint. On May 16, 2005, a
shareholder derivative action based on substantially the same
allegations was filed in the United States District Court,
Northern District of California. We have not responded to the
shareholder derivative complaints.

In addition, we are subject to other claims and litigation
arising in the ordinary course of business. Our management
considers that any liability from any reasonably foreseeable
disposition of such other claims and litigation, individually or
in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on
our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Director Indemnity
Agreements

We have entered into indemnification agreement with the members
of our Board of Directors to indemnify them to the extent
permitted by law against any and all liabilities, costs,
expenses, amounts paid in settlement



and damages incurred by the directors as a result of any
lawsuit, or any judicial, administrative or investigative
proceeding in which the directors are sued as a result of their
service as members of our Board of Directors.

INFLATION

We believe the impact of inflation on our results of operations
has not been significant for each of the past three fiscal years.

RISK FACTORS

Our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, which
may affect our future financial performance. If any of the
events or circumstances described below occurs, our business and
financial performance could be harmed, our actual results could
differ materially from our expectations and the market value of
our securities could decline. The risks and uncertainties
discussed below are not the only ones we face. There may be
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or
that we currently do not believe are material that may harm our
business and financial performance.

Our business is highly dependent on the success and timely
    release of new video game platforms, on the continued
    availability of existing video game platforms, as well as our
    ability to develop commercially successful products for these
    platforms.

We derive most of our revenue from the sale of products for play
on video game platforms manufactured by third parties, such as
Sony’s PlayStation 2 and Microsoft’s Xbox. The success
of our business is driven in large part by the availability of
an adequate supply of current-generation video game platforms,
the timely release and success of new video game hardware
systems, our ability to accurately predict which platforms will
be most successful in the marketplace, and our ability to
develop commercially successful products for these platforms. We
must make product development decisions and commit significant
resources well in advance of the anticipated introduction of a
new platform. A new platform for which we are developing
products may be delayed, may not succeed or may have a shorter
life cycle than anticipated. If the platforms for which we are
developing products are not released when anticipated, are not
available in adequate amounts to meet consumer demand, or do not
attain wide market acceptance, our revenue will suffer, we may
be unable to fully recover the resources we have committed, and
our financial performance will be harmed.

Our industry is cyclical and has entered a transition
    period heading into the next cycle. During the transition, we
    expect our costs to increase, we may experience a decline in
    sales as consumers anticipate and adopt next-generation products
    and our operating results may suffer and become more difficult
    to predict.

Video game platforms have historically had a life cycle of four
to six years, which causes the video game software market to be
cyclical as well. Sony’s PlayStation 2 was introduced in
2000 and Microsoft’s Xbox and the Nintendo GameCube were
introduced in 2001. Over the course of the next eighteen months,
we expect Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo to introduce new video
game platforms into the market (so-called “next-generation
platforms”). As a result, we believe that the interactive
entertainment industry has entered into a transition stage
leading into the next cycle. During this transition, we intend
to continue developing new titles for the current-generation of
video game platforms while we also make significant investments
preparing to introduce products upon the launch of the
next-generation platforms. We have and expect to continue to
incur increased costs during the transition to next-generation
platforms, which are not likely to be offset in the near future.
We also expect development costs for next-generation video games
to be greater on a per-title basis than development costs for
current-generation video games. Further, we expect that, as the
current-generation of platforms reaches the end of its cycle and
next-generation platforms are introduced into the market, sales
of video games for current-generation consoles may begin to
decline. Consumers may defer game software purchases until the
next-generation platforms become available. This decline may not
be offset by increased sales of products for the new platforms.
For example, following the launch of Sony’s
PlayStation 2 platform, we experienced a significant
decline in revenue from sales of products for Sony’s older
PlayStation game console, which was not immediately offset by
revenue generated from sales of products for the
PlayStation 2



platform. If the increased costs we have incurred and expect to
continue to incur are not offset during the transition, our
operating results will suffer and our financial position will be
harmed. In addition, during this transition, we expect our
operating results to be more volatile and difficult to predict,
which could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly.

Our platform licensors set the royalty rates and other
    fees that we must pay to publish games for their platforms, and
    therefore have significant influence on our costs. If one or
    more of the platform licensors adopt a different fee structure
    for future game consoles or we are unable to obtain such
    licenses, our profitability will be materially impacted.

In the next eighteen months, we expect our platform licensors to
introduce new video game platforms into the market. For example,
Microsoft and Sony have indicated that they plan to release
next-generation successors to the Xbox and PlayStation 2,
respectively, over the course of the next eighteen months. In
order to publish products for a new game machine, we must take a
license from the platform licensor which gives the platform
licensor the opportunity to set the fee structure that we must
pay in order to publish games for that platform. Similarly,
certain platform licensors have retained the flexibility to
change their fee structures for online gameplay and features for
their consoles. The control that platform licensors have over
the fee structures for their future platforms and online access
makes it difficult for us to predict our costs and profitability
in the medium to long term. It is also possible that platform
licensors will not renew our licenses. Because publishing
products for video game consoles is the largest portion of our
business, any increase in fee structures or failure to secure a
license relationship would significantly harm our ability to
generate revenues and/or profits.

If we do not consistently meet our product development
    schedules, our operating results will be adversely
    affected.

Our business is highly seasonal, with the highest levels of
consumer demand, and a significant percentage of our revenue,
occurring in the December quarter. In addition, we seek to
release many of our products in conjunction with specific
events, such as the release of a related movie or the beginning
of a sports season or major sporting event. If we miss these key
selling periods, due to product delays or delayed introduction
of a new platform for which we have developed products, our
sales will suffer disproportionately. Our ability to meet
product development schedules is affected by a number of
factors, including the creative processes involved, the
coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed
development teams required by the increasing complexity of our
products, and the need to refine and tune our products prior to
their release. We have in the past experienced development
delays for several of our products. Failure to meet anticipated
production or “go live” schedules may cause a
shortfall in our revenue and profitability and cause our
operating results to be materially different from expectations.

If the average price of current-generation titles
    continues to decline, our operating results will suffer.

As a result of a more value-oriented consumer base caused by
price reductions in current-generation platforms by Microsoft,
Sony and Nintendo, a greater number of current-generation titles
being published, and significant pricing pressure from our
competitors, we have experienced a decrease in the average price
of our titles for current-generation platforms. Although we
believe that a few of the most popular current-generation titles
will continue to be launched at premium price points, as the
interactive entertainment industry transitions to
next-generation video game platforms, we expect there to be
fewer current-generation titles able to command premium price
points, and we expect that even these titles will be subject to
price reductions at an earlier point in their sales cycle than
we have seen in prior years. We expect the average price of
current-generation titles to continue to decline, which will
have a negative effect on our margins and operating results.

Technology changes rapidly in our business, and if we fail
    to anticipate or successfully implement new technologies, the
    quality, timeliness and competitiveness of our products and
    services will suffer.

Rapid technology changes in our industry require us to
anticipate, sometimes years in advance, which technologies we
must implement and take advantage of in order to make our
products and services competitive in the market. Therefore, we
usually start our product development with a range of technical



development goals that we hope to be able to achieve. We may not
be able to achieve these goals, or our competition may be able
to achieve them more quickly than we can. In either case, our
products and services may be technologically inferior to our
competitors’, less appealing to consumers, or both. If we
cannot achieve our technology goals within the original
development schedule of our products and services, then we may
delay their release until these technology goals can be
achieved, which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our
development expenses. Alternatively, we may increase the
resources employed in research and development in an attempt to
accelerate our development of new technologies, either to
preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up
with our competition, which would increase our development
expenses.

Our business is intensely competitive and “hit”
    driven. If we do not continue to deliver “hit”
    products or if consumers prefer our competitors’ products
    over our own, our operating results could suffer.

Competition in our industry is intense and we expect new
competitors to continue to emerge. While many new products are
regularly introduced only a relatively small number of
“hit” titles accounts for a significant portion of net
revenue. Hit products published by our competitors may take a
larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate, which
could cause our product sales to fall below our expectations. If
our competitors develop more successful products, offer
competitive products at lower price points, or if we do not
continue to develop consistently high-quality and well-received
products, our revenue, margins, and profitability will decline.

If we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to
    intellectual property, we will publish fewer hit titles and our
    revenue, profitability and cash flows will decline. Competition
    for these licenses may make them more expensive, and increase
    our costs.

Many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual
property owned by others. For example, our EA SPORTS products
include rights licensed from major sports leagues and
players’ associations. Similarly, many of our hit EA
GAMES

tm

franchises, such as Bond, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings,
are based on key film and literary licenses. Competition for
these licenses is intense. If we are unable to maintain these
licenses and obtain additional licenses with significant
commercial value, our revenues and profitability will decline
significantly. Competition for these licenses may also drive up
the advances, guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the
licensor, which could significantly increase our costs.

If patent claims continue to be asserted against us, we
    may be unable to sustain our current business models or
    profits.

Many patents have been issued that may apply to widely-used game
technologies. Additionally, infringement claims under many
recently issued patents are now being asserted against Internet
implementations of existing games. Several such claims have been
asserted against us. Such claims can harm our business. We incur
substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such
claims, regardless of the merits of the claims. In the event
that there is a determination that we have infringed a
third-party patent, we could incur significant monetary
liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future,
which could negatively impact our operating results.

Other intellectual property claims may increase our
    product costs or require us to cease selling affected
    products.

Many of our products include extremely realistic graphical
images, and we expect that as technology continues to advance,
images will become even more realistic. Some of the images and
other content are based on real-world examples that may
inadvertently infringe upon the intellectual property rights of
others. Although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to
ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual
property rights of others, it is possible that third parties
still may claim infringement. From time to time, we receive
communications from third parties regarding such claims.
Existing or future infringement claims against us, whether valid
or not, may be time consuming and expensive to defend. Such
claims or litigations could require us to stop selling the
affected products, redesign those products to avoid
infringement, or obtain a license, all of which would be costly
and harm our business.



From time to time we may become involved in other
    litigation which could adversely affect us.

We are currently, and from time to time in the future may
become, subject to other claims and litigation, which could be
expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business
operations. In addition, the outcome of any claims or litigation
may be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse
effect on our business, operating results, or financial
condition. For further information regarding certain claims and
litigation in which we are currently involved, see
“Part I — Item 3. Legal
Proceedings” above.

Our business, our products and our distribution are
    subject to increasing regulation of content, consumer privacy
    and online delivery in the key territories in which we conduct
    business. If we do not successfully respond to these
    regulations, our business may suffer.

Legislation is continually being introduced that may affect both
the content of our products and their distribution. For example,
privacy laws in the United States and Europe impose various
restrictions on our web sites. Those rules vary by territory
although the Internet recognizes no geographical boundaries.
Other countries, such as Germany, have adopted laws regulating
content both in packaged goods and those transmitted over the
Internet that are stricter than current United States laws. In
the United States, the federal and several state governments are
considering content restrictions on products such as ours, as
well as restrictions on distribution of such products. Any one
or more of these factors could harm our business by limiting the
products we are able to offer to our customers and by requiring
additional differentiation between products for different
territories to address varying regulations. This additional
product differentiation would be costly.

If we do not continue to attract and retain key personnel,
    we will be unable to effectively conduct our business. In
    addition, compensation-related changes in accounting
    requirements, in addition to evolving legal and operational
    factors, could have a significant impact on our expenses and
    operating results.

The market for technical, creative, marketing and other
personnel essential to the development and marketing of our
products and management of our businesses is extremely
competitive. Our leading position within the interactive
entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of
executives and key creative talent. If we cannot successfully
recruit and retain the employees we need, or replace key
employees following their departure, our ability to develop and
manage our businesses will be impaired.

We annually review and evaluate with the Compensation Committee
of our Board of Directors the compensation and benefits that we
offer our employees to ensure that we are able to attract and
retain our talent. Within our regular review, we have considered
recent changes in the accounting treatment of stock options, the
competitive market for technical, creative, marketing and other
personnel, and the evolving nature of job functions within our
studios, marketing organizations and other areas of the
business. Any changes we make to our compensation programs could
result in increased expenses and have a significant impact on
our operating results.

Our platform licensors are our chief competitors and
    frequently control the manufacturing of and/or access to our
    video game products. If they do not approve our products, we
    will be unable to ship to our customers.

Our agreements with hardware licensors (such as Sony for the
PlayStation 2, Microsoft for the Xbox and Nintendo for the
Nintendo GameCube) typically give significant control to the
licensor over the approval and manufacturing of our products,
which could, in certain circumstances, leave us unable to get
our products approved, manufactured and shipped to customers.
These hardware licensors are also our chief competitors. In most
events, control of the approval and manufacturing process by the
platform licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times
and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently.
While we believe that our relationships with our hardware
licensors are currently good, the potential for these licensors
to delay or refuse to approve or manufacture our products
exists. Such occurrences would harm our business and our
financial performance.

We also require compatibility code and the consent of Microsoft
and Sony in order to include online capabilities in our products
for their respective platforms. As online capabilities for video
game platforms



become more significant, Microsoft and Sony could restrict our
ability to provide online capabilities for our console platform
products. If Microsoft or Sony refused to approve our products
with online capabilities or significantly impacted the financial
terms on which these services are offered to our customers, our
business could be harmed.

Our international net revenue is subject to currency
    fluctuations.

For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, international net
revenue comprised 47 percent of our total net revenue. We
expect foreign sales to continue to account for a significant
portion of our total net revenue. Such sales are subject to
unexpected regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers.
Additionally, foreign sales are primarily made in local
currencies, which may fluctuate against the U.S. dollar.
While we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate
some foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency
denominated assets and liabilities (primarily certain
intercompany receivables and payables) and from time to time,
foreign currency option contracts to hedge foreign currency
forecasted transactions (primarily related to a portion of the
revenue generated by our operational subsidiaries), our results
of operations, including our reported net revenue and net
income, and financial condition would be adversely affected by
unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the Euro
and Pound Sterling.

Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax
    liabilities could adversely affect our operating results and
    financial condition.

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in
various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required
in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and, in
the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions
and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is
uncertain. We are also required to estimate what our taxes will
be in the future. Although we believe our tax estimates are
reasonable, the estimate process is inherently uncertain, and
our estimates are not binding on tax authorities. Our effective
tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in our business,
including the mix of earnings in countries with differing
statutory tax rates, changes in the elections we make, changes
in applicable tax laws as well as other factors. Further, our
tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax
authorities and developments in those audits could adversely
affect our income tax provision. Should our ultimate tax
liability exceed our estimates, our income tax provision and net
income could be materially affected.

We are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes, such
as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and
goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various
foreign jurisdictions. We are regularly under examination by tax
authorities with respect to these non-income taxes. There can be
no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations, changes
in our business or changes in applicable tax rules will not have
an adverse effect on our operating results and financial
condition.

Changes in our worldwide operating structure could have
    adverse tax consequences.

We are in the process of examining our worldwide operating
structure in light of changing tax laws, our current and
anticipated business operations, and the pending expiration of
an offshore advance pricing agreements with a foreign tax
authority in December 2005 under which our current business
operates. Certain changes that we are considering, or a failure
to make certain other changes, to our operating structure would
increase our tax expense.

In addition, while our current intention is to invest
indefinitely our undistributed foreign earnings offshore, we are
in the process of evaluating whether we will change our
intentions regarding a portion of our foreign earnings and take
advantage of the repatriation provision of the Jobs Act, and if
so, the amount that we would intend to repatriate. We may decide
not to take advantage of the new law at all. In addition to not
having made a decision to repatriate any foreign earnings, we
are not yet in a position to determine the impact of a
qualifying repatriation, should we choose to make one, on our
income tax expense for fiscal 2006.



Our reported financial results could be adversely affected
    by changes in financial accounting standards or by the
    application of existing or future accounting standards to our
    business as it evolves.

As a result of the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the
review of accounting policies by the SEC and national and
international accounting standards bodies, the frequency of
accounting policy changes may accelerate. For example, the FASB
has issued a new standard that will require us to adopt a
different method of determining and accounting for the
compensation expense of our employee stock options. This and
other possible changes to accounting standards, could adversely
affect our reported results of operations although not
necessarily our cash flows. Further, accounting policies
affecting software revenue recognition have been the subject of
frequent interpretations, which could significantly affect the
way we account for revenue related to our products. As we
enhance, expand and diversify our business and product
offerings, the application of existing or future financial
accounting standards, particularly those relating to the way we
account for revenue, could have a significant adverse effect on
our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows.

The majority of our sales are made to a relatively small
    number of key customers. If these customers reduce their
    purchases of our products or become unable to pay for them, our
    business could be harmed.

In the U.S., in fiscal 2005, over 80 percent of our
U.S. sales were made to six key customers, two of which
have recently announced plans to merge. In Europe, our top ten
customers accounted for over 30 percent of our sales in
that territory in fiscal 2005. Worldwide, we had direct sales to
one customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., which represented
14 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2005. Though our
products are available to consumers through a variety of
retailers, the concentration of our sales in one, or a few,
large customers could lead to a short-term disruption in our
sales if one or more of these customers significantly reduced
their purchases or ceased to carry our products, and could make
us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these
large customers became unable to pay for our products.
Additionally, our receivables from these large customers
increase significantly in the December quarter as they stock up
for the holiday selling season. Also, having such a large
portion of our total net revenue concentrated in a few customers
reduces our negotiating leverage with these customers.

Acquisitions, investments and other strategic transactions
    could result in operating difficulties, dilution to our
    investors and other negative consequences.

We have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, a wide
array of potential strategic transactions, including
(1) acquisitions of companies, businesses, intellectual
properties, and other assets, and (2) investments in new
interactive entertainment businesses (for example, online and
mobile games). Any of these strategic transactions could be
material to our financial condition and results of operations.
Although we regularly search for opportunities to engage in
strategic transactions, we may not be successful in identifying
suitable opportunities. We may not be able to consummate
potential acquisitions or investments or an acquisition or
investment may not enhance our business or may decrease rather
than increase our earnings. In addition, the process of
integrating an acquired company or business, or successfully
exploiting acquired intellectual property or other assets, could
divert a significant amount of our management’s time and
focus and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and
expenditures. Additional risks we face include:



Future acquisitions and investments could involve the issuance
of our equity securities, potentially diluting our existing
stockholders, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or
amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill, any of which
could harm our financial condition. Our stockholders may not
have the opportunity to review, vote on or evaluate future
acquisitions or investments.

Our products are subject to the threat of piracy by a
    variety of organizations and individuals. If we are not
    successful in combating and preventing piracy, our sales and
    profitability could be harmed significantly.

In many countries around the world, more pirated copies of our
products are sold than legitimate copies. Though piracy has not
had a material impact on our operating results to date, highly
organized pirate operations have been expanding globally. In
addition, the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent
the protection measures we use in our products, the availability
of broadband access to the Internet, the ability to download
pirated copies of our games from various Internet sites, and the
widespread proliferation of Internet cafes using pirated copies
of our products, all have contributed to ongoing and expanding
piracy. Though we take steps to make the unauthorized copying
and distribution of our products more difficult, as do the
manufacturers of consoles on which our games are played, neither
our efforts nor those of the console manufacturers may be
successful in controlling the piracy of our products. This could
have a negative effect on our growth and profitability in the
future.

Our stock price has been volatile and may continue to
    fluctuate significantly.

The market price of our common stock historically has been, and
we expect will continue to be, subject to significant
fluctuations. These fluctuations may be due to factors specific
to us (including those discussed in the risk factors above as
well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do
not believe are material), to changes in securities
analysts’ earnings estimates, to our results falling below
the expectations of analysts and investors, to factors affecting
the computer, software, Internet, entertainment, media or
electronics industries, or to national or international economic

Item 7A:

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk

Market Risk

We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in
foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and market
prices. Market risk is the potential loss arising from changes
in market rates and market prices. Foreign currency option and
foreign exchange forward contracts are used to either hedge
anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures
subject to market risk. We do not enter into derivatives or
other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
(see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Interest rate risk is the potential loss arising from changes in
interest rates and credit ratings. We do not consider our cash
and cash equivalents to be exposed to significant interest rate
risk because our portfolio consists of highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less (see
Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

From time to time, we hedge some of our foreign currency risk
related to anticipated foreign-currency-denominated sales
transactions by purchasing option contracts that generally have
maturities of 15 months or less. These transactions are
designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. The derivative
assets associated with our hedging activities are recorded at
fair value in other current assets in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The effective portion of gains or losses resulting from
changes in fair value is initially reported as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of any tax
effects, in stockholders’ equity and subsequently
reclassified into net revenue in the period when the forecasted
transaction actually occurs. The ineffective portion of gains or
losses resulting from changes in fair value is reported in
interest and other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not entirely



eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. The
fair value of our foreign currency option contracts purchased
and included in other current assets was $1 million as of
both March 31, 2005 and 2004.

We utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate
foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency
denominated assets and liabilities, primarily intercompany
receivables and payables. The forward contracts generally have a
contractual term of less than one month and are transacted near
month-end. Therefore, the fair value of the forward contracts
generally is not significant at each month-end. Our foreign
exchange forward contracts are not designated as hedging
instruments under SFAS No. 133 and are accounted for
as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts are
reported as other current assets or other current liabilities in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and gains and losses from
changes in fair value are reported in interest and other income,
net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The gains and
losses on these forward contracts generally offset the gains and
losses on the underlying foreign-currency-denominated assets and
liabilities.

As of March 31, 2005 we had foreign exchange contracts to
purchase and sell approximately $425 million of foreign
currencies. Of this amount, $379 million represents
contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for
U.S. dollars, $22 million to sell foreign currencies
in exchange for British Pounds, and $24 million to purchase
foreign currency in exchange for U.S. dollars. As of
March 31, 2004 we had foreign exchange contracts to
purchase and sell approximately $190 million of foreign
currencies. Of this amount, $173 million represented
contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for
U.S. dollars and $17 million to sell foreign currency
for British Pounds. The fair value of our forward contracts was
approximately $0 and $2 million as of March 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively.

The counterparties to these forward and option contracts are
creditworthy multinational commercial banks. The risks of
counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are
not considered to be material.

Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency
exchange rate risks, there can be no assurances that our
mitigating activities will adequately protect us against the
risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. For
example, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate
movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would not result
in a material loss in fair value of our option contracts under
either scenario as of March 31, 2005 or 2004. A
hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of
10 percent or 15 percent would result in potential
losses on our forward contracts of $40 million and
$61 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2005, and
$17 million and $26 million, respectively, as of
March 31, 2004. This sensitivity analysis assumes a
parallel adverse shift in foreign currency exchange rates, which
do not always move in the same direction. Actual results may
differ materially.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
relates primarily to our short-term investment portfolio. We
manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment
portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high
credit quality and relatively short average maturities.
Additionally, the contractual terms of the securities do not
permit the issuer to call, prepay or otherwise settle the
securities at prices less that the stated par value of the
securities. We also do not use derivative financial instruments
in our short-term investment portfolio.

As of March 31, 2005 and 2004, our short-term investments
were classified as available-for-sale and, consequently,
recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses
resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net
of any tax effects,



in stockholders’ equity. Our portfolio of short-term
investments consists of the following investment categories,
summarized by fair value as of March 31, 2005 and 2004 (in
millions):

Notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks, there
can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected
against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. At any
time, a sharp rise in interest rates could have a significant
adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio.
The following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair
value in our short-term investment portfolio as of
March 31, 2005, arising from selected potential changes in
interest rates. The modeling technique measures the change in
fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the
yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points
(“BPS”), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS. Actual
results may differ materially.

During fiscal 2005, the composition of our portfolio of cash,
cash equivalents and short-term investments changed
significantly from mostly cash equivalents during fiscal 2004 to
mostly short-term investments during fiscal 2005, as illustrated
above, and is now more susceptible to changes in interest rates.
Therefore, we have changed our quantitative disclosures of
interest rate risk from the tabular presentation used in prior
years to the sensitivity analysis, presented above, as we
believe this methodology better illustrates the effects on our
portfolio caused by our primary risk of changes in interest
rates. We have not presented a similar sensitivity analysis for
fiscal 2004 because of the relatively insignificant amount of
short-term investments in fiscal 2004 versus fiscal 2005.

Market Price Risk

The values of our equity investments in publicly traded
companies are subject to market price volatility. As of
March 31, 2005, our marketable equity securities were
classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, were
recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair market value
with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component
of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of any tax
effects, in stockholders’ equity. The fair value of our
marketable equity securities was $140 million and
$1 million as of March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.



At any time, a sharp decrease in market prices in our
investments in marketable equity securities could have a
significant adverse impact on the fair value of our investments.
The following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair
value in our marketable equity securities as of March 31,
2005, arising from selected potential changes in market prices.
The modeling technique measures the change in fair value from
immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in market price plus or
minus 25 percent, 50 percent and 75 percent.
Hypothetical changes in market prices of the same magnitude
would not have resulted in material changes in fair value of our
marketable equity securities as of March 31, 2004 and,
accordingly, are not presented.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

Electronic Arts Inc. develops, markets, publishes and
distributes interactive software games that are playable by
consumers on home video game consoles (such as the Sony
PlayStation® 2, Microsoft Xbox® and Nintendo
GameCube

tm

),
personal computers, mobile platforms — including
hand-held game players (such as the Game Boy® Advance,
Nintendo
DS

tm

and Sony PSP®) and cellular telephones, — and
online, over the Internet and other proprietary online networks.
Some of our games are based on content that we license from
others (e.g., Madden NFL Football, Harry Potter and FIFA
Soccer), and some of our games are based on intellectual
property that is wholly-owned by us (e.g., The
Sims

tm

and Need for
Speed

tm

).
Our goal is to develop titles which appeal to the mass markets,
which often means translating and localizing them for sale in
non-English speaking countries. In addition, we also attempt to
create software game “franchises” that allow us to
publish new titles on a recurring basis that are based on the
same property. Examples of this are our annual iterations of our
sports-based franchises (e.g., NCAA Football and FIFA Soccer),
titles based on long-lived movie properties (e.g., James
Bond

tm

)
and wholly-owned properties that can be successfully sequeled
(e.g., The Sims and Need for Speed).

A summary of our significant accounting policies applied in the
preparation of our consolidated financial statements follows:

(a) Consolidation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the
accounts of Electronic Arts Inc. and its domestic and foreign
wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

(b) Fiscal Year

Our fiscal year is reported on a 52/53-week period that,
historically, has ended on the final Saturday of March in each
year. The results of operations for the fiscal years ended
March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 each contain 52 weeks
and ended on March 26, 2005, March 27, 2004 and
March 29, 2003, respectively. For simplicity of
presentation, all fiscal periods are treated as ending on a
calendar month end. Beginning with the fiscal year ending
March 31, 2006, we will end our fiscal year on the Saturday
nearest March 31. As a result, our fiscal 2006 will be
reported as a 53 week year with the first quarter
containing 14 weeks.

(c) Reclassifications

Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to
the fiscal 2005 presentation.

(d) Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
contingent assets and liabilities, and revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. Such estimates include sales
returns and allowances, provisions for doubtful accounts,
accrued liabilities, income taxes, and estimates regarding the
recoverability of prepaid royalties, inventories, long-lived
assets and deferred income taxes. These estimates generally
involve complex issues and require us to make judgments, involve
analysis of historical and future trends, can require extended
periods of time to resolve, and are subject to change from
period to period. In all cases, actual results could differ
materially from management’s estimates.



(e) Cash, Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments,
    Marketable Equity Securities and Other Investments

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with
insignificant rate risk and original maturities of three months
or less.

Short-term investments consist of securities with original
maturities of greater than three months and are available for
use in current operations or other activities such as capital
expenditures, business acquisitions, or stock repurchase
programs.

Short-term investments in debt and marketable equity securities
are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115,

“Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities”

. Our policy is to minimize the principal
risk of our investment portfolio by earning returns based on
current interest rates. Management determines the appropriate
classification of its debt and equity securities at the time of
purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance
sheet date. Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity
when we have the positive intent and ability to hold the
securities to maturity. Securities classified as
held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, which is
adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts
to maturity. Such amortization is included in interest income,
net. Debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity and
marketable equity securities are classified as
available-for-sale and are stated at fair value. Unrealized
gains and losses are included as a separate component of
accumulated other comprehensive income or (loss), net of any
related tax effect, in stockholders’ equity. Realized gains
and losses are calculated based on the specific identification
method. We recognize an impairment charge when we determine a
decline in the fair value of the securities below its cost basis
is other-than-temporary.

Investments in affiliates consist of investments in equity
securities accounted for under the equity and cost methods of
accounting in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion (“APB”) No. 18,

“The Equity
Method Of Accounting For Investments In Common Stock”

.
Our share of earnings or losses of investments in affiliates, in
which we own at least 20 percent of the voting securities,
is included in interest and other income, net in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations using the equity method of
accounting, except for investments where we are not able to
exercise significant influence over the operating and financing
decisions of the investee, in which case the cost method of
accounting is used. In accordance with APB No. 18,
management evaluates these investments to determine if events or
changes in circumstances indicate an other-than-temporary
impairment in value. We recognize an impairment charge when we
determine an other-than-temporary impairment in value exists.

(f) Inventories

Inventories consist of materials and labor and include
manufacturing royalties paid to console manufacturers.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out
method) or market.

(g) Property and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment, net are stated at cost. Depreciation is
calculated using the straight-line method over the following
useful lives:

Under the provisions of American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants Statement of Position (“SOP”) 98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed
or Obtained for Internal Use”

, we capitalize costs
associated with customized internal-use software systems that
have reached the application development stage and meet
recoverability tests. Such capitalized costs include external
direct costs utilized in developing



or obtaining the applications and payroll and payroll-related
expenses for employees who are directly associated with the
applications. Capitalization of such costs begins when the
preliminary project stage is complete and ceases at the point in
which the project is substantially complete and ready for its
intended purpose. The net book value of capitalized costs
associated with internal-use software amounted to
$28 million and $30 million as of March 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively, and are being depreciated on a
straight-line basis over each project’s estimated useful
life that ranges from three to five years.

(h) Long-Lived Assets

We evaluate long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangibles for impairment, in accordance with
SFAS No. 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”

, whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is
measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to
future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by
the asset. This may include assumptions about future prospects
for the business that the asset relates to and typically
involves computations of the estimated future cash flows to be
generated by these businesses. Based on these judgments and
assumptions, we determine whether we need to take an impairment
charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets to reflect its actual fair value.
Judgments and assumptions about future values and remaining
useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be
affected by a variety of factors, including but not limited to,
significant negative industry or economic trends, significant
changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the
strategy of our overall business and significant
under-performance relative to expected historical or projected
future operating results. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its
fair value. We did not record any asset impairment charges in
fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2004 and 2003, we recognized less
than $1 million and $66 million, respectively, of
asset impairment charges. See Note 6 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

(i) Goodwill

SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets”

requires that purchased goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangibles not be amortized. Rather, goodwill
and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to at least
an annual assessment for impairment by applying a
fair-value-based test.

SFAS No. 142 requires a two-step approach to testing
goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit. The first step
tests for impairment by applying fair value-based tests at the
reporting unit level. The second step (if necessary), measures
the amount of impairment by applying fair value-based tests to
individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. We
completed the first step of transitional goodwill impairment
testing during the quarter ended June 30, 2002 and found no
indicators of impairment of our recorded goodwill. As a result,
we recognized no transitional impairment loss in fiscal 2003 in
connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142.

(j) Concentration of Credit Risk

We extend credit to various companies in the retail and mass
merchandising industries. Collection of trade receivables may be
affected by changes in economic or other industry conditions and
may, accordingly, impact our overall credit risk. Although we
generally do not require collateral, we perform ongoing credit
evaluations of our customers and maintain reserves for potential
credit losses. As of March 31, 2005, we had
13.5 percent and 12.6 percent of our gross accounts
receivable outstanding with Pinnacle, a European logistics and
collections company, and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., respectively. As
of March 31, 2004, we had 17.3 percent and
11.3 percent of our gross accounts receivable outstanding
with Pinnacle and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., respectively.

Short-term investments are placed with high-credit-quality
financial institutions or in short-duration, high-quality
securities. We limit the amount of credit exposure in any one
financial institution or type of investment instrument.



(k) Revenue Recognition

We evaluate the recognition of revenue based on the criteria set
forth in SOP 97-2,

“Software Revenue
Recognition”

, as amended by SOP 98-9,

“Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions”

and
Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 101,

“Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements”

,
as revised by SAB No. 104,

“Revenue
Recognition”

. We evaluate revenue recognition using the
following basic criteria and recognize revenue when all four
criteria are met:

Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been
satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have
a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we
report. For example, for multiple element arrangements, we must
make assumptions and judgments in order to: (1) determine
whether and when each element has been delivered;
(2) determine whether undelivered products or services are
essential to the functionality of the delivered products and
services; (3) determine whether vendor-specific objective
evidence of fair value (“VSOE”) exists for each
undelivered element; and (4) allocate the total price among
the various elements we must deliver. Changes to any of these
assumptions or judgments, or changes to the elements in a
software arrangement, could cause a material increase or
decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular
period.

Product Revenue:

Product revenue, including sales to
resellers and distributors (“channel partners”), is
recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce product
revenue for estimated future customer returns, price protection,
and other offerings, which may occur with our customers and
channel partners.

Shipping and Handling:

In accordance with Emerging Issues
Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 00-10,

“Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and
Costs”

, we recognize amounts billed to customers for
shipping and handling as revenue. Additionally, shipping and
handling costs incurred by us are included in cost of goods sold.

Online Subscription Revenue:

Online subscription revenue
is derived principally from subscription revenue collected from
customers for online play related to our persistent state world
and
POGO

tm

products. These customers generally pay on a month-to-month
basis; however, prepaid subscription revenue, including revenue
collected from credit card sales as well as sales of

Gametime

subscription cards, are recognized ratably over
the period for which the services are provided.

Software Licenses:

We license software rights to
manufacturers of products in related industries (for example,
makers of personal computers or computer accessories) to include
certain of our products with the manufacturer’s product, or
offer our products to consumers who have purchased the
manufacturer’s product. We call these combined products
“OEM bundles”. These OEM bundles generally require the
customer to pay us an upfront nonrefundable fee, which
represents the guaranteed minimum royalty amount. Revenue is
generally recognized upon delivery of the product master or the
first copy. Per copy royalties on sales that exceed the minimum
guarantee are recognized as earned.



(l) Sales Returns and Allowances and Bad Debt
    Reserves

We estimate potential future product returns, price protection
and stock-balancing programs related to current period product
revenue. We analyze historical returns, current sell-through of
channel partner inventory of our products, current trends in the
software games business segment and the overall economy, changes
in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other
related factors when evaluating the adequacy of the sales
returns and price protection allowances. In addition, we monitor
the volume of sales to our channel partners and monitor their
inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution
channel could result in high returns or higher price protection
costs in subsequent periods.

Similarly, significant judgment is required to estimate our
allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period. We
analyze customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness and
current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the
allowance for doubtful accounts.

(m) Advertising Costs

We generally expense advertising costs as incurred, except for
production costs associated with media campaigns which are
recognized as prepaid assets (to the extent paid in advance) and
expensed at the first run of the advertisement. Cooperative
advertising with our channel partners is accrued when revenue is
recognized and such amounts are included in marketing and sales
expense if there is a separate identifiable benefit for which we
can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit
identified. Otherwise, they are recognized as a reduction of net
revenue. We then reimburse the channel partner when qualifying
claims are submitted. For the fiscal years ended March 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, advertising expenses totaled approximately
$174 million, $183 million and $152 million,
respectively. We sometimes receive vendor reimbursements for
advertising costs from our vendors, and such amounts are
recognized as a reduction of marketing and sales expense if
there is a separate identifiable benefit for which we can
reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit identified.
Otherwise, they are recognized as a reduction of cost of goods
sold. Included in marketing and sales expense are vendor
reimbursements of advertising expenses of $42 million,
$45 million, and $28 million for the fiscal years
ended March 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

(n) Software Development Costs

Research and development costs, which consist primarily of
software development costs, are expensed as incurred.
SFAS No. 86,

“Accounting for the Cost of
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
Marketed”

, provides for the capitalization of certain
software development costs incurred after technological
feasibility of the software is established or for development
costs that have alternative future uses. Under our current
practice of developing new products, the technological
feasibility of the underlying software is not established until
substantially all product development is complete, which
generally includes the development of a working model. The
software development costs that have been capitalized to date
have been insignificant.

(o) Stock-based Compensation

We account for stock-based awards to employees using the
intrinsic value method in accordance with APB No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”

. We
have adopted the disclosure-only provisions of
SFAS No. 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation”

, as amended.

Had compensation cost for our stock-based compensation plans
been measured based on the estimated fair value at the grant
dates in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 123, we estimate that our reported net income
and net income per share would have been the pro forma amounts
indicated below. The fair value of each option grant is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. The



following weighted-average assumptions were used for grants made
under our stock-based compensation plans in fiscal 2005, 2004
and 2003:

During the years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004,
compensation expense for Class B stock option plans, based
on the estimated fair value at the grant dates in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, would not have
had a material impact on reported net income and net income per
share. Compensation expense for fiscal 2003 would have increased
our net loss by $0.02 to $(2.79) for both basic and diluted loss
per Class B share.



In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004)
(“SFAS No. 123R”),

“Share-Based
Payment”

. SFAS No. 123R requires that the
cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions be
recognized in financial statements using a fair-value-based
method. The statement replaces SFAS No. 123,
supersedes APB No. 25, and amends SFAS No. 95,

“Statement of Cash Flows”

. While the fair value
method under SFAS No. 123R is very similar to the fair
value method under SFAS No. 123 with regards to
measurement and recognition of stock-based compensation,
management is currently evaluating the impact of several of the
key differences between the two standards on our consolidated
financial statements. For example, SFAS No. 123
permits us to recognize forfeitures as they occur while
SFAS No. 123R will require us to estimate future
forfeitures and adjust our estimate on a quarterly basis.
SFAS No. 123R also will require a classification
change in the statement of cash flows, whereby a portion of the
tax benefit from stock options will move from operating cash
flow activities to financing cash flow activities (total cash
flows will remain unchanged).

In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) released SAB No. 107,

“Share-based Payment”

, which provides the views
of the staff regarding the interaction between
SFAS No. 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations
for public companies. In April 2005, the SEC adopted a rule that
amends the compliance dates of SFAS No. 123R. Under
the revised compliance dates, we will be required to adopt the
provisions of SFAS No. 123R no later than the first
interim period of fiscal 2007. While management continues to
evaluate the impact of SFAS No. 123R on our
consolidated financial statements, we currently believe that the
expensing of stock-based compensation will have an impact on our
Consolidated Statements of Operations similar to our pro forma
disclosure under SFAS No. 123, as amended.

(p) Foreign Currency
Translation

For each of our foreign operating subsidiaries the functional
currency is its local currency. Assets and liabilities of
foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using
month-end exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are
translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates.
The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are
included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) in stockholders’ equity.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of
the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated
in currencies other than the functional currency. Included in
interest and other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations are foreign currency transaction gains (losses) of
$(23) million, $44 million and $22 million for
the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

(q) Impact of Recently
Issued Accounting Standards

In March 2004, the FASB ratified the other-than-temporary
impairment measurement and recognition guidance and certain
disclosure requirements for impaired securities as described in
EITF Issue No. 03-1,

“The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments”

. In September 2004, the FASB issued a
proposed Staff Position (“FSP”) EITF Issue
No. 03-1-a,

“Implementation Guidance for the
Application of Paragraph 16 of EITF 03-1”

.
The proposed FSP will provide measurement and recognition
guidance with respect to debt securities that are impaired
solely due to interest rates and/or sector spreads. In October
2004, the FASB delayed the effective date for the
other-than-temporary impairment measurement and recognition
guidance contained in paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue
No. 03-1 until FSP Issue No. 03-1-a is issued.
However, this delay does not suspend the requirement to
recognize other-than-temporary impairments as required by
existing authoritative literature; nor does it delay the
required disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been
recognized as other-than-temporary impairments in
paragraphs 21-22 of EITF Issue No. 03-1. See
Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Management is unable to determine what impact the adoption of
the measurement and recognition guidance in EITF Issue
No. 03-1 will have on our consolidated financial statements.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,

“Inventory Costs — an amendment of ARB
No. 43, Chapter 4”

. SFAS No. 151
amends the guidance in Accounting Research Bulletin
(“ARB”) No. 43,



Chapter 4,

“Inventory Pricing”

, to clarify
the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) and
requires that those items be recognized as current-period
charges. SFAS No. 151 also requires that allocation of
fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based
on the normal capacity of the production facilities.
SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred
during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005.
Management believes the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will
not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,

“Exchange of Non-monetary Assets — an
amendment of APB Opinion No. 29”

.
SFAS No. 153 amends APB No. 29,

“Accounting for Non-monetary Transactions”

, to
eliminate the exception for non-monetary exchanges of similar
productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for
exchanges of non-monetary assets that do not have commercial
substance. SFAS No. 153 is effective for non-monetary
exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after
June 15, 2005. Management believes the adoption of
SFAS No. 153 will not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

(a) Fair Value of
Financial Instruments

Cash, cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and
accrued and other liabilities are valued at their carrying
amounts as they approximate their fair value due to the short
maturity of these financial instruments.

All of our short-term investments and marketable equity
securities were classified as available-for-sale as of
March 31, 2005 and 2004. The fair value of these
investments is determined using quoted market prices for the
securities or similar financial instruments.

(b) Cash, Cash
Equivalents and Short-term Investments

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments consisted of
the following (in millions):



In accordance with EITF No. 03-1, the table above
summarizes the fair value and gross unrealized losses of our
short-term investments, aggregated by investment category and by
the length of time that individual securities have been in a
continuous unrealized loss position as of March 31, 2005.
The gross unrealized losses in each of these investment
categories were primarily caused by interest rate changes.
However, the contractual terms of these securities do not permit
the issuer to call, prepay or otherwise settle the securities at
prices less than the stated par value of the security.
Accordingly, we do not consider these investments to be
other-than-temporarily impaired as of March 31, 2005.

Gross unrealized gains in short-term investments were less than
$1 million as of March 31, 2005. Gross unrealized
gains and gross unrealized losses in short-term investments were
both less than $1 million as of March 31, 2004. No
material gains or losses were recognized from the sale of
short-term investments for the years ended March 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

The following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value
of our short-term investments, classified by stated maturity as
of March 31, 2005 (in millions):

Our investments in marketable equity securities consist of
investments in common stock of publicly traded companies. On
February 3, 2005, we purchased approximately
19.9 percent of the outstanding ordinary shares
(18.4 percent of the voting rights) of Ubisoft
Entertainment for $90 million. As the fair value of our
marketable equity securities exceed the cost basis of those
investments as of March 31, 2005, we do not consider these
investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. During fiscal
2004, we recognized a $1 million other-than-temporary
impairment charge to write-down certain investments to their
fair market value. During fiscal 2005 and 2003, no
other-than-temporary impairment charges were recognized.

The sale of marketable equity securities resulted in gains of
$2 million for both years ended March 31, 2005 and
2003. No material gains or losses were recognized from the sale
of marketable equity securities for the year ended
March 31, 2004.

(d)

Investments in Affiliates

As of March 31, 2005, investments in affiliates included a
warrant to acquire 2,327,602 additional shares of Digital
Illusions, C.E. (“DICE”) common stock. See Note 4
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The warrant
is accounted for as a derivative instrument and is recorded at
fair market value in accordance with SFAS No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities”

, as amended, with gains and losses
resulting from changes in fair market value recorded in interest
and other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. As of March 31, 2005, the fair value of the
warrant was $5 million.

For cost method investments with an aggregate cost of
$3 million, we estimated that the fair value exceeded the
cost basis of those investments. For the remaining
$2 million, no adverse events or other impairment



indicators have come to our attention suggesting that the
investment is impaired. Accordingly, we do not consider these
investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of
March 31, 2005. During fiscal 2004, no other-than-temporary
impairments in investments in affiliates were recognized.
However, during fiscal 2003, we determined that some of our cost
method investments contained other-than-temporary impairments
based on several factors such as the financial performance of
the affiliate, our decision to no longer acquire or continue
investing in the affiliate, the limited cash flow from future
business arrangements and other information available, and a
charge of $11 million was recorded to write-down these
investments to their estimated fair market value.

(3)

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

We account for our derivative and hedging activities under
SFAS No. 133. The assets or liabilities associated
with our derivative instruments and hedging activities are
recorded at fair value in other current assets or other current
liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As discussed below, the accounting for gains and losses
resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the
derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge
accounting.

We transact business in various foreign currencies and have
significant international sales and purchase transactions
denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we purchase
foreign currency option contracts, generally with maturities of
15 months or less, to reduce the volatility of cash flows
primarily related to revenue generated by our international
subsidiaries. In addition, we utilize foreign exchange forward
contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk
associated with foreign-currency-denominated assets and
liabilities, primarily intercompany receivables and payables.
The forward contracts generally have a contractual term of less
than one month and are transacted near month-end. Therefore, the
fair value of the forward contracts generally is not significant
at each month-end. We do not use foreign currency option or
foreign exchange forward contracts for speculative or trading
purposes.

Cash Flow Hedging
Activities

Our foreign currency option contracts are designated and qualify
as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133. The
effectiveness of the contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges
is assessed monthly through an evaluation of critical terms and
other criteria required by SFAS No. 133. The effective
portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value
is initially reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income or (loss), net of any tax effects, in
stockholders’ equity and subsequently reclassified into net
revenue in the period when the forecasted transaction actually
occurs. The ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting
from changes in fair value is reported in interest and other
income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We
expect the effective portion of hedges recognized in accumulated
other comprehensive income or (loss) as of March 31, 2005,
will be reclassified to net revenue during fiscal 2006. The
amount of hedging ineffectiveness recognized in interest and
other income, net was a loss of $1 million and
$2 million for the years ended March 31, 2005 and
2004, respectively.

Balance Sheet Hedging
Activities

Our foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated as
hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133. Accordingly,
any gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of
the forward contracts are reported in interest and other income,
net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The gains and
losses on these forward contracts generally offset the gains and
losses associated with the underlying
foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

Criterion

On October 19, 2004, we completed our acquisition of
100 percent of Criterion Software Group Ltd.
(“Criterion”) for an aggregate accounting purchase
price of approximately $68 million including transaction
costs and the assumption of outstanding stock options under
certain Criterion stock option plans. Based in



England, Criterion is a developer of video games and a provider
of middleware solutions for the game development and publishing
industry. The results of operations of Criterion and the
estimated fair market values of the acquired assets and assumed
liabilities have been included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements since the date of acquisition. Except for acquired
in-process technology, which is discussed below, the acquired
intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis
over estimated lives ranging from two to four years.

Acquired in-process technology includes the value of products in
the development stage that are not considered to have reached
technological feasibility or have alternative future use.
Accordingly, the acquired in-process technology was expensed in
the Consolidated Statement of Operations upon consummation of
the acquisition. Stock-based employee compensation represents
the intrinsic value of certain unvested employee stock options
that were assumed as part of the transaction. The stock option
awards were considered modified for accounting purposes and were
fully amortized over the remaining vesting period in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended
March 31, 2005.

Digital Illusions
C.E.

In 2003 we acquired: (1) approximately
1,911,403 shares of Class B common stock representing
a 19 percent equity interest in DICE; and (2) a
warrant to acquire an additional 2,327,602 shares of
to-be-issued Class A common stock at an exercise price of
SEK 43.23. Based in Sweden, DICE develops games for
personal computers and video game consoles. DICE’s products
are primarily sold through co-publishing agreements with us. The
transactions between DICE and us have been recorded at an
arms-length basis. Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005,
we accounted for our Class B common stock investment in
DICE under the equity method of accounting, as prescribed by APB
No. 18. Separately, the warrants valued at $5 million
as of March 31, 2005 are included in investments in
affiliates in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 2
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

On January 27, 2005 we completed a tender offer by
acquiring 3,235,053 shares of Class A common stock at
a price of SEK 61 per share, representing 32 percent
of the outstanding Class A common stock of DICE. During the
tender offer period and subsequently, we acquired, through open
market purchases at an average price of SEK 60.33, an
additional 1,190,658 shares of Class A common stock,
representing approximately 12 percent of the outstanding
Class A common stock in DICE. Accordingly, on a cumulative
basis as of March 31, 2005, we owned approximately
63 percent of DICE on an undiluted basis (excluding the
warrants discussed above). As a result, we have included the
assets, liabilities and results of operations of DICE in our
consolidated financial statements since January 27, 2005.
DICE’s 37 percent ownership is reflected as minority
interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31,
2005 and the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year
ended March 31, 2005. The preliminary purchase price
allocation, including the allocation of goodwill, will be
updated as additional information becomes available.

Except for acquired-in-process technology, the acquired
intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis
over estimated lives ranging from one to four years. The
acquired in-process technology was expensed in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations upon consummation of the acquisition.



A summary of the Criterion assets acquired and liabilities
assumed and the preliminary allocation of the DICE assets
acquired and liabilities assumed during the year ended
March 31, 2005 is as follows (in millions):

Square Co., Ltd.

In May 1998, we completed the formation of two new joint
ventures in North America and Japan with Square Co., Ltd.
(“Square”), a leading developer and publisher of
entertainment software in Japan. In North America, the companies
formed Square Electronic Arts, LLC (“Square EA”),
which had exclusive publishing rights in North America for
future interactive entertainment titles created by Square.
Additionally, we had the exclusive right to distribute in North
America products published by this joint venture. We contributed
$3 million and owned a 30 percent minority interest in
this joint venture while Square owned 70 percent. This
joint venture was accounted for under the equity method. The
joint venture agreements with Square expired as of
March 31, 2003. Our distribution of Square products in
North America terminated on June 30, 2003. On May 30,
2003, Square acquired our 30 percent ownership interest in
the joint venture for $8 million and the investment was
removed from our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In Japan, the companies established Electronic Arts
Square K.K. (“EA Square KK”) in 1998,
which localized and published in Japan a selection of
EA’s properties originally created in North America
and Europe, as well as developed and published original video
games in Japan. We contributed cash and had a 70 percent
majority ownership interest, while Square contributed cash and
owned 30 percent. Accordingly, the assets, liabilities and
results of operations for EA Square KK were included
in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements
of Operations since June 1, 1998, the date of formation.
Square’s 30 percent interest in EA Square KK
was reflected as “Minority interest” on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2003, and
Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended
March 31, 2003.

In May 2003, we acquired Square’s 30 percent ownership
interest in EA Square KK for approximately
$3 million in cash. As a result of the acquisition,
EA Square KK has become our wholly owned subsidiary
and has been renamed Electronic Arts K.K. The acquisition
was accounted for as a step acquisition purchase and the excess
purchase price over fair value of the net tangible assets
acquired, $1 million, was allocated to goodwill.

We completed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 with measurement dates of
January 1, 2005, January 1, 2004 and January 1,
2003, respectively, and found no indicators of impairment of our
recorded goodwill. There can be no assurance that future
impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings and
there is a potential for a write down of goodwill in connection
with the annual impairment test in future periods.

Finite-lived intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization,
as of March 31, 2005 and 2004, were $36 million and
$18 million, respectively, and include costs for obtaining
trade names and developed technologies. Amortization of
intangibles for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003 was $6 million (of which $3 million was
recognized in cost of goods sold), $3 million and
$8 million, respectively. Finite-lived intangible assets
are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of
their estimated useful lives or the agreement terms, typically
from two to twelve years. As of March 31, 2005 and
2004, the weighted-average remaining useful life for
finite-lived intangible assets was approximately 4.3 years
and 7.5 years, respectively.

When indicators are present and circumstances warrant, we
perform impairment tests under SFAS No. 144 to
evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets and
remaining finite-lived identifiable intangibles utilized in our
business. This test was performed in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2003 in conjunction with the overall valuation of the
EA.com legal entity and our Class B common stock and
resulted in an impairment of $12 million. See Note 6
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

Restructuring and asset impairment information as of
March 31, 2005 was as follows (in millions):

Over the last four fiscal years, we have entered into various
restructurings based on management decisions as discussed in
more detail below. As of March 31, 2005, an aggregate of
$23 million in cash had been paid out under the
fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 restructuring plans. In
addition, we have made subsequent net adjustments of
approximately $2 million during fiscal 2005 relating to
projected future cash outlays under the fiscal 2004 and 2003
restructuring plans. The remaining projected cash outlay of
$10 million is expected to be utilized by
January 2009. The facilities-related accrued obligation
shown above is net of $13 million of estimated future
sub-lease income. The restructuring accrual is included in other
accrued expenses presented in Note 8 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.



Fiscal 2004 Studio
Restructuring

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we closed the
majority of our leased studio facility in Walnut Creek,
California and our entire owned studio facility in Austin, Texas
in order to consolidate local development efforts in
Redwood City, California. We recorded total pre-tax charges
of $9 million, consisting of $7 million for
consolidation of facilities (net of expected future sublease
income), $2 million for workforce reductions of
approximately 117 personnel and less than $1 million
for the write-off of non-current assets, primarily leasehold
improvements.

Fiscal 2003 Studio
Restructuring

During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we closed our office
located in San Francisco, California and our studio located
in Seattle, Washington in order to consolidate local development
efforts in Redwood City, California and Vancouver, British
Columbia, Canada. We recorded total pre-tax charges of
$9 million, consisting of $7 million for consolidation
of facilities (net of expected future sublease income),
$1 million for the write-off of non-current assets,
primarily leasehold improvements, and $1 million for
workforce reductions of approximately 33 personnel.

Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we
approved a plan to consolidate the Los Angeles, California,
Irvine, California and Las Vegas, Nevada, studios into one
major game studio in Los Angeles. We recorded a total
pre-tax restructuring charge of $5 million, including
$2 million for the shutdown of facilities and associated
costs, $2 million for the write-off of non-current assets,
primarily leasehold improvements and $1 million for
workforce reductions.

Fiscal 2003 Online Restructuring

In March 2003, we consolidated the operations of EA.com into our
core business, and eliminated separate reporting for our
Class B common stock for all future reporting periods after
fiscal 2003. We recorded restructuring charges, including asset
impairment, of $67 million, consisting of $2 million
for workforce reductions of approximately 50 personnel,
$2 million for consolidation of facilities and
$63 million for the write-off of non-current assets. The
consolidation of facilities resulted in the closure of
EA.com’s Chicago and Virginia facilities and an adjustment
for the closure of EA.com’s San Diego studio in fiscal
2002.

As part of the restructuring efforts, we performed impairment
tests under SFAS No. 144,

“Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”

, to
evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets and
remaining finite-lived identifiable intangible assets utilized
in the EA.com business. This test was performed in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003 in conjunction with the overall valuation
of the EA.com legal entity and its Class B common stock. As
of March 31, 2003, the unit sales and the number of
subscribers for

The Sims Online,

our flagship EA.com
product, and overall EA.com performance was significantly below
our expectations, which we considered to be a triggering event
under SFAS No. 144. These results caused us to cancel
most of our plans to develop similar online products that would
have utilized the long-lived assets associated with the EA.com
business. Impairment charges on long-lived assets amounted to
$63 million and included $25 million relating to
impaired customized internal-use software systems for the EA.com
infrastructure, $26 million for other long-lived assets and
$12 million of finite-lived intangibles impairment charges
relating to EA.com’s acquisitions of Kesmai Corporation and
Pogo Corporation.

Fiscal 2002 Online Restructuring

In October 2001, we announced restructuring initiatives
involving EA.com and the closure of EA.com’s San Diego
studio and consolidation of our San Francisco and Virginia
facilities. As a result, we recorded restructuring charges of
$20 million, consisting of $4 million for workforce
reductions, $3 million for consolidation of facilities and
other administrative charges and $13 million for the
write-off of non-current assets and facilities.

All restructuring charges recorded prior to December 31,
2002 were recorded in accordance with EITF No. 94-3,

“Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an



Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring)

”, EITF No. 95-03,

“Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a
Purchase Business Combination”

, and SAB No. 100,

“Restructuring and Impairment Charges”.

All
restructuring charges recorded subsequent to December 31,
2002, were recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 146,

“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities”.

Adjustments to the restructuring reserves
will be made in future periods, if necessary, based upon the
then-current events and circumstances.

ROYALTIES AND LICENSES

Our royalty expenses consist of payments to (1) content
licensors, (2) independent software developers, and
(3) co-publishing and/or distribution affiliates. License
royalties consist of payments made to celebrities, professional
sports organizations, movie studios and other organizations for
our use of their trademarks, copyrights, personal publicity
rights, content and/or other intellectual property. Royalty
payments to independent software developers are payments for the
development of intellectual property related to our games.
Co-publishing and distribution royalties are payments made to
third parties for delivery of product.

Royalty-based payments made to content licensors and
distribution affiliates are generally capitalized as prepaid
royalties and expensed to cost of goods sold at the greater of
the contractual or effective royalty rate based on net product
sales. Prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent
software developers and co-publishing affiliates are generally
made in connection with the development of a particular product
and, therefore, we are generally subject to development risk
prior to the general release of the product. Accordingly,
payments that are due prior to completion of a product are
generally expensed as research and development as the services
are incurred. Payments due after completion of the product
(primarily royalty-based in nature) are generally expensed as
cost of goods sold at the higher of the contractual or effective
royalty rate based on net product sales.

Minimum guaranteed royalty obligations are initially recorded as
an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no
significant performance remains with the licensor. When
significant performance remains with the licensor, we record
royalty payments as an asset when actually paid and as a
liability when incurred rather than upon execution of the
contract. Minimum royalty payment obligations are classified as
current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are
contractually due within the next twelve months. As of
March 31, 2005 and 2004, approximately $51 million and
$63 million, respectively, of minimum guaranteed royalty
obligations had been recognized and are included in the tables
below.

Each quarter, we also evaluate the future realization of our
royalty-based assets as well as any unrecognized minimum
commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely
to be realized through product sales. Any impairments determined
before the launch of a product are charged to research and
development expense. Impairments determined post-launch are
charged to cost of goods sold. In either case, we rely on
estimated revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid
royalties. If actual sales or revised revenue estimates fall
below the initial revenue estimates, then the actual charge
taken may be greater in any given quarter than anticipated.

The current and long-term portions of prepaid royalties and
minimum guaranteed royalty-related assets, included in other
current assets and other assets, consisted of (in millions):

(i.e., delivery of the product or content or other factors) and
were therefore not recorded in our Consolidated Financial

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Lease Commitments and
Residual Value Guarantees

We lease certain of our current facilities and certain equipment
under non-cancelable operating lease agreements. We are required
to pay property taxes, insurance and normal maintenance costs
for certain of our facilities and will be required to pay any
increases over the base year of these expenses on the remainder
of our facilities.

In February 1995, we entered into a build-to-suit lease with a
third party for our headquarters facility in Redwood City,
California, which was refinanced with Keybank National
Association in July 2001 and expires in July 2006. We accounted
for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with
SFAS No. 13,

“Accounting for Leases”

,
as amended. Existing campus facilities developed in phase one
comprise a total of 350,000 square feet and provide space
for sales, marketing, administration and research and
development functions. We have an option to purchase the
property (land and facilities) for a maximum of
$145 million or, at the end of the lease, to arrange for
(i) an extension of the lease or (ii) sale of the
property to a third party while we retain an obligation to the
owner for approximately 90 percent of the difference
between the sale price and the guaranteed residual value of up
to $129 million if the sales price is less than this
amount, subject to certain provisions of the lease.

In December 2000, we entered into a second build-to-suit lease
with Keybank National Association for a five and one-half year
term beginning December 2000 to expand our Redwood City,
California headquarters facilities and develop adjacent property
adding approximately 310,000 square feet to our campus.
Construction was completed in June 2002. We accounted for this
arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with
SFAS No. 13, as amended. The facilities provide space
for sales, marketing, administration and research and
development functions. We have an option to purchase the
property for a maximum of $130 million or, at the end of
the lease, to arrange for (i) an extension of the lease, or
(ii) sale of the property to a third party while we retain
an obligation to the owner for approximately 90 percent of
the difference between the sale price and the guaranteed
residual value of up to $119 million if the sales price is
less than this amount, subject to certain provisions of the
lease.

We believe the estimated fair values of both properties under
these operating leases are in excess of their respective
guaranteed residual values as of March 31, 2005.



For the two lease agreements with Keybank National Association,
as described above, the lease rates are based upon the
Commercial Paper Rate and require us to maintain certain
financial covenants as shown below, all of which we were in
compliance with as of March 31, 2005.

In July 2003, we entered into a lease agreement with an
independent third party (the “Landlord”) for a studio
facility in Los Angeles, California, which commenced in October
2003 and expires in September 2013 with two five-year options to
extend the lease term. Additionally, we have options to purchase
the property after five and ten years based on the fair market
value of the property at the date of sale, a right of first
offer to purchase the property upon terms offered by the
Landlord, and a right to share in the profits from a sale of the
property. We have accounted for this arrangement as an operating
lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, as amended.
Existing campus facilities comprise a total of
243,000 square feet and provide space for research and
development functions. Our rental obligation under this
agreement is $50 million over the initial ten-year term of
the lease. This commitment is offset by sublease income of
$6 million for the sublet to an affiliate of the Landlord
of 18,000 square feet of the Los Angeles facility, which
commenced in October 2003 and expires in September 2013, with
options of early termination by the affiliate after five years
and by us after four and five years.

In June 2004, we entered into a lease agreement with an
independent third party for a studio facility in Orlando,
Florida, which commenced in January 2005 and expires in June
2010, with one five-year option to extend the lease term. The
campus facilities comprise a total of 117,000 square feet,
which we intend to use for research and development functions.
We have accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in
accordance with SFAS No. 13, as amended. Our rental
obligation over the initial five-and-a-half year term of the
lease is $13 million.

Letters of Credit

In July 2002, we provided an irrevocable standby letter of
credit to Nintendo of Europe. The standby letter of credit
guarantees performance of our obligations to pay Nintendo of
Europe for trade payables of up
to

€

18 million.
The standby letter of credit expires in July 2005. As of
March 31, 2005, we had

€

0.5 million
payable to Nintendo of Europe covered by this standby letter of
credit.

In August 2003, we provided an irrevocable standby letter of
credit to 300 California Associates II, LLC in replacement
of our security deposit for office space. The standby letter of
credit guarantees performance of our obligations to pay our
lease commitment up to approximately $1 million. The
standby letter of credit expires in December 2006. As of
March 31, 2005, we did not have a payable balance on this
standby letter of credit.

Development, Celebrity,
League and Content Licenses: Payments and Commitments

The products produced by our studios are designed and created by
our employee designers, artists, software programmers and by
non-employee software developers (“independent
artists” or “third-party developers”). We
typically advance development funds to the independent artists
and third-party developers during development of our games,
usually in installment payments made upon the completion of
specified development milestones.

Contractually, these payments are considered advances against
subsequent royalties on the sales of the products. These terms
are set forth in written agreements entered into with the
independent artists and third-party developers. In addition, we
have certain celebrity, league and content license contracts
that contain



minimum guarantee payments and marketing commitments that are
not dependent on any deliverables. Celebrities and organizations
with whom we have contracts include: ESPN (content in EA
SPORTS

tm

games); FIFA and UEFA (professional soccer); NASCAR (stock car
racing); John Madden (professional football); National
Basketball Association (professional basketball); PGA TOUR
(professional golf); Tiger Woods (professional golf); National
Hockey League and NHLPA (professional hockey); Warner Bros.
(Harry Potter, Batman and Superman); MGM/ Danjaq (James Bond);
New Line Productions (The Lord of the Rings); National Football
League, Arena Football League and PLAYERS Inc. (professional
football); Collegiate Licensing Company (collegiate football and
basketball); ISC (stock car racing); Island Def Jam (fighting);
and Viacom Consumer Products (The Godfather). These developer
and content license commitments represent the sum of
(i) the cash payments due under non-royalty-bearing
licenses and services agreements, and (ii) the minimum
payments and advances against royalties due under
royalty-bearing licenses and services agreements, the majority
of which are conditional upon performance by the counterparty.
These minimum guarantee payments and any related marketing
commitments are included in the table below.

The following table summarizes our minimum contractual
obligations and commercial commitments as of March 31,
2005, and the effect we expect them to have on our liquidity and
cash flow in future periods (in millions):

Developer/licensor commitments include $50 million of
    commitments to developers or licensors that have been included
    in both current and long-term assets and liabilities in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2005 because
    the developer or licensor does not have any performance
    obligations to us. Our developer/licensor and marketing
    commitments increased significantly in the latter half of fiscal
    2005 primarily as a result of agreements we renewed with the
    National Football League and PLAYERS Inc., as well as an
    exclusive, long-term agreement we entered into with ESPN Inc.
    (“ESPN”) for the development and integrated marketing
    of ESPN content in EA SPORTS games beginning in calendar 2006.
    While our commitments with ESPN are not contractually due until
    fiscal 2011 and beyond and are presented as such in the table
    above, we anticipate paying these commitments earlier as we
    publish titles associated with the agreement.

Total rent expense for all operating leases was
$41 million, $27 million and $22 million, for the
fiscal years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

The lease commitments disclosed above exclude commitments
included in our restructuring activities for contractual rental
commitments of $23 million under real estate leases for
unutilized office space, offset by $13 million of estimated
future sub-lease income. These amounts were expensed in the
periods of the related restructuring and are included in our
accrued and other liabilities reported on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2005. See Note 6 in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Litigation

On July 29, 2004, a class action lawsuit,

Kirschenbaum v. Electronic Arts Inc.

, was filed
against us in Superior Court in San Mateo, California. The
complaint alleges that we improperly classified “Image
Production



Employees” in California as exempt employees and seeks
injunctive relief, unspecified monetary damages, interest and
attorneys’ fees. The complaint was first amended on or
about November 30, 2004 to add two former employees as
named-plaintiffs, and amended again on or about January 5,
2005 to add another former employee as a named-plaintiff. The
allegations in the complaint were not materially changed by the
amendments.

On February 14, 2005, a second employment-related class
action lawsuit,

Hasty v. Electronic Arts Inc.,

was
filed against us in Superior Court in San Mateo,
California. The complaint alleges that we improperly classified
“Engineers” in California as exempt employees and
seeks injunctive relief, unspecified monetary damages, interest
and attorneys’ fees. On or about March 16, 2005, we
received a first amended complaint, which contains the same
material allegations as the original complaint. We answered the
first amended complaint on April 20, 2005.

On March 24, 2005, a purported class action lawsuit was
filed against us and certain of our officers and directors. The
complaint, which asserts claims under Section 10(b) and
20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based on allegedly
false and misleading statements, was filed in the United States
District Court, Northern District of California, by an
individual purporting to represent a class of purchasers of EA
common stock. Additional purported class action lawsuits have
been filed in the same court by other individuals asserting the
same claims against us. We have not yet responded to any of the
complaints. In addition, on April 12, 2005, a shareholder
derivative action was filed against certain of our officers and
directors. This suit asserts claims based on substantially the
same factual allegations set forth in the federal class action
lawsuits. The complaint was filed in San Mateo Superior
Court. On April 13, 2005, a second shareholder derivative
action was filed in San Mateo Superior Court based on the
same claims as the first complaint. On May 16, 2005, a
shareholder derivative action based on substantially the same
allegations was filed in the United States District Court,
Northern District of California. We have not responded to the
shareholder derivative complaints.

In addition, we are subject to other claims and litigation
arising in the ordinary course of business. Our management
considers that any liability from any reasonably foreseeable
disposition of such other claims and litigation, individually or
in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on
our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Director Indemnity
Agreements

We have entered into indemnification agreements with the members
of our Board of Directors to indemnify them to the extent
permitted by law against any and all liabilities, costs,
expenses, amounts paid in settlement and damages incurred by the
directors as a result of any lawsuit, or any judicial,
administrative or investigative proceeding in which the
directors are sued as a result of their service as members of
our Board of Directors.

INCOME TAXES

Our pretax income from operations for the fiscal years ended
March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 consisted of the following
components (in millions):

Year Ended March 31,




Domestic

$


$


$


Foreign




Income before provision for income taxes and minority interest

$


$


$




Income tax expense (benefit) for the fiscal years ended
March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 consisted of (in millions):

The differences between the statutory income tax rate and our
effective tax rate, expressed as a percentage of income before
provision for (benefit from) income taxes, for the years ended
March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows:

Our effective income tax rate reflects the net tax benefit from
having significant operations outside the United States that are
taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate of
35 percent.

Undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to
approximately $896 million as of March 31, 2005. Those
earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and,
accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided
thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of
dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to both
U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax
credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign
countries.



During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 we incurred
approximately $6 million in non-deductible acquisition
related costs from our acquisitions of 100 percent of
Criterion and an additional 44 percent of DICE.

During fiscal 2003, we successfully prevailed in Tax Court
proceedings with respect to previously-contested deficiencies
issued by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) in
conjunction with its audit of our U.S. income tax returns
for fiscal 1993 through 1996. In addition, the IRS examined our
U.S. income tax returns for fiscal 1997 through 1999 and
has proposed certain adjustments. During the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004, we resolved certain of these matters with the IRS,
which lowered our income tax expense by approximately
$20 million and resulted in a 2.5 percent rate
reduction. However, we have not resolved certain other issues
identified by the IRS for these tax years and are planning to
contest them. In addition, the IRS has commenced an examination
of our U.S. income tax returns for fiscal years 2000
through 2003. While the ultimate resolution of tax audits
involves a degree of uncertainty, we believe that adequate tax
accruals have been provided for any adjustments that are
expected to result for these years.

The components of the net deferred tax assets as of
March 31, 2005 and 2004 consisted of (in millions):

As of March 31, 2005, net deferred tax assets of
$86 million and $19 million were classified as current
assets and long-term assets, respectively. As of March 31,
2004, net deferred tax assets of $84 million and
$41 million were classified as current assets and long-term
assets, respectively. In addition, deferred tax liabilities of
$2 million were classified as accrued and other liabilities
as of March 31, 2004.

Of the tax credit carryforwards as of March 31, 2005, we
have research and development tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $8 million and $39 million for federal
and California purposes, respectively. The federal tax credit
carryforward expires in 2025, while the California tax credit
can be carried forward indefinitely. We also have foreign tax
credit carryforwards of approximately $4 million that
expire from 2011 to 2012, federal alternative minimum tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $3 million that can be
carried forward indefinitely, and California Manufacturers’
Investment Credit carryforwards of approximately $2 million
that expire from 2008 to 2011. The state tax credit
carryforwards are valued net of $14 million in federal
benefits.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Jobs
Act”), enacted on October 22, 2004, provides for a
temporary 85 percent dividends received deduction on
certain foreign earnings repatriated in our fiscal 2005 or



fiscal 2006. The deduction would result in an approximate
5.25 percent federal tax on a portion of the foreign
earnings repatriated. State, local and foreign taxes could apply
as well. To qualify for this federal tax deduction, the earnings
must be reinvested in the United States pursuant to a domestic
reinvestment plan established by our chief executive officer and
approved by the Board of Directors. Certain other criteria in
the Jobs Act must be satisfied as well. The maximum amount of
our foreign earnings that we may repatriate subject to the Jobs
Act deduction is $500 million.

As stated above, we have historically considered undistributed
earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely
reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. taxes have been
provided thereon. As a result of the Jobs Act, we are in the
process of evaluating whether we will change our intentions
regarding a portion of our foreign earnings and take advantage
of the repatriation provisions of the Jobs Act, and if so, the
amount that we would repatriate. We may not take advantage of
the new law at all. In addition to not having made a decision to
repatriate any foreign earnings, we are not yet in a position to
accurately determine the impact of a qualifying repatriation,
should we choose to make one, on our income tax expense for
fiscal 2006. If we decide to repatriate a portion of our foreign
earnings, we would be required to recognize income tax expense
related to the federal, state, local and foreign taxes that we
would incur on the repatriated earnings when the decision is
made. We estimate that the reasonably possible amount of the
income tax expense could be up to $35 million. We expect to
be in a position to finalize our analysis no later than February
2006.

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

(a)

Preferred Stock

As of March 31, 2005 and 2004, we had
10,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized but
unissued. The rights, preferences, and restrictions of the
preferred stock may be designated by the Board of Directors
without further action by our stockholders.

(b)

Tracking Stock

On March 22, 2000, our stockholders authorized the issuance
of a new series of common stock, designated as Class B
common stock (“Tracking Stock”). The Tracking Stock
was intended to reflect the performance of the EA.com business
segment. As a result of the approval of the Tracking Stock
proposal, our existing common stock was re-classified as
Class A common stock and was intended to reflect the
performance of the EA Core business segment. With the
authorization of the Class B common stock, we transferred a
portion of our consolidated assets, liabilities, revenue,
expenses and cash flows to EA.com Inc., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Electronic Arts.

In March 2003, we consolidated the operations of EA.com back
into our core operations in order to increase efficiency,
simplify our reporting structure and more directly integrate our
online activities into our core console and PC business. As a
result, we eliminated dual class reporting starting in fiscal
2004. The majority of outstanding Class B options and
warrants not directly held by us were acquired or converted to
common stock and warrants.

At our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, held on July 29,
2004, our stockholders elected to amend and restate our
Certificate of Incorporation to consolidate our Class A and
Class B common stock into a single class of common stock by
reclassifying each outstanding share of Class A common
stock as one share of common stock and converting each
outstanding share of Class B common stock into
0.001 share of common stock. Our stockholders also elected
to further amend and restate our Certificate of Incorporation to
increase the authorized common stock from 500 million total
shares of Class A and Class B common stock combined to
1 billion shares of the newly consolidated single class of
common stock. These amendments were effective on August 2,
2004. Prior year Class A common stock has been reclassified
to common stock to reflect these amendments.



(c)

Share Repurchase Program

On October 18, 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a
program to repurchase up to an aggregate of $750 million of
shares of our common stock. Pursuant to the authorization, we
may repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in
the open market or through privately negotiated transactions
over the course of a twelve-month period. During fiscal 2005, we
repurchased and retired 805,500 shares of our common stock
for approximately $41 million.

(12)

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

(a)

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)
program, which commenced in September 1991, whereby eligible
employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to
10 percent of their compensation to purchase shares at
85 percent of the lower of the fair market value of the
common stock on the date of commencement of the offering or on
the last day of the six-month purchase period. A new ESPP
program, the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, was approved by
the Board of Directors in May 2000 and commenced in August 2000.
In addition, we have a stock purchase plan which was adopted
without stockholder approval, the International Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, which was terminated by the Board of Directors in
connection with the amendment of the stockholder-approved Plan
discussed below as of February 2003.

The International Employee Stock Purchase Plan was adopted by
the Board of Directors in June 1996 and amended in October 1998,
February 1999 and February 2002 and is, in all material
respects, identical to the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
approved by the stockholders for U.S. employees. In
February 2003, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to
the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan to segregate provisions of
the Plan for purchases intended to qualify under
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”) for participants residing in the
U.S., from those that are not intended to qualify under
Section 423 of the Code for participants residing outside
of the U.S. Accordingly, we no longer issue common stock
under the International Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

At our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, held on July 29,
2004, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2000
Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares of
common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP by
1.5 million.

Information related to stock issuances under these plans is as
follows:

Year Ended March 31,




Number of shares issued (in thousands)




Range of exercise prices for purchase rights

$38.14 to

$51.35

$22.44 to

$38.14

$22.44 to

$22.87

Estimated weighted-average fair value of purchase rights

$13.96

$9.53

$9.78

The fair value above was estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model assumptions described in
Note 1(o) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. As of March 31, 2005, we had approximately
1.4 million shares of common stock reserved for future
issuance under the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

(b)

Stock Option Plans

Our 2000 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Equity Plan”)
allows us to grant options to purchase our common stock,
restricted stock and restricted stock units to our employees,
officers and directors. Pursuant to the Equity Plan, incentive
stock options may be granted to employees and officers and
non-qualified options may be granted to employees, officers and
directors, at not less than 100 percent of the fair market
value on the date of grant.



At our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, held on July 29,
2004, our stockholders approved amendments to the Equity Plan to
(a) increase by 11 million the number of shares of
common stock reserved for issuance under the Equity Plan,
(b) provide for the issuance of awards of restricted stock
units, (c) limit the total number of shares underlying
awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units to
3 million, (d) provide that the exercise price of
nonqualified stock options may not be less than 100% of the fair
market value of a share of common stock, (e) reduce the
size of initial and annual option grants to directors under the
Equity Plan, and (f) authorize the Compensation Committee
to determine the vesting provisions of options granted to
directors under the Equity Plan.

Our 2000 Class B Equity Incentive Plan (“Class B
plan”) allowed for the award of stock options or restricted
stock for up to an aggregate of 6 million shares of
Class B common stock. The Class B plan included a
provision for automatic option grants to our outside directors.
In February 2003, the Board of Directors amended the
Class B plan to eliminate automatic grants to directors and
to preclude any further awards under the Class B plan. See
Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We also have outstanding options to purchase our common stock
under the following plans, each of which has expired and
pursuant to which no further options may be granted: 1991 Stock
Option Plan, Celebrity and Artist Stock Option Plan
(“Artist Plan”), 1995 Stock Option Plan, and
1993 Directors’ Stock Option Plan (“Expired
Plans”). The Artist Plan was adopted by the Board of
Directors in July 1994 without stockholder approval. The terms
under the Artist Plan were substantially similar to the terms of
the Equity Plan. We also have outstanding options under our
1998 Directors’ Stock Option Plan
(“Directors’ Plan”). Although the Directors’
Plan has not yet expired, we intend for all automatic option
grants to directors to be made under the Equity Plan. In
addition, we have options outstanding that were granted under
the Criterion Software Limited Approved Share Option Scheme (the
“Criterion Plan”), which we assumed in connection with
our 100 percent acquisition of Criterion.

Options granted under the Equity Plan, the Expired Plans, the
Directors’ Plan and the Class B plan generally expire
ten years from the date of grant and are generally exercisable
as to 24 percent of the shares after 12 months, and
then the remainder in monthly increments over 38 months.
All options granted under the Criterion Plan are exercisable as
of March 31, 2005, and expire in January 2012.

At our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, held on July 29,
2004, our stockholders elected to amend and restate our
Certificate of Incorporation to consolidate our Class A and
Class B common stock into a single class of common stock by
reclassifying each outstanding share of Class A common
stock as one share of common stock and converting each
outstanding share of Class B common stock into
0.001 share of common stock. Similarly each outstanding
option to acquire a share of Class B common stock was
converted into an option to acquire 0.001 shares of common

(In thousands, except exercise prices)

Potential dilution is computed by dividing the options in the
related range of exercise prices by the shares of common stock
issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2005
(310 million shares). The weighted-average estimated fair
value of stock options granted during fiscal years 2005, 2004
and 2003 was $17.70, $16.22 and $13.64, respectively. The fair
value was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model assumptions described in Note 1(o) of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



The 40,952 thousand options outstanding have vested or will vest

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

SFAS No. 130,

“Reporting Comprehensive
Income”

, requires classification of comprehensive
income in a financial statement and display of accumulated other
comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and
additional paid-in capital. Accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) primarily includes foreign currency translation
adjustments, and the net of tax amounts for unrealized gains
(losses) on investments and unrealized gains (losses) on
derivatives. Foreign currency translation adjustments are not
adjusted for income taxes as they relate to indefinite
investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries.

The change in the components of accumulated other comprehensive
income, net of tax, is summarized as follows (in millions):



The change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments, net are
shown net of taxes of $1 million in both fiscal years 2005
and 2003. The change in unrealized gains on investments, net for
fiscal 2004 was not material. In each of the last three years,
activity related to derivatives has not been material.

(15)

NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE

The following table summarizes the computations of basic
earnings per share (“Basic EPS”) and diluted earnings
per share (“Diluted EPS”). Basic EPS is computed as
net income divided by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the
potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable
through stock-based compensation plans including stock options,
restricted stock awards, warrants and other convertible
securities using the treasury stock method. Effective
August 2, 2004, each outstanding share of Class A
common stock was reclassified as one share of common stock and
prior year Class A common stock has been reclassified to
reflect these amendments. See Note 11 in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Excluded from the above computation of weighted-average common
stock for Diluted EPS for the fiscal years ended March 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003 were options to
purchase 1 million, 3 million and 6 million
shares of common stock, respectively, as the options’
exercise price was greater than the average market price of the
common stock. For fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, the
weighted-average exercise price of these options was $63.63,
$47.19 and $31.16 per share, respectively.



Due to our fiscal 2003 restructuring related to EA.com, (see
Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements),
Class B net income per share reporting is no longer
required. The Diluted EPS calculation for common stock,
presented above for 2003, included the potential dilution from
the conversion of Class B common stock to common stock in
the event that an initial public offering for Class B
common stock did not occur. Net income used for the calculation
of Diluted EPS for common stock was $317 million for the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2003. This net income included
the remaining interest in EA.com (100 percent of EA.com
losses) which was directly attributable to outstanding
Class B shares owned by third parties, which would have
been included in the common stock EPS calculation in the event
that an initial public offering for Class B common stock
did not occur.

Due to the net loss attributable for the year ended
March 31, 2003 on a diluted basis to Class B
Stockholders, all stock options have been excluded from the
Diluted EPS calculation as their inclusion would have been
antidilutive. Had net income been reported for this period, an
additional 1 million shares would have been added to
diluted potential common stock for Class B common stock for
the year ended March 31, 2003.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

On June 24, 2002, we hired Warren Jenson as our Chief
Financial and Administrative Officer and agreed to loan him
$4,000,000, to be forgiven over four years based on his
continuing employment. The loan does not bear interest. On
June 24, 2004, pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement,
we forgave two million dollars of the loan and provided
Mr. Jenson approximately $1.6 million to offset the
tax implications of the forgiveness. As of March 31, 2005,
the remaining outstanding loan balance was $2,000,000, which
will be forgiven on June 24, 2006, provided that
Mr. Jenson has not voluntarily resigned his employment with
us or been terminated for cause prior to that time. No
additional funds will be provided to offset the tax implications
of the forgiveness of the remaining two million dollars.

In April 2002, we agreed to pay certain taxes incurred by Bruce
McMillan, Executive Vice President, Group Studio Head of EA
Canada, arising from his temporary employment with us in the
United Kingdom. Mr. McMillan agreed to reimburse us for
those payments upon receipt of his corresponding tax refund from
the Canadian taxing authorities. We subsequently paid
approximately $168,704 and $32,931 in October 2002 and April
2003, respectively, to the UK Inland Revenue for taxes incurred
by Mr. McMillan. In May 2003, Mr. McMillan became an
executive officer of Electronic Arts. As of January 22,
2004, Mr. McMillan had repaid us the entire amount of the
tax payments we made on his behalf.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

SFAS No. 131,

“Disclosures About Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information”

, establishes
standards for the reporting by public business enterprises of
information about product lines, geographic areas and major
customers. The method for determining what information to report
is based on the way that management organizes our operating
segments for making operational decisions and assessments of
financial performance.

Our chief operating decision maker is considered to be our Chief
Executive Officer (“CEO”). The CEO reviews financial
information presented on a consolidated basis accompanied by
disaggregated information about revenue by geographic region and
by product lines for purposes of making operating decisions and
assessing financial performance.

In fiscal 2003, we operated and reviewed our business in two
business segments:

•

EA Core business segment: creation, marketing and distribution
    of entertainment software.

•

EA.com business segment: creation, marketing and distribution of
    entertainment software which can be played or sold online,
    ongoing management of subscriptions of online games and web site
    advertising.

In March 2003, we consolidated the operations of the EA.com
business segment into our core business. We consider online
functionality to be integral to our existing and future
products. Accordingly, beginning April 1,



2003, we no longer manage our online products and services as a
separate business segment, and have consolidated our reporting
related to online products and services into our reporting for
the overall development and publication of our core products for
all reporting periods ending after that date. We believe that
this better reflects the way in which the CEO reviews and
manages our business and reflects the importance of the online
products and services relative to the rest of our business.
Concurrently, we also eliminated separate reporting for
Class B common stock for all reporting periods ending after
April 1, 2003.

Our view and reporting of business segments may change due to
changes in the underlying business facts and circumstances and
the evolution of our reporting to our CEO.

Information about our total net revenue by product line for the
fiscal years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is
presented below (in millions):



Information about our operations in North America, Europe and
Asia Pacific for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003 is presented below (in millions):

Our direct sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. represented
approximately 14 percent of total net revenue in fiscal
2005, approximately 13 percent of total net revenue in
2004, and approximately 12 percent of total net revenue in
fiscal 2003.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Electronic Arts Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Electronic Arts Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 26, 2005
and March 27, 2004, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive income, and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
March 26, 2005. In connection with our audits of the
consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the
accompanying financial statement schedule. These consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Electronic Arts Inc. and subsidiaries as of
March 26, 2005 and March 27, 2004, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended March 26, 2005, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in
our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Electronic Arts Inc.’s internal control
over financial reporting as of March 26, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated
June 3, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on
management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of,
internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Electronic Arts Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying “Management’s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting”, that Electronic Arts Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of March 26, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). Electronic Arts Inc.’s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Electronic
Arts Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of March 26, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in Internal
Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Also, in our opinion, Electronic Arts Inc. maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of March 26, 2005, based on criteria
established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Electronic Arts Inc. and
subsidiaries as of March 26, 2005 and March 27, 2004,
and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity and other comprehensive income, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
March 26, 2005, and the financial statement schedule and
our report dated June 3, 2005 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Item 9:

    Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A:

Controls and Procedures

Definition and Limitations of Disclosure Controls

Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act are
controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under
the Exchange Act, such as this report, is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Executive Vice President, Chief Financial
and Administrative Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management
evaluates these controls and procedures on an ongoing basis.

There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any
system of disclosure controls and procedures. These limitations
include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or
overriding of the controls and procedures and reasonable
resource constraints. In addition, because we have designed our
system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we
believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events,
our system of controls may not achieve its desired purpose under
all possible future conditions. Accordingly, our disclosure
controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance, but not
absolute assurance, of achieving their objectives.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President, Chief
Financial and Administrative Officer, after evaluating the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, believe
that as of the end of the period covered by this report, our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing
the requisite reasonable assurance that material information
required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Executive
Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding the required
disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to
provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. There are inherent limitations to the
effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial
reporting. These limitations include the possibility of human
error, the circumvention or overriding of the system and
reasonable resource constraints. Because of its inherent
limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may
not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with our policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of the end of our most
recently completed fiscal year. In making this assessment, our
management used the criteria set forth in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework,

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Based on this assessment, our management believes that, as of
the end of our most recently completed fiscal year, our internal
control over financial reporting was effective.



KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has
issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of
our internal control over financial reporting. That report
appears on page 99.

Changes in Internal Controls

In preparation for management’s report on internal control
over financial reporting, we documented and tested the design
and operating effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting. In connection with these efforts, we
implemented a number of enhancements to our internal control
over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31,
2005, including increased restrictions on access to our
information technology systems and the documentation and
augmentation of existing policies and procedures.
