ITEM 1:  BUSINESS


Overview

         Electronic  Arts was initially  incorporated  in California in 1982. In
September 1991, we were reincorporated under the laws of Delaware. Our principal
executive  offices are  located at 209 Redwood  Shores  Parkway,  Redwood  City,
California 94065 and our telephone number is (650) 628-1500.

We operate in two principal business segments globally:

     o   EA Core  business  segment:  creation,  marketing and  distribution  of
         entertainment software.

     o   EA.com  business  segment:  creation,  marketing  and  distribution  of
         entertainment software which can be played or sold online.

         EA Core

         We create, market and distribute interactive entertainment software for
a  variety  of  hardware  platforms.  As of March 31,  2000,  our  business  was
comprised of the following:

     o   Distribution  of over 100 titles  that we  developed  and/or  published
         under one of our brand names in North America,  including  older titles
         marketed as "Classics" or "Publisher's Choice."

     o   Distribution  of localized  versions of our products in the rest of the
         world.

     o   Distribution of approximately  20 additional  titles developed by other
         software  publishers  (that we refer to as Affiliated  Labels) in North
         America  and  titles we have  assisted  in the  development  with other
         software publishers (referred to as Co-Published titles).

     o   Distribution of over 1,000 Affiliated Label and Co-Published  titles in
         the rest of the world.

     Since our inception,  we have developed  products for 38 different hardware
platforms, including the following:


     o   IBM(R) PC and compatibles

     o   16-bit Sega(TM) Genesis(TM) video game system

     o   16-bit Super Nintendo Entertainment System(R)

     o   32-bit Sony PlayStation(R)

     o   64-bit Nintendo(R) 64

     o   128-bit Sony PlayStation 2





     Our product  development methods and organization are modeled on those used
in the  entertainment  industry.  We also market our  products  with  techniques
borrowed from other entertainment  companies such as record producers,  magazine
publishers and video distributors.  Employees whom we call "producers",  who are
responsible  for  the  development  of one or  more  products,  oversee  product
development  and  direct  teams  comprised  of both our  employees  and  outside
contractors.  Our designers regularly work with celebrities and organizations in
sports,  entertainment  and other areas to develop  products that provide gaming
experiences  that are as realistic and interactive as possible.  Celebrities and
organizations  with whom we have contracts include:  FIFA, NASCAR,  John Madden,
the National  Basketball  Association,  the PGA TOUR,  Tiger Woods, the National
Hockey League,  World Championship  Wrestling Inc., Football Association Premier
League and Formula One. We maintain  development studios in California,  Canada,
United Kingdom,  Florida,  Texas,  Japan,  Washington,  Maryland,  Australia and
Nevada.





         We  invest  in the  creation  of  state-of-the-art  software  tools and
utilities that are then used in product development.  These tools allow for more
cost-effective  product  development and the ability to more efficiently convert
products from one hardware platform to another. We have also made investments in
facilities and equipment to facilitate the creation and editing of digital forms
of video and audio recordings and product  development  efforts for new hardware
platforms.

         We distribute our products and those of our Affiliated Labels primarily
by direct sales to retail chains and outlets in the United States and Europe. In
Japan and the Asia Pacific  region,  we  distribute  products  both  directly to
retailers  and through third party  distributors.  Our products are available in
over 79,000 retail locations worldwide. In fiscal 2000, approximately 40% of our
net revenues  were  generated by  international  operations,  compared to 42% in
fiscal 1999 and 43% in fiscal 1998.

         EA.com

         On March 22, 2000,  the  stockholders  of Electronic  Arts voted on and
approved a proposal (the "Tracking Stock Proposal") to authorize the issuance of
a new series of common stock to be designated as Class B common stock ("Tracking
Stock"),  intended to reflect the  performance  of  Electronic  Arts' online and
e-Commerce  division  ("EA.com").  As a result of the  approval of the  Tracking
Stock Proposal, Electronic Arts' existing common stock has been re-classified as
Class A  common  stock  ("Class  A  Stock")  and that  stock  will  reflect  the
performance of Electronic Arts' other businesses ("EA Core").

         EA.com, a division of Electronic Arts Inc., represents Electronic Arts'
online and e-Commerce business.  EA.com's online business includes  subscription
revenues   collected  for  Internet   game  play  on  our  websites,   sales  of
Internet-based  games and sales of Electronic  Arts products sold through EA.com
websites.  Electronic  Arts began  development  of its initial  online  product,
Ultima Online  during  fiscal year 1996. We shipped  Ultima Online during fiscal
year 1998, and began  development of our online  business  during the same year.
EA.com's  websites  include EA.com,  individual sites for Electronic Arts' games
and the Games  Channel on America  Online,  which will be launched in the second
half of calendar 2000. Our goal is to be the leading online games site. To date,
the  majority of our  subscription  revenues  and  packaged  goods  revenues for
online-only  games have been generated by Ultima Online and Ultima  Online:  The
Second Age,  (collectively  referred to as Ultima  Online).  The  packaged  good
product  is  sold  through  our  traditional  distribution  channel  to  various
retailers.  The Ultima Online  product is then sold by the retail channel to the
end customer who must sign up for EA.com's  online  service to enjoy online play
on a  month-to-month  subscription  basis.  For a more detailed  description  of
EA.com's online business,  see Appendix IV of the Notice of Special Stockholders
Meeting and Proxy Statement dated March 22, 2000.

Investments and Joint Ventures

         Acquisitions

         Kesmai Corporation

         On February 7, 2000, we acquired Kesmai Corporation (now referred to as
"Kesmai")  from  News  America   Corporation   ("News  Corp")  in  exchange  for
$22,500,000  in cash  and  approximately  103,000  shares  of  Electronic  Arts'
existing  common stock valued at $8,650,000.  The  transaction was accounted for
under the purchase  method.  Kesmai(TM) is managed by EA.com and  specializes in
the design and development of multiplayer games delivered  directly to consumers
over the Internet and is a major  provider of game content to the Games  Channel
on the AOL  service.  The issuance of these  shares was  temporary,  pending the
authorization of Class B common stock. Subsequently,  on March 22, 2000, Class B
shares  were  authorized.  The Company  granted 5 percent of the initial  equity
attributable  to  EA.com  to  News  Corp,   adjusting  the  total  common  stock
consideration relating to the acquisition by $703,000 to $9,353,000. The Company
has contributed  Kesmai to the EA.com division.  See note 13 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, included in item 8 hereof.

         Westwood Studios

         In September  1998, we completed the  acquisition of Westwood  Studios,
Inc.  and  certain  assets  of  the  Irvine,   California-based  Virgin  Studios
(collectively  "Westwood") for  approximately  $122,688,000  in cash,  including
transaction  expenses.  The  transaction  was  accounted  for under the purchase
method.  Westwood is best known for its  successful PC  franchises,  Command and
Conquer  and  Lands  of  Lore.  See  note 13 of the  Notes  to the  Consolidated
Financial Statements, included in item 8 hereof.

         ABC Software

         In July 1998,  we acquired  ABC Software  AG, in  Switzerland,  and ABC
Software GmbH, in Austria  (collectively  "ABC"),  independent  distributors  of
entertainment,   edutainment  and  application   software,   for   approximately
$9,466,000  in cash (net of cash





acquired of $5,099,000) and $570,000 in other consideration. The transaction has
been  accounted for under the purchase  method.  See note 13 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, included in item 8 hereof.

         Other Business Combinations

         Additionally,  during  fiscal 2000 and fiscal  1999,  we acquired  four
software  development  companies.  See  note  13 of the  Notes  to  Consolidated
Financial Statements, included in item 8 hereof.

         Joint Ventures

         In May 1998, Electronic Arts and Square Co., Ltd. ("Square"), a leading
developer  and  publisher  of  entertainment  software in Japan,  completed  the
formation  of two new joint  ventures,  in North  America  and  Japan.  In North
America,  the companies formed Square  Electronic Arts, LLC ("Square EA"), which
has  exclusive  publishing  rights  in  North  America  for  future  interactive
entertainment  PlayStation  titles  created  by  Square.  We own a 30%  minority
interest in this joint venture while Square owns 70%. Additionally,  we have the
exclusive right to distribute in North America products  published by this joint
venture.

         In Japan,  the  companies  established  Electronic  Arts Square KK ("EA
Square KK"),  which  localizes and publishes in Japan our properties  originally
created in North America and Europe, as well as develops and publishes  original
video games in Japan. We own a 70% majority interest, while Square owns 30%. See
note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  included in item
8 hereof.

         Investments

         We have made  investments as part of our overall strategy and currently
hold minority equity interests in several  companies.  As of March 30, 2000, our
minority equity investments include  investments in NovaLogic,  Inc. and Firaxis
Software, Inc.

Market

         Historically,  no hardware  platform or video game system has  achieved
long-term  dominance in the interactive  entertainment  market.  In fiscal 2000,
Sony's  PlayStation  was the  dominant  hardware  platform in our  industry.  In
addition,  the installed base of  multimedia-enabled  home computers,  including
those with Internet  accessibility,  has continued to grow as personal computer,
or PC,  prices have  declined  and the  quality  and  choices of  software  have
increased dramatically.  We develop and publish products for multiple platforms,
and this diversification continues to be a cornerstone of our strategy.




         Sega

         Sega  launched  DreamcastTM  in  Japan  in  December  1998 and in North
America in September 1999. Sega designed  Dreamcast to combine features from the
console and PC platforms.  We currently have no products in development  for the
Sega Dreamcast.  See Risk Factors - "New video game platforms create  additional
technical and business model uncertainties".

         Sony

         Sony released the  PlayStation  2 console in Japan in March 2000.  Sony
has announced the release of the  PlayStation 2 console in the United States and
Europe in the fall of 2000.  The  PlayStation  2 console is a  128-bit,  Digital
Versatile Disk ("DVD") based system that is Internet and cable ready, as well as
backward compatible with the current PlayStation console software.  We currently
have various products under development for the Sony PlayStation 2 console.  See
Risk  Factors - "New  video  game  platforms  create  additional  technical  and
business model uncertainties".





         Nintendo

         Nintendo announced that it will release a next generation system,  code
named Dolphin, in the first half of 2001. Dolphin will offer a DVD drive.

         Microsoft

         Microsoft  announced  that it expects to release  its first  video game
system, code named Xbox(TM),  in the fall of 2001.

         New Entrants

         New  entrants  into  the  interactive   entertainment   and  multimedia
industries,  such as cable  television,  telephone,  and  diversified  media and
entertainment  companies,  in addition to a proliferation  of new  technologies,
such as online networks and the Internet,  have increased the competition in our
markets.  We are scheduled to release  several online  network  gaming  products
during  fiscal  2001.  See Risk  Factors  - "New  video  game  platforms  create
additional  technical  and  business  model  uncertainties"  and "The  impact of
e-Commerce and online games on our business is not known ".

         The early investment in products for the 32-bit market,  including both
Compact Disk personal computer (or PC) and dedicated entertainment systems (that
we call video game systems or  consoles),  has been  strategically  important in
positioning  us for the current  generation  of 32-bit and 64-bit  machines.  We
believe that such investment continues to be important. PlayStation has achieved
significant market acceptance in all geographical  territories.  However, as the
PlayStation  console  market has matured and the next  generation  consoles  are
introduced,  we expect  sales of current  PlayStation  products to  decline.  In
addition,  our revenues  and  earnings are  dependent on our ability to meet our
product release schedule and our failure to meet those schedules could result in
revenues  and  earnings  which  fall  short  of  analysts'  expectations  in any
individual  quarter.  See Risk  Factors -  "Product  development  schedules  are
frequently unreliable and make predicting quarterly results difficult".

         Online Games

         According to the market research firm, Jupiter  Communications,  online
gamers  (defined as  individuals  who have played  online  games within the past
year) are  expected to grow to 26.8 million  Internet  users by 2002 up from 3.7
million  Internet  users in 1998.  Jupiter  expects  total online  gaming market
revenue to grow to $2 billion by 2002.  We believe  the  expected  increases  in
online gaming will be primarily attributable to the following factors:

     o   Increasing popularity of PC gaming,

     o   Growing interest in multiplayer games,

     o   Growth in the number of households with PCs and Internet connections,

     o   General  growth  in  internet  usage,  including  the  number of users,
         communities and increased frequency of use by consumers,

     o   Rapid innovation of new online entertainment experiences,

     o   Mass market adoption of broadband technologies, and

     o   Decreasing costs of Internet access.

Competition

         EA Core

         See Risk Factors - "Our platform  licensors  are our chief  competitors
and frequently control the manufacturing of our video game products".

         EA.com

We believe EA.com faces  substantial  competition  from a number of existing and
potential competitors including:

     o   Console & PC Game  Publishers.  Other game  publishers  including  Sony
         Computer  Entertainment of America ("Sony"),  Nintendo,  Sega,  Hasbro,
         Mattel, Acclaim, Havas, Microsoft, Interplay, Infogrames and Eidos, are
         each  developing   individual   online  games  and  games  with  online
         components.  Currently,  Sony  (including the online  divisions of Sony
         Entertainment)  may  have  the  broadest   collection  of  online  game
         offerings,  which includes the online game, Everquest,  a virtual world
         that directly  competes with EA.com's  Ultima Online game. In addition,
         Sony operates the Sony Station, a site that offers family-oriented game
         shows.   Each  of  these   competitors  may  compete  with  EA.com  for
         advertising, subscription and e-Commerce sales.





     o   Portals.  With respect to advertising and e-Commerce sales, EA.com will
         also  compete with  general  purpose  consumer web sites such as Yahoo,
         Excite,  Lycos,  and  Microsoft  Network.  In  addition,  many of these
         Internet portals offer gaming sites such as Yahoo Games Channel, Excite
         Games Channel, Lycos Games Channel, and Microsoft Gaming Zone. Although
         most of the game areas of these  portals have  attained  modest  reach,
         their  key  placement  on  powerful   portals  makes  them  potentially
         significant competitors for gaming subscriptions as well.

     o   Family  Oriented  Game  Sites.  A number of sites  such as  Uproar.com,
         Gamesville.com,  Disney's go.com,  Shockwave.com and Pogo.com (formerly
         TEN),  have  driven  significant  amounts of traffic to their  sites by
         offering unique games and entertainment  content. In addition,  several
         of the sites offer frequent prizes with easy to play "gamettes".  These
         sites are typically monetizing their traffic by selling advertising.

     o   Aggregators.  Aggregators  such  as  Hearme.com,  Pogo.coom,  Microsoft
         Gaming Zone and Heat.net,  provide an  aggregation  of various types of
         online games,  including  aggregation of games developed by independent
         third parties. While these sites have been primarily focused on serving
         the  gaming  community,  they have since  adjusted  their  strategy  to
         include games, such as parlor games, that reach a broader audience.

     o   Sports Sites. Sports content sites such as ESPN.com, Sportsline.com and
         Foxsports.com  typically  feature fantasy league games and easy to play
         sports "gamettes" in addition to their editorial content.  Such fantasy
         league  games and sports  "gamettes"  typically  appeal to the  overall
         sports fan,  rather than the sports  gamer.  However,  these sites have
         significant  financial and content resources at their disposal and will
         provide competition for advertising and e-Commerce sales.

     o   Microsoft  Gaming Zone  ("MGZ").  Microsoft  falls into a number of the
         foregoing categories, as it is a portal, an aggregator, and a publisher
         of PC Software Products,  including game products. As such, Microsoft's
         offerings are the closest parallel to the proposed offerings of EA.com.
         MGZ currently  offers both family games and games directed  towards the
         more  serious  gamer and,  at the same  time,  has the  opportunity  to
         leverage these experiences with games sold at retail.  At present,  MGZ
         offers  matchmaking  for about 80 games  and  offers  approximately  20
         playable  online  games,  which  consist  primarily  of card and parlor
         games.

Relationships with Significant Hardware Platform Companies

         Sony

         In fiscal 2000, approximately 41% of our net revenues were derived from
sales of software for the  PlayStation  compared to 43% in fiscal  1999.  During
fiscal 2000,  we released 30  PlayStation  games  compared to 21 in fiscal 1999.
Among these releases were FIFA 2000,  Tomorrow Never Dies,  Madden NFL 2000, NBA
2000 and  Knockout  Kings(TM)  2000.  The  volume  of  sales of our  PlayStation
products  significantly  increased  in  fiscal  2000  due to more  titles  being
released  in the  current  fiscal  year  compared  to the prior  year.  Sony has
announced  the  release of the  PlayStation  2 console in the United  States and
Europe in the fall of 2000.  Although our PlayStation  products will be playable
on the PlayStation 2 console, we expect sales of current PlayStation products to
decline in fiscal 2001.  See Risk Factors - "Product  development  schedules are
frequently unreliable and make predicting quarterly results difficult".

         Under  the  terms of a  licensing  agreement  entered  into  with  Sony
Computer  Entertainment  of  America  in July 1994 (the  "Sony  Agreement"),  as
amended,  we are authorized to develop and distribute CD-based software products
compatible with the PlayStation.  Pursuant to the Sony Agreement, we engage Sony
to supply its  PlayStation  CDs for  distribution  by us.  Accordingly,  we have
limited  ability to control our supply of  PlayStation CD products or the timing
of their  delivery.  See Risk Factors - "Our  platform  licensors  are our chief
competitors  and  frequently   control  the  manufacturing  of  our  video  game
products".

         Nintendo

         During fiscal 2000, we released eight titles for the N64(R) compared to
nine titles in fiscal 1999. In fiscal 2000, approximately 8% of our net revenues
were derived from the sale of N64 products compared to 12% in 1999. The decrease
in N64 revenues for fiscal 2000 compared to the same period last year was due to
the weak market for N64 products as well as strong  comparisons  of World Cup 98
in the prior year.  We expect  revenues from N64 products to continue to decline
significantly in fiscal 2001.

         Under the terms of the N64 Agreement, we engage Nintendo to manufacture
our N64 cartridges for distribution by us. Accordingly,  we have limited ability
to control  our supply of N64  cartridges  or the  timing of their  delivery.  A
shortage of  microchips  or other  factors  outside our control could impair our
ability to obtain an adequate supply of cartridges.





          In connection with our purchases of N64 cartridges for distribution in
North America,  Nintendo  requires us to provide  irrevocable  letters of credit
prior to Nintendo's acceptance of purchase orders from us for purchases of these
cartridges.  For  purchases  of N64  cartridges  for  distribution  in Japan and
Europe,  Nintendo  requires  us to make  cash  deposits.  Furthermore,  Nintendo
maintains a policy of not accepting returns of N64 cartridges.  Because of these
and  other  factors,   the  carrying  of  an  inventory  of  cartridges  entails
significant capital and risk. See Risk Factors - "Our platform licensors are our
chief  competitors and frequently  control the  manufacturing  of our video game
products".

Relationships with Internet Service Providers

         America Online, Inc. ("AOL")

         Our agreement with AOL establishes the basis for EA.com's creation of a
games site on the world wide web that will be available to AOL  subscribers  via
the Games Channel on the AOL's  flagship ISP service and to other  consumers who
use other AOL portals (AOL.com, CompuServe,  Netscape/Netcenter, ICQ and Digital
City) as their base for  navigating  the web.  Users will also be able to access
the  EA.com  website  directly  from the world  wide web.  EA.com  will be AOL's
exclusive  provider of a broad  aggregation of online games and will program and
manage all of the Games Channel content within AOL's flagship ISP service in the
United States. In addition,  EA.com will program and manage the game channels on
AOL.com,  CompuServe,  Netcenter/Netscape  and  ICQ.  Within  any of  these  AOL
properties,  users  will be able to find a  games  channel  or area  which  will
provide  the user  access to EA.com  games.  According  to the April  2000 Media
Metrix reports,  the total number of unique monthly  visitors to the AOL branded
properties that will have access to the EA.com games site was 53 million. Via an
anchor tenant location, EA.com will also be a non-exclusive provider of games on
AOL's Digital City  property,  the leading  branded  local  content  network and
community  guide on the AOL service and the  Internet.  For the terms of the AOL
agreement,  see  Note 5 of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,
included in item 8 hereof.

Products and Product Development

         In fiscal 2000,  we generated  approximately  56% of our revenues  from
products  released  during the year.  See Risk  Factors -  "Product  development
schedules  are  frequently  unreliable  and make  predicting  quarterly  results
difficult".  As of March 31, 2000, we were actively  marketing  over 100 titles,
comprising  over 150 stock keeping units,  or sku's,  that were published by our
development  divisions  and  subsidiaries,  EA Studios.  During  fiscal 2000, we
introduced over 48 EA Studios titles, representing over 69 sku's, compared to 38
EA Studios titles, comprising over 59 sku's, in fiscal 1999.

         The  products  published  by EA Studios are designed and created by our
in-house   designers  and  artists  and  by  independent   software   developers
("independent  artists").  We typically pay the  independent  artists  royalties
based  on  the  sales  of the  specific  products,  as  defined  in the  related
independent artist agreements.

         For fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, no title  represented  revenues greater
than 10% of the total fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998 net revenues.

         We publish  products in a number of categories  such as sports,  action
and interactive movies, strategy,  simulations, role playing and adventure, each
of which is becoming  increasingly  competitive.  Our  sports-related  products,
marketed under the EA Sports brand name, accounted for a significant  percentage
of net revenues in fiscal years 2000 and 1999. There can be no assurance that we
will be able to maintain our market share in the sports category.

         The front line retail  selling prices in North America of our products,
excluding  older  titles  (marketed as  "Classics"  and  "Publisher's  Choice"),
typically  range from  $35.00 to $55.00.  "Classics"  and  "Publisher's  Choice"
titles have retail selling  prices that range from $10.00 to $30.00.  The retail
selling  prices of EA titles outside of North America vary based on local market
conditions.

         We currently  develop or publish  products for five different  hardware
platforms.   In  fiscal  2000,  our  product  releases  were  predominantly  for
PlayStation,  PC and N64. Our planned product  introductions for fiscal 2001 are
predominantly for the PC,  PlayStation,  PlayStation 2, online Internet play and
N64. See Risk Factors - "Product development schedules are frequently unreliable
and make predicting  quarterly results  difficult" and "New video game platforms
create additional technical and business model uncertainties".

         Compact disks are the preferred  medium for interactive  entertainment,
education, and information software, therefore, we are continuing our investment
in the development of CD-ROM tools and  technologies in fiscal 2001. We are also
investing in the development of DVD tools and  technologies  associated with the
introduction of the next generation video game console platforms. Our goal is to
be the market leader on the next generation of video game consoles.  We are also
increasing  the  investment in the  development  of tools and  technologies  for
online Internet game play and wide-area network  infrastructure.  Our goal is to
be  the  leading   provider  of  interactive   entertainment  on  the  Internet.
PlayStation has achieved significant market acceptance in all geographic





territories, however, as the PlayStation console market has reached maturity, we
expect sales of current PlayStation  products to decline in fiscal 2001. Most of
the console video game products will be convertible for use on multiple advanced
hardware systems. We had research and development expenditures of $260.8 million
in fiscal  2000,  $199.1  million in fiscal 1999,  and $145.7  million in fiscal
1998.  See  Risk  Factors  -  "Product  development   schedules  are  frequently
unreliable and make predicting quarterly results difficult".

         EA.com Web Site

         Content. EA.com intends to offer games within three broad categories of
interest: sports, family entertainment, and avid gaming. Each channel will focus
on targeting and serving its specific consumer group by:

     o   Offering engaging and accessible online games;

     o   Building a community in which  consumers  can interact with one another
         via chat,  bulletin  boards,  events,  and  match-making  services  for
         multi-player games and other contests;

     o   Delivering innovative content that continually entertains; and

     o   Establishing a direct  relationship  with each audience  member through
         personalization and customization of user experiences.

         In addition,  the product  offering of each broad category will include
existing  Electronic Arts franchises  adapted for game play on the Internet,  as
well as additional  original  games for online play.  EA.com's  products will be
offered  to  consumers  within the  appropriate  "channels"  on the site.  It is
anticipated that the offerings will incorporate some or all of the following:

     o   Sports.   EA.com  intends  to  leverage   existing   Electronic   Arts'
         franchises,  such as  PGA(R)  Tour/Tiger  Woods  Golf(R)  and  Knockout
         Kings(TM), to develop a community of sports gamers. In addition, EA.com
         will offer unique,  original online sports gaming  experiences,  sports
         game shows and  support of existing EA  packaged  goods  products  with
         services such as matchmaking,  game updates, product downloads and game
         tips.

     o   Family Entertainment.  The EA.com family games offering will consist of
         card games,  board games,  casino games,  trivia games,  game shows and
         other products with mass-market appeal. This channel will leverage cash
         prizes, merchandise prizes, tournaments and community.

     o   Avid Gaming.  The general gaming offering will be directed at teens and
         adults  looking to  participate  in games made up of fantastic  worlds,
         characters,  adventures or  activities--big or small, real or imagined.
         This offering will feature immersive experiences and sophisticated game
         play  appealing  to  dedicated   gamers,   as  well  as  new  forms  of
         cutting-edge Internet  entertainment.  This offering will capitalize on
         the success of our existing Ultima Online product as well as Electronic
         Arts' existing packaged goods franchises.

Marketing and Distribution

         Electronic Arts Distribution

         We distribute EA Studio, Affiliated Label and Co-Published products.

         Affiliated  Label  products are delivered to us as completed  products.
Co-Published  products  are titles we have  assisted  in  developing  with other
software  publishers.  As of March 31, 2000,  we  distributed  approximately  20
Affiliated  Label  and  Co-Published  titles  in North  America  and over  1,000
Affiliated  Label and  Co-Published  titles in the rest of the world.  No single
Affiliated Label Publisher has accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue in
any of the last three fiscal years.

         In May 1998,  Electronic  Arts and Square Co., Ltd.  formed a new joint
venture in North America,  creating Square Electronic Arts, LLC ("Square EA") as
discussed  in note 13 in the  Notes to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,
included  in item 8 hereof.  In  conjunction  with the  formation  of this joint
venture,  we have the exclusive  right in North  America to distribute  products
published  by this joint  venture.  In fiscal 2000,  Square EA  published  Final
Fantasy  VIII for the  PlayStation,  which  was a top  five  selling  title  for
Electronic Arts.

         We generated  approximately 90% of our North American net revenues from
direct sales to retailers  through a field sales  organization of  professionals
and a group of telephone sales  representatives.  The remaining 10% of our North
American sales were made through a limited  number of  specialized  and regional
distributors and rack jobbers in markets where we believe direct sales would not
be economical.  For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2000 and March 31, 1999, we
had sales to one customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., which represented 12% of total
net revenues.  We had no sales to any one customer in excess of 10% of total net
revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1998.





         The  video  game and PC  businesses  have  become  increasingly  "hits"
driven,   requiring   significantly   greater  expenditures  for  marketing  and
advertising,  particularly for television advertising. There can be no assurance
that we will  continue to produce  "hit"  titles,  or that  advertising  for any
product will increase sales sufficiently to recoup those advertising expenses.

         We have  stock-balancing  programs for our personal  computer  products
that, under certain  circumstances and up to a specified  amount,  allow for the
exchange of personal computer  products by resellers.  We also typically provide
for price  protection for our personal  computer and video game system  products
that,  under certain  conditions,  allows the reseller a price reduction from us
for unsold  products.  We  maintain a policy of  exchanging  products  or giving
credits, but do not give cash refunds. Moreover, the risk of product returns may
increase as new hardware  platforms  become more popular or market factors force
us to make changes in our distribution  system. We monitor and manage the volume
of our sales to retailers and distributors and their  inventories as substantial
overstocking  in the  distribution  channel  can  result in high  returns or the
requirement for substantial price protection in subsequent  periods.  We believe
that we provide  adequate  reserves for returns and price  protection  which are
based on estimated future returns of products,  taking into account  promotional
activities,  the timing of new product  introductions,  distributor and retailer
inventories of our products and other factors.  We believe our current  reserves
will be sufficient to meet return and price protection  requirements for current
in-channel inventory.  However, there can be no assurance that actual returns or
price protection will not exceed our reserves.

         We also  have a  fulfillment  group  that  sells  product  directly  to
consumers  through  a  toll-free  number  and  through  our  websites  listed in
advertising by us and our Affiliated Labels.  This group is also responsible for
targeted  direct mail  marketing and sells product  backups and  accessories  to
registered customers.

         The distribution  channels through which consumer software products are
sold have been characterized by change,  including  consolidations and financial
difficulties  of certain  distributors  and  retailers  and the emergence of new
retailers  such as general mass  merchandisers.  The  development  of remote and
electronic delivery systems will create further changes. The bankruptcy or other
business  difficulties  of a distributor  or retailer  could render our accounts
receivable from such entity uncollectible, which could have an adverse effect on
our operating results and financial condition. In addition, an increasing number
of companies are competing for access to these channels.  Our arrangements  with
our  distributors  and  retailers  may be terminated by either party at any time
without cause. Distributors and retailers often carry products that compete with
ours.  Retailers of our products  typically have a limited amount of shelf space
and promotional  resources for which there is intense competition.  There can be
no assurance  that  distributors  and  retailers  will  continue to purchase our
products  or  provide  our  products  with  adequate  levels of shelf  space and
promotional support.

Segment Reporting

As a result of the approval of the Tracking Stock proposal to authorize issuance
of a new series of common stock designated as Class B common stock,  intended to
reflect  the  performance  of  EA.com,  management  considers  EA.com a separate
reportable segment.  Accordingly,  prior period information has been restated to
disclose  separate  segments.  The Company  operates in two  principal  business
segments globally:

     o   EA Core  business  segment:  creation,  marketing and  distribution  of
         entertainment software.

     o   EA.com  business  segment:  creation,  marketing  and  distribution  of
         entertainment software which can be played or sold online.

Please see the discussion regarding segment reporting in the MD&A and Note 18 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

International Operations

         We have  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  throughout  the world,  including
offices in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Germany, Australia,  Canada, South
Africa,  Singapore,  Sweden, Japan, Malaysia, Brazil and Holland. The amounts of
net revenues,  operating profit and identifiable  assets attributable to each of
our geographic  regions for each of the last three fiscal years are set forth in
Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  included in item
8 hereof.

         International net revenues increased by 11% to $573,374,000,  or 40% of
consolidated  fiscal  2000 net  revenues,  compared to  $516,865,000,  or 42% of
consolidated fiscal 1999 net revenues due to the following:

     o   Europe's net revenues  increased by 11% primarily due to an increase in
         sales of PC titles  including  Command and Conquer:  Tiberian  Sun, Sim
         City 3000 and The Sims as well as an increase in  PlayStation  revenues
         due to the success of FIFA 2000,





         Tomorrow Never Dies and F1 2000.  These increases were partially offset
         by an  expected  decline  in sales of N64  products.  Overall  European
         revenues were adversely  impacted by a devaluation of the Euro compared
         to the same period last year.

     o   Asia  Pacific's  net revenues  increased 20% due to PC sales of Command
         and Conquer: Tiberian Sun and Sim City 3000.

     o   Japan's net  revenues  were flat  compared  to the prior  year.  PC and
         Affiliated   Label  revenues   increased,   offset  by  a  decrease  in
         PlayStation  product sales  primarily due to strong sales of FIFA: Road
         to World Cup and World Cup 98 in the prior year.

         Though  international  revenues  are  expected to grow in fiscal  2001,
international  revenues  may not grow at as high a rate as in prior  years.  See
Risk Factors - "Our business,  our products, and our distribution are subject to
increasing  regulation  in key  territories"  and  "Foreign  Sales and  Currency
Fluctuations".

Manufacturing and Suppliers

         Materials

         In  many   instances,   we  are  able  to   acquire   materials   on  a
volume-discount  basis.  We have multiple  potential  sources of supply for most
materials,  except  with  respect  to  our  PlayStation  and  N64  products,  as
previously  mentioned.  We also have alternate  sources for the  manufacture and
assembly of most of our products.  To date, we have not experienced any material
difficulties  or delays in production of our software and related  documentation
and  packaging.  However,  a shortage of components or other factors  beyond our
control  could  impair our ability to  manufacture,  or have  manufactured,  our
products.  See Risk Factors - "Our platform  licensors are our chief competitors
and frequently control the manufacturing of our video game products".

         Consultants

         As of  March  31,  2000,  approximately  25%  of  the  staff  creating,
designing and  developing  the  infrastructure  of EA.com's  website and network
interface is being provided by outside  consultants such as Andersen  Consulting
and Proxicom.  See Risk Factors - "If we do not maintain our  relationship  with
outside  consultants  such as Andersen  Consulting and Proxicom,  our ability to
develop our online business will be impaired".

Backlog

         We normally ship products  within a few days after receipt of an order.
However,  a backlog may occur for EA Studio and  Affiliated  Label products that
have been announced for release but not yet shipped.  We do not consider backlog
to be an indicator of future performance.

Seasonality

         Our business is highly  seasonal.  We typically  experience our highest
revenues and profits in the calendar  year-end holiday season and a seasonal low
in revenues and profits in the quarter  ending in June. In our 2001 fiscal year,
and  particularly in the June and September  quarters,  we expect these seasonal
trends to be  magnified  by general  industry  factors,  including  the  current
platform  transition and the concentration of our product releases in the second
half of fiscal 2001. In addition,  we are continuing to invest  significantly in
our online  operation,  EA.com.  Accordingly,  we expect  significant  operating
losses  in the  first  half  of  fiscal  2001.  See  Risk  Factors  -  "Platform
transitions such as the one now occurring typically depress the market for video
game software  until new platforms  achieve a wide market  acceptance"  and "Our
business is both seasonal and cyclical".

Employees

         As of March 31, 2000, we employed  approximately  3,100 people, of whom
over  1,300  were  outside  the  United  States.  Of  this  amount,  there  were
approximately  300 EA.com  full-time  employees.  We believe that our ability to
attract and retain qualified  employees is an important factor in our growth and
development  and that our future success will depend,  in large measure,  on our
ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees.  To date, we have
been  successful in recruiting  and  retaining  sufficient  numbers of qualified
personnel  to conduct our  business  successfully.  See Risk  Factors - "We face
intense  competition  for talent  from highly  valued  Internet  companies"  and
"Because of the intense competition for qualified technical, creative, marketing
and other  personnel,  we may not be able to attract  and  retain the  personnel
necessary for our business".





ITEM 2:  PROPERTIES

         Our  principal  administrative,   sales  and  marketing,  research  and
development,  and support facility is located in two modern buildings in Redwood
City, California,  20 miles south of San Francisco.  We moved into this facility
in October  1998.  We presently  occupy  approximately  350,000 sq. ft. in these
buildings under an operating lease for the buildings and certain  adjoining land
that will expire on December 1, 2001. Monthly lease payments vary based upon the
London  InterBank  Offered Rate. We have the option to purchase the property for
the  unamortized  financed  balance at any time after the  non-cancelable  lease
term, or we may terminate the lease at any time after the non-cancelable term by
arranging a third party sale or by making a termination  payment. In April 1999,
we exercised our option to purchase a parcel of land under the lease and sold it
to a third party.  The proceeds will  mitigate a portion of the occupancy  costs
for this facility.  Should we elect to terminate the lease,  we will guarantee a
residual value of up to 85% of the unamortized value of the property. As part of
the agreement, we must also comply with certain financial covenants.

         Our North American distribution is supported by a newly centralized and
expanded  warehouse  facility in Louisville,  Kentucky occupying 250,000 sq. ft.
The Hayward  distribution  center was closed in fiscal 2001 in conjunction  with
the expansion of our Louisville, Kentucky facility. We also occupy sales offices
in the metropolitan areas of Toronto, Chicago, Dallas and New York.

         In addition to our Redwood City  development  studio,  we own a 206,000
sq. ft.  development  facility in Burnaby,  British Columbia,  Canada and rent a
33,000 sq. ft.  facility in Seattle,  Washington.  The move to the new  Canadian
offices was  completed in June 1999.  We also own a 180,000 sq. ft.  development
facility in Austin, Texas, and lease development  facilities in Walnut Creek and
Carlsbad, California and Charlottesville, Virginia.

         We own a 101,000 sq.ft.  administrative and sales facility in Chertsey,
England,  which our  United  Kingdom  subsidiary  moved into in March  2000.  In
Europe,   we  also  lease  a  distribution  hub  in  Heerlen,   Holland  and  an
administrative   and  sales  facilities  in  Germany,   as  well  as  sales  and
distribution  facilities  in: Madrid,  Spain;  Johannesburg,  South Africa;  and
Sennwald  Switzerland.  Additionally,  we have sales and administrative  offices
throughout Europe.

         In Asia and the South  Pacific,  we maintain a 5,500 sq. ft.  sales and
distribution   facility  in  Brisbane,   Australia.   We  also  have  sales  and
distribution  facilities in Singapore,  Malaysia and Taiwan,  and representative
offices in Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai, China. We also maintain a 27,000 sq.
ft.  sales and  development  office in Tokyo,  Japan.  See Notes 4 and 11 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 hereof.

         We believe that these facilities are adequate for our current needs. We
believe that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed
to accommodate our future needs.





ITEM 3:  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         We are  subject to pending  claims and  litigation.  Management,  after
review and  consultation  with counsel,  considers  that any liability  from the
disposition of such lawsuits  would not have a material  adverse effect upon our
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.


ITEM 4:  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

         At the Company's  Special  Meeting of  Stockholders,  held on March 22,
2000, the following matters were voted upon by the Stockholders:

ITEM 7:  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS

The following  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" contains  forward-looking  statements about circumstances
that have not yet occurred. All statements, trend analysis and other information
contained below relating to markets, our products and trends in revenue, as well
as other statements including words such as "anticipate",  "believe" or "expect"
and  statements  in the  future  tense  are  forward-looking  statements.  These
forward-looking statements are subject to business and economic risks and actual
events or our actual future results could differ materially from those set forth
in the forward-looking  statements due to such risks and uncertainties.  We will
not necessarily update information if any forward-looking  statement later turns

and  performance  include,  but are not  limited  to those  discussed  under the
heading "Risk Factors" at pages 36 to 41 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Comparison of Fiscal 2000 to 1999:

Revenues

We derive revenues  primarily from shipments of  entertainment  software,  which
includes EA Studio  products for dedicated  entertainment  systems (that we call
video game systems or consoles such as  PlayStation  and Nintendo 64), EA Studio
personal  computer  products (or PC), and Affiliated Label (or AL) products that
are published by third parties and  distributed or  co-published  by us. We also
derive  revenues  from  licensing  of EA Studio  products and  Affiliated  Label
products through hardware companies (or OEMs) and online subscription revenues.


North America Net Revenues

The increase in North  America net  revenues for fiscal 2000  compared to fiscal
1999 was primarily attributable to:

 o       A 52%  increase  in PC  revenues  due to strong  sales of  Command  and
         Conquer:  Tiberian  Sun,  Sim City 3000 as well as the  fourth  quarter
         shipment of The Sims in fiscal 2000.

 o       A 20%  increase in  PlayStation  revenues  due to more titles  released
         during  fiscal 2000  including  Madden NFL 2000,  NBA 2000 and Tomorrow
         Never Dies as compared to fiscal 1999.

 o       A 17% increase in AL revenues  primarily  due to the shipment of titles
         published  by Square EA offset by the loss of an  affiliate,  Accolade,
         due to its  acquisition  by a third  party in the first  quarter of the
         current fiscal year.

 o       These increases were partially  offset by an expected  decline in sales
         of Nintendo 64 ("N64") products.

International Net Revenues

The increase in  international  net revenues for fiscal 2000  compared to fiscal
1999 was attributable to the following:

 o       Europe's net revenues  increased by 11% primarily due to an increase in
         sales of PC titles  including  Command and Conquer:  Tiberian  Sun, Sim
         City 3000 and The Sims as well as an increase in  PlayStation  revenues
         due to the success of FIFA 2000, Tomorrow Never Dies and F1 2000. These
         increases were partially  offset by an expected decline in sales of N64
         products.  Overall  European  revenues  were  adversely  impacted  by a
         devaluation of the Euro compared to the same period last year.


 o       Asia  Pacific's  net revenues  increased 20% due to PC sales of Command
         and Conquer: Tiberian Sun and Sim City 3000.

 o       Japan's net  revenues  were flat  compared  to the prior  year.  PC and
         Affiliated   Label  revenues   increased,   offset  by  a  decrease  in
         PlayStation  product sales  primarily due to strong sales of FIFA: Road
         to World Cup and World Cup 98 in the prior year.



Personal Computer Product Net Revenues

We released 31 PC titles in fiscal 2000 compared to 29 PC titles in fiscal 1999.
The worldwide increase in sales of PC revenues was primarily  attributable to an
increase in sales in North  America and Europe due to the success of Command and
Conquer:  Tiberian  Sun  released  in the  second  quarter  of  fiscal  2000 and
continued  strong  catalog sales of Sim City 3000 released in the fourth quarter
of fiscal  1999.  Other key titles in the current year include The Sims and FIFA
2000.

We expect  revenues from PC products to grow in fiscal 2001, but as revenues for
these products increase, they may not grow at the current rate.

PlayStation Product Net Revenues

We released 30 new  PlayStation  titles in fiscal 2000  compared to 21 in fiscal
1999. The increase in PlayStation  product sales was attributable to more titles
released in the current  fiscal year compared to the same period last year.  Key
releases for the year include FIFA 2000,  Tomorrow Never Dies,  Madden NFL 2000,
NBA 2000 and Knockout Kings(TM) 2000.

Sony has announced the release of the PlayStation 2 console in the United States
and  Europe  in the fall of 2000.  Although  our  PlayStation  products  will be
playable on the  PlayStation 2 console,  we expect sales of current  PlayStation
products to decline in fiscal 2001.

Under the  terms of a  licensing  agreement  entered  into  with  Sony  Computer
Entertainment of America in July 1994 (the "Sony Agreement"), as amended, we are
authorized  to develop and  distribute  software  products  compatible  with the
PlayStation.  Pursuant  to the Sony  Agreement,  we engage  Sony to  manufacture
PlayStation Compact Disks for distribution by us.  Accordingly,  we have limited
ability to control  our supply of  PlayStation  products  or the timing of their
delivery.

Affiliated Label Product Net Revenues

AL product sales increased due to higher sales in North America. The increase in
Affiliated  Label revenues  compared to the same period last year was due to the
distribution of titles by Square EA, including Final Fantasy(R) VIII,  partially
offset by the termination of our distribution agreement with Accolade, which was
acquired by a third party.

N64(R) Product Net Revenues

The  expected  decrease in N64  revenues  for fiscal  2000  compared to the same
period last year was due to the weak  market for N64  products as well as strong
comparisons  of World Cup 98 in the prior  year.  We  released  eight  titles in
fiscal 2000,  including WCW(TM) Mayhem,  compared to nine titles in fiscal 1999.
We expect revenues from N64 products to decline significantly in fiscal 2001.

Under the terms of the N64 Agreement,  we engage Nintendo to manufacture our N64
cartridges  for  distribution  by us.  Accordingly,  we have  little  ability to
control our supply of N64 cartridges or the timing of their delivery. A shortage
of microchips  or other factors  outside our control could impair our ability to
obtain an adequate supply of cartridges.




In connection  with our purchases of N64  cartridges for  distribution  in North
America,  Nintendo requires us to provide irrevocable letters of credit prior to
Nintendo's  acceptance  of  purchase  orders  from  us for  purchases  of  these
cartridges.  For  purchases  of N64  cartridges  for  distribution  in Japan and
Europe,  Nintendo  requires  us to make  cash  deposits.  Furthermore,  Nintendo
maintains a policy of not accepting returns of N64 cartridges.  Because of these
and  other  factors,   the  carrying  of  an  inventory  of  cartridges  entails
significant capital and risk.

Online Subscription Revenues

Online  subscription  revenues are revenues  collected for Internet game play on
our  websites.  The  increase in online  revenues for fiscal 2000 as compared to
fiscal 1999 was attributable to the following:

 o       The average number of paying  customers for Ultima Online  increased to
         over  140,000 for fiscal  2000 as  compared  to over  105,000 in fiscal
         1999.

 o       The increase in paying  customers was due to continued  strong sales of
         Ultima Online,  the addition of new events within the Ultima worlds and
         the  release  of Ultima  Online:  The Second  Age(TM) in October  1998.
         Ultima  Online:  The Second Age added  features  including  new worlds,
         monsters and an in-game chat feature.

 o       We established  servers for Ultima Online in Europe in June 1999 and in
         Japan in October 1998.  This local dial-in  capability  resulted in new
         customers  in those  territories  for the fiscal  2000,  as compared to
         fiscal 1999.

License, OEM and Other Revenues

The  increase  in  license,  OEM and other  revenues  was  primarily  due to the
following:

 o       License/OEM  revenues  increased due to the sales of  Gameboy(R)  Color
         titles in the current fiscal year.

 o       Other revenues decreased primarily due to decreases in 32-bit products,
         other than PlayStation,  as we are no longer publishing games for those
         platforms.

Operations by Segment

As a result of the  approval  of the  Tracking  Stock  proposal  (see Note 2) to
authorize  issuance of a new series of common stock designated as Class B common
stock,  intended  to reflect the  performance  of EA.com,  management  considers
EA.com a separate reportable segment. Accordingly,  prior period information has
been  restated to disclose this  separate  segment.  We operate in two principal
business segments globally:

 o       Electronic Arts core ("EA Core") business segment: creation,  marketing
         and distribution of entertainment software.

 o       EA.com  business  segment:  creation,  marketing  and  distribution  of
         entertainment software which can be played or sold online.

EA.com, a division of Electronic Arts Inc.,  represents  Electronic Arts' online
and e-Commerce  businesses.  EA.com's  business includes  subscription  revenues
collected for Internet game play on our  websites,  sales of packaged  goods for
Internet-only based games and sales of Electronic Arts games sold through EA.com
websites.  The  statement of income  includes  all  revenues and costs  directly
attributable to EA.com,  including charges for shared facilities,  functions and
services  used by EA.com and  provided by  Electronic  Arts.  Certain  costs and
expenses  have been  allocated  based on  management's  estimates of the cost of
services provided to EA.com by Electronic Arts.







The  increase in net  revenues  for EA.com for fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal
1999 was attributable to the following:

 o       Higher online revenues from increased subscriptions to Ultima Online.

 o       Higher internet-based e-Commerce revenues.

 o       Partially  offset by lower Ultima Online packaged  product revenues due
         to the decrease in the average selling price.

Cost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues  decreased in
fiscal 2000 due to:

 o       An  increase  in sales of higher  margin PC titles as a  percentage  of
         revenues.

 o       An increase in sales of higher margin AL co-published titles which make
         up a greater amount of total AL revenues as compared to the prior year.





 o       A decrease in sales of lower margin N64 titles.

 o       Higher average margin for PC sales due to higher percentage of revenues
         from internally developed and Intellectual  Property owned titles, such
         as Command and Conquer: Tiberian Sun, Sim City 3000 and The Sims.

 o       Partially  offset  by a  decrease,  as a  percentage  of  revenues,  of
         PlayStation products.

Marketing and Sales.  Marketing and sales expenses increased in absolute dollars
by 15% primarily attributed to:

 o       Increased  print,  Internet and  television  advertising to support new
         releases.

 o       Increased  cooperative  advertising  associated with higher revenues in
         North America and Europe as compared to the prior year.

 o       Additional   headcount  related  to  the  continued  expansion  of  our
         worldwide distribution business.

General and  Administrative.  General and  administrative  expenses increased in
absolute dollars by 21% primarily due to:

 o       An increase in payroll and  occupancy  costs to support the increase in
         growth in North America and Europe.

 o       Increased  general  and  administrative  spending  for  EA.com.  EA.com
         expanded its staff and incurred additional administrative related costs
         required to support  growth of the business.  We anticipate a continued
         increase in the absolute  dollars  spent on general and  administrative
         related expenses for EA.com.

Research and  Development.  The increase in absolute dollars by 31% for research
and development expenses (including Network Development and Support) was due to:

 o       Increased  research  and  development   spending  due  to  the  ongoing
         investment  in our  online  business.  EA.com  increased  the number of
         online  projects in development  and increased  development  staff.  We
         believe that continued spending for EA.com game development is critical
         to the  growth of the  business  and to meet  certain  targeted  launch
         commitments.  EA.com  intends to increase the number of online games in
         development  and  significantly  increase  development  and  production
         staff. As a result,  research and development  expenses are expected to
         increase in absolute dollars.

 o       Additional  headcount-related  expenses  attributable  to the increased
         in-house  development  capacity and a higher number of SKUs released in
         fiscal 2000.

 o       An  increase  in  development  spending  for  next  generation  console
         products including development for the PlayStation 2 console.

We released a total of 69 new  products in fiscal 2000  compared to 59 in fiscal
1999.

Network Development and Support. The increase in network development and support
expenses was due to:

 o       The ongoing investment in our online business.

 o       EA.com's  network and  development  support  expenses  increased due to
         increased  spending for network  infrastructure  in preparation for new
         online  products  and the EA.com game site.  In  addition,  we incurred
         higher  infrastructure  costs related to increased  server capacity for
         Ultima  Online,  allowing  EA.com  to serve a higher  number  of active
         subscribers.

We expect  network  development  and  support  expenses  to increase in absolute
dollars in the future.

Charge for Acquired In-Process Technology.

Fiscal 2000:

 o       In connection  with the  acquisition  of Kesmai by EA.com in the fourth
         fiscal quarter of fiscal 2000, we allocated and expensed  $3,869,000 of
         the  purchase  price to  acquired  in-process  technology.  Kesmai  had
         various projects in progress at the time of the acquisition.  As of the
         acquisition  date,  costs to complete  Kesmai  projects  acquired  were
         expected to be approximately  $10,550,000 in future periods. We believe
         there have been no significant  changes to these  estimates as of March
         31, 2000.  We currently  expect to complete  the  development  of these
         projects  at various  dates  through  fiscal  2002 and to  publish  the
         projects upon completion.  In conjunction with the merger of Kesmai, we
         accrued approximately  $200,000 related to direct transaction and other
         related  costs.  At March 31,  2000 there  were  $133,000  in  accruals
         remaining related to these items.

 o       In connection with the acquisitions of two development  companies by EA
         Core, made in the 2nd and 4th quarters of fiscal 2000, we allocated and
         expensed  $2,670,000  of the  purchase  price  to  acquired  in-process
         technology.

Fiscal 1999:

 o       In connection  with the acquisition of Westwood by EA Core in September
         1998, we allocated and expensed  $41,836,000  of the purchase  price to
         acquired in-process technology.

 o       Additionally,  in  connection  with  the  acquisition  of two  software
         development  companies by EA Core, in the first quarter of fiscal 1999,
         we  incurred  a total  charge of  $2,279,000  for  acquired  in-process
         technology.





These charges were made after we concluded  that the  in-process  technology had
not reached  technological  feasibility and had no alternative  future use after
taking into  consideration  the potential for usage of the software in different
products and resale of the software.

Amortization of Intangibles.  The amortization of intangibles  results primarily
from the acquisitions of Westwood,  Kesmai,  ABC Software and other acquisitions
made in fiscal 2000. Amortization of intangibles was $10,866,000 for EA Core and
$1,123,000 for EA.com.

Interest and Other Income,  Net.  Interest and other income,  net,  increased in
absolute  dollars  primarily  due to  realized  gains  on  sales  of  marketable
securities  and the sale of our  interest  in an  affiliate.  Those  gains  were
partially  offset by a write-off of a note  receivable  from an affiliate in the
current year as well as a gain on sale of land recognized in the prior year.

Income  Taxes.  Our  effective  tax rate was 31.0% for fiscal 2000 and 38.3% for
fiscal 1999.  The  effective tax rate was lower than the  comparable  prior year
period  (excluding  the  effect  of the  one-time  charges  in the  prior  year)
primarily  as a result of a higher  portion of  international  income for fiscal
2000  subject to a lower  foreign tax rate as  compared  to the prior year.  Our
effective tax rate for fiscal 1999 was  negatively  affected as there was no tax
benefit recorded for a portion of the charges related to the acquired in-process
technology.  Excluding the effect of these  charges,  the effective tax rate for
fiscal 1999 would have been 32.0%.

Net Income. In absolute dollars,  reported net income increased by 60% primarily
related to higher revenues and gross profits as compared to the same period last
year.  The increase was also due to  significant  one-time  charges for acquired
in-process  technology in the prior year.  This was  partially  offset by higher
costs  incurred by EA.com for the  development of online  projects,  the network
infrastructure development and higher infrastructure costs for Ultima Online and
Ultima  Online:  The Second Age.  Excluding  the  one-time  charges  relating to
acquired in-process technology of $4,512,000, net of taxes, in the current year,
net income would have been $121,263,000. Excluding the one-time charges relating
to acquired  in-process  technology  of  $37,506,000,  net of taxes in the prior
year, net income would have been $110,378,000.

Excluding  one-time  charges  related  to  acquired  in-process  technology  and
goodwill amortization,  net income would have been $129,535,000 for fiscal 2000.
Excluding  one-time  charges  relating to  acquired  in-process  technology  and
goodwill amortization, net income would have been $114,376,000 for fiscal 1999.

                                ================================================


North America Net Revenues

The increase in North America net revenues was mainly attributable to:

 o       Strong  growth  in N64  and  PlayStation  systems.  Net  revenues  from
         PlayStation  and N64  increased  51% due to a larger market and greater
         installed  base for these  platforms as well as more title releases for
         N64 in comparison to the prior year.

 o       AL sales  increased 53% compared to the prior year primarily due to the
         distribution of products published by Square EA.

 o       PC revenues increased 11% due to key title releases during the year.





International Net Revenues

The increase in  international  net revenues for fiscal 1999  compared to fiscal
1998 was attributable to the following:

 o       Europe's net revenues  increased  primarily due to an increase in sales
         of PlayStation and Affiliated Label products.

 o       Japan's net revenues increased primarily due to the sales of FIFA: Road
         to World Cup 98.

 o       Offset by a decrease in Asia  Pacific net  revenues due to the weakness
         in Asian currencies. In local currency, in spite of weak economies, net
         revenues for Asia Pacific increased compared to the prior year.




PlayStation Product Net Revenues

We released 21 new  PlayStation  titles in fiscal 1999  compared to 25 in fiscal
1998. The increase in PlayStation  product sales was attributable to the greater
installed base of  PlayStation  game consoles and the releases of key titles for
this platform including FIFA 99, World Cup 98 and Madden NFL 99.

Personal Computer Product Net Revenues

We released 29 PC titles in fiscal 1999 compared to 30 PC titles in fiscal 1998.
The worldwide increase in sales of PC products was primarily  attributable to an
increase in sales in Europe and North America due to the related releases of key
titles for this platform including SimCity 3000.

N64 Product Net Revenues

The increase in N64 revenues was primarily  due to more title  releases for this
platform  compared to the prior year and a larger N64 market.  We released  nine
titles in fiscal 1999,  including NASCAR(R) 99, compared to two titles in fiscal
1998.

Affiliated Label Product Net Revenues

AL product sales increased due to higher sales in North America and Europe. This
increase was primarily attributable to the distribution of products published by
Square EA in North America and the acquisition of ABC Software in Switzerland.

Online Subscription Revenues

The  increase in online  revenues for fiscal 1999 as compared to fiscal 1998 was
attributable  to the  following:

 o       The  average  paying  customers  for Ultima  Online  increased  to over
         105,000 for fiscal 1999 as compared to over 74,000 for fiscal 1998, due
         to continued  strong  sales of Ultima  Online and the release of Ultima
         Online:  The Second Age in the third  quarter  of fiscal  1999.  Ultima
         Online: The Second Age added features such as new worlds,  monsters and
         in-game chat features.

 o       EA.com  established  servers  providing  local dial-in  capability  for
         Ultima Online in Japan in the third quarter of fiscal 1999. We only had
         servers in North America in fiscal 1998.

License, OEM and Other Revenues

The decrease in license, OEM, online and other revenues was primarily due to the
following:

 o       Net  revenues  derived  from  32-bit  products  other than  PlayStation
         decreased primarily due to lower sales of Sega Saturn(R)  products.  We
         released no new Sega Saturn  titles in fiscal 1999 compared to eight in
         fiscal 1998.

 o       Net revenues  generated by 16-bit video game  cartridge-based  products
         decreased  in fiscal  1999 as compared  to fiscal  1998.  As the 16-bit
         video game market has been  replaced by 32-bit and 64-bit  systems,  we
         did not release any new titles in fiscal 1999.





 o       Licensing of EA Studio products  increased  primarily as a result of an
         increase in the  revenues  generated  by  licensing  of our products in
         Europe.

Operations by Segment







The  increase in net  revenues  for EA.com for fiscal 1999 as compared to fiscal
1998 was mainly attributable to the following:

 o       Higher online revenues from subscriptions for Ultima Online: The Second
         Age, the upgrade to Ultima Online.

 o       Mitigated by lower product  revenues from Ultima Online for fiscal 1999
         as compared to fiscal 1998.

Cost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues  decreased in
fiscal 1999 primarily due to lower artist  royalties,  including savings related
to  an  acquisition  of a  software  development  company  during  fiscal  1999,
partially offset by higher sales of lower margin N64 products.

Marketing  and Sales.  Marketing  and sales  expenses  increased  27%  primarily
attributed to:

 o       Increased  print,  Internet and  television  advertising to support new
         releases.

 o       Increased  cooperative  advertising  associated with higher revenues in
         North America and Europe as compared to the prior year.

 o       Additional   headcount  related  to  the  continued  expansion  of  our
         worldwide distribution business.

 o       The acquisitions of ABC Software and Westwood Studios.

General and  Administrative.  General and administrative  expenses increased 32%
primarily  due to an increase in headcount  and  occupancy  costs to support the
increase in growth in North America and Europe operations, including the opening
of  additional  international  offices  in  Europe  and the  acquisition  of ABC
Software.

Research  and  Development.  The  increase in absolute  dollars for research and
development expenses (including Network Development and Support) was due to:

 o       Additional  headcount-related  expenses attributable to the acquisition
         of  Westwood   Studios,   Inc.  and  certain   assets  of  the  Irvine,
         California-based  Virgin Studio (collectively  "Westwood") in September
         1998 and Tiburon Entertainment, Inc. in April 1998.

 o       Higher  development  costs per title,  as products are  including  more
         content and are more complex and time consuming to develop.

 o       An increase in development costs for Ultima Online.

 o       A higher number of projects in  development  in fiscal 1999 as compared
         to fiscal 1998 for EA.com

We released a total of 59 new  products in fiscal 1999  compared to 71 in fiscal
1998.

Network Development and Support. The increase in network development and support
expenses  for  EA.com  was  due  to  higher  design,  engineering  and  software
maintenance costs associated with the Ultima Online worlds.

Charge for Acquired  In-Process  Technology.  In connection with the purchase of
Westwood in  September  1998,  we  allocated  and  expensed  $41,836,000  of the
$122,688,000  purchase price to in-process  research and  development  projects.
This allocation  represents the estimated fair value based on risk-adjusted cash
flows related to the incomplete research and development  projects.  At the date
of  acquisition,  this  amount was  expensed  as a  non-recurring  charge as the
in-process technology had not yet reached  technological  feasibility and had no
alternative future uses. Westwood had three major PC projects in progress at the
time of the acquisition including two in the best-selling  franchise Command and
Conquer and one in the critically  acclaimed Lands of Lore(TM) series. As of the
acquisition date, costs to complete the Westwood projects acquired were expected
to be  approximately  $9.1 million in fiscal 1999,  $10.6 million in fiscal 2000
and $1.0  million  in fiscal  2001.  We believe  there have been no  significant
changes to these  estimates.  We currently expect to complete the development of
these  projects at various dates through fiscal 2001 and to publish the products
upon completion.

The nature of the efforts required to develop the acquired in-process technology
into commercially  viable products  principally  relate to the completion of all
planning,  designing  and testing  activities  necessary to  establish  that the
product  can be produced to meet our design  requirements  including  functions,
features and technical performance requirements. Though we currently expect that
the acquired in-process technology will be successfully developed,  there can be
no assurance  that  commercial or technical  viability of these products will be
achieved.   Furthermore,  future  developments  in  the  entertainment  software
industry, changes in computer or video game console technology, changes in other
product  offerings or other  developments may cause us to alter or abandon these
plans.

The  value  assigned  to  purchased  in-process  technology  was  determined  by
estimating the completion  percentage of research and development efforts at the
acquisition date,  forecasting risk adjusted revenues considering the completion
percentage,  estimating  the  resulting  net cash  flows from the  projects  and
discounting  the  net  cash  flows  to  their  present  values.  The  completion
percentages  were  estimated  based on cost incurred to date,  importance of the
completed  development  tasks and the elapsed portion of the total project time.
The revenue projection used to value the in-process  research and development is
based on unit sales  forecasts for worldwide  sales  territories and adjusted to
consider only the revenue related to development  achievements  completed at the
acquisition  date. Net cash flow estimates include cost of goods sold and sales,
marketing and general and administrative  expenses and taxes forecasted based on
historical operating characteristics.  In addition, net cash flow estimates were
adjusted to allow for fair return on working  capital and fixed assets,  charges
for  franchise  and  technology   leverage  and  return  on  other  intangibles.
Appropriate risk adjusted





discount  rates  ranging  from 20% to 22.5% were used to  discount  the net cash
flows back to their present value. The remaining identified  intangibles will be
amortized  on a  straight-line  basis over two to twelve years based on expected
useful  lives of  franchise  tradenames,  existing  products  and  technologies,
retention of workforce,  and other intangible  assets. If these projects are not
successfully  developed, we may not realize the value assigned to the in-process
research and  development  projects.  In addition,  the value of other  acquired
intangible assets may also become impaired.

In conjunction with the merger of Westwood, we accrued approximately  $1,500,000
related to direct  transaction  costs and other related  accruals.  At March 31,
2000, there were $500,000 in accruals remaining related to these items.

Additionally,   for  fiscal  1999,  the  charge  for  in-process   research  and
development  also  included   write-offs  of  $2,279,000   associated  with  the
acquisition of two software development companies in the first quarter.

For fiscal 1998,  we incurred a charge of  $1,500,000  for  acquired  in-process
technology  in  connection  with the  acquisition  of the remaining 35% minority
ownership interest in Electronic Arts Victor, Inc. in December 1997. This charge
was made after we concluded  that the  in-process  technology had no alternative
future  use after  taking  into  consideration  the  potential  for usage of the
software in different products and resale of the software.

Amortization  of  Intangibles.  Amortization  of  intangibles  results  from the
acquisitions of Westwood and ABC Software in the second quarter of fiscal 1999.

Merger  Costs.  On July 25,  1997,  we  completed  a  merger  with  Maxis,  Inc.
("Maxis").  In  conjunction  with the merger,  we recorded  costs of $10,792,000
which included direct transaction fees and costs associated with integrating the
operations  of the two  companies.  At March 31,  1999,  there were no  accruals
remaining related to these merger costs.

Operating Income. Operating income increased due to:

 o       Higher net  revenues  and  related  gross  profit  partially  offset by
         increased   operating  expenses  including  the  charges  for  acquired
         in-process technology of $44,115,000 in the current fiscal year.

 o       Partially  offset  by  merger  costs of  $10,792,000  and a charge  for
         acquired   in-process   technology   of   $1,500,000   related  to  the
         acquisitions in the prior fiscal year.

Excluding  one-time items in both years, as noted above,  operating income would
have been $149,393,000 in fiscal 1999 and $95,741,000 in fiscal 1998.

Interest and Other Income,  Net. The decrease in interest and other income, net,
was primarily attributable to the sale of our 50% ownership interest in Creative
Wonders,  LLC in December 1997. The sale resulted in a gain in the prior year of
$12,625,000.

Income Taxes.  Electronic Arts' effective tax rate was 38.3% for fiscal 1999 and
33.0% for fiscal 1998.  Our  effective  tax rate for fiscal 1999 was  negatively
affected  as there was no tax  benefit  recorded  for a portion  of the  charges
related to the acquired  in-process  technology.  Excluding  the effect of these
charges,  the  effective  tax rate for  fiscal  1999  would  have been  32.0% as
compared to a 33.0% tax rate for fiscal  1998.  The lower rate of 32.0%  results
primarily  from a higher  portion  of  international  income  subject to a lower
foreign  tax rate as  compared  to the prior year and an increase in the federal
research and experimental credit.

Minority Interest in Consolidate Joint Venture.

 o       In the first  quarter of fiscal  1999,  we formed EA Square KK which is
         seventy percent owned by us and thirty percent owned by Square Co. Ltd.
         ("Square"), a leading developer and publisher of entertainment software
         in Japan.  Minority  interest for fiscal 1999  represents  Square's 30%
         interest in the net income of EA Square KK.

 o       For fiscal 1998, the minority interest  represented the 35% interest in
         Electronic  Arts Victor,  Inc.  ("EAV")  owned by Victor  Entertainment
         Industries,  Inc.  ("VEI").  We acquired  the  remaining  35%  minority
         ownership interest in EAV held by VEI in December 1997.

Net  Income.  In  absolute  dollars,  reported  net  income  was flat due to the
one-time  charges  related  to  acquisitions  offsetting   significantly  higher
operating income. The increase in net income,  excluding  one-time charges,  was
due to higher revenues and gross profits, partially offset by higher spending on
development  of online  projects,  higher  support  costs for Ultima  Online and
Ultima  Online:  The  Second  Age,  and  higher  network   infrastructure  costs
associated with Ultima Online worlds.





 o       For  fiscal  1998,  net  income  included  a  one-time  gain on sale of
         Creative Wonders, LLC in the amount of $8,459,000, net of taxes, offset
         by Maxis merger costs and a charge for acquired in-process developments
         of $8,236,000, net of taxes.

 o       For fiscal  1999,  net income  included  one-time  charges for acquired
         in-process technology of $37,506,000, net of taxes.

Excluding  one-time items in both years, as noted above, net income increased to
$110,378,000 in fiscal 1999 from $72,339,000, or 53% over fiscal 1998.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

         As of March 31, 2000, our working capital was $440,021,000  compared to
$333,256,000  at  March  31,  1999.   Cash,  cash   equivalents  and  short-term
investments increased by approximately  $26,982,000 in fiscal 2000. We generated
$45,336,000  of cash from  operations  in fiscal  2000  which was  reduced  by a
payment of $36,000,000 to AOL as discussed  below. In addition,  $85,589,000 was
provided  through  the sale of  equity  securities  under  our  stock  plans and
$20,000,000 was provided  through the sale of shares of Class B common stock and
warrants to AOL.

         Reserves for bad debts and sales returns  decreased from $72,850,000 at
March 31, 1999 to $65,067,000 at March 31, 2000.  Reserves have been charged for
returns of product and price  protection  credits  issued for  products  sold in
prior  periods.  Management  believes  these  reserves  are  adequate  based  on
historical  experience  and  its  current  estimate  of  potential  returns  and
allowances.

         During fiscal 2000, we invested $22,500,000 in cash for the acquisition
of Kesmai and  $22,096,000  for other  acquisitions  made  during  the year.  In
addition, we invested approximately $37,400,000 for new facilities in Europe and
Canada and $61,400,000 in computer equipment worldwide.

         Our  principal  source  of  liquidity  is  $339,804,000  in cash,  cash
equivalents and short-term  investments.  Management believes the existing cash,
cash  equivalents,   short-term  investments,  marketable  securities  and  cash
generated  from  operations  will be  sufficient  to meet  cash  and  investment
requirements  of  Electronic  Arts and EA.com for the next twelve months and the
foreseeable future.

         Included in the amounts above is the following for the EA.com business:

o        To date EA.com has been funded  solely by  Electronic  Arts  (including
         proceeds  from the sale of stock to AOL in the amount of  $20,000,000).
         This  funding  has been  accounted  for as capital  contributions  from
         Electronic  Arts.  Excess cash generated from operations is transferred
         to Electronic  Arts, and has been accounted for as a return of capital.
         We anticipate these funding  procedures will continue in the near-term.
         However,  Electronic  Arts may,  at its  discretion,  provide  funds to
         EA.com under a debt arrangement,  instead of treating such funding as a
         capital contribution.

o        During  fiscal  2000,  EA.com used  $68,329,000  of cash in  operations
         (including payments to AOL of approximately  $36,000,000),  $37,605,000
         in capital expenditures for computer equipment, network infrastructure,
         internal use software and related third party software,  $1,499,000 for
         an investment in a 3rd party developer, $32,539,000 for the acquisition
         of Kesmai and  another  acquisition,  offset by  $140,410,000  provided
         through capital contributions from Electronic Arts.

o        During fiscal 1999,  EA.com used  $9,086,000 of cash in operations  and
         $1,881,000  in capital  expenditures  for computer  equipment,  network
         infrastructure  and related  software,  offset by $10,967,000  provided
         through the capital contribution from Electronic Arts.

         EA.com  is  required  to  pay  $50,000,000  to AOL  as a  carriage  fee
(including certain advertising fees of which $604,000 was expensed in the twelve
months  ended  March  31,  2000)  under  the  AOL  agreement.  Of  this  amount,
$25,000,000 was paid upon signing the agreement and the remainder is due in four
equal  annual  installments  on the  first  four  anniversaries  of the  initial
payment.  Payment  of  the  first  annual  installment  of  $6,250,000  will  be
accelerated to June 1, 2000 since certain launch requirements will not be met by
that date.  EA.com is also required to pay to AOL $31,000,000 as an advance of a
minimum  guaranteed  revenue share for revenues  generated by subscriptions  and
other  certain  commercial  transactions  on the EA.com  site.  Of this  amount,
$11,000,000  was paid upon signing of the  agreement and the remainder is due in
four equal annual installments on the first anniversary of the initial payment.

         EA.com also made a commitment  to spend  $15,000,000  in offline  media
advertisements  promoting our online games,  including those on the AOL service,
during the term of the AOL agreement.

         Future  liquidity  needs of EA.com  will be met by  Electronic  Arts as
Electronic Arts intends to continue to fund the cash  requirements of EA.com for
the foreseeable future.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In December 1999, the  Securities and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") issued Staff
Accounting  Bulletin No. 101("SAB 101"),  "Revenue  Recognition," which outlines
the basic criteria that must be met to recognize  revenue and provides  guidance
for





presentation  of revenue  and for  disclosure  related  to  revenue  recognition
policies in financial  statements  filed with the SEC. SAB 101 is effective  for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1999,  except, as amended by SAB 101A,
registrants with fiscal years that begin between December 16, 1999 and March 15,
2000 may  report a change  in  accounting  principle  no later  than the  second
quarter of fiscal  years  beginning  after  December  15,  1999.  We believe the
adoption of SAB 101 will not have a material  impact on our  financial  position
and results of operations.

In March 2000, the Emerging  Issues Task Force issued No. 00-02 ("EITF  00-02"),
"Accounting for Web Site  Development  Costs".  EITF 00-02 states that all costs
relating to software used to operate a web site and relating to  development  of
initial  graphics and web page design should be accounted for using Statement of
Position ("SOP") 98-1. Under this SOP, costs incurred in the preliminary project
stage  should  be  expensed  as  incurred,  as  should  most  training  and data
conversion  costs.  External direct costs of materials and services and internal
direct  payroll-related  costs should be capitalized  once certain  criteria are
met. EITF 00-02 is effective for all fiscal  quarters  beginning  after June 30,
2000.  We do not  expect a  significant  impact on our  consolidated  results of
operations, financial position or cash flows on the EITF's effective date.

In March 2000, the Emerging  Issues Task Force issued No. 00-03 ("EITF  00-03"),
"Application of AICPA SOP 97-2, "Software Revenue  Recognition," to Arrangements
That Include the Right to Use  Software  Stored on Another  Entity's  Hardware",
which  discusses  the  effect on  revenue  recognition  of a  software  vendor's
obligation to host its software that previously was licensed to a customer.  The
EITF has reached the  conclusion  that, if the customer is unable to utilize the
software on the customer's  hardware or contract with another party unrelated to
the vendor to host the  software,  then the  arrangement  with the  customer  is
outside  the scope of SOP 97-2 and should be treated as a service  contract.  We
may be  required  to change the  timing of our  revenue  recognition  related to
product revenues. We believe the adoption of EITF 00-03 will not have a material
impact on our financial position and results of operations.

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of  Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  133  ("SFAS  133")  "Accounting  for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", which establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities.  SFAS 133
is  effective  as of the  beginning  of the first  quarter  of the  fiscal  year
beginning  after June 15, 2000. We are determining the effect of SFAS 133 on our
financial statements.

In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants  ("AICPA")
issued SOP 98-1,  "Accounting  for the Costs of Computer  Software  Developed or
Obtained  for  Internal  Use".  SOP 98-1  requires  that  consulting,  hardware,
software and direct  payroll-related costs associated with the implementation of
customized internal-use software be capitalized and amortized over the estimated
useful life of the  software.  These costs relate to game site  application  and
infrastructure  design and  development,  as well as costs  related to providing
customer  account  management  and  building  in  e-Commerce  functionality  and
interfaces.  SOP 98-1 is effective  for financial  statements  issued for fiscal
years  beginning  after  December  15,  1998.  As of  March  31,  2000,  we have
capitalized  $26,318,000 of these costs  associated with the effort to build and
support the EA.com game sites at launch.

YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE

Year 2000 Status

         As of the date of this filing,  we have not  incurred  any  significant
business  disruptions  as a result of Year 2000 issues.  However,  while no such
occurrence  has  developed,  Year  2000  issues  that may arise  related  to key
suppliers and service  providers may not become  apparent  immediately.  We have
received  assurances of Year 2000  compliance  from key suppliers.  We have also
received  assurances from key service providers such as financial  institutions,
our payroll service provider,  and our retirement plan administrator as to their
Year 2000  readiness.  We will  continue  to  monitor  our own  systems  and our
business partners to identify and address any potential risk situations  related
to the Year 2000.  We can  provide no  assurance  that we will not be  adversely
affected by these suppliers and service  providers due to  noncompliance  in the
future.

EURO CONVERSION

         On January 1,  1999,  eleven of the  fifteen  member  countries  of the
European  Union  established  fixed  conversion  rates  between  their  existing
currencies  (the "legacy  currency")  and the one common legal currency known as
the "Euro".  From January 1, 1999 through  June 30, 2002 the  countries  will be
able to use their legacy currencies or the Euro to transact business. By July 1,
2002, at the latest,  the  conversion to the Euro will be complete at which time
the legacy currencies will no longer be legal tender. The fixed conversion rates
between their existing  currencies have eliminated  exchange rate risk among the
member countries.





         The conversion to the Euro has reduced the number of forward  contracts
that we use to hedge the exchange  rate risk.  The forward  contracts  that were
used to hedge the individual  legacy  currencies  have been replaced by a single
Euro hedge contract and the intercompany  transactions among subsidiaries within
the European Union are no longer subject to exchange rate risk.

         We do not  anticipate any material  impact from the Euro  conversion on
our  financial   information  systems  which  currently   accommodate   multiple
currencies.  Computer  software  changes  necessary to comply with the Year 2000
issue are  generally  compliant to the Euro  conversion  issue.  Due to numerous
uncertainties, we cannot reasonably estimate the effect that the Euro conversion
issue will have on our pricing or market strategies,  and the impact, if any, it
will have on our financial condition and results of operations.





- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RISK FACTORS

         Electronic  Arts'  business is subject to many risks and  uncertainties
which may affect our future financial performance. Some of those important risks
and  uncertainties  which may cause our  operating  results to vary or which may
materially and adversely affect our operating results are as follows:


                   Risk Factors Relating to Our Core Business

Platform  Transitions Such as the One Now Occurring Typically Depress the Market
for Video game Software Until New Platforms Achieve a Wide Market Acceptance

         When new video game  platforms  are  announced or  introduced  into the
market,  consumers  typically  reduce their purchases of video games for current
platforms in anticipation of new platforms being  available.  During that period
sales of our video game  products can be expected to slow or even decline  until
new  platforms  have  achieved a wide  market and  consumer  acceptance.  We are
currently in such a transition.  Sony expects to ship its  PlayStation 2 product
in the fall of 2000.  Nintendo and Microsoft  have also announced that their new
console  systems will be released in calendar  year 2001.  Current  sales of our
products  for the  existing  PlayStation  and  Nintendo 64  platforms  have been
adversely affected.  We expect this trend to continue until one or more of these
new consoles achieve a wide installed base of consumers.

New  Video  Game  Platforms  Create  Additional  Technical  and  Business  Model
Uncertainties

         Large  portions of our  revenues  are derived from the sale of products
for play on proprietary  video game platforms such as the Sony  PlayStation  and
Nintendo 64. The success of our products is significantly affected by acceptance
of the new video  game  hardware  systems  and the life  span of older  hardware
platforms and our ability to accurately  predict  which  platforms  will be most
successful.

         Sometimes we will spend development and marketing resources on products
designed for new video game systems that have not yet achieved  large  installed
bases or will continue product development for older hardware platforms that may
have shorter life cycles than we expected.  Conversely, if we do not develop for
a  platform  that  achieves   significant  market  acceptance,   or  discontinue
development  for a platform  that has a longer  life cycle  than  expected,  our
revenue growth may be adversely affected.

         For example, the Sega Dreamcast console launched in Japan in early 1999
and in the  United  States  in  September  of 1999.  We have no  products  under
development  for  this  platform.  Should  this  platform  achieve  wide  market
acceptance,  our revenue growth may be adversely affected.  Similarly, we intend
to launch a variety of products for the new Sony  platform,  the  PlayStation 2,
expected to be released  in the United  States in the fall of 2000.  Should that
platform  not  achieve  wide  acceptance  by  consumers,  we will  have  spent a
disproportionate  amount of our resources for this  platform.  Additionally,  we
have not negotiated  publishing agreements with Sony, Sega or Nintendo for their
next  generation  platforms,  and we do not  know  whether  the  terms  of those
agreements will be favorable.

Product  Development  Schedules Are Frequently  Unreliable  and Make  Predicting
Quarterly Results Difficult

         Product development schedules,  particularly for new hardware platforms
and high-end  multimedia  personal  computers,  or PCs, are difficult to predict
because they involve creative  processes,  use of new development  tools for new
platforms and the learning process, research and experimentation associated with
development for new technologies.  For example, Tiberian Sun, which was expected
to ship in fiscal 1999 at the time of our acquisition of Westwood  Studios,  was
not released until the second quarter of fiscal 2000 due to development  delays.
Additionally,  development  risks  for  CD-ROM  products  can  cause  particular
difficulties in predicting  quarterly results because brief  manufacturing  lead
times allow finalizing  products and projected  release dates late in a quarter.
Our  revenues  and  earnings  are  dependent  on our ability to meet our product
release  schedules,  and our  failure to meet those  schedules  could  result in
revenues  and  earnings  which  fall  short of  analysts'  expectations  for any
individual quarter and the fiscal year.

Our Business Is Both Seasonal and Cyclical

         Our business is seasonal with a significant  percentage of our revenues
occurring in the December  quarter.  Our business is also  cyclical;  video game
platforms have  historically  had a life cycle of four to six years, and decline
as more advanced  platforms are being  introduced.  As one group of platforms is
reaching the end of its cycle and new platforms are  emerging,  buying  patterns
may





change. Purchases of products for older platforms may slow at a faster rate than
sales of new platforms.  We are currently beginning such a platform  transition.
Sega  introduced its latest platform in the United States in September 1999, and
Sony expects to ship its PlayStation 2 product in the fall of 2000. Nintendo and
Microsoft have also announced that their new console systems will be released in
calendar year 2001.  Sales of our current  products for the current Nintendo and
Sony platforms have already been adversely affected, and we expect this trend to
continue  until one or more new  platforms  achieves  a wide  installed  base of
consumers.

The Impact of e-Commerce and Online Games on Our Business Is Not Known

         While we do not currently derive significant revenues from online sales
of our packaged products,  we believe that such form of distribution will become
a more significant factor in our business in the future.  E-commerce is becoming
an increasingly popular method for conducting business with consumers.  How that
form of distribution will affect the more traditional  retail  distribution,  at
which we have historically had success, and over what time period, is uncertain.
In addition, we expect the number and popularity of online games to increase and
become a significant factor in the interactive games business  generally.  We do
not know  how that  increase  generally,  or the  emerging  business  of  EA.com
specifically, will affect the sales of packaged goods.

Our  Business,  Our  Products,  and Our  Distribution  Are Subject to Increasing
Regulation in Key Territories

         Legislation is increasingly  introduced which may affect the content of
our products and their  distribution.  For example,  privacy rules in the United
States and Europe impose various restrictions on our web sites. Those rules vary
by territory while of course the Internet recognizes no geographical boundaries.
Other countries such as Germany have adopted laws regulating content transmitted
over the Internet  that are stricter  than current  United  States laws.  In the
United  States,  in response  to recent  events,  the federal and several  state
governments are considering content  restrictions on products such as those made
by us as well as restrictions on distribution of such products.  Any one or more
of these factors could harm our business.

Our Platform  Licensors Are Our Chief  Competitors  and  Frequently  Control the
Manufacturing of Our Video Game Products

         Our  agreements  with  hardware  licensors,  which  are also our  chief
competitors,  typically  give  significant  control  to the  licensor  over  the
approval  and  manufacturing  of our  products.  This  fact  could,  in  certain
circumstances,  leave us unable to get our products  approved,  manufactured and
shipped to customers.  In most events, control of the approval and manufacturing
process by the platform  licensors  increases both our manufacturing  lead times
and costs as compared to those we can achieve  independently.  For  example,  in
prior years, we experienced delays in obtaining  approvals for and manufacturing
of  PlayStation  products which caused delays in shipping  those  products.  The
potential for additional delay or refusal to approve or manufacture our products
continues with our platform licensors.  Such occurrences would harm our business
and adversely affect our financial performance.

Proliferation and Assertion of Patents Poses Serious Risks to our Business

         Many  patents  have been  issued  that may  apply to  widely  used game
technologies.  Additionally,  many less  recently  issued  patents are now being
asserted  against  Internet  implementations  of existing  games.  Several  such
patents have been asserted against us. For example,  we currently have a lawsuit
pending  regarding  our  publication  of games that can be played both alone and
with others over the Internet in which the patent holder has moved to enjoin the
sale of EA  personal  computer  products  that can be played  alone and over the
Internet.  Such claims can harm our business. We will incur substantial expenses
in evaluating and defending against such claims, regardless of the merits of the
claims.  In the event that there is a  determination  that we have  infringed  a
third  party  patent,  we could  incur  significant  monetary  liability  and be
prevented from using the rights in the future.


                  Risk Factors Relating to Our Online Business

Because of EA.com's Limited Operating History,  It Will Be Difficult To Evaluate
its Business and Prospects

         EA.com's business is still in the developing  stages, so evaluating its
business and prospects  will be more difficult than would be the case for a more
mature business.  We will continue to encounter the risks and difficulties faced
in  launching  a new  business,  and we may  not  achieve  our  goals  or may be
compelled to change the manner in which we seek to develop the  business.  These
uncertainties as to the future operations of EA.com will increase the difficulty
we face in completing  and pursuing the essential  plans for the  development of
the  business  and will also make it more  difficult  for our  stockholders  and
securities analysts to predict the operating results of this business.



EA.com Has a History of Losses and Expects To  Continue To Incur  Losses and May
Never Achieve Profitability

         EA.com has incurred  substantial losses to date,  including the current
fiscal  year.  We expect  EA.com to continue to incur  losses as it develops its
business.  EA.com will be required to maintain the significant support,  service
and product  enhancement  demands of online users, and we cannot be certain that
EA.com will produce  sufficient  revenues  from its  operations to support these
costs.  Even if profitability is achieved,  EA.com may not be able to sustain it
over a period of time.

Our Agreements  with America Online May Not Prove  Successful to the Development
of EA.com's Business

         We have  announced a series of agreements  with America  Online for the
offering of our games through AOL for online play. These agreements require that
we make substantial  guaranteed payments to AOL and that we commit our resources
to  pursuit  of the  online  game  opportunity.  We cannot be  assured  that the
substantial  costs  associated  with the AOL agreements will be justified by the
revenues generated from that relationship. In addition, restrictions included in
the AOL agreements  limiting  other channels we may develop for offering  online
games may limit our ability to  diversify  our online  distribution  strategies.
Further,  we are required  under our agreement  with AOL to launch our game site
within a  specified  time period or be subject to certain  penalties,  including
AOL's right to terminate the agreement. We were not successful in meeting a June
1, 2000 initial  launch target and we may not be  successful in achieving  other
specified launch targets.  See additional  discussion relating to our agreements
with AOL in Note 5 of the Notes to Consiolidated Financial Statements,  included
in item 8 hereof. The success for us of the AOL agreements will also be a result
of AOL's performance under the agreements, a factor over which we will have very
little control.

We Have Very Limited Experience with Online Games and May Not Be Able To Operate
This Business Effectively

         Offering  games solely for online play is a substantial  departure from
our  traditional  business of selling  packaged  software  games.  We anticipate
employing  various pricing  models,  including  subscription  fees, "pay to play
fees" and advertising.  We have very little  experience with developing  optimal
pricing  strategies  for online games and no experience in "pay to play" pricing
or in  securing  advertising  revenue  for online  services.  Similarly,  we are
inexperienced  in  predicting  usage  patterns  for our  games.  Because  of our
inexperience in this area, we may not be effective in achieving success that may
otherwise be attainable from offering our games online.

Online Games Have Risks That Are Not Associated with Our Traditional Business

         Online  games,  particularly  multiplayer  games,  pose risks to player
enjoyment that do not generally apply to packaged game sales. Players frequently
would not be  acquainted  with other  players,  which may  adversely  affect the
playing experiencing.  Social issues raised by a player's conduct may impact the
experience  for other players.  We have not  determined  whether or how we might
monitor or proctor  player  behavior to mitigate  behavior that impairs the game
experience.  In addition,  there are substantial  technical challenges to be met
both in the  introduction  of our games online and in  maintaining  an effective
game  playing  environment  over  time.  If  these  risks  are not  successfully
controlled and technical challenges resolved,  potential customers for our games
may be unwilling to play in  sufficient  volume to allow us to attain or sustain
profitability.

We May Not Be Able To Obtain the Required Licenses To Offer Our Games Online

         If we are unable to reach terms with certain  licensors  for our games,
we will not be able to offer  certain  of our games  for  online  play.  Many of
Electronic Arts' most popular games feature  characters,  trademarks,  people or
concepts for which we have licenses from third  parties.  As an example,  our EA
SPORTS products  typically  contain content  licensed from a sports and players'
association.  In certain instances the terms of these licenses will not allow us
to offer the games for online play without negotiating an additional license. We
cannot be certain  that the  licensors  will be amenable to a license for online
games  involving  their  content or,  even if they are,  that we will be able to
reach  terms  with  them for such use.  We may be forced to agree to terms  that
ultimately materially impair the economic value to us of the online game market.

Proliferation  and  Assertion of Patents  Poses Serious Risks to the Business of
EA.com.

         Many  patents  have been issued that may apply to widely used  Internet
technologies.  Additionally,  many less  recently  issued  patents are now being
asserted against Internet  implementations of older  technologies.  Several such
patents have been asserted against us. For example,  we currently have a lawsuit
pending  regarding  our  publication  of games that can be played both alone and
with others over the Internet in which the patent holder has moved to enjoin the
sale of EA  personal  computer  products  that can be played  alone and over the
Internet.  Such claims can harm our business. We will incur substantial expenses
in evaluating and defending against such claims, regardless of the merits of the
claims.  In the event that there is a  determination  that we have  infringed  a
third  party  patent,  we could  incur  significant  monetary  liability  and be
prevented from using the rights in the future.




Development of EA.com's Business Will Require Significant Capital, and We Cannot
Be Assured That It Will Be Available

         EA.com  will  not  be  successful  if it  does  not  receive  the  very
substantial  financing that will be required to launch its business.  Electronic
Arts has  agreed to provide a limited  amount of  funding  to  EA.com,  but this
financing alone will not be sufficient for the development of EA.com's business.
Any  additional  funding  that is  obtained  from EA may  either be treated as a
revolving credit advance or would increase EA's retained  interest in EA.com and
correspondingly  decrease the interest of the holders of  outstanding  shares of
Class B common stock. The attraction of additional  equity or debt financing for
EA.com  from third  parties may not be possible or may only be possible on terms
that result in significant  dilution to Class A and Class B common  stockholders
or interest or other costs and debt-related restrictions on the operation of the
business.

If Use of the Internet  Does Not  Continue To Develop and  Reliably  Support the
Demands Placed on It by Electronic Commerce, EA.com's Business Will Be Harmed

         EA.com's  success  depends  upon growth in the use of the Internet as a
medium for playing games.  Although the Internet is experiencing rapid growth in
the number of users,  this growth is a recent  phenomenon  and may not continue.
Furthermore,  despite  this  growth  in  usage,  the  use  of the  Internet  for
sophisticated games like ours is relatively new. Our business would be seriously
harmed if:

 o       use of the Internet  does not  continue to increase or  increases  more
         slowly than expected,

 o       the infrastructure for the Internet does not effectively support online
         game play,

 o       concerns over the secure transmission of confidential  information over
         public  networks  inhibit  the  growth  of the  Internet  as a means of
         conducting commercial transactions, or

 o       government  regulations  regarding  Internet content,  privacy or other
         conditions impede the effectiveness of the Internet to users.

Capacity  Restraints  May  Restrict  the Use of the Internet as a Forum for Game
Play, Resulting in Decreased Demand for Our Products

         The  Internet  infrastructure  may not be able to support  the  demands
placed on it by increased usage or the limited  capacity of networks to transmit
large  amounts  of data.  Other  risks  associated  with  commercial  use of the
Internet could slow its growth, including:

 o       outages and other delays  resulting from the inadequate  reliability of
         the network infrastructure,

 o       slow development of enabling  technologies and complementary  products,
         and

 o       limited availability of cost-effective, high speed access.

         Delays in the  development  or adoption of new  equipment  standards or
protocols required to handle increased levels of Internet activity, or increased
governmental  regulation,  would cause the  Internet  to fail to gain,  or lose,
viability as a means of game playing. If these or any other factors cause use of
the Internet for commerce to slow or decline,  the Internet may not prove viable
as a commercial marketplace. This, in turn, would result in decreased demand for
EA.com's products and services.

To Become and Remain Competitive, EA.com Must Continually Develop and Expand New
Content. This Is Inherently Risky and Expensive.

         EA.com's  success  depends  on our  ability  to  develop  products  and
services  for  the  initial  launch  of the  EA.com  site  and  our  ability  to
continually  expand the content on that site. Our agreement with AOL requires us
to develop new games under our relationship  with AOL. We cannot assure you that
products will be developed on time,  in a cost  effective  manner,  or that they
will be successful.





We May Not Be Able To Respond to Rapid Technological Change.

         The market for Internet products and services is characterized by rapid
technological  change and evolving  industry  standards.  Both in completing the
design and implementation of our network infrastructure and thereafter,  we will
be  required to  continually  improve  performance,  features,  reliability  and
capacity of our  network  infrastructure.  We cannot  assure you that we will be
successful  in  responding  rapidly  or  in a  cost  effective  manner  to  such
developments.

Increasing  Governmental  Regulation of the Internet  Could Limit the Market for
Our Products

         As Internet commerce continues to evolve, we expect that federal, state
and foreign governments will adopt laws and regulations  covering issues such as
user  privacy,  taxation  of goods  and  services  provided  over the  Internet,
pricing,  content and  quality of products  and  services.  It is possible  that
legislation could expose companies involved in electronic commerce to liability,
taxation  or other  increased  costs,  any of which  could  limit the  growth of
electronic commerce  generally.  Legislation could dampen the growth in Internet
usage and decrease its acceptance as a communications  and commercial medium. If
enacted,  these  laws and  regulations  could  limit  the  market  for  EA.com's
products.

If We Do Not Maintain Our Relationship with Outside Consultants Such as Andersen
Consulting  and  Proxicom,  Our Ability To Develop Our Online  Business  Will Be
Impaired

         Because  approximately  20%  of  the  staff  creating,  designing,  and
developing  the  infrastructure  for EA.com's  website and network  interface is
being provided by outside  consultants such as Andersen Consulting and Proxicom,
losing the business  relationship  with such  consultants  would cause EA.com to
lose an  important  component  of its  website  implementation  team.  Given the
intense competition for qualified technical consultants,  EA.com may not be able
to retain these consultants or, if necessary,  replace them. If it cannot do so,
its ability to develop its business will be impaired.

Our  Revenues  Have Been  Heavily  Dependent  on a Single  Product  and Would Be
Adversely Affected if That Product's Popularity Were To Decline

         EA.com's  revenues to date have  consisted  primarily of revenues  from
sales of our online product Ultima Online, and we would be adversely affected if
revenues  from that  product were to decline for any reason and not be replaced.
We expect the online game market to become increasingly  competitive,  and it is
possible that other  producer's  current or future games could cause our revenue
from Ultima  Online to decline.  In addition,  popularity of Ultima Online could
decline  over  time  simply   because  of  consumer   preference  for  new  game
experiences.

We Invest Very Heavily in Research and Development  and Network  Development and
Support for EA.com,  and We Cannot Be Assured That We Will Achieve Revenues That
Validate This Level of Spending

         We have  invested,  and expect to continue to invest,  very  heavily in
research and development and network development and support for our website and
online games. We will need to expand EA.com's  revenues  substantially for it to
achieve  profitability  with these levels of expenditure being required,  and we
may not be able to do so. If we cannot increase  revenues to profitable  levels,
the  value of EA.com  will be  impaired.  In order to  develop  the broad  games
offerings  that we envision  for our online  operations  it will be necessary to
engage in significant  developmental  efforts both to adapt existing EA games to
the  online  format  and to create new online  games.  Our  agreements  with AOL
require us to maintain a substantial  commitment to online game  development and
we  cannot  be  assured  that we  will  realize  acceptable  returns  from  this
investment.

Online  Product  Development   Schedules  Are  Unreliable  and  Make  Predicting
Quarterly Results Difficult

         Online product development  schedules,  particularly for Internet based
games are difficult to predict because they involve creative  processes,  use of
new development  tools,  Internet  latency issues,  a learning process to better
understand  Internet  based game  mechanics,  and research  and  experimentation
associated  with   development  for  new  online   technologies.   Additionally,
development risks for Internet based products can cause particular  difficulties
in predicting  quarterly results because of the challenges  associated with game
testing, live Beta testing,  integration into network servers and integration on
to the Games web site and impact the  "release,  ("go  live")  dates of products
during a particular  quarter.  Our revenues and operating costs are dependent on
our  ability to meet our product  "go live"  schedules,  and our failure to meet
those   schedules   could  result  in  revenues   falling   short  of  analysts'
expectations, with no corresponding decrease in expenses, resulting in increased
operating losses for EA.com





                              General Risk Factors

We Face Intense Competition for Talent from Highly Valued Internet Companies

         Competition  for  employees  in  the  interactive   software   business
continues to be intense.  Recently,  the most intense competition for recruiting
and  retaining  key  employees  is from  Internet  companies.  The large  equity
positions  frequently  offered to key  executives  and  creative  talent in such
companies  and the  actual  or  perceived  opportunity  for  rapid  stock  price
appreciation of these companies make their compensation  packages  attractive to
those who are already working in more mature  companies.  This situation creates
difficulty  for us to compete for the  attraction and retention of executive and
key creative talent.

Because of the Intense Competition for Qualified Technical,  Creative, Marketing
and Other  Personnel,  We May Not Be Able To Attract  and  Retain the  Personnel
Necessary for our Businesses

         The market  for  technical,  creative,  marketing  and other  personnel
essential to the  development of online  businesses and management of our online
and core businesses is extremely competitive,  and we may not be able to attract
and retain the employees we need. In addition, the rising cost of real estate in
the San  Francisco  Bay area - the  location  of our  headquarters  and  largest
studio, has increased dramatically, and has made recruiting from other areas and
relocating   employees  to  our  headquarters  more  difficult.   If  we  cannot
successfully  recruit and retain the  employees we need,  our ability to develop
and manage our businesses will be impaired.

Foreign Sales and Currency Fluctuations

         For fiscal  2000  international  net  revenues  comprised  40% of total
consolidated net revenues.  We expect foreign sales to continue to account for a
significant  and  growing  portion of our  revenues.  Such sales are  subject to
unexpected regulatory  requirements,  tariffs and other barriers.  Additionally,
foreign sales are primarily made in local  currencies  which may fluctuate.  For
example,  our  European  revenues  in fiscal 2000 were  adversely  impacted by a
devaluation  of the Euro as  compared to the prior  year.  Our foreign  currency
exposure  may  increase  if this  trend  continues.  Any of  these  factors  may
significantly harm our business.

Increased Difficulties in Forecasting Results

         During platform transition  periods,  where the success of our products
is significantly  impacted by the changing market for our products,  forecasting
our  revenues  and  earnings  is more  difficult  than in more  stable or rising
product  markets.  The demand for our products  may decline  during a transition
faster than we anticipate, negatively impacting both revenues and earnings.

Fluctuations in Stock Price

Due to  analysts'  expectations  of  continued  growth  and other  factors,  any
shortfall in earnings could have an immediate and significant  adverse effect on
the trading  price of our common stock in any given  period.  As a result of the
factors discussed in this report and other factors that may arise in the future,
the market price of our common stock  historically  has been, and we expect will
continue to be subject to significant  fluctuations over a short period of time.
These fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us, to changes in analysts'
earnings estimates,  or to factors affecting the computer,  software,  Internet,
entertainment,  media or  electronics  businesses or the  securities  markets in
general. For example, during fiscal year 2000, the price per share of our common
stock ranged from $45.63 to $120.94.

Because of these and other factors affecting our operating results and financial
condition,  past  financial  performance  should  not be  considered  a reliable
indicator of future performance,  and investors should not use historical trends
to anticipate results or trends in future periods.




Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risk

We are  exposed  to  various  market  risks,  including  the  changes in foreign
currency  exchange rates and interest  rates.  Market risk is the potential loss
arising from changes in market rates and prices. Foreign exchange contracts used
to hedge foreign  currency  exposures and short-term  investments are subject to
market risk. We do not consider our cash and cash  equivalents  to be subject to
interest  rate  risk  due  to  their  short  maturities.  We do not  enter  into
derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We utilize foreign  exchange  contracts to hedge foreign  currency  exposures of
underlying assets and liabilities,  primarily certain  intercompany  receivables
that are denominated in foreign  currencies,  thereby,  limiting our risk. Gains
and losses on foreign exchange  contracts are reflected in the income statement.
At March 31, 2000, we had foreign  exchange  contracts,  all with  maturities of
less than nine months to purchase and sell approximately $242,143,000 in foreign
currencies, primarily British Pounds, European Currency Units ("Euro"), Canadian
Dollars, Japanese Yen and other currencies.

Fair value  represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate
and the forward rate. The  counterparties to these contracts are substantial and
creditworthy   multinational   commercial   banks.  The  risks  of  counterparty
nonperformance  associated  with  these  contracts  are  not  considered  to  be
material.  Notwithstanding  our efforts to manage foreign exchange risks,  there
can be no assurances  that our hedging  activities  will  adequately  protect us
against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.

The following  table provides  information  about our foreign  currency  forward
exchange contracts at March 31, 2000. The information is provided in U.S. dollar
equivalents  and presents the notional  amount  (forward  amount),  the weighted
average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and fair value.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While the  contract  amounts  provide  one  measurement  of the  volume of these
transactions,  they do not  represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk.
The amounts (arising from the possible inabilities of counterparties to meet the
terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which
the counterparties' obligations exceed our obligations as these contracts can be
settled on a net basis at our  option.  We control  credit risk  through  credit
approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily
to our investment  portfolio.  We do not use derivative financial instruments in
our  investment  portfolio.




We  manage  our  interest  rate  risk by  maintaining  an  investment  portfolio
primarily  consisting of debt  instruments of high credit quality and relatively
short average  maturities.  We also manage our interest rate risk by maintaining
sufficient cash and cash equivalent  balances such that we are typically able to
hold our  investments  to  maturity.  At March 31, 2000,  our cash  equivalents,
short-term and long-term  investments  included debt securities of $194,769,000.
Notwithstanding  our  efforts to manage  interest  rate  risks,  there can be no
assurances  that we will be adequately  protected  against the risks  associated
with interest rate fluctuations.

of our investment portfolio at March 31, 2000:

ITEM 8:  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

The Report of Independent Auditors,  Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements follow below on pages 44 through 70.


INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Electronic Arts Inc. and Subsidiaries:

We have audited the accompanying  consolidated balance sheets of Electronic Arts
Inc.  and  subsidiaries  as  of  March  31,  2000  and  1999,  and  the  related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year  period ended March 31, 2000. These  consolidated
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards
in the  United  States of  America.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Electronic Arts Inc.
and  subsidiaries  as of March  31,  2000 and  1999,  and the  results  of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the  three-year  period
ended  March 31,  2000,  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United States of America.

ELECTRONIC ARTS AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

March 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998

(1)  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Consolidation

The  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  include the  accounts of
Electronic Arts Inc. and its wholly-owned and  majority-owned  subsidiaries (the
"Company").  All significant  intercompany  balances and transactions  have been
eliminated in consolidation.

     A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation
of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company follows:

(a)  Fiscal Year

The  Company's  fiscal year is reported on a 52/53-week  period that ends on the
Saturday  nearest to March 31 in each year. The results of operations for fiscal
2000, 1999 and 1998 contain 52 weeks.  For clarity of presentation  herein,  all
fiscal periods are treated as ending on a calendar month end.

(b)  Revenue Recognition

The  Company's  revenue  recognition  policies are in  compliance  with American
Institute of Certified  Public  Accountants  Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2,
"Software Revenue Recognition", and SOP 98-4, "Deferral of the Effective Date of
a  Provision  of  SOP  97-2",  which  provide  guidance  on  generally  accepted
accounting principles for recognizing revenue on software transactions. SOP 97-2
requires that revenue recognized from software arrangements be allocated to each
element of the  arrangement  based on the relative  fair values of the elements.
The Company has adopted the  provisions  of these SOPs as of April 1, 1998.  The
adoption  has, in certain  circumstances,  resulted  in the  deferral of certain
revenues  associated  with the  Company's  sales  promotions  and products  with
multiple deliverable elements. Neither the changes in certain business practices
nor the deferral of certain  revenues have resulted in a material  impact on the
Company's  operating  results,  financial  position or cash flows for the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2000. Total deferred revenue at March 31, 2000 and 1999 was
$1,847,000, and $8,206,000, respectively.

In December  1998,  the Accounting  Standards  Executive  Committee of the AICPA
issued  SOP  98-9,  "Software  Revenue  Recognition,  with  Respect  to  Certain
Arrangements," which required recognition of revenue using the "residual method"
in a multiple element arrangement when fair value does not exist for one or more
of the  undelivered  elements  in the  arrangement.  SOP 98-9 is  effective  for
transactions entered into after March 15, 1999. Under the "residual method", the
total  fair value of the  undelivered  elements  is  deferred  and  subsequently
recognized in accordance  with SOP 97-2. The adoption of SOP 98-9 in fiscal year
2000 did not have a  material  change in the  accounting  for  revenues  for the
Company.

Product  Sales:  The Company  recognizes  revenue upon  shipment of its packaged
goods products based on "FOB Shipping"  terms.  Under FOB Shipping terms,  title
and  risk of loss  are  transferred  when  the  products  are  delivered  to the
customer.  In  order  to  recognize  revenue,  the  Company  must  not  have any
continuing  obligations  and it must  also be  probable  that the  Company  will
collect the accounts  receivable.  Subject to certain  limitations,  the Company
permits  customers to obtain  exchanges  within  certain  specified  periods and
provides price protection on certain unsold  merchandise.  Revenue is recognized
net of an allowance for returns and price protection.


Online  Subscription   Revenues:   Online  subscription   revenues  are  derived
principally from subscription revenues collected from customers for online play,
who are only contractually  obligated for pay on a month-to-month basis. Prepaid
monthly  subscription  revenues,  including  revenues collected from credit card
sales  as well as  sales  of  Gametime  subscription  cards,  are  deferred  and
subsequently  recognized  ratably over the period for which the hosting services
are provided.

Software Licenses: For those agreements which provide the customers the right to
multiple copies in exchange for guaranteed  minimum royalty amounts,  revenue is
recognized  at  delivery  of the  product  master  or the first  copy.  Per copy
royalties on sales that exceed the guarantee are recognized as earned.

Revenue  from the  licensing  of  software  was  $21,704,000,  $17,788,000,  and
$15,431,000  for  the  fiscal  years  ended  March  31,  2000,  1999  and  1998,
respectively.

(c)  Cash and Investments

Cash equivalents  consist of highly liquid  investments with  insignificant rate
risk  and  with  maturities  of three  months  or less at the date of  purchase.
Short-term  investments  include  securities with maturities  greater than three
months  and less than one year,  except  for  certain  investments  with  stated
maturities greater than one year.  Long-term  investments  consist of securities
with maturities greater than one year.

The Company  accounts for investments  under  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards  No.  115,  "Accounting  for  Certain  Investments  in Debt and Equity
Securities,"  ("SFAS 115").  The Company's policy is to protect the value of its
investment  portfolio and to minimize principal risk by earning returns based on
current interest rates. Management determines the appropriate  classification of
its debt and equity





securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates  such  designation as of each
balance sheet date. Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity  when the
Company has the positive  intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.
Securities  classified as held-to-maturity  are carried at amortized cost, which
is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity.
Such  amortization  is  included  in  interest  income.  Debt  securities,   not
classified as  held-to-maturity,  are classified as  available-for-sale  and are
stated at fair value.  Securities  sold is based on the specific  identification
method.

(d)  Prepaid Royalties

Prepaid royalties consist primarily of prepayments for manufacturing  royalties,
original equipment  manufacturer (OEM) fees and license fees paid to celebrities
and professional sports organizations for use of their trade name. Also included
in prepaid  royalties are prepayments  made to independent  software  developers
under  development  arrangements  that have  alternative  future  uses.  Prepaid
royalties  are  expensed at the  contractual  royalty rate as cost of goods sold
based on actual net product sales.  Management  evaluates the future realization
of prepaid royalties quarterly and charges to income any amounts that management
deems  unlikely to be realized  through  product  sales.  Royalty  advances  are
classified as current and  non-current  assets based upon  estimated net product
sales for the following year. The current portion of prepaid royalties, included
in other current  assets,  was $54,970,000 and $35,057,000 at March 31, 2000 and
1999,  respectively.  The long-term  portion of prepaid  royalties,  included in
other  assets,  was  $11,373,000  and  $7,602,000  at March  31,  2000 and 1999,
respectively.

(e)  Software Development Costs

Research and development costs, which consist primarily of software  development
costs, are expensed as incurred. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
86,  "Accounting  for the  Cost of  Computer  Software  to be Sold,  Leased,  or
Otherwise  Marketed"  ("SFAS 86"),  provides for the  capitalization  of certain
software  development  costs  incurred  after  technological  feasibility of the
software is established or for development  costs that have  alternative  future
uses.  Under the  Company's  current  practice of developing  new products,  the
technological  feasibility of the underlying  software is not established  until
substantially all product development is complete,  which generally includes the
development of a working model.  The software  development  costs that have been
capitalized to date have been insignificant.

(f)  Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Inventories at March 31,
2000 and 1999 consisted of:

======================================= =========== ============
                                           2000        1999

- --------------------------------------- ----------- ------------
                                           $22,986      $22,376
- --------------------------------------- ----------- ------------

(g) Advertising Costs

The  Company  generally  expenses  advertising  costs as  incurred,  except  for
production  costs associated with media campaigns which are deferred and charged
to expense at the first run of the ad. Cooperative advertising with distributors
and  retailers is accrued when revenue is  recognized.  Cooperative  advertising
credits are reimbursed  when  qualifying  claims are  submitted.  For the fiscal
years  ended  March  31,  2000,  1999 and  1998,  advertising  expenses  totaled
approximately $87,377,000, $72,437,000 and $55,090,000, respectively.

(h)  Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation is calculated using the
accelerated and straight-line methods over the following useful lives:

- ----------------------------- ------------------------------------
Buildings                     20 to 25 years
- ----------------------------- ------------------------------------
Computer equipment and
software                      3 to 7 years
- ----------------------------- ------------------------------------
Furniture and equipment       3 to 7 years
- ----------------------------- ------------------------------------
Leasehold improvements        Lesser of the lease terms or the
                              estimated useful lives of the
                              improvements
- ----------------------------- ------------------------------------

(i)  Intangible Assets

Intangible   assets  net  of  amortization  at  March  31,  2000  and  1999,  of
$117,236,000,  and  $90,682,000,   respectively,   include  goodwill,  costs  of
obtaining product technology and noncompete  covenants which are amortized using
the straight-line  method over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the
agreement terms,  typically from two to twelve years.  Amortization  expense for
fiscal years ended March 31, 2000,  1999 and 1998 was  $11,989,000,  $5,880,000,
and $692,000,  respectively. The Company assesses the recoverability of goodwill
by determining  whether the carried value of the assets may be recovered through
estimated future cash flows.

(j)  Income Taxes

Income tax expense is based on reported  earnings before income taxes.  Deferred
income taxes  reflect the impact of  temporary  differences  between  assets and
liabilities  recognized  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  such  amounts
recognized for tax purposes.





(k)  Foreign Currency Translation

For each of the Company's  foreign  subsidiaries the functional  currency is its
local currency. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into
U.S.  dollars  using  current  exchange  rates,  and  revenues  and expenses are
translated  into U.S.  dollars  using  average  exchange  rates.  The effects of
foreign  currency  translation  adjustments  are  deferred  and  included  as  a
component of  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income (loss) in  stockholders'
equity.

Foreign  currency  transaction  gains and  losses  are a result of the effect of
exchange rate changes on transactions  denominated in currencies  other than the
functional currency.  Included in interest and other income in the statements of
income are foreign  currency  transaction  losses of $1,781,000,  $1,168,000 and
$517,000,   for  the  fiscal  years  ended  March  31,  2000,   1999  and  1998,
respectively.

(l)  Net Income Per Share

The following  summarizes the  computations  of Basic Earnings Per Share ("EPS")
and  Diluted  EPS.  Basic  EPS  is  computed  as  net  earnings  divided  by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS
reflects the potential  dilution  that could occur from common  shares  issuable
through stock-based compensation plans including stock options, restricted stock
awards,  warrants and other  convertible  securities  using the  treasury  stock
method.

  Diluted                      $   1.76     $  1.15     $  1.19

Excluded from the above computation of  weighted-average  shares for diluted EPS
for the  fiscal  years  ended  March 31,  2000,  1999 and 1998 were  options  to
purchase 229,000, 645,000 and 137,000 shares of common stock,  respectively,  as
the options'  exercise  price was greater  than the average  market price of the
common shares.  For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000,  the  weighted-average
exercise  price of the  respective  options  was $81.88.  Class B common  stock,
authorized  on March 22, 2000 was excluded from the  Company's  calculations  of
basic and diluted EPS because its impact on the calculations is immaterial.

(m) Employee Benefits

The Company has a 401(k) Plan covering  substantially all of its U.S. employees.
The 401(k)  Plan  permits  the Company to make  discretionary  contributions  to
employees'  accounts based on the Company's financial  performance.  The Company
contributed  $1,799,000,  $2,092,000  and  $902,000 to the Plan in fiscal  2000,
fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998, respectively.

(n) Stock-based Compensation

The Company  accounts for  stock-based  awards to employees  using the intrinsic
value method in  accordance  with  Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25").

(o) Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In December 1999, the  Securities and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") issued Staff
Accounting  Bulletin No. 101("SAB 101"),  "Revenue  Recognition," which outlines
the basic criteria that must be met to recognize  revenue and provides  guidance
for  presentation of revenue and for disclosure  related to revenue  recognition
policies in financial  statements  filed with the SEC. SAB 101 is effective  for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1999,  except, as amended by SAB 101A,
registrants with fiscal years that begin between December 16, 1999 and March 15,
2000 may  report a change  in  accounting  principle  no later  than the  second
quarter of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1999. The Company  believes
the  adoption  of SAB 101 will  not  have a  material  impact  on the  Company's
financial position and results of operations.

In March 2000, the Emerging  Issues Task Force issued No. 00-02 ("EITF  00-02"),
"Accounting for Web Site  Development  Costs".  EITF 00-02 states that all costs
relating to software used to operate a web site and relating to  development  of
initial  graphics and web page design should be accounted for using Statement of
Position ("SOP") 98-1. Under this SOP, costs incurred in the preliminary project
stage  should  be  expensed  as  incurred,  as  should  most  training  and data
conversion  costs.  External direct costs of materials and services and internal
direct  payroll-related  costs should be capitalized  once certain  criteria are
met. EITF 00-02 is effective for all fiscal  quarters  beginning  after June 30,
2000.  The  Company  does not expect a  significant  impact on the  consolidated
results of operations,  financial position or cash flows on the EITF's effective
date.

In March 2000, the Emerging  Issues Task Force issued No. 00-03 ("EITF  00-03"),
"Application of AICPA SOP 97-2, "Software Revenue  Recognition," to Arrangements
That Include the Right to Use  Software  Stored on Another  Entity's  Hardware",
which  discusses  the  effect on  revenue  recognition  of a  software  vendor's
obligation to host its software that previously was licensed to a customer.  The
EITF has reached the  conclusion  that, if the customer is unable to utilize the





software on the customer's  hardware or contract with another party unrelated to
the vendor to host the  software,  then the  arrangement  with the  customer  is
outside the scope of SOP 97-2 and should be treated as a service  contract.  The
Company may be required to change the timing of its revenue  recognition related
to product  revenues.  The Company  believes the adoption of EITF 00-03 will not
have a  material  impact on the  Company's  financial  position  and  results of
operations.

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of  Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  133  ("SFAS  133")  "Accounting  for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", which establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities.  SFAS 133
is  effective  as of the  beginning  of the first  quarter  of the  fiscal  year
beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company is determining the effect of SFAS 133
on its financial statements.

In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants  ("AICPA")
issued SOP 98-1,  "Accounting  for the Costs of Computer  Software  Developed or
Obtained  for  Internal  Use".  SOP 98-1  requires  that  consulting,  hardware,
software and direct  payroll-related costs associated with the implementation of
customized internal-use software be capitalized and amortized over the estimated
useful life of the  software.  These costs relate to game site  application  and
infrastructure  design and  development,  as well as costs  related to providing
customer  account  management  and  building  in  e-Commerce  functionality  and
interfaces.  SOP 98-1 is effective  for financial  statements  issued for fiscal
years  beginning  after December 15, 1998. As of March 31, 2000, the Company has
capitalized  $26,318,000 of these costs  associated with the effort to build and
support the EA.com game sites at launch.

(p) Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosures  of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Such
estimates  include   provisions  for  doubtful   accounts,   sales  returns  and
allowances,  warranty provisions,  and estimates regarding the recoverability of
prepaid royalty advances and inventories. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

(q)  Reclassifications

Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2000 presentation.

(r) Long-Lived Assets

The Company evaluates long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for
impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of assets is
measured by a comparison  of the carrying  amount of an asset to future net cash
flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the
carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.

(2) APPROVAL OF THE TRACKING STOCK PROPOSAL

On March 22, 2000, the  stockholders  of Electronic Arts voted on and approved a
proposal  (the  "Tracking  Stock  Proposal")  to authorize the issuance of a new
series of  common  stock to be  designated  as Class B common  stock  ("Tracking
Stock"),  intended to reflect the  performance  of  Electronic  Arts' online and
e-Commerce  division  ("EA.com").  As a result of the  approval of the  Tracking
Stock Proposal, Electronic Arts' existing common stock has been re-classified as
Class A  common  stock  ("Class  A  Stock")  and that  stock  will  reflect  the
performance of Electronic Arts' other businesses ("EA Core").

- ------------------------------------- ------------- -------------

Long-term and short-term  held-to-maturity  investments include commercial notes
with original  maturities of five to eight years secured by U.S.  Treasury Notes
which enable the Company to take  advantage of certain tax  incentives  from its
Puerto Rico operation.  These  investments are treated as  held-to-maturity  for
financial reporting purposes.






The fair value of held-to-maturity  securities at March 31, 2000 was $18,162,000
which  included  gross  unrealized  losses  of  $238,000.   The  fair  value  of
held-to-maturity  securities at March 31, 1999 was  $24,353,000  which  included
gross unrealized gains of $153,000.

(b)  Marketable Securities

Marketable  securities  are  comprised  of equity  securities.  The  Company has
accounted for investments in equity securities as  "available-for-sale"  and has
stated applicable  investments at fair value,  with net unrealized  appreciation
reported as a separate  component  of  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income
(loss) in stockholders'  equity.  Marketable securities had an aggregate cost of
$15,000  and  $585,000 at March 31,  2000 and 1999,  respectively.  At March 31,
2000,  marketable  securities  included gross unrealized  gains of $221,000.  At
March  31,  1999  marketable  securities  included  gross  unrealized  gains  of
$4,299,000.

For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2000 and 1999, the fair value of marketable
securities sold was $8,604,000 and $1,818,000,  respectively. The gross realized
gains from these sales totaled  $7,528,000  and  $1,454,000  for fiscal 2000 and
1999,  respectively.  The gain on sale of  investments  is based on the specific
identification method.

(c) Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts

The Company  utilizes  foreign  exchange  contracts  to hedge  foreign  currency
exposures of underlying assets and liabilities,  primarily certain  intercompany
receivables  that are denominated in foreign  currencies,  thereby  limiting our
risk..  The Company does not use forward  exchange  contracts for speculative or
trading purposes.  The Company's  accounting  policies for these instruments are
based on the Company's  designation of such instruments as hedging transactions.
The criteria the Company uses for  designating  an instrument as a hedge include
the  instrument's  effectiveness  in risk reduction and  one-to-one  matching of
forward  exchange  contracts  to  underlying  transactions.  Gains and losses on
currency  forward  contracts that are designated and effective as hedges of firm
commitments  are deferred and  recognized  in income in the same period that the
underlying  transactions  are  settled.  Gains and  losses on  currency  forward
contracts that are  designated and effective as hedges of existing  transactions
are  recognized  in  income  in the  same  period  as  losses  and  gains on the
underlying transactions are recognized and generally offset. Gains and losses on
any  instruments not meeting the above criteria would be recognized in income in
the  current  period.   The  Company  transacts   business  in  various  foreign
currencies.  At March 31, 2000, the Company had foreign exchange contracts,  all
with  maturities  of less than nine months,  to purchase and sell  approximately
$242,143,000 in foreign currencies,  primarily in British Pounds, Euro, Canadian
Dollars, Japanese Yen and other European currencies.

Fair value  represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate
and the forward rate,  plus the  unamortized  premium or discount.  At March 31,
2000, fair value of these contracts is not significant.  The  counterparties  to
these contracts are substantial and creditworthy multinational commercial banks.
The risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are not
considered  to be  material.  Notwithstanding  our  efforts  to  manage  foreign
exchange  risk,  there can be no  assurances  that our hedging  activities  will
adequately  protect  us  against  the risks  associated  with  foreign  currency
fluctuations.

(4)  COMMITMENTS

Lease Obligations

The Company leases certain of its current facilities and certain equipment under
non-cancelable  operating  lease  agreements.  The  Company is  required  to pay
property  taxes,  insurance  and  normal  maintenance  costs for  certain of its
facilities and will be required to pay any increases over the base year of these
expenses on the remainder of the Company's facilities.

In  February  1995,  the  Company  entered  into a master  operating  lease,  as
subsequently amended, for land and a building to be constructed in Redwood City,
California.  The  initial  term of the lease is for a period of three years from
November 30, 1998.  Monthly lease  payments are based upon the London  InterBank
Offered  Rate.  The  Company  has the option to purchase  the  property  for the
unamortized financed balance at any time after the non-cancelable lease term, or
it may  terminate  the  lease  at any  time  after  the  non-cancelable  term by
arranging  a third  party sale or by making a  termination  payment.  Should the
Company elect to terminate the lease,  it will  guarantee a residual value of up
to 85% of the unamortized value of the property.  As part of the agreement,  the
Company must also comply with certain financial covenants.

Total future minimum lease commitments as of March 31, 2000 are:

(5) AMERICA ONLINE, INC. ("AOL") AGREEMENT

In November 1999,  Electronic Arts Inc., EA.com and AOL entered into a five year
agreement which establishes the basis for EA.com's production of a games site on
the world wide web that will be  available  to AOL  subscribers  and to users of
other branded AOL properties. Under this agreement, EA.com is required to launch
its site no later  than June 1,  2000,  although,  under  certain  circumstances
described in the  agreement,  this date can be extended to September 1, 2000. If
the site is not launched  within the  specified  time frame,  and if  prescribed
additions to the site are not achieved within a specified time frame or the site
does not contain  content as required under the agreement,  then,  under certain
circumstances, AOL would have the ability to terminate the agreement.

The Company is required to pay  $50,000,000  to AOL as a carriage fee (including
certain  advertising  fees of which  $604,000  was  expensed for the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2000) under the AOL agreement.  Of this amount,  $25,000,000 was
paid  upon  signing  the  agreement  and  the  remainder  is due in  four  equal
installments on the first four anniversaries of the initial payment.  Payment of
the first annual  installment of $6,250,000  will be accelerated to June 1, 2000
since certain launch  requirements  will not be met by that date. The Company is
also required to pay to AOL  $31,000,000  as an advance of a minimum  guaranteed
revenue  share  for  revenues  generated  by  subscriptions  and  other  certain
commercial  transactions on the EA.com site. Of this amount $11,000,000 was paid
upon  signing of the  agreement  and the  remainder  is due in four equal annual
installments on the first anniversary of the initial payment.  The fair value of
the payments  made under the AOL  agreement  was  determined  by an  independent
valuation and the resulting  amounts will be amortized  (beginning with the site
launch)  over  the  remaining  term of the  five  year  agreement.  Advances  of
$35,395,000 are included in other long-term assets as of March 31, 2000.

The Company also committed to spend  $15,000,000 in offline media  advertisments
promoting its games on AOL during the term of the agreement.

Sale of Class B Common Stock and Warrant to AOL

In connection  with the  agreement  with AOL, the Company sold shares of Class B
common stock to AOL (the "AOL  Shares")  representing  10 percent of the initial
equity value attributable to EA.com valued at $18,700,000.

In  addition  to the AOL  Shares,  the  Company  sold AOL a  warrant  (the  "AOL
Warrant") to purchase shares of Class B common stock  representing an additional
5 percent of the initial equity value attributable to EA.com for $1,300,000. The
aggregate exercise price of the AOL Warrant will be $40,000,000. The AOL Warrant
expires  at the latest at the fifth  anniversary  of its date of  issuance,  and
under certain conditions may expire at an earlier date.

AOL Exchange Rights

If a Qualified  Public Offering (as defined in the AOL Agreement) does not occur
within 12 months  following  the initial sale of the AOL Shares to AOL, then AOL
may  exchange  their Class B common  stock shares for a number of Class A common
stock  based on the ratio of per share  price  paid by AOL for the Class B stock
relative to $83.7958.


(6)  CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The  Company  extends  credit  to  various  companies  in the  retail  and  mass
merchandising  industry.  Collection  of trade  receivables  may be  affected by
changes in economic or other industry  conditions and may,  accordingly,  impact
the  Company's  overall  credit risk.  Although the Company  generally  does not
require  collateral,  the Company  performs  ongoing  credit  evaluations of its
customers and reserves for potential credit losses are maintained.

Short-term   investments   are  placed   with  high   credit-quality   financial
institutions or in short-duration  high quality  securities.  The Company limits
the  amount of credit  exposure  in any one  institution  or type of  investment
instrument.


(7)  LITIGATION

The  Company  is subject to pending  claims and  litigation.  Management,  after
review and  consultation  with counsel,  considers  that any liability  from the
disposition of such lawsuits  would not have a material  adverse effect upon the
consolidated financial condition of the Company.


(8)  PREFERRED STOCK

At March 31, 2000 and 1999,  the Company had  10,000,000  and 1,000,000  shares,
respectively,   of  Preferred  Stock   authorized  but  unissued.   The  rights,
preferences,  and  restrictions  of the Preferred Stock may be designated by the
Board of Directors without further action by the Company's stockholders.


(9)  TREASURY STOCK

In February 1999,  the Board of Directors  approved a plan to purchase up to two
million shares of the Company's common stock. For the year ended March 31, 2000,
the Company did not  repurchase  shares.  For the year ended March 31, 1999, the
Company  repurchased  222,500  shares for  approximately  $9,001,000  under this
program.  For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2000 and 1999, 122,563 and 99,937
shares were reissued under the Company's Stock Plans, respectively.





When treasury shares were reissued,  any excess of the average  acquisition cost
of the  shares  over the  proceeds  from  reissuance  was  charged  to  retained
earnings.

 (10) STOCK PLANS

(a)  Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The  Company  has an Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  program  whereby  eligible
employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to 10% of their compensation to
purchase shares at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the Common Stock
on the date of  commencement of the offering or on the last day of the six-month
purchase  period.  The program  commenced  in  September  1991.  In fiscal 2000,
245,523  shares were  purchased by the Company and  distributed  to employees at
prices  ranging  from  $32.41 to $58.28.  In fiscal  1999,  241,514  shares were
purchased by the Company and  distributed  to  employees at prices  ranging from
$26.19 to $36.60.  In fiscal 1998,  199,680 shares were purchased by the Company
and  distributed to employees at prices ranging from $26.14 to $26.19 per share.
The weighted average fair value of the fiscal 2000,  fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998
awards was $20.00,  $18.27 and $9.43,  respectively.  Under the  Employee  Stock
Purchase Plan 30,928 shares were  distributed  from reissued  treasury  stock in
fiscal 1999. No shares were distributed  from reissued  treasury stock in fiscal
2000 or fiscal 1998. At March 2000, the Company had 366,921 shares of its Common
Stock reserved for future issuance under the Plan.

Prior to the  Maxis  merger in July  1997,  Maxis  employees  were  eligible  to
participate in an employee stock purchase plan. In fiscal 1998,  Maxis purchased
7,684 shares under this plan which were distributed to participating  employees.
Shares were purchased at prices ranging from $27.70 to $27.99 in fiscal 1998.

(b)  Stock Option Plans

The Company's 1991 Stock Option Plan,  1993 Stock Option Plan, 1995 Stock Option
Plan, and Directors' Plan ("Option  Plans") provide stock options for employees,
officers and directors.  Pursuant to these Option Plans,  the Board of Directors
may grant  non-qualified  and incentive  stock options to employees and officers
and non-qualified  options to directors,  at not less than the fair market value
on the date of grant.

Together  with the  Tracking  Stock  Proposal,  the  stockholders  approved  the
Electronic Arts Inc. 2000 Class B Equity  Incentive Plan and the Electronic Arts
Inc.  2000 Class A Equity  Incentive  Plan.  The Class B equity  plan allows the
award of stock options or  restricted  stock for up to an aggregate of 6,000,000
shares of Class B common  stock and the Class A equity  plan allows the award of
stock options and restricted stock for up to an aggregate of 3,100,000 shares of
Class A common stock.  Each includes a provision for automatic  option grants to
the  Company's  outside  directors.  As of March 31,  2000  there were no shares
granted under either plan.

Under the Company's stock option plans,  122,563 and 69,009 shares were reissued
from  treasury  stock in fiscal  2000 and  1999,  respectively.  No shares  were
distributed from reissued treasury stock in fiscal 1998.

The options  generally expire ten years from the date of grant and are generally
exercisable in monthly  increments  over 50 months.  Certain  options assumed in
connection  with the Maxis  merger in fiscal 1998 expire ten years from the date
of  grant,  and  vest  and  become  exercisable  at a rate  of 25% on the  first
anniversary of the date of grant and 25% of the shares each year thereafter.

Class B common stock grants will  generally  vest over 50 months with 2% vesting
per month.

The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 123,  "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" ("SFAS
123").  Accordingly,  no  compensation  expense has been  recognized for options
granted under the Company's  employee-based stock option plans. Had compensation
expense  been  determined  based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards
under those plans in accordance  with the  provisions of SFAS 123, the Company's
pro forma net income and net  income  per share for fiscal  2000,  1999 and 1998
would have been:

(In thousands, except per share data)

   Pro forma - diluted             $1.19       $0.74       $0.88
- -----------------------------------------------------------------

The fair value of each option  grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes  option-pricing model. The following weighted-average  assumptions
are used for grants made in 2000, 1999 and 1998 under the stock plans: risk-free
interest  rates of 4.93% to 6.54% in 2000;  4.39% to 5.55% in 1999; and 5.31% to
6.42% in 1998; expected volatility of 65% in fiscal 2000, 59% in fiscal 1999 and
58% in fiscal 1998;  expected lives of 2.29 years in fiscal 2000,  2.27 years in
fiscal  1999 and 2.25 years in fiscal  1998 under the Option  Plans and one year
for the Employee  Stock  Purchase Plan. No dividends are assumed in the expected
term.  The  Company's  calculations  are based on a  multiple  option  valuation
approach and forfeitures are recognized when they occur.  The above  disclosures
include  options  granted  under the former  Maxis  option plans as if they were
initially granted by the Company.





Because SFAS 123 is applicable only to options  granted  subsequent to March 31,
1995, the impact of non-vested stock options granted prior to this date has been
excluded from the pro forma calculation.  Accordingly, pro forma adjustments are
not  indicative of future period pro forma  adjustments  as the pro forma effect
will not be fully reflected until subsequent years.

amounted to $34,736,000, $34,581,000 and $26,215,000, for the fiscal years ended

(13)  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DIVESTITURE

(a) Kesmai

On February 7, 2000, the Company acquired Kesmai Corporation (now referred to as
"Kesmai")  from  News  America   Corporation   ("News  Corp")  in  exchange  for
$22,500,000 in cash and approximately  103,000 shares of the Company's  existing
common  stock valued at  $8,650,000.  Kesmai(TM)  specializes  in the design and
development  of  multiplayer  games  delivered  directly to  consumers  over the
Internet and is a major provider of game content to the Games Channel on the AOL
service.  The issuance of these shares was temporary,  pending the authorization
of Class B common stock.  Subsequently,  on March 22, 2000,  Class B shares were
authorized.  The Company granted 5 percent of the initial equity attributable to
EA.com to News Corp, adjusting the total common stock consideration  relating to
the acquisition by $703,000 to $9,353,000. The Company has contributed Kesmai to
the EA.com division.

The Company is also committed to spend $5 million in advertising with News Corp.
or any of its affiliates.

If a qualified  public  offering of Class B common  stock does not occur  within
twenty-four  months of News Corp's  purchase of such shares,  then News Corp has
the right to (1) exchange Class B common stock for approximately  103,000 shares
of Class A common stock, and (2) receive cash from Electronic Arts in the amount
of $9,650,000.

The acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method. The results of
operations of Kesmai and the estimated fair market values of the acquired assets
and liabilities have been included in the consolidated financial statements from
the date of  acquisition.  The adjusted  allocation of the excess purchase price
over the net tangible  liabilities  assumed was $32,815,000,  of which, based on
management's  estimates  prepared in  conjunction  with a third party  valuation
consultant,  $3,869,000  was  allocated  to  purchased  in-process  research and
development and $28,946,000 was allocated to other  intangible  assets.  Amounts
allocated  to  other  intangibles  include  goodwill  of  $18,932,000,  existing
technology  of  $3,992,000,  amounts  attributed  to a prior  AOL  agreement  of
$3,131,000 and other  intangibles  of  $2,891,000.  The allocation of intangible
assets is being amortized over lives ranging from two to seven years.

Purchased  in-process research and development includes the value of products in
the  development  stage that are not  considered  to have reached  technological
feasibility or to have alternative future use.  Accordingly,  this non-recurring
item was expensed in the Consolidated  Statement of Income upon  consummation of
the  acquisition.   The  non-recurring   charge  for  in-process   research  and
development  reduced diluted  earnings per share by  approximately  $0.04 in the
fiscal year 2000.

In connection with the acquisition of Kesmai, the Company allocated and expensed
$3,869,000 of the purchase price to acquired in-process  technology.  Kesmai had
various  projects  in  progress  at  the  time  of  the  acquisition.  As of the
acquisition date, costs to complete Kesmai projects acquired were expected to be
approximately  $10,550,000 in future  periods.  The Company  believes there have
been no significant changes





to these  estimates  as of March 31,  2000.  The  Company  currently  expects to
complete the  development of these projects at various dates through fiscal 2002
and to publish the projects upon  completion.  In conjunction with the merger of
Kesmai, the Company accrued approximately $200,000 related to direct transaction
costs and other related costs. At March 31, 2000 there were $133,000 in accruals
remaining related to these items.

The purchase price for the Kesmai  transaction  was allocated to assets acquired
and liabilities assumed as set forth below (in thousands):

In management's  opinion, the unaudited pro forma combined results of operations
are not  indicative  of the actual  results  that would  have  occurred  had the
acquisition  been  consummated  at the  beginning  of  fiscal  1999 or of future
operations of the combined  companies  under the ownership and management of the
Company.

(b) Westwood Studios

In September 1998, the Company  completed the  acquisition of Westwood  Studios,
Inc.  and  certain  assets  of the  Irvine,  California  - based  Virgin  Studio
(collectively  "Westwood") for  approximately  $122,688,000  in cash,  including
transaction expenses.  The adjusted allocation of the excess purchase price over
the net  tangible  liabilities  assumed  was  $128,573,000  of  which,  based on
management's  estimates  prepared in  conjunction  with a third party  valuation
consultant,  $41,836,000  was  allocated  to purchased  in-process  research and
development and $86,737,000 was allocated to other  intangible  assets.  Amounts
allocated to other  intangibles  include  franchise  trade names of $32,357,000,
existing  technology of $6,510,000,  workforces of $1,680,000 and other goodwill
of  $46,190,000  and are being  amortized  over lives ranging from two to twelve
years.  Purchased  in-process  research  and  development  includes the value of
products  in the  development  stage  that are not  considered  to have  reached
technological  feasibility or to have alternative future use. Accordingly,  this
non-recurring  item was  expensed in the  Consolidated  Statement of Income upon
consummation  of  the  acquisition.  The  non-recurring  charge  for  in-process
research and  development  reduced diluted  earnings per share by  approximately
$0.59 in the fiscal year 1999. The results of the operations of Westwood and the
estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities  assumed are included in
the Company's financial statements from the date of acquisition.

In conjunction  with the merger of Westwood,  the Company accrued  approximately
$1,500,000  related to direct  transaction costs and other related accruals.  At
March 31,  2000,  there were  $500,000  in accruals  remaining  related to these
items.

In  connection  with the  Westwood  acquisition,  the  purchase  price  has been
allocated to the assets and  liabilities  assumed  based upon the fair values on
the date of acquisition, as follows (in thousands):

================================================================================
Current assets                                                          $ 4,500
Property and equipment                                                    3,257

In management's  opinion, the unaudited pro forma combined results of operations
are not  indicative  of the actual  results  that would  have  occurred  had the
acquisition been consummated at the beginning of fiscal 1998 or at the beginning
of fiscal  1999 or of future  operations  of the  combined  companies  under the
ownership and management of the Company.





(c) ABC Software

In July 1998,  the  Company  acquired  ABC  Software  AG and ABC  Software  GmbH
(collectively "ABC"), independent distributors of entertainment, edutainment and
application software in Switzerland and Austria, respectively, for approximately
$9,466,000  in cash (net of cash acquired of  $5,099,000)  and $570,000 in other
consideration. The transaction has been accounted for under the purchase method.
The  excess  purchase  price  over the fair  value  of the net  tangible  assets
acquired of  approximately  $7,377,000  was  allocated  to goodwill and is being
amortized over 7 years.

(d) Square Co., Ltd.

In May 1998, the Company and Square Co., Ltd.  ("Square"),  a leading  developer
and publisher of entertainment software in Japan, completed the formation of two
new joint ventures in North America and Japan.  In North America,  the companies
formed Square Electronic Arts, LLC ("Square EA"), which has exclusive publishing
rights in North America for future interactive  entertainment  titles created by
Square. Additionally, the Company has the exclusive right to distribute in North
America  products  published  by this joint  venture.  The  Company  contributed
$3,000,000  and owns a 30% minority  interest in this joint venture while Square
owns 70%. This joint venture is accounted for under the equity method.

In Japan, the companies established  Electronic Arts Square KK ("EA Square KK"),
which will  localize and publish in Japan the  Company's  properties  originally
created in North  America  and Europe,  as well as develop and publish  original
video  games in  Japan.  The  Company  contributed  cash and has a 70%  majority
ownership interest, while Square contributed cash and owns 30%. Accordingly, the
assets,  liabilities  and results of operations for EA Square KK are included in
the Company's  Consolidated  Balance Sheets and Results of Operations since June
1, 1998,  the date of formation.  Square's 30% interest in EA Square KK has been
reflected as "Minority  interest in consolidated joint venture" on the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements.

(e) Maxis, Inc.

On July 25, 1997, the Company completed a merger with Maxis, Inc.  ("Maxis"),  a
California-based   interactive   software  developer.   Under  the  transaction,
approximately  4.1 million  shares of Electronic  Arts' stock were exchanged for
all  outstanding  Maxis common  stock.  The  transaction  was accounted for as a
pooling of interests. The accompanying financial statements,  notes and analyses
have been restated for all periods presented to reflect this transaction.

In  conjunction  with  the  merger  of  Maxis,  the  Company  recorded  costs of
$10,792,000.  This  charge  included  direct  transaction  fees  for  investment
bankers,  attorneys,  accountants,  and  other  related  costs of  approximately
$2,781,000  and costs  associated  with  integrating  the  operations of the two
companies of approximately  $8,011,000.  Included in the integration  costs were
redundant facility costs,  severance payments,  equipment  abandonment costs and
other  asset  write  downs,  contract  termination  charges  and  other  related
expenses.  Of the total merger costs,  approximately  $5,185,000 related to cash
expenditures while approximately $5,607,000 related to noncash charges. At March
31,  2000,  there were no accruals  remaining  related to these  merger  related
costs.

In December 1997, the Company  completed the sale of its 50% ownership  interest
in Creative  Wonders,  LLC, a joint venture  company formed with the Walt Disney
Company for  $16,750,000 in cash. The Company  recognized a gain of $12,625,000,
which is included in interest and other income.  Prior to the sale,  the Company
distributed  children's  interactive  titles  published  and  sold by the  joint
venture into the retail  channel.  The  investment  was  accounted for under the
equity method prior to sale.

(g) Other Business Combinations

Additionally,  during the year ended March 31,  2000,  the Company  acquired two
software  development  companies.  In connection  with these  acquisitions,  the
Company incurred a charge of $2,670,000 for acquired in-process technology.  The
charge was made after the Company  concluded that the in-process  technology had
not reached  technological  feasibility and had no alternative  future use after
taking into  consideration  the potential for usage of the software in different
products and resale of the software.

During the quarter  ended June 30,  1998,  the  Company  acquired  two  software
development  companies.  In  connection  with these  acquisitions,  the  Company
incurred a charge of $2,279,000 for acquired in-process  technology.  The charge
was made after the Company  concluded  that the  in-process  technology  had not
reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use after taking

The  Company  provides  for  U.S.  taxes  on an  insignificant  portion  of  the
undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and does not provide taxes on
the  remainder.  We have not  provided for Federal  income tax on  approximately
$165,000,000 of  undistributed  earnings of our foreign  subsidiaries,  since we
intend to reinvest this amount in foreign subsidiary operations indefinitely.

The Company's U.S.  income tax returns for the years 1992 through 1995 have been
examined by the Internal  Revenue Service (IRS). In 1998, the Company received a
notice of  deficiencies  from the IRS. These  deficiencies  relate  primarily to
operations in Puerto Rico,  which the Company is  contesting  in Tax Court.  The
Company  believes that any additional  liabilities,  if any, that arise from the
outcome of this examination  will not be material to the Company's  consolidated
financial statements.

(16) COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

In fiscal  1999,  the Company  adopted  SFAS No. 130,  "Reporting  Comprehensive
Income," which establishes  standards for reporting and display of comprehensive
income and its components  (revenues,  expenses,  gains and losses) in financial
statements.  SFAS 130 requires classification of other comprehensive income in a
financial  statement and display of other  comprehensive  income separately from
retained earnings and additional  paid-in capital.  Other  comprehensive  income
includes primarily foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains
(losses) on investments.

The change in the components of accumulated other  comprehensive  income, net of
taxes, is summarized as follows (in thousands):

(17) DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following  methods and  assumptions  were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that
value:

Cash, cash equivalents,  short-term investments,  receivables,  accounts payable
and accrued liabilities - the carrying amount approximates fair value because of
the short maturity of these instruments.

Long-term investments, investments classified as held-to-maturity and marketable
securities - fair value is based on quoted market prices.





(18) SEGMENT INFORMATION

In 1999,  the Company  adopted SFAS No. 131,  "Disclosures  about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related  Information",  which supersedes SFAS No. 14,  "Financial
Reporting  for  Segments  of a Business  Enterprise".  SFAS No. 131  establishes
standards for the reporting by public business  enterprises of information about
product lines, geographic areas and major customers.  The method for determining
what  information  to report is based on the way that  management  organizes the
operating  segments  within the Company  for making  operational  decisions  and
assessments of financial  performance.  The Company's chief  operating  decision
maker is considered to be the Company's Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). The CEO
reviews financial  information  presented on a consolidated basis accompanied by
disaggregated  information  about  revenues by geographic  region and by product
lines for  purposes  of  making  operating  decisions  and  assessing  financial
performance.

As a result of the approval of the Tracking Stock proposal to authorize issuance
of a new series of common stock designated as Class B common stock,  intended to
reflect  the  performance  of  EA.com,  management  considers  EA.com a separate
reportable segment.  Accordingly,  prior period information has been restated to
disclose  separate  segments.  The Company  operates in two  principal  business
segments globally:

     o   Electronic Arts core ("EA Core") business segment: creation,  marketing
         and distribution of entertainment software.

     o   EA.com  business  segment:  creation,  marketing  and  distribution  of
         entertainment software which can be played or sold online.

Please see the discussion regarding segment reporting in the MD&A.
