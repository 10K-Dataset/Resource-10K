ANNUAL REPORT




PART I

This Report contains forward-looking statements within the
    meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
    All statements, other than statements of historical fact,
    including statements regarding industry prospects and future
    results of operations or financial position, made in this Report
    are forward looking. We use words such as
    “anticipate”, “believe”, “expect”,
    “intend”, “estimate” (and the negative of
    any of these terms), “future” and similar expressions
    to help identify forward-looking statements. These
    forward-looking statements are subject to business and economic
    risk and reflect management’s current expectations, and
    involve subjects that are inherently uncertain and difficult to
    predict. Our actual results could differ materially. We will not
    necessarily update information if any forward-looking statement
    later turns out to be inaccurate. Risks and uncertainties that
    may affect our future results include, but are not limited to,
    those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors”,
    beginning on page 13.

Item 1:

Business

Overview

Electronic Arts develops, markets, publishes and distributes
    interactive software games and content that are playable by
    consumers on the following devices:

•

Video game consoles such as the Sony
    PlayStation

®

2 and
    PLAYSTATION

®

3,
    Microsoft
    Xbox

®

and
    Xbox 360

tm

and Nintendo
    Wii

tm

,

•

Personal computers (PCs),

•

Mobile platforms including cellular handsets and handheld game
    players such as the
    PlayStation

®

Portable
    (“PSP

tm

”),
    Nintendo
    DS

tm

and Game
    Boy

®

Advance and
    iPod

®

, and

•

Online (over the Internet and other proprietary online networks).

We also sell advertising in many of our games and on our
    websites.

We refer to consoles, PCs, mobile platforms and online
    collectively as “platforms”. In fiscal 2007, we
    developed or published products for 13 different platforms.
    Since our inception, we have published games for over
    50 different platforms. This platform diversification
    continues to be a cornerstone of our product strategy.

The interactive software games that we develop and publish are
    broken down into two major categories: (1) games developed
    by our EA Studios, and (2) games that we co-publish with,
    or distribute on behalf of, another company through our EA
    Partners group. Our EA Studios games are either developed
    internally at our development and production studios located in
    the United States, Canada, England, Sweden, Germany, Singapore,
    China, Romania and India, or by third parties whom we engage to
    develop games on our behalf at their own development and
    production studios. We market, publish and distribute games in
    over 30 countries throughout the world.

We market the products produced by our studios under the
    EA

tm

,
    EA
    SPORTS

tm

,
    EA SPORTS
    BIG

tm

,
    and
    POGO

tm

brands.

We were initially incorporated in California in 1982. In
    September 1991, we reincorporated under the laws of Delaware.
    Our principal executive offices are located at 209 Redwood
    Shores Parkway, Redwood City, California 94065 and our telephone
    number is

(650) 628-1500.

Development
    of Our Games

The console, handheld, PC and online games we publish are
    developed primarily by our EA Studios, while the games we offer
    for cellular handsets are developed primarily by third parties.
    In addition, through our EA Partners group, we team with other
    game development companies to assist them with the development
    of games on our behalf. For the fiscal years ended
    March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, research and development
    expenses were $1,041 million, $758 million and
    $633 million, respectively.



EA
    Studios

We develop packaged goods games internally at our development
    and production studios located in the United States, Canada,
    England, Sweden, Germany, Singapore and China. We invest in the
    creation of software tools to more efficiently develop games for
    multiple platforms. We also make investments in facilities and
    equipment that allow us to create and edit video and audio
    recordings that are used in our games. Employees whom we call
    “executive producers” are responsible for overseeing
    the development of one or more products or
    “franchises” (a series of sequeled or related
    products). We also engage third parties to develop games on our
    behalf at their own development and production studios.

Following our acquisition of JAMDAT Mobile Inc. in February
    2006, we merged our existing cellular handset software game
    development and publishing business into JAMDAT’s to
    establish our EA Mobile business. We engage third parties to
    develop games for cellular handsets on our behalf at their own
    development and production studios and, to a lesser extent, we
    develop cellular handset games internally at our development and
    production studios located in the United States, Canada,
    England, Romania and India.

We develop online games and content internally at our
    development and production studios located in the United States,
    Canada and Singapore. In fiscal 2007, we acquired Mythic
    Entertainment, Inc., a developer and publisher of massively
    multiplayer online role-playing games. We also engage third
    parties to develop online games on our behalf at their own
    development and production studios.

In fiscal 2007, we generated approximately 65 percent of
    our net revenue from games developed by our EA Studios that were
    initially released during the year, as compared to approximately
    73 percent in fiscal 2006. Excluding titles developed for
    cellular handsets, during fiscal 2007 we released 32 EA Studio
    titles compared to 31 EA Studio titles in fiscal 2006. In fiscal
    2007, we released over 190,000 stock keeping units, or SKUs (a
    version of a title designed for play on a particular platform),
    for cellular handsets.

Co-publishing,
    Distribution and Third Party Development

Through our EA Partners group, we team with other game
    development companies to assist with the development of their
    own interactive software games, which we then publish, market
    and distribute. We refer to these types of arrangements as
    “co-publishing”. For example, in fiscal 2007, we
    signed a co-publishing agreement with NAMCO BANDAI Games America
    for

Hellgate:
    London

tm

,
    which is being developed by Flagship Studios.

We also distribute interactive software games that are developed
    and published by other companies. An example of one of our
    recent distribution products is

Half-Life

®

2: Episode One

, which was developed and published by
    Valve and distributed worldwide by us.

We also engage third parties to develop games on our behalf.

Publishing
    Our Games — Marketing, Market Segments and
    Distribution

We market our products under four major brand names:

•

EA — we publish a variety of games under our EA brand.
    Some of our products published under the EA brand include

Need for
    Speed

tm

Carbon

,

The
    Sims

tm


and

The
    Godfather

tm

The Game

;

•

EA SPORTS — sports simulation games. Some of our
    products published under the EA SPORTS brand include

Madden
    NFL 07

,

FIFA Soccer 07

and

Tiger Woods PGA
    TOUR

®


;

•

EA SPORTS BIG — arcade-style extreme sports and
    modified traditional sports games. Some of our products
    published under the EA SPORTS BIG brand include

Def Jam:
    Icon

tm

,

NBA STREET Homecourt

and

FIFA Street 2

; and

•

POGO — Online casual games and downloadable casual
    games.



In addition, our EA Partners group operates under a variety of
    deal types and structures with the intent of making available
    our publishing marketing and distribution services to game
    developers who may not have the scale of our resources.

In fiscal 2007, we had two titles,

Need for Speed Carbon

and

Madden NFL 07

, published on 10 different
    platforms, each of which represented approximately
    11 percent of our total net revenue. In fiscal 2006, we had
    one title,

Need for Speed Most Wanted

, published on eight
    different platforms, which represented approximately
    10 percent of our total net revenue. In fiscal 2005, we had
    one title,

Need for Speed Underground 2

, published on
    five different platforms, which represented approximately
    11 percent of our total net revenue.

Packaged
    Goods

The console, PC and handheld games that we publish are made
    available to consumers as packaged goods (usually Blu-ray Disc,
    CD, DVD, cartridge or Universal Media Disc format) that are
    typically sold in retail stores and through online stores
    (including our own online store). In North America and Europe,
    our largest markets, we sell these packaged goods products
    primarily to retailers, including mass market retailers (such as
    Wal-Mart), electronics specialty stores (such as Best Buy) or
    game software specialty stores (such as GameStop). Many of our
    PC products can also be purchased over the Internet through
    digital download.

We generated approximately 95 percent of our North American
    packaged goods net revenue from direct sales to retailers, with
    the remaining net revenue being generated through a limited
    number of specialized and regional distributors and rack jobbers
    in markets where we believe direct sales would not be
    economical. Outside of North America, we derive packaged goods
    revenue primarily from direct sales to retailers. In a few of
    our smaller markets, we sell our packaged goods products through
    distributors with whom we have written agreements or informal
    arrangements, depending on the business customs of the
    territories. We also distribute products of other companies
    through our rack jobbing business in Switzerland. We had direct
    sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. which represented approximately
    13 percent of total net revenue in both fiscal 2007 and
    2006, and approximately 14 percent of total net revenue in
    fiscal 2005. We also had direct sales to GameStop Corp. which
    represented approximately 12 percent of total net revenue
    in fiscal 2007.

Video Games — Consoles, Handhelds and
    PCs.

Historically, there have been multiple video
    game consoles and handheld game players available to consumers,
    and there has been vigorous competition among manufacturers.
    While Sony’s
    PlayStation

®

and PlayStation 2 consoles have significantly outsold their
    competitors in the past, the PLAYSTATION 3 faces very strong
    competition from new platforms such as Microsoft’s Xbox 360
    and the Nintendo Wii. The PC also continues to be a strong
    interactive game platform. Similarly, while Nintendo’s Game
    Boy

®

Advance and Nintendo DS are current and historic leaders in the
    handheld game player market, Sony’s PlayStation Portable is
    also a competitor in this segment.

Video game consoles have historically had a life cycle of four
    to six years, which causes the video game software market to be
    cyclical as well. With the release of Microsoft’s Xbox 360
    in 2005 and the releases of Sony’s PLAYSTATION 3 and
    Nintendo’s Wii in 2006, our industry is at the beginning of
    a new cycle. As such, in fiscal 2008, we expect to release fewer
    titles for the PlayStation 2 than in fiscal 2007, a very small
    number of titles for the Xbox, and no titles for the Nintendo
    GameCube

Cellular
    Handsets

Through EA Mobile, we are a leading global publisher of
    interactive entertainment software playable on cellular
    handsets, including games, ring tones, images and other content.
    Our customers typically purchase and download our games through
    a wireless carrier’s branded

e-commerce

service accessed directly from their cellular handsets. These
    wireless carrier services include, among others, Verizon
    Wireless’

Get It Now

, Sprint PCS

Vision

,
    Cingular

MEdia

and Vodafone

live!.

Our customers
    are charged either a one-time or a monthly subscription fee on
    their cellular service invoice for the game. The wireless
    carriers generally retain a percentage of the fee and pay the
    remainder to us. The wireless distribution of our games
    eliminates traditional publishing complexities, including
    physical production, packaging, shipping, inventory management
    and return processing. Our customers may also purchase and
    download games directly from our website.

Many of our games are designed to take advantage of multimedia
    enhancements in the latest generation of cellular handsets,
    including high-resolution color displays, increased processing
    power, improved audio capabilities and increased memory
    capabilities. We publish games in multiple categories designed
    to appeal to a broad range of wireless subscribers. Our
    portfolio is primarily based on intellectual properties that we
    create and own, and well-established brands and content that we
    license from third parties.

Online

We publish four types of games that are played online by
    consumers — online casual games, massively multiplayer
    online games, mid-session games, and online-enabled packaged
    goods. We derive revenue from these games primarily through paid
    subscriptions, advertising and sales of digital content.

Online Casual Games.

We offer online casual
    games such as card games, puzzle games and word games on our
    website, pogo.com, and on certain online services provided by
    third parties. We had over 1.5 million paying Club Pogo
    subscribers as of March 31, 2007, up from 1.2 million
    paying subscribers as of March 31, 2006.

Massively Multiplayer Online Games.

Players
    experience online-only “massively multiplayer online
    games” (sometimes called “persistent state world
    games” or “MMOs”) as interactive virtual worlds
    where thousands of other players can interact with one another.
    After installing the software on their PCs, players are able to
    subscribe and interact with other players online. We currently
    offer three MMO games:

Ultima
    Online

tm

,
    Dark Age of
    Camelot

®

and

The Sims
    Online

tm

,
    and we are in the process of developing

Warhammer

®

Online.

Mid-session games.

Players experience
    mid-session games as interactive virtual worlds where players
    form small groups and interact with one another. We currently
    offer one mid-session game,

EA
    Sports

tm

FIFA Online,

but anticipate offering more in future years.
    Although we offer

EA Sports FIFA Online

for free, players
    may purchase additional in-game content from us through
    micro-transactions.

Online-Enabled Packaged Goods.

We include
    online functionality in certain of our PC, PLAYSTATION 3,
    PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, Xbox and PSP products, which
    enable consumers to participate in online communities and play
    against one another via the Internet.

Digital Content.

We offer full-game downloads
    and additional content (such as booster packs, expansion packs
    and smaller pieces of game content referred to as
    micro-transactions) for our PC and console-based games through
    our EA.com website and online interfaces within game consoles.
    In addition, our POGO games are offered through third-party
    websites.



Advertising.

We derive revenue from
    advertising in our games and on our websites.

Competition

We compete in the entertainment industry for the leisure time
    and discretionary spending of consumers with other forms of
    media, such as motion pictures, television, social networking
    and music. Our competitors vary in size and cost structure from
    very small companies with limited resources to very large,
    diversified corporations with greater financial and marketing
    resources than ours. For example, we compete with venture
    capital funded

start-ups,

traditional independent video game publishers, hardware and
    software manufacturers, casual entertainment websites, social
    networking websites, mobile games developers, foreign games
    developers and large media companies. We also compete with
    satellite radio, traditional radio and all other forms of
    entertainment.

Our business is characterized by the continuous introduction of
    innovative new titles and the development of new technologies.
    Competition is also based on product quality and features,
    timing of product releases, brand-name recognition, quality of
    in-game content, access to distribution channels, effectiveness
    of marketing and price.

In addition to competing for product sales, we face heavy
    competition from other software game companies and large media
    companies to obtain license agreements granting us the right to
    use intellectual property included in our products. Some of
    these content licenses are controlled by the diversified media
    companies, which, in some cases, have decided to publish their
    own games based on popular entertainment properties that they
    control, rather than licensing the content to a software game
    company such as us. See “Intellectual Property” below.

Sales
    of Packaged Goods

The market for our packaged goods products is also characterized
    by significant price competition and we regularly face pricing
    pressures from our competitors. These pressures have, from time
    to time, required us to reduce our prices on certain products.
    Our experience has been that software game prices tend to
    decline once a generation of consoles has been in the market for
    a significant period of time due to the increasing number of
    software titles competing for acceptance by consumers and the
    introduction of new consoles. As our industry has transitioned
    to a new generation of consoles over the past two years, we have
    experienced this kind of price erosion with respect to games for
    the prior generation of consoles (e.g., PlayStation 2, Xbox
    and Nintendo GameCube).

For sales of packaged goods, we compete directly with Sony,
    Microsoft and Nintendo, each of which develop and publish
    software for their respective console platforms. We also compete
    with numerous companies which, like us, develop and publish
    software games that operate on their consoles. These competitors
    include Activision, Atari, Capcom, Koei, Konami, LucasArts,
    Midway, Namco, Sega, Take-Two Interactive, THQ and Ubisoft,
    among others. As discussed above, diversified media companies
    such as Fox, Disney, Time Warner, Viacom and Vivendi are also
    expanding their software game publishing efforts.

Sales
    for Cellular Handsets

The wireless entertainment applications market segment, for
    which we develop and publish games, ring tones and wallpapers
    for cellular handsets, is highly competitive and characterized
    by frequent product introductions, evolving wireless platforms
    and new technologies. As demand for applications continues to
    increase, we expect new competitors to enter the market and
    existing competitors to allocate more resources to develop and
    market applications. As a result, we expect competition in the
    wireless entertainment market segment to intensify.

The current and potential competition in the wireless
    entertainment applications market segment includes major media
    companies, traditional video game publishing companies, wireless
    carriers, wireless software providers and other companies that
    specialize in wireless entertainment applications. We also
    compete with wireless content aggregators, who pool applications
    from multiple developers (and sometimes publishers) and



offer them to carriers or through other sales channels. In
    addition, new and existing competitors are beginning to offer
    wireless entertainment applications on an ad-supported basis.
    Currently, we consider our primary competitors in the wireless
    entertainment applications market segment to be Disney, Fox
    Mobile Entertainment, Gameloft, Glu Mobile, Hands-On Mobile,
    Namco, Sony Pictures and THQ Wireless.

Online
    Sales

The online games market segment is also highly competitive and
    characterized by frequent product introductions, new business
    models and new platforms. As the proportion of households with a
    broadband connection increases, we expect new competitors to
    enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more
    resources toward developing online games. As a result, we expect
    competition in the online games market segment to intensify.

Our current and potential competitors in the online games market
    segment include major media companies, traditional video game
    publishing companies, and companies that specialize in online
    games. Our competitors in the casual games segment include MSN,
    Popcap, Real, AOL and Yahoo!. In the massively multiplayer
    online game segment our competitors include Atari, Midway, NC
    Soft, Sony and Vivendi Games. In the mid-session game segment
    our competitors include Nexon.

Intellectual
    Property

Like other entertainment companies, our business is
    significantly based on the creation, acquisition, exploitation
    and protection of intellectual property. Some of this
    intellectual property is in the form of software code, patented
    technology, and other technology and trade secrets that we use
    to develop our games and to make them run properly on the
    platforms. Other intellectual property is in the form of
    audio-visual elements that consumers can see, hear and interact
    with when they are playing our games — we call this
    form of intellectual property “content”.

Each of our products embodies a number of separate forms of
    intellectual property protection: the software and the content
    of our products are copyrighted; our products may use patented
    inventions or trade secrets; our product brands and names may be
    trademarks of ours or others; our products may contain voices
    and likenesses of actors, athletes

and/or

commentators (which may be protected by personal publicity
    rights) and often contain musical compositions and recordings
    that are also copyrighted. Our products also may contain content
    licensed from others, such as trademarks, fictional characters,
    storylines and software code.

We acquire the rights to include wholly-owned intellectual
    property in our products by creating the intellectual property
    within our EA Studios. We also acquire the rights to include
    proprietary intellectual property in our products through
    acquisitions. We also enter into content license agreements such
    as those with sports leagues and player associations, movie
    studios and performing talent, music labels, music publishers
    and musicians. These licenses are typically limited to use of
    the licensed rights in products for specific time periods. In
    addition, our products that play on game consoles, handhelds and
    cellular handsets include technology that is owned by the
    console manufacturer and licensed non-exclusively to us for use.
    While we may have renewal rights for some licenses, our business
    and the justification for the development of many of our
    products is dependent on our ability to continue to obtain the
    intellectual property rights from the owners of these rights at
    reasonable rates.

Our products are susceptible to unauthorized copying. We
    typically distribute our PC products using copy protection
    technology that we license from other companies. In addition,
    console manufacturers, such as Sony, typically incorporate
    security devices in their consoles in an effort to prevent the
    use of unlicensed products. Our primary protection against
    unauthorized use, duplication and distribution of our products
    is enforcement of our copyright and trademark interests. We
    typically own the copyright to the software code as well as the
    brand or title name trademark under which our products are
    marketed. We register our copyrights and trademarks in the
    United States and other countries.

    we are authorized to develop and distribute DVD-based software
    products and online content compatible with the Xbox and Xbox
    360.

Nintendo.

Under the terms of agreements we
    have entered into with Nintendo Co., Ltd. and its affiliates, we
    are authorized to develop and distribute proprietary optical
    format disk products and cartridges compatible with the Nintendo
    GameCube, the Wii, the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance.
    Pursuant to these agreements, we engage Nintendo to supply Wii
    proprietary optical format disk products and Nintendo DS
    cartridges for our products.

Cellular
    Handsets

We have agreements to distribute our wireless applications
    through more than 110 carriers in over 40 countries.
    Our customers download our applications to their cellular
    handsets and their wireless carrier invoices them a one-time fee
    or monthly subscription fee. Our carrier distribution agreements
    establish the fees to be retained by the carrier for
    distributing our applications. These arrangements are typically
    terminable on short notice. The agreements generally do not
    obligate the carriers to market or distribute any of our
    applications.

Content
    Licensors

Many of our products are based on or incorporate content and
    trademarks owned by others. For example, our EA, EA SPORTS and
    EA SPORTS BIG products include rights licensed from third
    parties, including major studios, publishers, artists, authors,
    celebrities, athletes and the major sports leagues and players
    associations.

Inventory,
    Working Capital, Backlog, Manufacturing and Suppliers

We manage inventory by communicating with our customers prior to
    the release of our products, and then using our industry
    experience to forecast demand on a

product-by-product

and

territory-by-territory

basis. Historically, we have experienced high turnover of our
    products, and the lead times on re-orders of our products are
    generally short, approximately two to three weeks. Further, as
    discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, we have
    practices in place with our customers (such as stock balancing
    and price protection) that reduce product returns.

We typically ship orders immediately upon receipt. To the extent
    that any backlog may or may not exist at the end of a reporting
    period, it would be both coincidental and an unreliable
    indicator of future results of any period.

The suppliers we use to manufacture our games and related
    materials include independent third parties, Sony and Nintendo.

In many instances, we are able to acquire materials on a
    volume-discount basis. We have multiple potential sources of
    supply for most materials, except for the disk component of our
    PLAYSTATION 3, PlayStation 2, PSP and Wii and Nintendo
    DS cartridges.

Our online games and cellular handset applications are delivered
    digitally, and therefore, are not manufactured.

International
    Operations

We conduct business and have wholly-owned subsidiaries
    throughout the world, including offices in Europe, Australia,
    Asia and Latin America. International net revenue increased by
    4 percent to $1.425 billion, or



46 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2007, compared to
    $1.367 billion, or 46 percent of total net revenue in
    fiscal 2006.

The amounts of net revenue and long-lived assets attributable to
    each of our geographic regions for each of the last three fiscal
    years are set forth in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this report.

Seasonality

Our business is highly seasonal. We typically experience our
    highest sales volume in the holiday season quarter ending in
    December and a seasonal low in sales volume in the quarter
    ending in June. Starting in fiscal 2008, we expect to defer the
    recognition of a significant amount of net revenue related to
    our online-enabled packaged goods over an extended period of
    time (which we currently estimate to be six months). As a
    result, the quarter in which we generate the highest sales
    volume may be different than the quarter in which we recognize
    the highest net revenue. Our results can also vary based on a
    number of factors, including title release dates, consumer
    demand for our products, shipment schedules and our revenue
    recognition policies.

Employees

As of March 31, 2007, we employed approximately
    7,900 people, of whom over 4,500 were outside the United
    States. We believe that our ability to attract and retain
    qualified employees is a critical factor in the successful
    development of our products and that our future success will
    depend, in large measure, on our ability to continue to attract
    and retain qualified employees. Less than 3 percent of our
    employees, all of whom work for our Swedish development
    subsidiary, are represented by a union, guild or other
    collective bargaining organization.

Item 1A:

Risk
    Factors

Our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, which
    may affect our future financial performance. If any of the
    events or circumstances described below occurs, our business and
    financial performance could be harmed, our actual results could
    differ materially from our expectations and the market value of
    our stock could decline. The risks and uncertainties discussed
    below are not the only ones we face. There may be additional
    risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we
    currently do not believe are material that may harm our business
    and financial performance.

Our business is highly dependent on the success and
    availability of video game hardware systems manufactured by
    third parties, as well as our ability to develop commercially
    successful products for these systems.

We derive most of our revenue from the sale of products for play
    on video game hardware systems (which we also refer to as
    “platforms”) manufactured by third parties, such as
    Sony’s PlayStation 2 and PLAYSTATION 3,
    Microsoft’s Xbox 360 and Nintendo’s Wii. The success
    of our business is driven in large part by the commercial
    success and adequate supply of these video game hardware
    systems, our ability to accurately predict which systems will be
    successful in the marketplace, and our ability to develop
    commercially successful products for these systems. We must make
    product development decisions and commit significant resources
    well in advance of anticipated product ship dates. A platform
    for which we are developing products may not succeed or may have
    a shorter life cycle than anticipated. If consumer demand for
    the systems for which we are developing products are lower than
    our expectations, our revenue will suffer, we may be unable to
    fully recover the investments we have made in developing our
    products, and our financial performance will be harmed.
    Alternatively, a system for which we have not devoted
    significant resources could be more successful than we had
    initially anticipated, causing us to miss out on meaningful
    revenue opportunities.

Our industry is cyclical and is beginning its next cycle.
    During the transition, consumers may be slower to adopt new
    video game systems than we anticipate, and our operating results
    may suffer and become more difficult to predict.

Video game hardware systems have historically had a life cycle
    of four to six years, which causes the video game software
    market to be cyclical as well. Microsoft launched the Xbox 360
    in November 2005, while Sony and Nintendo launched the
    PLAYSTATION 3 and the Wii, respectively, in November 2006. We
    have continued to develop and market new titles for
    prior-generation video game systems such as the PlayStation 2
    while also making significant investments in products for the
    new systems. As the prior-generation systems reach the end of
    their life cycle and the installed base of the new systems
    continues to grow, our sales of video games for prior-generation
    systems will continue to decline as (1) we produce fewer
    titles for prior-generation systems, (2) consumers replace
    their prior-generation systems with the new systems,

and/or

(3) consumers defer game software purchases until they are
    able to purchase a new video game hardware system. This decline
    in prior-generation product sales may be greater than we
    anticipate, and sales of products for the new platforms may be
    lower than we anticipate. Moreover, we expect development costs
    for the new video game systems to be greater on a per-title
    basis than development costs for prior-generation video game
    systems. As a result of these factors, during the next several
    quarters, we expect our operating results to be more volatile
    and difficult to predict, which could cause our stock price to
    fluctuate significantly.

If we do not consistently meet our product development
    schedules, our operating results will be adversely affected.

Our business is highly seasonal, with the highest levels of
    consumer demand and a significant percentage of our sales
    occurring in the December quarter. In addition, we seek to
    release many of our products in conjunction with specific
    events, such as the release of a related movie or the beginning
    of a sports season or major sporting event. If we miss these key
    selling periods for any reason, including product delays or
    delayed introduction of a new platform for which we have
    developed products, our sales will suffer disproportionately.



Likewise, if a key event to which our product release schedule
    is tied were to be delayed or cancelled, our sales would also
    suffer disproportionately. Our ability to meet product
    development schedules is affected by a number of factors,
    including the creative processes involved, the coordination of
    large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams
    required by the increasing complexity of our products and the
    platforms for which they are developed, and the need to
    fine-tune our products prior to their release. We have
    experienced development delays for our products in the past,
    which caused us to push back release dates. In the future, any
    failure to meet anticipated production or release schedules
    would likely result in a delay of revenue

and/or

possibly a significant shortfall in our revenue, harm our
    profitability, and cause our operating results to be materially
    different than anticipated.

Our business is intensely competitive and “hit”
    driven. If we do not continue to deliver “hit”
    products and services or if consumers prefer our
    competitors’ products or services over our own, our
    operating results could suffer.

Competition in our industry is intense and we expect new
    competitors to continue to emerge in the United States and
    abroad. While many new products and services are regularly
    introduced, only a relatively small number of “hit”
    titles accounts for a significant portion of total revenue in
    our industry. Hit products or services offered by our
    competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we
    anticipate, which could cause revenue generated from our
    products and services to fall below expectations. If our
    competitors develop more successful products or services, offer
    competitive products or services at lower price points or based
    on payment models perceived as offering a better value
    proposition (such as

pay-for-play

or subscription-based models), or if we do not continue to
    develop consistently high-quality and well-received products and
    services, our revenue, margins, and profitability will decline.

Technology changes rapidly in our business and if we fail to
    anticipate or successfully implement new technologies or the
    manner in which people play our games, the quality, timeliness
    and competitiveness of our products and services will suffer.

Rapid technology changes in our industry require us to
    anticipate, sometimes years in advance, which technologies we
    must implement and take advantage of in order to make our
    products and services competitive in the market. Therefore, we
    usually start our product development with a range of technical
    development goals that we hope to be able to achieve. We may not
    be able to achieve these goals, or our competition may be able
    to achieve them more quickly and effectively than we can. In
    either case, our products and services may be technologically
    inferior to our competitors’, less appealing to consumers,
    or both. If we cannot achieve our technology goals within the
    original development schedule of our products and services, then
    we may delay their release until these technology goals can be
    achieved, which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our
    development expenses. Alternatively, we may increase the
    resources employed in research and development in an attempt to
    accelerate our development of new technologies, either to
    preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up
    with our competition, which would increase our development
    expenses.

The video game hardware manufacturers set the royalty rates
    and other fees that we must pay to publish games for their
    platforms, and therefore have significant influence on our
    costs. If one or more of these manufacturers adopt a different
    fee structure for future game consoles, our profitability will
    be materially impacted.

In order to publish products for a video game system such as the
    Xbox 360, PLAYSTATION 3 or Wii, we must take a license from the
    manufacturer, which gives it the opportunity to set the fee
    structure that we must pay in order to publish games for that
    platform. Similarly, certain manufacturers have retained the
    flexibility to change their fee structures, or adopt different
    fee structures for online gameplay and other new features for
    their consoles. The control that hardware manufacturers have
    over the fee structures for their platforms and online access
    makes it difficult for us to predict our costs, profitability
    and impact on margins. Because publishing products for video
    game systems is the largest portion of our business, any
    increase in fee structures would significantly harm our ability
    to generate revenues

and/or

profits.



The video game hardware manufacturers are among our chief
    competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of

and/or

access to our video game products. If they do not approve our
    products, we will be unable to ship to our customers.

Our agreements with hardware licensors (such as Sony for the
    PLAYSTATION 3, Microsoft for the Xbox 360, and Nintendo for
    the Wii) typically give significant control to the licensor over
    the approval and manufacturing of our products, which could, in
    certain circumstances, leave us unable to get our products
    approved, manufactured and shipped to customers. These hardware
    licensors are also among our chief competitors. Generally,
    control of the approval and manufacturing process by the
    hardware licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times
    and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently.
    While we believe that our relationships with our hardware
    licensors are currently good, the potential for these licensors
    to delay or refuse to approve or manufacture our products
    exists. Such occurrences would harm our business and our
    financial performance.

We also require compatibility code and the consent of Microsoft,
    Sony and Nintendo in order to include online capabilities in our
    products for their respective platforms. As online capabilities
    for video game systems become more significant, Microsoft, Sony
    and Nintendo could restrict the manner in which we provide
    online capabilities for our products. If Microsoft, Sony or
    Nintendo refused to approve our products with online
    capabilities or significantly impacted the financial terms on
    which these services are offered to our customers, our business
    could be harmed.

If we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to
    intellectual property, we will publish fewer hit titles and our
    revenue, profitability and cash flows will decline. Competition
    for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our
    costs.

Many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual
    property owned by others. For example, our EA SPORTS products
    include rights licensed from major sports leagues and
    players’ associations. Similarly, many of our other hit
    franchises, such as The Godfather, Harry Potter and Lord of the
    Rings, are based on key film and literary licenses. Competition
    for these licenses is intense. If we are unable to maintain
    these licenses or obtain additional licenses with significant
    commercial value, our revenues and profitability will decline
    significantly. Competition for these licenses may also drive up
    the advances, guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the
    licensor, which could significantly increase our costs.

Our business is subject to risks generally associated with
    the entertainment industry, any of which could significantly
    harm our operating results.

Our business is subject to risks that are generally associated
    with the entertainment industry, many of which are beyond our
    control. These risks could negatively impact our operating
    results and include: the popularity, price and timing of our
    games and the platforms on which they are played; economic
    conditions that adversely affect discretionary consumer
    spending; changes in consumer demographics; the availability and
    popularity of other forms of entertainment; and critical reviews
    and public tastes and preferences, which may change rapidly and
    cannot necessarily be predicted.

If we do not continue to attract and retain key personnel, we
    will be unable to effectively conduct our business.

The market for technical, creative, marketing and other
    personnel essential to the development and marketing of our
    products and management of our businesses is extremely
    competitive. Our leading position within the interactive
    entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of
    executives and key creative talent. If we cannot successfully
    recruit and retain the employees we need, or replace key
    employees following their departure, our ability to develop and
    manage our businesses will be impaired.

If patent claims continue to be asserted against us, we may
    be unable to sustain our current business models or profits, or
    we may be precluded from pursuing new business opportunities in
    the future.

Many patents have been issued that may apply to widely-used game
    technologies, or to potential new modes of delivering, playing
    or monetizing game software products. For example, infringement
    claims under many issued patents are now being asserted against
    interactive software or online game sites. Several such claims



have been asserted against us. We incur substantial expenses in
    evaluating and defending against such claims, regardless of the
    merits of the claims. In the event that there is a determination
    that we have infringed a third-party patent, we could incur
    significant monetary liability and be prevented from using the
    rights in the future, which could negatively impact our
    operating results. We may also discover that future
    opportunities to provide new and innovative modes of game play
    and game delivery to consumers may be precluded by existing
    patents that we are unable to license on reasonable terms.

Other intellectual property claims may increase our product
    costs or require us to cease selling affected products.

Many of our products include extremely realistic graphical
    images, and we expect that as technology continues to advance,
    images will become even more realistic. Some of the images and
    other content are based on real-world examples that may
    inadvertently infringe upon the intellectual property rights of
    others. Although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to
    ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual
    property rights of others, it is possible that third parties
    still may claim infringement. From time to time, we receive
    communications from third parties regarding such claims.
    Existing or future infringement claims against us, whether valid
    or not, may be time consuming and expensive to defend. Such
    claims or litigations could require us to stop selling the
    affected products, redesign those products to avoid
    infringement, or obtain a license, all of which would be costly
    and harm our business.

From time to time we may become involved in other legal
    proceedings which could adversely affect us.

We are currently, and from time to time in the future may
    become, subject to other legal proceedings, claims, litigation
    and government investigations or inquiries, which could be
    expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business
    operations. In addition, the outcome of any legal proceedings,
    claims, litigation, investigations or inquiries may be difficult
    to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, operating results, or financial condition.

Our business, our products and our distribution are subject
    to increasing regulation of content, consumer privacy,
    distribution and online hosting and delivery in the key
    territories in which we conduct business. If we do not
    successfully respond to these regulations, our business may
    suffer.

Legislation is continually being introduced that may affect both
    the content of our products and their distribution. For example,
    data and consumer protection laws in the United States and
    Europe impose various restrictions on our web sites. Those rules
    vary by territory although the Internet recognizes no
    geographical boundaries. Other countries, such as Germany, have
    adopted laws regulating content both in packaged games and those
    transmitted over the Internet that are stricter than current
    United States laws. In the United States, the federal and
    several state governments are continually considering content
    restrictions on products such as ours, as well as restrictions
    on distribution of such products. For example, recent
    legislation has been adopted in several states, and could be
    proposed at the federal level, that prohibits the sale of
    certain games (e.g., violent games or those with “M
    (Mature)” or “AO (Adults Only)” ratings) to
    minors. Any one or more of these factors could harm our business
    by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers,
    by limiting the size of the potential market for our products,
    and by requiring costly additional differentiation between
    products for different territories to address varying
    regulations.

If one or more of our titles were found to contain hidden,
    objectionable content, our business could suffer.

Throughout the history of our industry, many video games have
    been designed to include certain hidden content and gameplay
    features that are accessible through the use of in-game cheat
    codes or other technological means that are intended to enhance
    the gameplay experience. However, in several recent cases,
    hidden content or features have been found to be included in
    other publishers’ products by an employee who was not
    authorized to do so or by an outside developer without the
    knowledge of the publisher. From time to time, some hidden
    content and features have contained profanity, graphic violence
    and sexually explicit or otherwise objectionable material. In a
    few cases, the Entertainment Software Ratings Board
    (“ESRB”) has reacted to discoveries of hidden content
    and features by reviewing the rating that was originally
    assigned to the product, requiring the publisher to change the
    game packaging

and/or

fining the publisher. Retailers have



on occasion reacted to the discovery of such hidden content by
    removing these games from their shelves, refusing to sell them,
    and demanding that their publishers accept them as product
    returns. Likewise, consumers have reacted to the revelation of
    hidden content by refusing to purchase such games, demanding
    refunds for games they’ve already purchased, and refraining
    from buying other games published by the company whose game
    contained the objectionable material.

We have implemented preventative measures designed to reduce the
    possibility of hidden, objectionable content from appearing in
    the video games we publish. Nonetheless, these preventative
    measures are subject to human error, circumvention, overriding,
    and reasonable resource constraints. If a video game we
    published were found to contain hidden, objectionable content,
    the ESRB could demand that we recall a game and change its
    packaging to reflect a revised rating, retailers could refuse to
    sell it and demand we accept the return of any unsold copies or
    returns from customers, and consumers could refuse to buy it or
    demand that we refund their money. This could have a material
    negative impact on our operating results and financial
    condition. In addition, our reputation could be harmed, which
    could impact sales of other video games we sell. If any of these
    consequences were to occur, our business and financial
    performance could be significantly harmed.

If we ship defective products, our operating results could
    suffer.

Products such as ours are extremely complex software programs,
    and are difficult to develop, manufacture and distribute. We
    have quality controls in place to detect defects in the
    software, media and packaging of our products before they are
    released. Nonetheless, these quality controls are subject to
    human error, overriding, and reasonable resource constraints.
    Therefore, these quality controls and preventative measures may
    not be effective in detecting defects in our products before
    they have been reproduced and released into the marketplace. In
    such an event, we could be required to recall a product, or we
    may find it necessary to voluntarily recall a product,

and/or

scrap
    defective inventory, which could significantly harm our business
    and operating results.

Our international net revenue is subject to currency
    fluctuations.

For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, international net
    revenue comprised 46 percent of our total net revenue. We
    expect foreign sales to continue to account for a significant
    portion of our total net revenue. Such sales may be subject to
    unexpected regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers.
    Additionally, foreign sales are primarily made in local
    currencies, which may fluctuate against the U.S. dollar.
    While we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate
    some foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency
    denominated assets and liabilities (primarily certain
    intercompany receivables and payables) and, from time to time,
    foreign currency option contracts to hedge foreign currency
    forecasted transactions (primarily related to a portion of the
    revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currency generated
    by our operational subsidiaries), our results of operations,
    including our reported net revenue and net income, and financial
    condition would be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign
    currency fluctuations, particularly the Euro, British pound
    sterling and Canadian dollar.

Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax
    liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial
    condition.

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in
    various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required
    in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, and, in
    the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions
    and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is
    uncertain.

We are also required to estimate what our taxes will be in the
    future. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable,
    the estimation process and applicable laws are inherently
    uncertain, and our estimates are not binding on tax authorities.
    Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by our profit
    level, by changes in our business, including the mix of earnings
    in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the
    elections we make, changes in applicable tax laws as well as
    other factors. Further, our tax determinations are regularly
    subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those
    audits could adversely affect our income tax provision. Should
    our ultimate tax liability exceed our estimates, our income tax
    provision and net income or loss could be materially affected.



We incur certain tax expenses that do not decline
    proportionately with declines in our consolidated pre-tax income
    or loss. As a result, in absolute dollar terms, our tax expense
    will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower
    levels of pre-tax income or loss than higher levels. In
    addition, at lower levels of pre-tax income or loss, our
    effective tax rate will be more volatile.

In addition, the rules for tax accounting have recently been
    changed. In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation (“FIN”)
    No. 48, “

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
    - An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

”,
    which provides new rules for the accounting for uncertainty in
    income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance
    with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
    (“SFAS”) No. 109, “

Accounting for Income
    Taxes

” (see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements). We are evaluating what impact the
    adoption of FIN No. 48 will have on our Consolidated
    Financial Statements as it becomes effective in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2008. This impact could be material and our
    future effective tax rates could be more volatile.

We are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes, such
    as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and
    goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various
    foreign jurisdictions. We are regularly under examination by tax
    authorities with respect to these non-income taxes. There can be
    no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations, changes
    in our business or changes in applicable tax rules will not have
    an adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition.

Our reported financial results could be adversely affected by
    changes in financial accounting standards or by the application
    of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it
    evolves.

As a result of the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the
    review of accounting policies by the SEC and national and
    international accounting standards bodies, the frequency of
    accounting policy changes may accelerate. For example, as
    discussed above, FIN No. 48 will affect the way we
    account for income taxes and could have a material impact on our
    financial results. Similarly, changes in accounting standards
    relating to stock-based compensation require us to recognize
    significantly greater expense than we had been recognizing prior
    to the adoption of the new standard. Likewise, policies
    affecting software revenue recognition have and could further
    significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to
    our products and services. For example, as our industry
    transitions to new video game hardware systems, we expect a more
    significant portion of our console and PC games will be
    online-enabled and, as a result, we will be required to
    recognize the related revenue over an extended period of time
    rather than at the time of sale. As we enhance, expand and
    diversify our business and product offerings, the application of
    existing or future financial accounting standards, particularly
    those relating to the way we account for revenue and taxes,
    could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results
    although not necessarily on our cash flows.

We have begun the implementation of a new set of financial
    information systems in anticipation of a significant increase in
    deferred net revenue, which, if not completed in a successful
    and timely manner, could impede our ability to accurately
    process, prepare and analyze important financial data.

We have begun to implement a new set of financial information
    systems and processes designed to help us accurately process,
    prepare and analyze the significant amount of net revenue from
    online-enabled packaged goods we expect to recognize on a
    deferred basis beginning in fiscal 2008. The successful
    implementation of these systems and processes entails a number
    of risks due to the complexity of the systems, the number of
    people affected company-wide, and the implementation process
    itself. While testing of these new systems and processes and
    training of employees are done in advance of implementation,
    there are inherent limitations in our ability to simulate a
    full-scale operating environment in advance of implementation.
    There can be no assurance that the implementation of these
    financial information systems and processes will not impede our
    ability to accurately and timely process, prepare and analyze
    the financial data we use in making operating decisions and
    which form the basis of the financial information we include in
    the periodic reports we file with the SEC.



Changes in our worldwide operating structure or the adoption
    of new products and distribution models could have adverse tax
    consequences.

As we expand our international operations, adopt new products
    and new distribution models, implement changes to our operating
    structure or undertake intercompany transactions in light of
    changing tax laws, expiring rulings, acquisitions and our
    current and anticipated business and operational requirements,
    our tax expense could increase. For example, in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2006, we repatriated $375 million under
    the America Jobs Creation Act of 2004. As a result, we
    recognized an additional one-time tax expense in fiscal 2006 of
    $17 million.

The majority of our sales are made to a relatively small
    number of key customers. If these customers reduce their
    purchases of our products or become unable to pay for them, our
    business could be harmed.

In our fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, over
    70 percent of our U.S. sales were made to seven key
    customers. In Europe, our top ten customers accounted for
    approximately 31 percent of our sales in that territory
    during the year ended March 31, 2007. Worldwide, we had
    direct sales to two customers, Wal-Mart Stores and GameStop
    Corp., Inc., which represented approximately 13 percent and
    12 percent, respectively, of total net revenue in the year
    ended March 31, 2007. Though our products are available to
    consumers through a variety of retailers, the concentration of
    our sales in one, or a few, large customers could lead to a
    short-term disruption in our sales if one or more of these
    customers significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to
    carry our products, and could make us more vulnerable to
    collection risk if one or more of these large customers became
    unable to pay for our products. Additionally, our receivables
    from these large customers increase significantly in the
    December quarter as they stock up for the holiday selling
    season. Also, having such a large portion of our total net
    revenue concentrated in a few customers could reduce our
    negotiating leverage with these customers.

Acquisitions, investments and other strategic transactions
    could result in operating difficulties, dilution to our
    investors and other negative consequences.

We have engaged in, evaluated, and expect to continue to engage
    in and evaluate, a wide array of potential strategic
    transactions, including (i) acquisitions of companies,
    businesses, intellectual properties, and other assets,
    (ii) minority investments in strategic partners, and
    (iii) investments in new interactive entertainment
    businesses (for example, online and mobile games). Any of these
    strategic transactions could be material to our financial
    condition and results of operations. Although we regularly
    search for opportunities to engage in strategic transactions, we
    may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities. We
    may not be able to consummate potential acquisitions or
    investments or an acquisition or investment may not enhance our
    business or may decrease rather than increase our earnings. In
    addition, the process of integrating an acquired company or
    business, or successfully exploiting acquired intellectual
    property or other assets, could divert a significant amount of
    our management’s time and focus and may create unforeseen
    operating difficulties and expenditures. Additional risks we
    face include:

•

The need to implement or remediate controls, procedures and
    policies appropriate for a public company in an acquired company
    that, prior to the acquisition, lacked these controls,
    procedures and policies,

•

Cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from
    an acquired company or business into our organization,

•

Retaining key employees from the businesses we acquire,

•

The need to integrate an acquired company’s accounting,
    management information, human resource and other administrative
    systems to permit effective management, and

•

To the extent that we engage in strategic transactions outside
    of the United States, we face additional risks, including risks
    related to integration of operations across different cultures
    and languages, currency risks and the particular economic,
    political and regulatory risks associated with specific
    countries.



Future acquisitions and investments could involve the issuance
    of our equity securities, potentially diluting our existing
    stockholders, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or
    amortization expenses, write-offs of goodwill, intangibles, or
    acquired in-process technology, or other increased expenses, any
    of which could harm our financial condition. Our stockholders
    may not have the opportunity to review, vote on or evaluate
    future acquisitions or investments.

Our products are subject to the threat of piracy by a variety
    of organizations and individuals. If we are not successful in
    combating and preventing piracy, our sales and profitability
    could be harmed significantly.

In many countries around the world, more pirated copies of our
    products are sold than legitimate copies. Though we believe
    piracy has not had a material impact on our operating results to
    date, highly organized pirate operations have been expanding
    globally. In addition, the proliferation of technology designed
    to circumvent the protection measures we use in our products,
    the availability of broadband access to the Internet, the
    ability to download pirated copies of our games from various
    Internet sites, and the widespread proliferation of Internet
    cafes using pirated copies of our products, all have contributed
    to ongoing and expanding piracy. Though we take steps to make
    the unauthorized copying and distribution of our products more
    difficult, as do the manufacturers of consoles on which our
    games are played, these efforts may not be successful in
    controlling the piracy of our products. This could have a
    negative effect on our growth and profitability in the future.

Our stock price has been volatile and may continue to
    fluctuate significantly.

The market price of our common stock historically has been, and
    we expect will continue to be, subject to significant
    fluctuations. These fluctuations may be due to factors specific
    to us (including those discussed in the risk factors above as
    well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do
    not believe are material), to changes in securities
    analysts’ earnings estimates or ratings, to our results or
    future financial guidance falling below our expectations and
    analysts’ and investors’ expectations, to factors
    affecting the computer, software, Internet, entertainment, media
    or electronics industries, or to national or international
    economic conditions.

Redwood
    City Headquarters

In February 1995, we entered into a

build-to-suit

lease (“Phase One Lease”) with a third-party lessor
    for our headquarters facilities in Redwood City, California
    (“Phase One Facilities”). The Phase One Facilities
    comprise a total of approximately 350,000 square feet and
    provide space for sales, marketing, administration and research
    and development functions. In July 2001, the lessor refinanced
    the Phase One Lease with Keybank National Association through
    July 2006. The Phase One Lease expires in January 2039, subject
    to early termination in the event the underlying financing
    between the lessor and its lenders is not extended. Subject to
    certain terms and conditions, we may purchase the Phase One
    Facilities or arrange for the sale of the Phase One Facilities
    to a third party.

Pursuant to the terms of the Phase One Lease, we have an option
    to purchase the Phase One Facilities at any time for a purchase
    price of $132 million. In the event of a sale to a third
    party, if the sale price is less than $132 million, we will
    be obligated to reimburse the difference between the actual sale
    price and $132 million, up to a maximum of
    $117 million, subject to certain provisions of the Phase
    One Lease, as amended.

On May 26, 2006, the lessor extended its loan financing
    underlying the Phase One Lease with its lenders through July
    2007, and on May 14, 2007, the lenders extended this
    financing again for an additional year through July 2008. We may
    request, on behalf of the lessor and subject to lender approval,
    an additional one-year extension of the loan financing between
    the lessor and the lenders. In the event the lessor’s loan
    financing with the lenders is not extended, we may loan to the
    lessor approximately 90 percent of the financing, and
    require the lessor to extend the remainder through July 2009;
    otherwise the lease will terminate. We account for the Phase One
    Lease arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with
    SFAS No. 13,

“Accounting for Leases”

,
    as amended.

In December 2000, we entered into a second

build-to-suit

lease (“Phase Two Lease”) with Keybank National
    Association for a five and one-half year term beginning in
    December 2000 to expand our Redwood City, California
    headquarters facilities and develop adjacent property
    (“Phase Two Facilities”). Construction of the Phase
    Two Facilities was completed in June 2002. The Phase Two
    Facilities comprise a total of approximately 310,000 square
    feet and provide space for sales, marketing, administration and
    research and development functions. Subject to certain terms and
    conditions, we may purchase the Phase Two Facilities or arrange
    for the sale of the Phase Two Facilities to a third party.

Pursuant to the terms of the Phase Two Lease, we have an option
    to purchase the Phase Two Facilities at any time for a purchase
    price of $115 million. In the event of a sale to a third
    party, if the sale price is less than $115 million, we will
    be obligated to reimburse the difference between the actual sale
    price and $115 million, up to a maximum of
    $105 million, subject to certain provisions of the Phase
    Two Lease, as amended.

On May 26, 2006, the lessor extended the Phase Two Lease
    through July 2009 subject to early termination in the event the
    underlying loan financing between the lessor and its lenders is
    not extended. Concurrently with the extension of the lease, the
    lessor extended the loan financing underlying the Phase Two
    Lease with its



lenders through July 2007. On May 14, 2007 the lenders
    extended this financing again for an additional year through
    July 2008. We may request, on behalf of the lessor and subject
    to lender approval, an additional one-year extension of the loan
    financing between the lessor and the lenders. In the event the
    lessor’s loan financing with the lenders is not extended,
    we may loan to the lessor approximately 90 percent of the
    financing, and require the lessor to extend the remainder
    through July 2009, otherwise the lease will terminate. We
    account for the Phase Two Lease arrangement as an operating
    lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, as amended.

We believe that, as of March 31, 2007, the estimated fair
    values of both properties under these operating leases exceeded
    their respective guaranteed residual values.

Guildford,
    Orlando, Los Angeles and Vancouver Studios; Louisville
    Distribution Center

In February 2006, we entered into an agreement with an
    independent third party to lease a studio facility in Guildford,
    Surrey, United Kingdom, which commenced in June 2006 and will
    expire in May 2016. The facility comprises a total of
    approximately 95,000 square feet, which we use for research
    and development functions. Our rental obligation under this
    agreement is approximately $33 million over the initial
    ten-year term of the lease.

In June 2004, we entered into a lease agreement, amended in
    December 2005, with an independent third party for a studio
    facility in Orlando, Florida. The lease commenced in January
    2005 and expires in June 2010, with one five-year option to
    extend the lease term. The campus facilities comprise a total of
    140,000 square feet and provide space for research and
    development functions. Our rental obligation over the initial

five-and-a-half

year term of the lease is $15 million.

In July 2003, we entered into a lease agreement with an
    independent third party (the “Landlord”) for a studio
    facility in Los Angeles, California, which commenced in October
    2003 and expires in September 2013 with two five-year options to
    extend the lease term. Additionally, we have options to purchase
    the property after five and ten years based on the fair market
    value of the property at the date of sale, a right of first
    offer to purchase the property upon terms offered by the
    Landlord, and a right to share in the profits from a sale of the
    property. Existing campus facilities comprise a total of
    243,000 square feet and provide space for research and
    development functions. Our rental obligation under this
    agreement is $50 million over the initial ten-year term of
    the lease. This commitment is offset by expected sublease income
    of $6 million for a sublease to an affiliate of the
    Landlord of 18,000 square feet of the Los Angeles facility,
    which commenced in October 2003 and expires in September 2013,
    with options of early termination by the affiliate after five
    years and by us after four and five years.

In October 2002, we entered into a lease agreement, with an
    independent third party for a studio facility in Vancouver,
    British Columbia, Canada, which commenced in May 2003 and
    expires in April 2013. We amended the lease in October 2003. The
    facility comprises a total of approximately 65,000 square
    feet and provides space for research and development functions.
    Our rental obligation under this agreement is approximately
    $16 million over the initial ten-year term of the lease.

Our North American distribution is supported by a centralized
    warehouse facility that we lease in Louisville, Kentucky,
    occupying 250,000 square feet.

In addition to the properties discussed above, we have other
    properties under lease which have been included in our
    restructuring costs as discussed in Note 6 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
    this report. While we continually evaluate our facility
    requirements, we believe that suitable additional or substitute
    space will be available as needed to accommodate our future
    needs.



Item 3:

Legal
    Proceedings

On September 14, 2006, we received an informal inquiry from
    the Securities and Exchange Commission requesting certain
    documents and information relating to our stock option grant
    practices from January 1, 1997 through the date of the
    letter. We have cooperated to date with all matters related to
    this request. We most recently provided the SEC with information
    in December 2006. The SEC has not asked for any further
    information since that time.

We are also subject to claims and litigation arising in the
    ordinary course of business. We believe that any liability from
    any reasonably foreseeable disposition of such claims and
    litigation, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
    or results of operations.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

OVERVIEW

The following overview is a top-level discussion of our
    operating results as well as some of the trends and drivers that
    affect our business. Management believes that an understanding
    of these trends and drivers is important in order to understand
    our results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, as
    well as our future prospects. This summary is not intended to be
    exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the
    detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this

Form 10-K,

including in the “Business” section and the “Risk
    Factors” above, the remainder of “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations”, or the Consolidated Financial Statements and
    related notes.

About
    Electronic Arts

We develop, market, publish and distribute interactive software
    games that are playable by consumers on video game consoles
    (such as the Sony PlayStation 2 and PLAYSTATION 3,
    Microsoft Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii), personal computers, mobile
    platforms (including cellular handsets and handheld game players
    such as the PlayStation Portable (“PSP”) and the
    Nintendo DS) and online (over the Internet and other proprietary
    online networks). Some of our games are based on content that we
    license from others (e.g., Madden NFL Football, The Godfather
    and FIFA Soccer), and some of our games are based on our own
    wholly-owned intellectual property (e.g., The Sims and Need for
    Speed). Our goal is to publish titles with mass-market appeal,
    which often means translating and localizing them for sale in
    non-English speaking countries. In addition, we also attempt to
    create software game “franchises” that allow us to
    publish new titles on a recurring basis that are based on the
    same property. Examples of this franchise approach are the
    annual iterations of our sports-based products (e.g., Madden NFL
    Football,
    NCAA

®

Football and FIFA Soccer), wholly-owned properties that can be
    successfully sequeled (e.g., The Sims, Need for Speed and
    Battlefield) and titles based on long-lived literary

and/or

movie
    properties (e.g., Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter).

Overview
    of Financial Results

Total net revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007
    was $3.091 billion, up 5 percent as compared to the
    fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. Total net revenue for the
    fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 was driven by sales of

Madden NFL 07

,

Need for Speed Carbon

,

FIFA

,

The Sims 2 Pets

, and

NCAA

®

Football 07.

Four titles sold more than five
    million units in the fiscal year ended March 31,
    2007 —

Madden NFL 07

,

, and

Net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 was
    $76 million as compared to $236 million for the fiscal
    year ended March 31, 2006. Diluted net income per share for
    the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 was $0.24 as compared
    to $0.75 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. Although
    net revenue increased in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006,
    net income decreased due to an increase in our operating
    expenses as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 123
    (revised 2004) (“SFAS No. 123(R)”),
    “

Share Based Payment

”, an increase in our
    annual bonus expense and an increase in additional
    personnel-related costs due to an increase in headcount. These
    increases were further mitigated by a decrease in our income tax
    provision.

We generated $397 million of cash from operating activities
    during the year ended March 31, 2007, as compared to
    $596 million for fiscal 2006. The decrease in cash
    generated from operating activities was primarily due to the
    timing of the collection of our receivables as a result of
    collecting a greater amount of our receivables during fiscal
    2006 as compared to fiscal 2007.

Stock-Based Compensation.

Beginning in fiscal
    2007, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) which requires us to
    recognize the cost resulting from all share-based payment
    transactions in our financial statements using a
    fair-value-based method. See Note 12 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table
    summarizes our stock-based compensation expense resulting from
    stock options, restricted stock, restricted



stock units and our employee stock purchase plan included in our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal years ended
    March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (in millions):

    unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock and
    restricted stock units (collectively referred to as
    “restricted stock rights”) was $82 million and is
    expected to be recognized over a weighted-average service period
    of 2.3 years.

Management’s
    Overview of Historical and Prospective Business
    Trends

Transition to A New Generation of
    Consoles.

Video game hardware systems have
    historically had a life cycle of four to six years, which causes
    the video game software market to be cyclical as well. Microsoft
    launched the Xbox 360 in November 2005, while Sony and Nintendo
    launched the PLAYSTATION 3 and the Wii, respectively, in
    November 2006. We have continued to develop and market new
    titles for prior-generation video game systems such as the
    PlayStation 2 while also making significant investments in
    products for the new systems. As the prior-generation systems
    reach the end of their life cycle and the installed base of the
    new systems continues to grow, our sales of video games for
    prior-generation systems will continue to decline as (1) we
    produce fewer titles for prior-generation systems,
    (2) consumers replace their prior-generation systems with
    the new systems,

and/or

(3) consumers reduce game software purchases for certain
    prior-generation consoles generally, for example, until they are
    able to purchase a new video game hardware system. This decline
    in prior-generation product sales could ultimately be greater
    than we anticipate, and sales of products for the new platforms
    may be lower than we anticipate. Moreover, we expect development
    costs for the new video game systems to be greater on a
    per-title basis than development costs for prior-generation
    video game systems.

We have incurred increased costs during this transition as we
    have continued to develop and market new titles for certain
    prior-generation video game platforms while also making
    significant investments in products for the new generation
    platforms. As we move through the life cycle of prior-generation
    consoles, we will continue to devote significant resources to
    the development of prior-generation titles while at the same
    time spending more for the new generation of platforms and
    technology. As a result of these factors, we expect research and
    development expenses to increase in fiscal 2008.

Investment in Online.

Today, we generate net
    revenue from a variety of online products and services,
    including casual games and downloadable content marketed under
    our Pogo brand, persistent state world games such as

Ultima
    Online

and

Dark Age of Camelot,

PC-based downloadable
    content and online-enabled packaged goods. As the nature of
    online game offerings expands and evolves, we anticipate
    long-term opportunities for growth in this area. For example, we
    expect that consumers will take advantage of the online
    connectivity of the new generation of consoles at a much higher
    rate than they have on prior-generation consoles, allowing more
    consumers to enhance their gameplay experience through
    multiplayer activity, community-building and downloading
    content. We plan to increase the amount of content available for
    download on the PC, consoles and cell phones, increase the
    number of games with dynamic in-game advertising and to increase
    the number of PC-based games that can be downloaded digitally.
    In addition, we plan to expand our casual game offerings
    internationally and to invest in growing genres such as
    mid-session



games. To further enhance our online offerings, we acquired
    Mythic, a developer and publisher of massively multiplayer
    online role-playing games, in July 2006. We intend to make
    significant investments in online products, infrastructure and
    services and believe that online gameplay will become an
    increasingly important part of our business in the long term.

Significantly Increased Deferred Revenue for Online-Enabled
    Games.

The ubiquity of high-speed Internet access
    and the integration of network connectivity into new generation
    game consoles are expected to increase demand for games with
    online-enabled features. To address this demand, many of our
    software products are developed with the ability to be connected
    to and played via the Internet. In order for consumers to
    participate in online communities and play against one another
    via the Internet, we (or through outsourced arrangements with
    third parties) have servers which support the various online
    services we provide to consumers such as matchmaking, roster
    updates, tournaments and player rankings. In situations where we
    do not separately sell these online services, we consider the
    sale of the software product as a “bundle” sale or
    multiple element arrangement in which we sell both the software
    product and the online service for one combined price.

Through fiscal 2007, for accounting purposes, vendor specific
    objective evidence of fair value existed for the online service.
    Accordingly, we allocated the revenue collected from the sale of
    the software product between the online service and the software
    product and recognized the amounts allocated to each element
    separately. However, starting in fiscal 2008, for accounting
    purposes, the required vendor specific objective evidence of
    fair value will not exist for the online services. This will
    prevent us from allocating and recognizing revenue related to
    the software product and the online services separately.
    Accordingly, we will begin to recognize all of the revenue from
    the sale of our online-enabled software products related to the
    PC, PlayStation 2, PLAYSTATION 3 and the PSP platforms over
    the estimated online service period (currently expected to be
    recognized over six months after the month of sale). We
    anticipate that, in fiscal 2008, we will likely defer
    approximately $400 to $500 million in net revenue from the
    sale of these online-enabled software products into fiscal 2009.
    On a quarterly basis, this amount will vary significantly
    depending upon the timing of the release of the online-enabled
    software product and the sales volume of such products. In
    addition, we will expense the cost of goods sold related to
    these transactions when delivered. As of March 31, 2007,
    deferred net revenue related to packaged goods and digital
    content (i.e., content delivered to the consumer via the
    Internet including (1) digital downloads and
    (2) certain incremental content related to our core
    subscription services playable only online, which are types of
    “micro-transactions”) was $23 million.

Expansion of Mobile Platforms.

Advances in
    mobile technology have resulted in a variety of new and evolving
    platforms for

on-the-go

interactive entertainment that appeal to a broader demographic
    of consumers. Our efforts to capitalize on the growth in mobile
    interactive entertainment are focused in two broad
    areas — packaged goods games for handheld game systems
    and downloadable games for cellular handsets.

We have developed and published games for a variety of handheld
    platforms, including the Nintendo Game Boy and Game Boy Advance,
    for several years. The introductions of the Sony PSP and the
    Nintendo DS, with their enhanced graphics, deeper gameplay, and
    online functionality, provide a richer mobile gaming experience
    for consumers.

We expect sales of games for cellular handsets to continue to be
    an increasingly important part of our business worldwide. To
    accelerate our position in this growing segment, in February
    2006, we acquired JAMDAT Mobile Inc., a global publisher of
    wireless games and other wireless entertainment applications. As
    a result of this acquisition, our net revenue from games for
    cellular handsets increased significantly in fiscal 2007 as
    compared to prior years. Likewise, the acquisition, along with
    the additional investment required to grow this portion of our
    business globally, resulted in increased license royalties,
    development and operating expenses in fiscal 2007.

As mobile technology continues to evolve and the installed base
    of both handheld game systems and game-enabled cellular phones
    continues to expand, we anticipate that sales of our titles for
    mobile platforms — for both handhelds and cellular
    handsets — will become an increasingly important part
    of our business.

Acquisitions, Investments and Strategic
    Transactions.

We have engaged in, evaluated, and
    expect to continue to engage in and evaluate, a wide array of
    potential strategic transactions, including
    (1) acquisitions of



companies, businesses, intellectual properties, and other
    assets, and (2) investments in new interactive
    entertainment businesses, such as online and mobile games. In
    May 2007, we announced that we entered into a licensing
    agreement with and expect to make a strategic equity investment
    in The9 Limited, a leading online game operator in China, on or
    around May 29, 2007. The licensing agreement gives The9
    exclusive publishing rights for

EA SPORTS FIFA Online

in
    mainland China. In April 2007, we expanded our commercial
    agreements with and made strategic equity investments in Neowiz
    Corporation and its online gaming subsidiary, Neowiz Games.
    Based in Korea, Neowiz is an online media and gaming company
    with which we partnered in 2006 to launch

EA Sports FIFA
    Online

in Korea. In October 2006, the remaining outstanding
    shares of Digital Illusions C.E. (“DICE”) were
    purchased, thereby completing the acquisition of the remaining
    minority interest of DICE. In July 2006, we acquired Mythic as
    part of our efforts to accelerate our growth in the massively
    multiplayer online role-playing market. In fiscal 2007, we also
    acquired SingShot Media, a San Francisco-based online
    karaoke community, as well as substantially all of the assets of
    Headgate Studios, a Utah-based developer with which we had
    partnered since 2000 to develop certain EA franchises, and
    Phenomic Game Development, a developer of Real Time Strategy
    games based in Germany. In fiscal 2006, we acquired JAMDAT as
    part of our efforts to accelerate our growth in mobile gaming.

International Expansion.

We expect
    international sales to remain a fundamental part of our
    business. As part of our international expansion strategy, we
    may seek to partner with established local companies through
    acquisitions, joint ventures, minority investments or other
    similar arrangements. We are planning to expand our development
    and business activities internationally. We believe that in
    order to succeed internationally, it is important to locally
    develop content that is specifically directed toward local
    cultures and consumers. As such, we expect to continue to devote
    resources to hiring local development talent and expanding our
    infrastructure.

Sales of “Hit” Titles.

Sales of
    “hit” titles, several of which were top sellers in a
    number of countries, contributed significantly to our net
    revenue in fiscal 2007. Our top-selling titles across all
    platforms worldwide during the year ended March 31, 2007
    were

Madden NFL 07

,

Need for Speed Carbon

,

FIFA

,

The Sims 2 Pets

and

NCAA Football 07.

Hit
    titles are important to our financial performance because they
    benefit from overall economies of scale. We have developed, and
    it is our objective to continue to develop, many of our hit
    titles to become franchise titles that can be regularly iterated.

Increasing Licensing Costs.

We generate a
    significant portion of our net revenue and operating income from
    games based on licensed content, such as FIFA Soccer. We have
    recently entered into new licenses and renewed older licenses,
    some of which may contain higher royalty rates or guarantees
    than similar license agreements we have entered into in the
    past. We believe these licenses, and the product franchises they
    support, will continue to be important to our future operations,
    but the higher costs of these licenses will negatively impact
    our gross margins.

Foreign Currency Exchange Impact.

Net revenue
    from international sales accounted for approximately
    46 percent of our total net revenue during both fiscal 2007
    and 2006. Our international net revenue was primarily driven by
    sales in Europe and, to a much lesser extent, in Asia.

Year-over-year,

foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on our net revenue
    of $53 million, or 2 percent, for the year ended
    March 31, 2007.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial
    Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    contingent assets and liabilities, and revenue and expenses
    during the reporting periods. The policies discussed below are
    considered by management to be critical because they are not
    only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and
    results of operations but also because application and
    interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and
    estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown.
    As a result, actual results may differ materially from our
    estimates.



Revenue
    Recognition, Sales Returns, Allowances and Bad Debt
    Reserves

We principally derive revenue from sales of interactive software
    games designed for play on video game consoles (such as the
    PLAYSTATION 3, Xbox 360 and Wii), PCs and mobile platforms
    including handheld game players (such as the Sony PSP, Nintendo
    DS and Nintendo Game Boy Advance) and cellular handsets. We
    evaluate the recognition of revenue based on the criteria set
    forth in Statement of Position (“SOP”)

97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition”

, as amended by

SOP 98-9,

“Modification of

SOP 97-2,

    (“SAB”) No. 104,

“Revenue
    Recognition”.

We evaluate revenue recognition using the
    following basic criteria and recognize revenue when all four of
    the following criteria are met:

•

Evidence of an arrangement.

Evidence of an agreement with
    the customer that reflects the terms and conditions to deliver
    products must be present in order to recognize revenue.

•

Delivery.

Delivery is considered to occur when a product
    is shipped and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership have
    been transferred to the customer. For online game services,
    delivery is considered to occur as the service is provided.

•

Fixed or determinable fee.

If a portion of the
    arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable, we recognize
    revenue as the amount becomes fixed or determinable.

•

Collection is deemed probable.

We conduct a credit review
    of each customer involved in a significant transaction to
    determine the creditworthiness of the customer. Collection is
    deemed probable if we expect the customer to be able to pay
    amounts under the arrangement as those amounts become due. If we
    determine that collection is not probable, we recognize revenue
    when collection becomes probable (generally upon cash
    collection).

Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been
    satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have
    a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we
    report. For example, for multiple element arrangements, we must
    make assumptions and judgments in order to: (1) determine
    whether and when each element has been delivered;
    (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are
    essential to the functionality of the delivered products and
    services; (3) determine whether vendor-specific objective
    evidence of fair value (“VSOE”) exists for each
    undelivered element; and (4) allocate the total price among
    the various elements we must deliver. Changes to any of these
    assumptions or judgments, or changes to the elements in a
    software arrangement, could cause a material increase or
    decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular
    period. For example, some of our packaged goods products are
    sold with online services. Prior to, and through fiscal 2007, we
    had been able to determine VSOE for the online services to be
    delivered; therefore, we have been able to allocate the total
    price received from the combined product and online service sale
    between these two elements and recognize the related revenue
    separately. However, starting in fiscal 2008, VSOE will not
    exist for the online services to be delivered for certain
    platforms and all revenue from these transactions will be
    recognized over the estimated online service period. More
    specifically, we will begin to recognize the revenue from sales
    of certain online-enabled packaged goods on a straight-line
    basis over six months after the month of sale. Accordingly, this
    relatively small change (from having VSOE for online hosting
    services to no longer having VSOE) will have a significant
    effect on our reported results.

Determining whether a transaction constitutes an online game
    service transaction or a download of a product requires judgment
    and can be difficult. The accounting for these transactions is
    significantly different. Revenue from product downloads is
    recognized when the download occurs (assuming all other
    recognition criteria are met). Revenue from online game services
    is recognized as the services are rendered. If the service
    period is not defined, we recognize the revenue over the
    estimated service period. Determining the estimated service
    period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular
    revision based on historical online usage.

Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors
    (“channel partners”), is recognized when the above
    criteria are met. We reduce product revenue for estimated future
    returns, price protection, and other offerings, which may occur
    with our customers and channel partners. In certain countries,
    we have stock-balancing programs for our PC and video game
    system products, which allow for the exchange of these



products by resellers under certain circumstances. It is our
    general practice to exchange products or give credits rather
    than to give cash refunds.

In certain countries, from time to time, we decide to provide
    price protection for both our PC and video game system products.
    When evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price
    protection allowances, we analyze historical returns, current
    sell-through of distributor and retailer inventory of our
    products, current trends in retail and the video game segment,
    changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products, and
    other related factors. In addition, we monitor the volume of
    sales to our channel partners and their inventories, as
    substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could
    result in high returns or higher price protection costs in
    subsequent periods.

In the future, actual returns and price protections may
    materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the
    distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer
    preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due
    to new platforms, product updates or competing products. For
    example, the risk of product returns

and/or

price
    protection for our products may continue to increase as the
    PlayStation 2 console moves through its lifecycle. While we
    believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters,
    these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our
    estimates changed, our returns and price protection reserves
    would change, which would impact the total net revenue we
    report. For example, if actual returns

and/or

price
    protection were significantly greater than the reserves we have
    established, our actual results would decrease our reported
    total net revenue. Conversely, if actual returns

and/or

price
    protection were significantly less than our reserves, this would
    increase our reported total net revenue.

Significant judgment is required to estimate our allowance for
    doubtful accounts in any accounting period. We determine our
    allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer
    creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends and
    historical experience. Depending upon the overall economic
    climate and the financial condition of our customers, the amount
    and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could
    change significantly.

Royalties
    and Licenses

Our royalty expenses consist of payments to (1) content
    licensors, (2) independent software developers, and
    (3) co-publishing and distribution affiliates. License
    royalties consist of payments made to celebrities, professional
    sports organizations, movie studios and other organizations for
    our use of their trademarks, copyrights, personal publicity
    rights, content

and/or

other
    intellectual property. Royalty payments to independent software
    developers are payments for the development of intellectual
    property related to our games. Co-publishing and distribution
    royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of
    product.

Royalty-based obligations with content licensors and
    distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and
    capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and
    subsequently paid. These royalty-based obligations are generally
    expensed to cost of goods sold generally at the greater of the
    contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on expected
    net product sales. Significant judgment is required to estimate
    the effective royalty rate for a particular contract. Because
    the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to
    project future revenue, it is inherently subjective as our
    future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors,
    including (1) the total number of titles subject to the
    contract, (2) the timing of the release of these titles,
    (3) the number of software units we expect to sell which
    can be impacted by a number of variables, including product
    quality and competition, and (4) future pricing.
    Determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is
    particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in
    predicting the popularity of entertainment products.
    Accordingly, if our future revenue projections change, our
    effective royalty rates would change, which could impact the
    royalty expense we recognize. Prepayments made to thinly
    capitalized independent software developers and co-publishing
    affiliates are generally made in connection with the development
    of a particular product and, therefore, we are generally subject
    to development risk prior to the release of the product.
    Accordingly, payments that are due prior to completion of a
    product are generally amortized to research and development over
    the development period as the services are incurred. Payments
    due after completion of the product (primarily royalty-based in
    nature) are generally expensed as cost of goods sold.



Our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed
    royalty payments which are initially recorded as an asset and as
    a liability at the contractual amount when no performance
    remains with the licensor. When performance remains with the
    licensor, we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually
    paid and as a liability when incurred, rather than recording the
    asset and liability upon execution of the contract. Minimum
    royalty payment obligations are classified as current
    liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are
    contractually due within the next twelve months. As of
    March 31, 2007 and 2006, approximately $9 million of
    minimum guaranteed royalty obligations had been recognized in
    each period.

Each quarter, we also evaluate the future realization of our
    royalty-based assets as well as any unrecognized minimum
    commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely
    to be realized through product sales. Any impairments determined
    before the launch of a product are charged to research and
    development expense. Impairments determined post-launch are
    charged to cost of goods sold. In either case, we rely on
    estimated revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid
    royalties and commitments. If actual sales or revised revenue
    estimates fall below the initial revenue estimate, then the
    actual charge taken may be greater in any given quarter than
    anticipated. We had no impairments during fiscal 2007. During
    fiscal 2006 and 2005, we recorded impairment charges of
    $16 million and $8 million, respectively.

Valuation
    of Long-Lived Assets, including goodwill and other intangible
    assets

We evaluate both purchased intangible assets and other
    long-lived assets in order to determine if events or changes in
    circumstances indicate a potential impairment in value exists.
    This evaluation requires us to estimate, among other things, the
    remaining useful lives of the assets and future cash flows of
    the business. These evaluations and estimates require the use of
    judgment. Our actual results could differ materially from our
    current estimates.

Under current accounting standards, we make judgments about the
    recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other
    long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate a potential impairment in the remaining value of the
    assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In order to
    determine if a potential impairment has occurred, management
    makes various assumptions about the future value of the asset by
    evaluating future business prospects and estimated cash flows.
    Our future net cash flows are primarily dependent on the sale of
    products for play on proprietary video game consoles, handheld
    game players, PCs, and cellular handsets
    (“platforms”). The sales of our products are affected
    by our ability to accurately predict which platforms and which
    products we develop will be successful. Also, our revenue and
    earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product
    release schedules. Due to product sales shortfalls, we may not
    realize the future net cash flows necessary to recover our
    long-lived assets, which may result in an impairment charge
    being recorded in the future. We recognized an insignificant
    amount of impairment in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005.

SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets”

requires at least an annual assessment for
    impairment of goodwill by applying a fair-value-based test. A
    two-step approach is required to test goodwill for impairment
    for each reporting unit. The first step tests for impairment by
    applying fair value-based tests at the reporting unit level. The
    second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by
    applying fair value-based tests to individual assets and
    liabilities within each reporting unit. Application of the
    goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including
    identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and
    liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to
    reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each
    reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is
    estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology which
    requires significant judgment to estimate the future cash flows,
    determine the appropriate discount rates, growth rates and other
    assumptions. The determination of fair value for each reporting
    unit could be materially affected by changes in these estimates
    and assumptions which could trigger impairment. In fiscal 2007,
    we completed the first step of the annual goodwill impairment
    testing as of January 1, 2007 and found no indicators of
    impairment of our recorded goodwill. We did not recognize an
    impairment loss on goodwill in fiscal 2007, 2006 or 2005. Future
    impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings and there is
    a potential for a write-down of goodwill in connection with the
    annual impairment test.



Stock-Based
    Compensation

On April 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) and
    applied the provisions of SAB No. 107,
    “

Share-Based Payment

”, on our adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R). SFAS No. 123(R) requires
    that the cost resulting from all share-based payment
    transactions be recognized in the financial statements using a
    fair-value-based method. We elected to use the modified
    prospective transition method of adoption.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires us to measure compensation
    cost for all outstanding unvested stock-based awards made to our
    employees and directors based on estimated fair values and
    recognize compensation over the service period for awards
    expected to vest. We recognized $133 million of stock-based
    compensation related to employee stock options, restricted stock
    units, restricted stock awards and our employee stock purchase
    plan (“ESPP”) during the fiscal year ended
    March 31, 2007. We recognized $3 million of
    stock-based compensation related to employee restricted stock
    units, stock options assumed in connection with our acquisition
    of JAMDAT and non-employee stock options during the fiscal year
    ended March 31, 2006. We recognized $6 million of
    stock-based compensation related to stock options assumed in
    connection with our acquisition of Criterion Software Group Ltd.
    and non-employee stock options and warrants during the fiscal
    year ended March 31, 2005.

For options and ESPP, we use the Black-Scholes option valuation
    model to determine the grant date fair value. The Black-Scholes
    option valuation model requires us to make certain assumptions
    about the future. The determination of fair value is affected by
    our stock price as well as assumptions regarding subjective and
    complex variables such as expected employee exercise behavior
    and our expected stock price volatility over the term of the
    award. Generally, our assumptions are based on historical
    information and judgment is required to determine if historical
    trends may be indicators of future outcomes. We estimated the
    following key assumptions for the Black-Scholes valuation
    calculation:

•

Risk-free interest rate.

The risk-free interest rate is
    based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of
    grant for the expected term of the option.

•

Expected volatility.

We use our historical stock price
    volatility and consider the implied volatility computed based on
    the price of short-term options publicly traded on our common
    stock for our expected volatility assumption.

•

Expected term.

The expected term represents the
    weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain
    outstanding. The expected term is determined based on historical
    exercise behavior, post-vesting termination patterns, options
    outstanding and future expected exercise behavior.

•

Expected dividends.

As required by SFAS No. 123(R), employee stock-based
    compensation expense recognized in fiscal 2007 was calculated
    based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced
    for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are revised, if
    necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ
    from those estimates and an adjustment will be recognized at
    that time.

Changes to our underlying stock price, our assumptions used in
    the Black-Scholes option valuation calculation and our
    forfeiture rate as well as future grants of equity could
    significantly impact compensation expense to be recognized in
    fiscal 2008 and future periods.

Income
    Taxes

In the ordinary course of our business, there are many
    transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax
    determination is uncertain. As part of the process of preparing
    our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to
    estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which
    we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for
    such periods. This process requires estimating both our
    geographic mix of income and our current tax exposures in each
    jurisdiction where we operate. These estimates involve complex
    issues, require extended periods of time to resolve, and require
    us to make judgments, such as anticipating the positions that we
    will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the
    returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities. We
    are also required to make determinations of the need to record
    deferred tax liabilities and the recoverability of deferred tax
    assets. A valuation allowance is



established to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not
    likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each
    jurisdiction.

In addition, changes in our business, including acquisitions,
    changes in our international corporate structure, changes in the
    geographic location of business functions or assets, changes in
    the geographic mix and amount of income, as well as changes in
    our agreements with tax authorities, valuation allowances,
    applicable accounting rules, applicable tax laws and
    regulations, rulings and interpretations thereof, developments
    in tax audit and other matters, and variations in the estimated
    and actual level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall
    effective income tax rate. As with fiscal 2007, we expect our
    effective tax rate to be unusually volatile and subject to
    significant fluctuation.

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS

Our fiscal year is reported on a 52 or

53-week

period that, historically, ended on the final Saturday of March
    in each year. Beginning with the fiscal year ended
    March 31, 2006, our fiscal year ends on the Saturday
    nearest March 31. As a result, fiscal 2006 contained
    53 weeks with the first quarter containing 14 weeks.
    Our results of operations for the fiscal years ended
    March 31, 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005 contain the following
    number of weeks:

For simplicity of disclosure, all fiscal periods are referred to
    as ending on a calendar month end.

Beginning in fiscal 2007, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R)
    and applied the provisions of SAB No. 107 to our
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). We elected to use the
    modified prospective transition method of adoption which
    requires that compensation expense be recognized in the
    financial statements for all awards granted after the date of
    adoption as well as for existing awards for which the requisite
    service has not been rendered as of the date of adoption.
    Accordingly, prior periods are not restated for the effect of
    SFAS No. 123(R). Prior to our adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R), we valued our stock options based on
    the multiple-award valuation method and recognized the expense
    using the accelerated approach over the requisite service
    period. In conjunction with our adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R), we changed our method of recognizing
    our stock-based compensation expense to the straight-line
    approach over the requisite service period; however, we continue
    to value our stock options based on the multiple-award valuation
    method.

Prior to fiscal 2007, we accounted for stock-based awards to
    employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with
    Accounting Principles Board No. 25, “

Accounting for
    Stock Issued to Employees

” and adopted the
    disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123,
    “

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

”, as
    amended. Also, as required by SFAS No. 148,
    “

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
    Transition and Disclosure

”, we provided pro forma net
    income and net income per common share disclosures for
    stock-based awards as if the fair-value-based method defined in
    SFAS No. 123 had been applied. As a result, prior
    periods are not restated for the effect of
    SFAS No. 123(R). Pre-tax stock-based compensation
    expense for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and
    2005 was $133 million, $3 million and $6 million,
    respectively.

Comparison
    of Fiscal 2007 to Fiscal 2006

Net
    Revenue

We derive net revenue principally from sales of interactive
    software games designed for play on video game consoles (such as
    the PlayStation 2, PLAYSTATION 3, Xbox 360 and Wii),
    PCs and handheld game players (such as the Sony PSP, Nintendo DS
    and Nintendo Game Boy Advance) and cellular handsets. We also
    derive net revenue from selling services in connection with some
    of our online games, programming third-party web



sites with our game content, allowing other companies to
    manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other
    products, and selling advertisements on our online web pages and
    in our games.

From a geographical perspective, our total net revenue for
    fiscal years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows
    (in millions):

North
    America

For fiscal 2007, net revenue in North America was
    $1,666 million, driven primarily by (1) our packaged
    goods business led by sales of

Madden NFL 07

,

Need for
    Speed Carbon

, and

NCAA Football 07

, and (2) to a
    lesser extent, growth in our cellular handset games business
    resulting from our February 2006 acquisition of JAMDAT. Overall,
    net revenue increased $82 million, or 5 percent, as
    compared to fiscal 2006.

The increase in net revenue for fiscal 2007, as compared to
    fiscal 2006 was driven primarily by (1) a $95 million
    increase in cellular handset net revenue, and (2) a
    $43 million increase in
    catalog

(a)

net revenue. These increases were partially offset by a
    $79 million decrease in
    frontline

(b)

net revenue.

(a)

We refer to “catalog net revenue” as net revenue
    derived from an EA Studio SKU (a version of a title designed for
    play on a particular platform) for consoles, PC, PSP, Nintendo
    DS, and Game Boy Advance subsequent to the fiscal period
    presented in which the SKU was initially launched.

(b)

We refer to “frontline net revenue” as net revenue
    derived from an EA Studio SKU for consoles, PC, PSP, Nintendo
    DS, and Game Boy Advance during the same fiscal period presented
    as the SKU was launched.

Europe

For fiscal 2007, net revenue in Europe was $1,261 million,
    driven primarily by sales of

FIFA 07

and

Need for
    Speed Carbon.

Overall, net revenue increased
    $87 million, or 7 percent, as compared to fiscal 2006.
    We estimate that foreign exchange rates (primarily the Euro and
    the British pound sterling) increased reported European net
    revenue by approximately $57 million, or 5 percent,
    for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. Excluding the effect
    of foreign exchange rates, we estimate that European net revenue
    increased by approximately $30 million, or 2 percent,
    for fiscal 2007.

The increase in net revenue for fiscal 2007, as compared to
    fiscal 2006 was driven primarily by (1) a $64 million
    increase in catalog net revenue, and (2) a $25 million
    increase in cellular handset net revenue. These increases were
    partially offset by a $7 million decrease in frontline net
    revenue.

Asia

For fiscal 2007, net revenue in Asia was $164 million,
    driven primarily by sales of

Need for Speed
    Carbon.

Overall, net revenue decreased by
    $29 million, or 15 percent, as compared to fiscal
    2006. The decrease in net revenue for fiscal 2007 was driven
    primarily by (1) a $21 million decrease in
    co-publishing and distribution net revenue, and (2) a
    $20 million decrease in frontline net revenue. These
    decreases were partially offset by a $13 million increase
    in catalog net revenue. We estimate that changes in foreign
    exchange rates decreased reported net revenue in Asia by
    approximately $4 million, or 2 percent, for fiscal
    2007. Excluding the effect



of foreign exchange rates, we estimate that Asia net revenue
    decreased by approximately $25 million, or 13 percent,
    for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006.

Our total net revenue by platform for fiscal years 2007 and 2006

Overall, PlayStation 2 net revenue
    decreased $241 million, or 21 percent, compared to
    fiscal 2006. Although we are unable to specifically quantify the
    impact, we believe the decrease was primarily due to the
    transition to new generation consoles.

We expect PlayStation 2-related net revenue to continue to
    decline in fiscal 2008 as consumers increasingly migrate to new
    platforms, we publish fewer titles (as compared to fiscal
    2007) and we defer a greater percentage of our net revenue
    due to the change in our online-enabled packaged goods business
    model.

Xbox

The Xbox 360 was launched in North America, Europe and Japan
    during the three months ended December 31, 2005 and in the
    rest of Asia during the three months ended March 31, 2006.
    For fiscal 2007, net revenue from sales of titles for the
    Xbox 360 was $480 million driven primarily by sales of

Madden NFL 07, Need for Speed Carbon

, and

FIFA 07.

We expect net revenue from sales of titles for the Xbox 360
    to increase as the installed base grows and we release more
    titles.

    was $157 million, driven primarily by sales of

Madden

    Football 07.

Overall, Xbox net revenue decreased

    2006. Although we are unable to specifically quantify the
    impact, we believe the decrease was primarily due to the
    transition to new generation consoles.

We expect Xbox-related net revenue to continue to decline as
    consumers increasingly migrate to new platforms and we publish
    significantly fewer titles (as compared to fiscal 2007).

PLAYSTATION

The PLAYSTATION 3 launched in North America and Japan during the
    three months ended December 31, 2006 and Europe and the
    rest of Asia during the three months ended March 31, 2007.
    Net revenue from sales of titles for the PLAYSTATION 3 was
    $94 million for fiscal 2007, driven by sales of

Need for
    Speed Carbon

,

Madden NFL 07

, and

EA
    SPORTS

tm

Fight Night Round 3.

We expect net revenue from sales of titles for the PLAYSTATION 3
    to increase as the installed base grows and we release more
    titles. The increase will be partially offset by our deferral of
    net revenue resulting from certain online-enabled PLAYSTATION 3
    games.

Wii

The Wii launched in North America, Europe and parts of Asia
    during the three months ended December 31, 2006. Net
    revenue from sales of titles for the Wii was $65 million
    for fiscal 2007, driven by sales of

Need for Speed

Nintendo
    GameCube

For fiscal 2007, net revenue from sales of titles for the
    Nintendo GameCube was $60 million, driven primarily by
    sales of

Madden NFL 07

,

Need for Speed Carbon

, and

FIFA 07.

Overall, Nintendo GameCube net revenue decreased
    $75 million, or 56 percent, as compared to fiscal
    2006. Although we are unable to specifically quantify the
    impact, we believe the decrease was primarily due to the
    transition to new generation consoles.

We expect Nintendo GameCube-related net revenue to continue to
    decline as consumers increasingly migrate to new platforms. We
    will no longer release titles for the Nintendo GameCube, which
    will also contribute to our expected net revenue decline from
    this platform.

PC

For fiscal 2007, net revenue from sales of titles for the PC was
    $498 million driven primarily by sales of titles from The
    Sims, Battlefield, and Command and Conquer franchises. Overall,
    PC net revenue increased $80 million, or 19 percent,
    as compared to fiscal 2006. The increase was due to a
    $62 million increase in frontline net revenue and an
    $18 million increase in catalog net revenue.

Mobile
    Platforms

Net revenue from mobile products, which consist of packaged
    goods games for handheld systems and downloadable games for
    cellular handsets, increased from $393 million in fiscal
    2006 to $540 million in fiscal 2007. The increase was
    primarily due to a $121 million

year-over-year

growth in our cellular handset games business resulting from our
    acquisition of JAMDAT and an increase of $37 million in net
    revenue from sales of titles for the Nintendo DS.

We expect sales of games for cellular handsets to continue to be
    an increasingly important part of our business worldwide.



Co-Publishing
    and Distribution

Net revenue from co-publishing and distribution products, which
    consists of packaged goods games we co-develop and co-publish
    with as well as distribute on behalf of other companies and
    revenue generated from our Switzerland distribution business,
    decreased from $213 million in fiscal 2006 to
    $175 million in fiscal 2007. The decrease was primarily due
    to a decline in sales from two titles which were released in
    fiscal 2006 but had no corresponding releases in fiscal 2007:
    (1)

Half-Life 2

, sales of which decreased by
    $19 million and (2)

Black & White

tm

,
    sales of which decreased by $15 million.

We expect sales of titles for co-publishing products to increase
    in fiscal 2008.

Cost
    of Goods Sold

Cost of goods sold for our packaged-goods business consists of
    (1) product costs, (2) certain royalty expenses for
    celebrities, professional sports and other organizations and
    independent software developers, (3) manufacturing
    royalties, net of volume discounts and other vendor
    reimbursements, (4) expenses for defective products,
    (5) write-offs of post-launch prepaid royalty costs,
    (6) amortization of certain intangible assets, and
    (7) operational expenses. We generally recognize volume
    discounts when they are earned from the manufacturer (typically
    in connection with the achievement of unit-based milestones),
    whereas other vendor reimbursements are generally recognized as
    the related revenue is recognized. Cost of goods sold for our
    online products consists primarily of data center and bandwidth
    costs associated with hosting our web sites, credit card fees
    and royalties for use of third-party properties. Cost of goods
    sold for our web site advertising business primarily consists of
    ad-serving costs.

Cost of goods sold for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 were as

(0.8%)

In fiscal 2007, cost of goods sold decreased by
    0.8 percentage points as a percentage of total net revenue
    as compared to fiscal 2006. This decrease was primarily due to
    lower average product costs as a percentage of total net revenue
    primarily driven by (1) fewer returns and lower pricing
    actions taken, or expected to be taken, in fiscal 2007 as
    compared to fiscal 2006 and (2) improved inventory
    management. As a result, we estimate average product costs as a
    percentage of total net revenue decreased by approximately
    2 percent in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006.

As a percentage of total net revenue, the decrease in average
    product costs was partially offset by an estimated
    1 percent increase in license royalties during fiscal 2007
    as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to (1) license
    agreements associated with our EA SPORTS titles and
    (2) from our acquisition of JAMDAT. This was partially
    offset by lower license royalties from movie-based titles in
    fiscal 2007.

Although there can be no assurance, and our actual results could
    differ materially, in the short-term we expect our gross margin
    to decline as a result of (1) increased deferred net
    revenue related to certain online-enabled packaged goods (we
    will expense the cost of goods sold related to these
    transactions when delivered), (2) a higher mix of
    co-publishing and distribution net revenue that has a lower
    gross margin, and (3) higher license royalty rates.

Marketing
    and Sales

Marketing and sales expenses consist of personnel-related costs
    and advertising, marketing and promotional expenses, net of
    qualified advertising cost reimbursements from third parties.

Marketing and sales expenses for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 were

Marketing and sales expenses increased by $35 million, or
    8 percent, in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. The
    increase was primarily due to (1) an increase of
    $17 million in stock-based compensation expense recognized
    as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R),
    (2) an increase of $10 million in our annual bonus
    expense, and (3) $10 million in additional
    personnel-related costs primarily resulting from an increase in
    headcount. These increases were partially offset by a decrease
    of $9 million in our marketing, advertising, promotional
    and related services as a result of higher advertising in the
    prior year to support our product releases, primarily from our
    Harry Potter and BLACK franchises.

Marketing and sales expenses included vendor reimbursements for
    advertising expenses of $28 million and $41 million in
    fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively.

We expect marketing and sales expenses to increase in absolute
    dollars in fiscal 2008 primarily to support our titles.

General
    and Administrative

General and administrative expenses consist of personnel and
    related expenses of executive and administrative staff, fees for
    professional services such as legal and accounting, and
    allowances for doubtful accounts.

    as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R),
    (2) a $14 million increase in our annual bonus

    personnel-related costs to help support our administrative
    functions worldwide, and (4) an increase of
    $11 million in professional and contracted services in
    support of our technology infrastructure.

We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in
    absolute dollars in fiscal 2008 primarily due to an increase in
    personnel-related costs.

Research
    and Development

Research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred
    by our production studios for personnel-related costs,
    contracted services, equipment depreciation and any impairment
    of prepaid royalties for pre-launch products. Research and
    development expenses for our online business include expenses
    incurred by our studios consisting of direct development and
    related overhead costs in connection with the development and
    production of our online games. Research and development
    expenses also include expenses associated with the development
    of web site content, network infrastructure direct expenses,
    software licenses and maintenance, and network and management
    overhead.

    compensation expense recognized as a result of our adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R), (2) a $59 million increase
    in our annual bonus expense, (3) $54 million in
    additional personnel-related costs, primarily due to a
    14 percent increase in headcount related in part to our
    acquisitions of JAMDAT and Mythic, and partially to support
    development of games for the new generation of consoles,
    (4) an increase of $50 million in external development
    expenses primarily due to a greater number of projects in
    development as compared to the prior year as well as



expenses in our cellular handset business resulting from our
    acquisition of JAMDAT, and (5) an increase of
    $45 million in facilities-related expenses in support of
    our research and development functions worldwide.

We expect research and development expenses to increase in

For fiscal 2007, amortization of intangibles resulted from our

    JAMDAT, Criterion and others. Amortization of intangibles
    increased by $20 million, or 286 percent, in fiscal
    2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the
    amortization of intangibles related to our acquisitions of
    JAMDAT and Mythic. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.

We expect amortization of intangible expenses to increase

    acquisition of JAMDAT. Acquired in-process technology includes
    the value of products in the development stage that are not
    considered to have reached technological feasibility or have an
    alternative future use. Accordingly, upon consummation of these
    acquisitions, we incurred a charge for the acquired in-process
    technology, as reflected in our Consolidated Statement of
    Operations. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we recorded a total
    pre-tax restructuring charge of $10 million, consisting
    entirely of one-time benefits related to headcount reductions,
    which is included in restructuring charges in our Consolidated
    Statement of Operations. These headcount reductions related to
    our decision in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 to realign our
    resources with our product plan for fiscal 2007 and strategic
    opportunities for the new generation of consoles, online and
    mobile platforms.

During fiscal 2006, restructuring charges related to the
    establishment of our international publishing headquarters in
    Geneva, Switzerland were approximately $14 million, of
    which $8 million was for the closure of certain United
    Kingdom facilities. During fiscal 2007, restructuring charges
    related to the establishment of our international publishing
    headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland were approximately
    $15 million, of which $10 million was for
    employee-related expenses.



In connection with our fiscal 2006 international publishing
    reorganization, in fiscal 2008, we expect to incur between
    $5 million and $10 million of restructuring costs.
    Overall, including charges incurred through March 31, 2007,
    we expect to incur between $50 million and $55 million
    of restructuring costs in connection with our fiscal 2006
    international publishing reorganization, substantially all of
    which will result in cash expenditures by 2017. These
    restructuring costs will consist primarily of employee-related
    relocation assistance (approximately $30 million), facility
    exit costs (approximately $15 million), as well as other
    reorganization costs (approximately $7 million).

Our effective income tax rates were 48.2 percent and

    For fiscal 2007, our effective income tax rate was higher than
    the U.S. statutory rate of 35.0 percent due to a
    number of factors, including certain non-deductible stock based
    compensation expenses related to SFAS No. 123(R) and
    additional charges resulting from certain non-deductible
    acquisition-related costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2007. For fiscal 2006, our effective income tax rate is higher
    than the U.S. statutory rate of 35.0 percent for
    fiscal 2006 due to a number of factors, including the
    repatriation of foreign earnings in connection with the American
    Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Jobs Act”), as
    discussed below, and additional charges resulting from certain
    non-deductible acquisition-related costs during the second and
    fourth quarters of fiscal 2006, which were partially offset by
    other items.

Our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2008 and future
    periods will depend on a variety of factors. For example,
    changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany
    transactions (for example, the acquisition of and intercompany
    transactions related to Mythic and DICE), changes in our
    international structure, changes in the geographic location of
    business functions or assets, changes in the geographic mix of
    income, as well as changes in, or termination of, our agreements
    with tax authorities, valuation allowances, applicable
    accounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, rulings
    and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audit and other
    matters. Also, variations in the estimated and actual level of
    annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective income
    tax rate for future fiscal years. We incur certain tax expenses
    that do not decline proportionately with declines in our
    consolidated income or increase in consolidated loss. As a
    result, in absolute dollar terms, our tax expense will have a
    greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of
    pre-tax income than higher levels. In addition, at lower levels
    of pre-tax income, our effective tax rate will be more volatile.

We historically have considered undistributed earnings of our
    foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and,
    accordingly, no U.S. taxes have been provided thereon. With
    the exception of taking advantage of the one-time opportunity
    afforded to us by the Jobs Act, we currently intend to continue
    to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our
    foreign subsidiaries.



In July 2006, FASB issued FIN No. 48 which clarifies
    the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in
    financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109.
    FIN No. 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and
    measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition
    and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
    in a tax return and provides guidance on derecognition,
    classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
    periods, disclosure, and transition. Under FIN No. 48,
    the evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The
    first step is a recognition process where we are required to
    determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position
    will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any
    related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical
    merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has
    met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, it is
    presumed that the position will be examined by the appropriate
    taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant
    information. The second step is a measurement process whereby a
    tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition
    threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to
    recognize in the financial statements. FIN No. 48 also
    requires new tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of
    unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning and end of the
    reporting period. The provisions of FIN No. 48 are
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2006. As such, we are required to adopt it in our first quarter
    of fiscal year 2008. Any changes to our income taxes due to the
    adoption of FIN No. 48 are treated as the cumulative
    effect of a change in accounting principle. We are evaluating
    what impact the adoption of FIN No. 48 will have on
    our Consolidated Financial Statements. This impact could be
    material and our future effective tax rates could be more
    volatile.

Net income decreased by $160 million, or 68 percent,
    in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. The decrease was due
    to a $395 million increase in our operating expenses
    primarily due to (1) an increase of $128 million in
    stock-based compensation expense recognized as a result of our
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), (2) an
    $83 million increase in our annual bonus expense, and
    (3) a $75 million increase in additional
    personnel-related costs due to an increase in headcount (related
    in part to our acquisitions and growth in our EA Mobile
    business). These increases in operating expenses were mitigated
    by (1) a $140 million increase in net revenue and
    (2) an $81 million decrease in our income tax
    provision.

We expect net earnings to decrease in fiscal 2008 primarily as a
    result of (1) the fact that during fiscal 2008, we expect
    to recognize the cost of goods sold and direct marketing and
    selling costs related to certain online-enabled packaged goods
    for which a portion of the corresponding net revenue will be
    deferred and not recognized until fiscal 2009, and (2) an
    increase in our research and development expense.

North
    America

For fiscal 2006, net revenue in North America was
    $1,584 million, driven primarily by sales of
    (1)

Madden NFL 06, Need for Speed Most Wanted, NBA LIVE
    06,
    NCAA

®

Football 06

and

The Sims 2,

(2) titles
    for the PSP, which was launched in North America in March 2005,
    and (3) titles for the Xbox 360, which launched in November
    2005. Overall, net revenue decreased $81 million, or
    5 percent, as compared to fiscal 2005. Our net revenue was
    adversely impacted by the transition to next-generation consoles
    in fiscal 2006 as overall net revenue from sales of our titles
    for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube
    decreased. While sales of titles for the PSP and the Xbox 360
    helped to mitigate the impact of the transition in fiscal 2006,
    they were not enough to offset the overall decrease in net
    revenue in North America.

From a title and franchise perspective, the decrease in net
    revenue was primarily due to (1) lower sales from our NFL
    Street, NBA Street, Def Jam and The
    Urbz

tm

franchises as there were no corresponding titles released during
    fiscal 2006, and (2) lower sales from our Lord of the Rings
    franchise which was released on multiple platforms during fiscal
    2005 as compared to two platforms, the PSP and PC, during fiscal
    2006. The overall decrease in net revenue was mitigated by
    (1) sales of

Battlefield

tm

on the PC which was released during the first quarter of
    fiscal 2006 and

Battlefield 2: Modern
    Combat

    quarter of fiscal 2006, (2) increased net revenue from our
    Madden franchise primarily resulting from the release of

Madden NFL 06

    (3) increased net revenue from our Burnout franchise
    primarily resulting from the release of

on the Xbox 360 and

Europe

For fiscal 2006, net revenue in Europe was $1,174 million,
    driven primarily by sales of

Need for Speed Most Wanted, FIFA
    06, The Sims 2, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire

, as
    well as sales of titles for the PSP and Xbox 360 which were both
    introduced in Europe during fiscal 2006. Overall, net revenue
    declined $110 million, or 9 percent, as compared to
    fiscal 2005. We estimate that foreign exchange rates (primarily
    the Euro and the British pound sterling) decreased reported
    European net revenue by approximately $36 million, or
    3 percent, net of realized gains from hedging activities,
    for the fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Excluding the
    effect of foreign exchange rates, we estimate that European net
    revenue decreased by approximately $74 million, or
    6 percent, for fiscal 2006. Our net revenue in Europe was
    adversely impacted by the transition to next-generation consoles
    in fiscal 2006 as overall net revenue from sales of our titles
    for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube
    decreased. Sales of titles for the PSP, Nintendo DS, and the
    Xbox 360, however, were enough to offset the overall decrease in
    net revenue from sales of titles for current-generation consoles.

From a title and franchise perspective, the overall decrease in
    net revenue was primarily due to (1) lower sales from our
    Lord of the Rings and The Sims franchises, (2) the release
    of

The
    Urbz

tm

:
    Sims in the
    City

tm

during the three months ended December 31, 2004 as
    there was no corresponding title released during fiscal 2006,
    and (3) higher fiscal 2005 sales of

UEFA Euro

tm

,
    which was released in the three months ended June 30, 2004
    in conjunction with the UEFA Euro 2004 football tournament held
    in Europe. The overall decrease in net revenue was mitigated by
    increased net revenue from our Battlefield franchise due to the
    release of multiple titles during fiscal 2006 and our FIFA
    Street franchise due to the initial release of

FIFA Street

late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 which benefited
    fiscal 2006 and the release of

FIFA Street 2

earlier in
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.

Asia

For fiscal 2006, net revenue in Asia increased by
    $13 million, or 7 percent, as compared to fiscal 2005.
    The increase in net revenue for fiscal 2006 was driven primarily
    by sales of titles for the PSP, which launched in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2005. We estimate that the foreign exchange
    rate impact on Asia net revenue was not material for fiscal 2006
    as compared to fiscal 2005.

PlayStation

For fiscal 2006, net revenue from sales of titles for the
    PlayStation 2 was $1,127 million, driven primarily by sales
    of

Need for Speed Most Wanted, Madden NFL 06, FIFA 06, NCAA
    Football 06

and

NBA LIVE 06.

We released 28 titles
    for the PlayStation 2 during fiscal 2006, as compared to 27
    titles in fiscal 2005. Overall, PlayStation 2 net revenue
    decreased $203 million, or 15 percent, as compared to
    fiscal 2005. We believe the transition to next-generation
    consoles adversely impacted our net revenue from sales of titles
    for the PlayStation 2 in fiscal 2006. From a title and franchise
    perspective, the decrease in net revenue was primarily due to
    (1) lower sales from our Lord of the Rings, The Urbz, Def
    Jam, NFL Street and NBA Street franchises, none of which had
    fiscal 2006 releases, and (2) lower sales of fiscal 2006
    releases from our Need for Speed and Bond franchises as well as
    lower sales of our Fight Night franchise from which two titles
    were released in fiscal 2005 as compared to one title in fiscal
    2006. The overall decrease in net revenue was mitigated by the
    releases of

The
    Godfather

tm

The Game

,

BLACK

tm

,

Medal of Honor European
    Assault

tm

,
    and

Battlefield 2: Modern Combat

none of which had a
    corresponding release in fiscal 2005.

Xbox

For fiscal 2006, net revenue from sales of titles for the Xbox
    was $400 million, driven primarily by sales of

Madden
    NFL 06, Need for Speed Most Wanted, NCAA Football 06

and

Burnout Revenge.

We released 28 titles for the Xbox
    during fiscal 2006, as compared to 26 titles in fiscal 2005.
    Overall, Xbox net revenue decreased $116 million, or
    22 percent, as compared to fiscal 2005. We believe the
    transition to next-generation consoles, particularly the launch
    of the Xbox 360 during the last half of fiscal 2006, adversely
    impacted our net revenue from sales of titles for the Xbox in
    fiscal 2006. From a title and franchise perspective, the
    decrease in net revenue was primarily due to (1) lower
    sales from our Lord of the Rings, NFL Street, Def Jam, NBA
    Street



and The Urbz franchises, none of which had fiscal 2006 releases,
    and (2) lower sales of fiscal 2006 releases from our Need
    for Speed and Bond franchises as well as lower sales of our
    Fight Night franchise from which two titles were released in
    fiscal 2005 as compared to one title in fiscal 2006. The overall
    decrease in net revenue was mitigated by the release of

Battlefield 2: Modern Combat, BLACK

and

The Godfather
    The Game

, none of which had a corresponding release in
    fiscal 2005.

Xbox

The Xbox 360 was launched in North America, Europe and Japan
    during the three months ended December 31, 2005, and in the
    rest of Asia during the three months ended March 31, 2006.
    As of March 31 2006, the installed base of the Xbox 360
    continued to be small compared to the installed base of the
    Xbox. Net revenue from sales of titles for the Xbox 360 was
    $140 million for fiscal 2006, driven by sales of

Need
    for Speed Most Wanted

,

Madden NFL 06

and

EA SPORTS
    Fight Night Round 3.

We released seven titles for the Xbox
    360 in fiscal 2006.

Nintendo
    GameCube

For fiscal 2006, net revenue from sales of titles for the
    Nintendo GameCube was $135 million, driven primarily by
    sales of

Need for Speed Most Wanted, Harry Potter and the
    Goblet of Fire

and

Madden NFL 06.

We
    released 14 titles for the Nintendo GameCube during fiscal 2006,
    as compared to 20 titles in fiscal 2005. Overall, Nintendo
    GameCube net revenue decreased $77 million, or
    36 percent, as compared to fiscal 2005, consistent with the
    percentage decline in the number of titles we released for this
    platform. We believe the transition to next-generation consoles
    adversely impacted our net revenue from sales of titles for the
    Nintendo GameCube in fiscal 2006. From a title and franchise
    perspective, the decrease in net revenue in fiscal 2006 was
    primarily due to (1) lower sales from our Lord of the
    Rings, The Urbz, NBA Street, NFL Street and Def Jam franchises,
    none of which had fiscal 2006 releases, and (2) lower sales
    of fiscal 2006 releases from our Need for Speed and Bond
    franchises.

PC

For fiscal 2006, net revenue from sales of titles for the PC was
    $418 million, driven primarily by sales of titles from The
    Sims franchise and

Battlefield 2.

We released 22 titles
    for the PC during fiscal 2006, as compared to 21 titles in
    fiscal 2005. Overall, PC net revenue decreased
    $113 million, or 21 percent, as compared to fiscal
    2005. The decrease was primarily due to (1) significantly
    higher fiscal 2005 sales of

The Sims 2,

(2) lower sales from our Medal of
    Honor

tm

franchise as there were no corresponding titles released during
    fiscal 2006, and (3) lower sales from our Lord of the Rings
    franchise. The overall decrease in net revenue was mitigated by
    sales of products from our Battlefield franchise in fiscal 2006.
    On January 27, 2005, we began consolidating the financial
    results of DICE into our financial statements, and, therefore,
    have characterized

Battlefield 2

PC-based revenue as part
    of our PC product line. Prior to consolidating DICE’s
    financial results, we classified revenue from the Battlefield
    franchise as co-publishing and distribution revenue.

Mobile
    Platforms

Net revenue from mobile products — consisting of
    packaged goods games for handheld systems and downloadable games
    for cellular handsets — increased from
    $118 million in fiscal 2005 to $393 million in fiscal
    2006. The increase was primarily due to sales of titles released
    in fiscal 2006 for the PSP, and the Nintendo DS, both of which
    were launched in fiscal 2005 in certain countries. We released
    16 titles for the PSP during fiscal 2006, as compared to three
    titles in fiscal 2005. Overall, PSP net revenue increased
    $234 million, driven primarily by sales of titles from our
    Need for Speed, FIFA, Burnout and Madden franchises. We released
    ten titles for the Nintendo DS during fiscal 2006, as compared
    to three titles in fiscal 2005. Nintendo DS net revenue
    increased $44 million, driven primarily by sales of titles
    from our Need for Speed, The Sims and Madden franchises. The
    increase in PSP and Nintendo DS net revenue was partially offset
    by lower sales of titles for the Game Boy Advance.



Co-Publishing
    and Distribution

Net revenue from co-publishing and distribution products
    decreased from $283 million in fiscal 2005 to
    $213 million in fiscal 2006. The decrease was primarily due
    to (1) the change in our classification of sales of
    products from our Battlefield franchise, which, as discussed
    above, we no longer classify as co-publishing and distribution
    revenue, and (2) overall higher fiscal 2005 sales of
    various co-publishing and distribution titles. The overall
    decrease in net revenue was mitigated by sales of

Half-Life 2

in fiscal 2006.

Subscription
    Services

Net revenue from subscription services increased from
    $55 million in fiscal 2005 to $61 million in fiscal
    2006. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to an
    increase in the number of paying subscribers to Club
    Pogo

tm

,
    partially offset by a decrease in net revenue from

Ultima
    Online.

Licensing,
    Advertising and Other

Net revenue from licensing, advertising and other decreased from
    $74 million in fiscal 2005 to $63 million in fiscal
    2006. The decrease in net revenue was primarily due to Nokia
    N-Gage license revenue in fiscal 2005.

    and related contracted service expenses as a result of increased
    advertising to support our titles, and (2) an increase of
    $11 million in personnel-related costs resulting from an
    increase in facilities and headcount-related expenses in support
    of our marketing and sales functions worldwide.

Marketing and sales expenses included vendor reimbursements for
    advertising expenses of $41 million and $42 million in
    fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively.

    employee-related litigation matters in fiscal 2005. This

    resulting from an increase in employee headcount in our Canadian
    and European studios as we increased our internal development
    efforts and invested in next-generation tools, technologies and
    titles, as well as consolidation of DICE. To a lesser extent,
    these increases were also due to higher facilities-related costs
    offset by lower third-party development costs.

    stake of the outstanding shares of DICE. Acquired in-process
    technology includes the value of products in the development
    stage that are not considered to have reached technological
    feasibility or have an alternative future use. Accordingly, upon
    consummation of these acquisitions, we incurred a charge for the

In November 2005, we announced plans to establish an

    Through our quarter ended September 30, 2006, we relocated
    certain employees to our new facility in Geneva, closed certain
    facilities in the United Kingdom, and made other related changes
    in our international publishing business.



During fiscal 2006, restructuring charges were approximately
    $14 million, of which $8 million was for the closure
    of certain United Kingdom facilities, $3 million for
    employee-related expenses, and $3 million in other costs
    relating to our international publishing reorganization.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we aligned our
    resources with our product plan for fiscal 2007 and strategic
    opportunities relating to next-generation consoles, online and
    mobile platforms. As part of this alignment we recorded a total
    pre-tax restructuring charge of $10 million, consisting
    entirely of one-time benefits related to headcount reductions,
    which is included in restructuring charges in our Consolidated

    the U.S. statutory rate of 35.0 percent for fiscal

    operating expenses. The growth in our operating expenses was
    primarily driven by an increase in research and development
    expenses as we increased our internal development efforts and
    invested in next-generation tools, technologies and titles,
    while at the same time we continued to support
    current-generation product development.

Impact of
    Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,

“Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial
    Instruments — An Amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 133 and 140”

. SFAS No. 155
    (1) permits fair value measurement for any hybrid financial
    instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise
    would require bifurcation, (2) clarifies that interest-only
    strips and principal-only strips are not subject to the
    requirements of SFAS No. 133,

“Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”

,
    (3) establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in
    securitized financial assets to identify interests that are
    freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial
    instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring
    bifurcation, (4) clarifies that



concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are
    not embedded derivatives, and (5) amends
    SFAS No. 140,

“Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities — A Replacement of FASB Statement
    No. 125”

to eliminate the prohibition on a
    qualifying special-purpose entity from holding a derivative
    financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest
    other than another derivative financial instrument. In December
    2006, the FASB cleared guidance in Derivatives Implementation
    Group Statement 133 Implementation Issue No. B40,

“Embedded Derivatives: Application of
    Paragraph 13(b) to Securitized Interests in Prepayable
    Financial Assets”

. FASB concluded that a securitized
    interest in prepayable financial assets is not subject to the
    conditions in paragraph 13(b) of SFAS No. 133 if
    it meets the two criteria outlined in the Statement 133
    Implementation Issue No. B40. SFAS No. 155 is
    effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued for
    fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. The
    guidance in the Statement 133 Implementation Issue
    No. B40 is applicable upon adoption of
    SFAS No. 155, although the FASB provides certain
    exceptions as described in the Statement 133 Implementation
    Issue No. B40. We do not expect the adoption of
    SFAS No. 155 or Statement 133 Implementation
    Issue No. B40 to have a material impact on our Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
    (“FIN”) No. 48, “

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — An Interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109

”. FIN No. 48
    clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
    recognized in financial statements in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109, “

Accounting for Income
    Taxes

”. FIN No. 48 prescribes a recognition
    threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
    recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected
    to be taken in a tax return and provides guidance on
    derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
    accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. Under
    FIN No. 48, the evaluation of a tax position is a
    two-step process. The first step is a recognition process where
    we are required to determine whether it is more likely than not
    that a tax position will be sustained upon examination,
    including resolution of any related appeals or litigation
    processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In
    evaluating whether a tax position has met the
    more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, it is presumed that
    the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing
    authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
    The second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position
    that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is
    calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in
    the financial statements. FIN No. 48 also requires new
    tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax
    benefits at the beginning and end of the reporting period. The
    provisions of FIN No. 48 are effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2006. As such, we are
    required to adopt it in our first quarter of fiscal year 2008.
    Any changes to our income taxes due to the adoption of
    FIN No. 48 are treated as the cumulative effect of a
    change in accounting principle. We are evaluating what impact
    the adoption of FIN No. 48 will have on our
    Consolidated Financial Statements. This impact could be material
    and our future effective tax rates could be more volatile.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “

Fair Value Measurements

”.
    SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
    accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. Fair value refers to the price that would be
    received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
    orderly transaction between market participants in the market in
    which the reporting entity transacts. SFAS No. 157
    establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the
    information used to develop those assumptions. Fair value
    measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the
    fair value hierarchy. The provisions of SFAS No. 157
    are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. We do not expect the adoption of
    SFAS No. 157 to have a material impact on our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
    Financial Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB
    Statement No. 115

”. SFAS No. 159 permits
    entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and
    certain other items at fair value that are not currently
    required to be measured at fair value. It also establishes
    presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate
    comparisons between entities that choose different measurement
    attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The
    provisions of SFAS No. 159 are effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007. This Statement should not be applied
    retrospectively to fiscal years



beginning prior to the effective date, except as permitted with
    early adoption. We are evaluating if we will adopt
    SFAS No. 159 and what impact the adoption will have on
    our Consolidated Financial Statements if we adopt. If we adopt
    SFAS No. 159, it may have a material impact on our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

In March 2007, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
    issued a tentative conclusion on EITF

07-03,

“

Accounting for Advance Payments for Goods or Services
    to Be Used in Future Research and Development

” and the
    FASB ratified the tentative conclusion. The FASB exposed the
    EITF tentative conclusion for public comment. The comment period
    was expected to end in May 2007. EITF

07-03

addresses the diversity which exists with respect to the
    accounting for the non-refundable portion of a payment made by a
    research and development entity for future research and
    development activities. Under this tentative conclusion, an
    entity would defer and capitalize non-refundable advance
    payments made for research and development activities until the
    related goods are delivered or the related services are
    performed. If a final consensus is reached on this tentative
    conclusion, EITF

07-03

would
    be effective for interim or annual reporting periods in fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2007. We do not expect
    the adoption of EITF

07-03

to
    have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements
    if ratified by the FASB as currently proposed.

Changes
    in Cash Flow

During fiscal 2007, we generated $397 million of cash from
    operating activities as compared to $596 million for fiscal
    2006. The decrease in cash generated from operating activities
    was primarily due to the timing of the collection of our
    receivables as a result of collecting a greater amount of our
    receivables during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2007. We
    expect cash from operating activities to increase in fiscal 2008.

For fiscal 2007, we generated $1,315 million of cash
    proceeds from maturities and sales of short-term investments and
    $168 million in proceeds from sales of common stock through
    our stock-based compensation plans. Our primary use of cash in
    non-operating activities consisted of
    (1) $1,522 million used to purchase short-term
    investments, (2) $178 million in capital expenditures
    primarily related to investments in our worldwide development
    tools, technologies and equipment and expansions of our
    Vancouver and United Kingdom studios, as well as
    (3) $103 million primarily for the acquisitions of
    Mythic and the remaining minority interest in DICE. During
    fiscal 2008, we anticipate making continued capital investments
    in our studios, investments in the new generation of consoles,
    online infrastructure and mobile platforms. In addition,



we have engaged in, evaluated, and expect to continue to engage
    in and evaluate, a wide array of potential strategic
    transactions.

In April 2007, we expanded our commercial agreements with and
    made strategic equity investments in Neowiz Corporation and its
    online gaming subsidiary, Neowiz Games. We purchased stock
    representing in aggregate approximately 19 percent of each
    of Neowiz and Neowiz Games for approximately $108 million.
    Based in Korea, Neowiz is an online media and gaming company
    with which we partnered in 2006 to launch

EA Sports FIFA
    Online

in Korea.

Short-term
    investments and marketable equity securities

Due to our mix of fixed and variable rate securities, our
    short-term investment portfolio is susceptible to changes in
    short-term interest rates. As of March 31, 2007, our
    short-term investments had gross unrealized gains of
    $2 million, or less than 1 percent of the total in
    short-term investments, and gross unrealized losses of
    approximately $1 million, or less than 1 percent of
    the total in short-term investments. From time to time, we may
    liquidate some or all of our short-term investments to fund
    operational needs or other activities, such as capital
    expenditures, business acquisitions or stock repurchase
    programs. Depending on which short-term investments we liquidate
    to fund these activities, we could recognize a portion, or all,
    of the gross unrealized gains or losses.

Marketable equity securities increased to $341 million as
    of March 31, 2007, from $160 million as of
    March 31, 2006, due to an increase in the fair value of our
    investment in Ubisoft Entertainment.

Receivables,
    net

Our gross accounts receivable balances were $470 million
    and $431 million as of March 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The increase in our accounts receivable balance
    was primarily due to a higher percentage of net revenue
    recognized in the last month of our fourth quarter of fiscal
    2007 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Reserves
    for sales returns, pricing allowances and doubtful accounts
    decreased in absolute dollars from $232 million as of
    March 31, 2006 to $214 million as of March 31,
    2007. As a percentage of trailing nine month net revenue,
    reserves decreased from 9 percent as of March 31,
    2006, to 8 percent as of March 31, 2007. We believe
    these reserves are adequate based on historical experience and
    our current estimate of potential returns, pricing allowances
    and doubtful accounts.

Inventories

Inventories increased slightly to $62 million as of
    March 31, 2007 from $61 million as of March 31,
    2006. Other than

Need for Speed Carbon

, no single title
    represented more than $3 million of inventory as of
    March 31, 2007.

Other
    current assets

Other current assets decreased to $219 million as of
    March 31, 2007, from $234 million as of March 31,
    2006, primarily due to the timing of the collection of
    advertising credits owed to us by our vendors that were earned
    in fiscal 2007, partially offset by an increase in value added
    taxes receivable.

Accounts
    payable

Accounts payable increased to $180 million as of
    March 31, 2007, from $163 million as of March 31,
    2006, primarily due to higher inventory purchases to support our
    business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 as compared to the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.

Accrued
    and other current liabilities

Our accrued and other liabilities increased to $823 million
    as of March 31, 2007 from $697 million as of
    March 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to an
    increase of (1) $84 million in accrued compensation
    and benefits and (2) $50 million in income taxes
    payable.



Deferred
    income taxes, net

Our long-term position of deferred income taxes changed by
    $46 million, from a liability position as of March 31,
    2006 to a net asset position as of March 31, 2007 primarily
    due to the addition of assets related to our adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R) and the reduction of liabilities due
    to the amortization of purchased intangibles.

Financial
    Condition

We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term
    investments, marketable equity securities and cash generated
    from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating
    requirements for at least the next twelve months, including
    working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and
    potential future acquisitions or strategic investments. We may
    choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our
    financial position, facilitate expansion, pursue strategic
    acquisitions and investments or to take advantage of business
    opportunities as they arise. There can be no assurance, however,
    that such additional capital will be available to us on
    favorable terms, if at all, or that it will not result in
    substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.

The loan financing arrangements supporting our Redwood City
    headquarters leases with Keybank National Association, described
    in the “Off-Balance Sheet Commitments” section below,
    are scheduled to expire in July 2008. Upon expiration of the
    financing, we may request, on behalf of the lessor and subject
    to lender approval, an additional one-year extension of the loan
    financing between the lessor and the lenders. In the event the
    lessor’s loan financing with the lenders is not extended,
    we may loan to the lessor approximately 90 percent of the
    financing, and require the lessor to extend the remainder
    through July 2009, otherwise the leases will terminate. Upon
    expiration of the leases, we may purchase the facilities for
    $247 million, or arrange for a sale of the facilities to a
    third party. In the event of a sale to a third party, if the
    sale price is less than $247 million, we will be obligated
    to reimburse the difference between the actual sale price and
    $247 million, up to maximum of $222 million, subject
    to certain provisions of the leases.

As of March 31, 2007, approximately $1,108 million of
    our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and
    marketable equity securities that was generated from operations
    was domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions. While we have no
    plans to repatriate these funds to the United States in the
    short term, if we choose to do so, we would accrue and pay
    additional taxes on any portion of the repatriation where no
    United States income tax had been previously provided. During
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we repatriated
    $375 million of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 under the
    Jobs Act. We completed the repatriation in fiscal 2006 which
    resulted in a tax expense of $17 million.

We have a “shelf” registration statement on

Form S-3

on file with the SEC. This shelf registration statement, which
    includes a base prospectus, allows us at any time to offer any
    combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or
    more offerings up to a total amount of $2 billion. Unless
    otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the
    base prospectus, we would use the net proceeds from the sale of
    any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration
    statement for general corporate purposes, including for working
    capital, financing capital expenditures, research and
    development, marketing and distribution efforts and, if
    opportunities arise, for acquisitions or strategic alliances.
    Pending such uses, we may invest the net proceeds in
    interest-bearing securities. In addition, we may conduct
    concurrent or other financings at any time.

Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected
    by various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited
    to, those related to customer demand and acceptance of our
    products on new platforms and new versions of our products on
    existing platforms, our ability to collect our accounts
    receivable as they become due, successfully achieving our
    product release schedules and attaining our forecasted sales
    objectives, the impact of competition, economic conditions in
    the United States and abroad, the seasonal and cyclical nature
    of our business and operating results, risks of product returns
    and the other risks described in the “Risk Factors”
    section, included in Part I, Item 1A of this report.



Contractual
    Obligations and Commercial Commitments

Development,
    Celebrity, League and Content Licenses: Payments and
    Commitments

The products we produce in our studios are designed and created
    by our employee designers, artists, software programmers and by
    non-employee software developers (“independent
    artists” or “third-party developers”). We
    typically advance development funds to the independent artists
    and third-party developers during development of our games,
    usually in installment payments made upon the completion of
    specified development milestones. Contractually, these payments
    are generally considered advances against subsequent royalties
    on the sales of the products. These terms are set forth in
    written agreements entered into with the independent artists and
    third-party developers.

In addition, we have certain celebrity, league and content
    license contracts that contain minimum guarantee payments and
    marketing commitments that may not be dependent on any
    deliverables. Celebrities and organizations with whom we have
    contracts include: FIFA, FIFPRO Foundation, UEFA and FAPL
    (Football Association Premier League Limited) (professional
    soccer); NASCAR (stock car racing); National Basketball
    Association (professional basketball); PGA TOUR and Tiger Woods
    (professional golf); National Hockey League and NHL
    Players’ Association (professional hockey); Warner Bros.
    (Harry Potter, Batman and Superman); New Line Productions and
    Saul Zaentz Company (The Lord of the Rings); Red Bear Inc. (John
    Madden); National Football League Properties and PLAYERS Inc.
    (professional football); Collegiate Licensing Company
    (collegiate football, basketball and baseball); Simcoh (Def
    Jam); Viacom Consumer Products (The Godfather); ESPN (content in
    EA
    SPORTS

tm

games); Twentieth Century Fox Licensing and Merchandising (The
    Simpsons); and Marvel Entertainment, Inc. (Marvel character
    fighting games). These developer and content license commitments
    represent the sum of (1) the cash payments due under
    non-royalty-bearing licenses and services agreements and
    (2) the minimum guaranteed payments and advances against
    royalties due under royalty-bearing licenses and services
    agreements, the majority of which are conditional upon
    performance by the counterparty.

The following table summarizes our minimum contractual
    obligations and commercial commitments as of March 31,
    2007, and the effect we expect them to have on our liquidity and
    cash flow in future periods (in millions):

Developer/licensor commitments include $9 million of
    commitments to developers or licensors that have been recorded
    in current and long-term liabilities and a corresponding amount
    in current and long-term assets in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets as of March 31, 2007 because payment is not
    contingent upon performance by the developer or licensor.



The amounts represented in the table above reflect our minimal
    cash obligations for the respective fiscal years, but do not
    necessarily represent the periods in which they will be expensed
    in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Lease commitments include contractual rental commitments of
    $15 million under real estate leases for unutilized office
    space resulting from our restructuring activities. These
    amounts, net of estimated future

sub-lease

income, were expensed in the periods of the related
    restructuring and are included in our accrued and other current
    liabilities reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
    March 31, 2007. See Note 6 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Related
    Person Transaction

On June 24, 2002, we hired Warren C. Jenson as our
    Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative
    Officer and agreed to loan him $4 million to be forgiven
    over four years based on his continuing employment. The loan did
    not bear interest. On June 24, 2004, pursuant to the terms
    of the loan agreement, we forgave $2 million of the loan
    and provided Mr. Jenson approximately $1.6 million to
    offset the tax implications of the forgiveness. On June 24,
    2006, pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement, we forgave
    the remaining outstanding loan balance of $2 million. No
    additional funds were provided to offset the tax implications of
    the forgiveness of the $2 million balance.

OFF-BALANCE
    SHEET COMMITMENTS

In February 1995, we entered into a

build-to-suit

lease (“Phase One Lease”) with a third-party lessor
    for our headquarters facilities in Redwood City, California
    (“Phase One Facilities”). The Phase One Facilities
    comprise a total of approximately 350,000 square feet and
    provide space for sales, marketing, administration and research
    and development functions. In July 2001, the lessor refinanced
    the Phase One Lease with Keybank National Association through
    July 2006. The Phase One Lease expires in January 2039, subject
    to early termination in the event the underlying financing
    between the lessor and its lenders is not extended. Subject to
    certain terms and conditions, we may purchase the Phase One
    Facilities or arrange for the sale of the Phase One Facilities
    to a third party.

Pursuant to the terms of the Phase One Lease, we have an option
    to purchase the Phase One Facilities at any time for a purchase
    price of $132 million. In the event of a sale to a third
    party, if the sale price is less than $132 million, we will
    be obligated to reimburse the difference between the actual sale
    price and $132 million, up to a maximum of
    $117 million, subject to certain provisions of the Phase
    One Lease, as amended.

On May 26, 2006, the lessor extended its loan financing
    underlying the Phase One Lease with its lenders through July
    2007, and on May 14, 2007, the lenders extended this
    financing again for an additional year through July 2008. We may
    request, on behalf of the lessor and subject to lender approval,
    an additional one-year extension of the loan financing between
    the lessor and the lenders. In the event the lessor’s loan
    financing with the lenders is not extended, we may loan to the
    lessor approximately 90 percent of the financing, and
    require the lessor to extend the remainder through July 2009;
    otherwise the lease will terminate. We account for the Phase One
    Lease arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with
    SFAS No. 13,

“Accounting for Leases”

,
    as amended.

In December 2000, we entered into a second

build-to-suit

lease (“Phase Two Lease”) with Keybank National
    Association for a five and one-half year term beginning in
    December 2000 to expand our Redwood City, California
    headquarters facilities and develop adjacent property
    (“Phase Two Facilities”). Construction of the Phase
    Two Facilities was completed in June 2002. The Phase Two
    Facilities comprise a total of approximately 310,000 square
    feet and provide space for sales, marketing, administration and
    research and development functions. Subject to certain terms and
    conditions, we may purchase the Phase Two Facilities or arrange
    for the sale of the Phase Two Facilities to a third party.

Pursuant to the terms of the Phase Two Lease, we have an option
    to purchase the Phase Two Facilities at any time for a purchase
    price of $115 million. In the event of a sale to a third
    party, if the sale price is less than



$115 million, we will be obligated to reimburse the
    difference between the actual sale price and $115 million,
    up to a maximum of $105 million, subject to certain
    provisions of the Phase Two Lease, as amended.

On May 26, 2006, the lessor extended the Phase Two Lease
    through July 2009 subject to early termination in the event the
    underlying loan financing between the lessor and its lenders is
    not extended. Concurrently with the extension of the lease, the
    lessor extended the loan financing underlying the Phase Two
    Lease with its lenders through July 2007. On May 14, 2007
    the lenders extended this financing again for an additional year
    through July 2008. We may request, on behalf of the lessor and
    subject to lender approval, an additional one-year extension of
    the loan financing between the lessor and the lenders. In the
    event the lessor’s loan financing with the lenders is not
    extended, we may loan to the lessor approximately
    90 percent of the financing, and require the lessor to
    extend the remainder through July 2009, otherwise the lease will
    terminate. We account for the Phase Two Lease arrangement as an
    operating lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, as
    amended.

We believe that, as of March 31, 2007, the estimated fair
    values of both properties under these operating leases exceeded
    their respective guaranteed residual values.

The two lease agreements with Keybank National Association
    described above require us to maintain certain financial
    covenants as shown below, all of which we were in compliance
    with as of March 31, 2007.

In February 2006, we entered into an agreement with an
    independent third party to lease a studio facility in Guildford,
    Surrey, United Kingdom, which commenced in June 2006 and will
    expire in May 2016. The facility comprises a total of
    approximately 95,000 square feet, which we use for research
    and development functions. Our rental obligation under this
    agreement is approximately $33 million over the initial
    ten-year term of the lease.

In June 2004, we entered into a lease agreement, amended in
    December 2005, with an independent third party for a studio
    facility in Orlando, Florida. The lease commenced in January
    2005 and expires in June 2010, with one five-year option to
    extend the lease term. The campus facilities comprise a total of
    140,000 square feet and provide space for research and
    development functions. Our rental obligation over the initial

five-and-a-half

year term of the lease is $15 million.

In July 2003, we entered into a lease agreement with an
    independent third party (the “Landlord”) for a studio
    facility in Los Angeles, California, which commenced in October
    2003 and expires in September 2013 with two five-year options to
    extend the lease term. Additionally, we have options to purchase
    the property after five and ten years based on the fair market
    value of the property at the date of sale, a right of first
    offer to purchase the property upon terms offered by the
    Landlord, and a right to share in the profits from a sale of the
    property. Existing campus facilities comprise a total of
    243,000 square feet and provide space for research and
    development functions. Our rental obligation under this
    agreement is $50 million over the initial ten-year term of
    the lease. This commitment is offset by expected sublease income
    of $6 million for a sublease to an affiliate of the
    Landlord of 18,000 square feet of the Los Angeles facility,
    which commenced in October 2003 and expires in September 2013,
    with options of early termination by the affiliate after five
    years and by us after four and five years.

In October 2002, we entered into a lease agreement, with an
    independent third party for a studio facility in Vancouver,
    British Columbia, Canada, which commenced in May 2003 and
    expires in April 2013. We amended the lease in October 2003. The
    facility comprises a total of approximately 65,000 square
    feet and provides space for research and development functions.
    Our rental obligation under this agreement is approximately
    $16 million over the initial ten-year term of the lease.



Neowiz
    Investment

In April 2007, we expanded our commercial agreements with and
    made strategic equity investments in Neowiz Corporation and its
    online gaming subsidiary, Neowiz Games. We purchased stock
    representing in aggregate approximately 19 percent of each
    of Neowiz and Neowiz Games for approximately $108 million.
    Based in Korea, Neowiz is an online media and gaming company
    with which we partnered in 2006 to launch

EA Sports FIFA
    Online

in Korea.

Legal
    Proceedings

On September 14, 2006, we received an informal inquiry from
    the Securities and Exchange Commission requesting certain
    documents and information relating to our stock option grant
    practices from January 1, 1997 through the date of the
    letter. We have cooperated to date with all matters related to
    this request. We most recently provided the SEC with information
    in December 2006. The SEC has not asked for further
    information since that time.

We are also subject to claims and litigation arising in the
    ordinary course of business. We believe that any liability from
    any reasonably foreseeable disposition of such claims and
    litigation, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
    or results of operations.

Director
    Indemnity Agreements

We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of the
    members of our Board of Directors at the time they joined the
    Board to indemnify them to the extent permitted by law against
    any and all liabilities, costs, expenses, amounts paid in
    settlement and damages incurred by the directors as a result of
    any lawsuit, or any judicial, administrative or investigative
    proceeding in which the directors are sued or charged as a
    result of their service as members of our Board of Directors.

INFLATION

We believe the impact of inflation on our results of operations
    has not been significant in any of the past three fiscal years.

Item 7A:

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market
    Risk

We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and market
    prices. Market risk is the potential loss arising from changes
    in market rates and market prices. We employ established
    policies and practices to manage these risks. Foreign exchange
    option and forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated
    exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign
    exchange risk as discussed below. We have not historically, nor
    do we currently, hedge our short-term investment portfolio. We
    do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be exposed to
    significant interest rate risk because our cash and cash
    equivalent portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with
    original maturities of three months or less (see Note 2 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
    this report). We also do not currently hedge our market price
    risk relating to our equity investments. Further, we do not
    enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for
    trading or speculative purposes (see Note 3 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
    this report).

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Cash Flow Hedging Activities.

From time to
    time, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to
    forecasted foreign-currency-denominated sales and expense
    transactions by purchasing option contracts that generally have
    maturities of 15 months or less. These transactions are
    designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. The derivative
    assets associated with our hedging activities are recorded at
    fair value in other current assets in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. The effective portion of gains or losses resulting from
    changes in fair value of these hedges is initially reported, net
    of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive



income in stockholders’ equity and subsequently
    reclassified into net revenue or operating expenses, as
    appropriate in the period when the forecasted transaction is
    recorded. The ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting
    from changes in fair value, if any, is reported in each period
    in interest and other income, net, in our Consolidated
    Statements of Operations. Our hedging programs reduce, but do
    not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate
    movements in revenue and operating expenses. As of
    March 31, 2007, we had foreign currency option contracts to
    purchase approximately $28 million in foreign currencies
    and to sell approximately $72 million of foreign
    currencies. As of March 31, 2007, these foreign currency
    option contracts outstanding had a total fair value of less than
    $1 million, included in other current assets. As of
    March 31, 2006, we had no foreign currency option contracts
    outstanding.

Balance Sheet Hedging Activities.

We utilize
    foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency
    risk associated with foreign-currency-denominated assets and
    liabilities, primarily intercompany receivables and payables.
    The forward contracts generally have a contractual term of
    approximately one month and are transacted near month-end.
    Therefore, the fair value of the forward contracts generally is
    not significant at each month-end. Our foreign exchange forward
    contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under
    SFAS No. 133 and are accounted for as derivatives
    whereby the fair value of the contracts are reported as other
    current assets or other current liabilities in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets, and gains and losses from changes in fair value
    are reported in interest and other income, net. The gains and
    losses on these forward contracts generally offset the gains and
    losses on the underlying foreign-currency-denominated assets and
    liabilities, which are also reported in interest and other
    income, net, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of
    March 31, 2007, we had forward foreign exchange contracts
    to purchase and sell approximately $104 million in foreign
    currencies. Of this amount, $73 million represented
    contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for
    U.S. dollars, $8 million to sell foreign currencies in
    exchange for British pound sterling and $23 million to
    purchase foreign currencies in exchange for U.S. dollars.
    As of March 31, 2006, we had forward foreign exchange
    contracts to purchase and sell approximately $161 million
    in foreign currencies. Of this amount, $132 million
    represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for
    U.S. dollars, $14 million to sell foreign currencies
    in exchange for British pound sterling and $15 million to
    purchase foreign currencies in exchange for U.S. dollars.
    The fair value of our forward contracts was immaterial as of
    March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006.

The counterparties to these forward and option contracts are
    creditworthy multinational commercial banks; therefore, the risk
    of counterparty nonperformance is not considered to be material.

Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency
    exchange rate risks, there can be no assurance that our hedging
    activities will adequately protect us against the risks
    associated with foreign currency fluctuations. As of
    March 31, 2007, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency
    exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent
    would result in a potential loss in fair value of our option
    contracts of $1 million in both scenarios. As of
    March 31, 2006, we had no foreign currency option contracts
    outstanding. A hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange
    rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would result
    in potential losses on our forward contracts of $9 million
    and $14 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2007,
    and $16 million and $23 million, respectively, as of
    March 31, 2006. This sensitivity analysis assumes a
    parallel adverse shift in foreign currency exchange rates, which
    do not always move in the same direction. Actual results may
    differ materially.

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
    relates primarily to our short-term investment portfolio. We
    manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment
    portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high
    credit quality and relatively short maturities. Additionally,
    the contractual terms of the securities do not permit the issuer
    to call, prepay or otherwise settle the securities at prices
    less than the stated par value of the securities. Our
    investments are held for purposes other than trading. Also, we
    do not use derivative financial instruments in our short-term
    investment portfolio.

As of March 31, 2007 and 2006, our short-term investments
    were classified as

available-for-sale

and, consequently, recorded at fair market value with unrealized
    gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as
    a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income,
    net of any tax effects, in



stockholders’ equity. Our portfolio of short-term
    investments consisted of the following investment categories,
    summarized by fair value as of March 31, 2007 and 2006 (in
    millions):

Notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks, there
    can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against
    risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. At any time, a
    sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact
    on the fair value of our investment portfolio. The following
    table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value in our
    short-term investment portfolio as of March 31, 2007,
    arising from potential changes in interest rates. The modeling
    technique estimates the change in fair value from immediate
    hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus

Market
    Price Risk

The value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies
    are subject to market price volatility. As of March 31,
    2007 and 2006, our marketable equity securities were classified
    as

available-for-sale

and, consequently, were recorded in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses
    reported as a separate component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income, net of any tax effects, in



stockholders’ equity. The fair value of our marketable
    equity securities was $341 million and $160 million as
    of March 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

At any time, a sharp change in market prices in our investments
    in marketable equity securities could have a significant impact
    on the fair value of our investments. The following table
    presents the hypothetical changes in fair value in our
    marketable equity securities as of March 31, 2007, arising
    from changes in market prices plus or minus 25 percent,

DESCRIPTION
    OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

We develop, market, publish and distribute interactive software
    games that are playable by consumers on video game consoles
    (such as the Sony
    PlayStation

®

2 and
    PLAYSTATION

®

3,
    Microsoft Xbox

tm

and Nintendo
    Wii

tm

),
    personal computers, mobile platforms (including cellular
    handsets and handheld game players such as the
    PlayStation

®

Portable
    (“PSP

tm

”)
    and the Nintendo
    DS

tm

)
    and online (over the Internet and other proprietary online
    networks). Some of our games are based on content that we
    license from others (e.g., Madden NFL Football, The Godfather
    and FIFA Soccer), and some of our games are based on our own
    wholly-owned intellectual property (e.g., The
    Sims

tm

and Need for
    Speed

tm

).
    Our goal is to publish titles with mass-market appeal, which
    often means translating and localizing them for sale in
    non-English speaking countries. In addition, we also attempt to
    create software game “franchises” that allow us to
    publish new titles on a recurring basis that are based on the
    same property. Examples of this franchise approach are the
    annual iterations of our sports-based products (e.g., Madden NFL
    Football,
    NCAA

®

Football and FIFA Soccer), wholly-owned properties that can be
    successfully sequeled (e.g., The Sims, Need for Speed and
    Battlefield) and titles based on long-lived literary

and/or

movie
    properties (e.g., Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter).

A summary of our significant accounting policies applied in the
    preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements follows:

(a)

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the

    majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
    balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal
    Year

Our fiscal year is reported on a 52 or

53-week

period that, historically, ended on the final Saturday of March
    in each year. Beginning with the fiscal year ended
    March 31, 2006, our fiscal year ends on the Saturday
    nearest March 31. As a result, fiscal 2006 contained
    53 weeks with the first quarter containing 14 weeks.
    Our results of operations for the fiscal years ended
    March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 contain the following number
    of weeks:

Reclassifications

Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to
    the fiscal 2007 presentation.

(d)

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities, contingent assets
    and liabilities, and revenue and expenses during the reporting
    period. Such estimates include sales returns and allowances,
    provisions for doubtful accounts, accrued liabilities, income
    taxes, estimates regarding the recoverability of prepaid
    royalties and royalty commitments, inventories, long-lived
    assets, certain estimates related to the measurement and
    recognition of costs resulting from our share-based payment
    transactions, deferred income tax assets as well as estimates
    used in our goodwill impairment



test. These estimates generally involve complex issues and
    require us to make judgments, involve analysis of historical and
    future trends, can require extended periods of time to resolve,
    and are subject to change from period to period. In all cases,
    actual results could differ materially from our estimates.

(e)

Cash,
    Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments, Marketable Equity
    Securities and Other Investments

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with
    insignificant interest rate risk and original or remaining
    maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.

Short-term investments consist of securities with original or
    remaining maturities of greater than three months at the time of
    purchase. The short-term investments are available for use in
    current operations or other activities such as capital
    expenditures and business acquisitions.

As of March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006, short-term
    investments and marketable equity securities were classified as

available-for-sale

and stated at fair value based upon quoted market prices for the
    securities. Unrealized gains and losses are included as a
    separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income,
    net of any related tax effect, in stockholders’ equity.
    Realized gains and losses are calculated based on the specific
    identification method. We recognize an impairment charge when we
    determine that a decline in the fair value of a security below
    its cost basis is

other-than-temporary.

Investments in affiliates consist of investments in equity
    securities accounted for under either the cost method or the
    equity method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
    Opinion (“APB”) No. 18,

“The Equity
    Method Of Accounting For Investments In Common Stock”.

Our share of earnings or losses of investments in affiliates
    accounted for under the equity method is included in interest
    and other income, net, in our Consolidated Statement of
    Operations, except for investments where we are not able to
    exercise significant influence over the operating and financing
    decisions of the investee, in which case the cost method of
    accounting is used. We evaluate the investment in affiliates to
    determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate an

other-than-temporary

impairment in value. We recognize an impairment charge when we
    determine an

other-than-temporary

impairment in value exists.

(f)

Inventories

Inventories consist of materials (including manufacturing
    royalties paid to console manufacturers), labor and freight-in.
    Inventories are stated at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out method) or market.

(g)

Property
    and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment, net, are stated at cost. Depreciation is
    calculated using the straight-line method over the following
    useful lives:

Buildings

20 to 25 years

Computer equipment and software

3 to 5 years

Furniture and equipment

3 to 5 years

Leasehold improvements

Lesser of the lease term or the
    estimated useful lives of the improvements, generally 1 to
    10 years

Under the provisions of American Institute of Certified Public
    Accountants Statement of Position (“SOP”)

98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed
    or Obtained for Internal Use”

, we capitalize costs
    associated with customized internal-use software systems that
    have reached the application development stage and meet
    recoverability tests. Such capitalized costs include external
    direct costs utilized in developing or obtaining the
    applications and payroll and payroll-related expenses for
    employees who are directly associated with the applications.
    Capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project
    stage is complete and ceases at the point in which the project
    is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose.
    The net book value of capitalized costs associated with
    internal-use software amounted to $18 million and
    $23 million as of March 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, and are being depreciated on a straight-line basis
    over each asset’s estimated useful life that ranges from
    three to five years.



(h)

Long-Lived
    Assets

We evaluate long-lived assets and certain identifiable
    intangibles for impairment, in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets”

, whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
    recoverable. Recoverability of assets is measured by a
    comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future
    undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the
    asset. This may include assumptions about future prospects for
    the business that the asset relates to and typically involves
    computations of the estimated future cash flows to be generated
    by these businesses. Based on these judgments and assumptions,
    we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to
    reduce the value of the asset stated on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet to reflect its actual fair value. Judgments and
    assumptions about future values and remaining useful lives are
    complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety
    of factors, including but not limited to, significant negative
    industry or economic trends, significant changes in the manner
    of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall
    business and significant under-performance relative to expected
    historical or projected future operating results. If we were to
    consider such assets to be impaired, the amount of impairment we
    would recognize would be measured by the amount by which the
    carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value which is
    estimated by discounted cash flows. We recognized an
    insignificant amount of impairment in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005.

(i)

Taxes
    Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental
    Authorities

Taxes assessed by a government authority that are both imposed
    on and concurrent with specific revenue transactions between us
    and our customers is presented on a net basis in our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

(j)

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

We extend credit to various companies in the retail and mass
    merchandising industries. Collection of trade receivables may be
    affected by changes in economic or other industry conditions and
    may, accordingly, impact our overall credit risk. Although we
    generally do not require collateral, we perform ongoing credit
    evaluations of our customers and maintain reserves for potential
    credit losses. As of March 31, 2007 and 2006, we had
    10 percent and 11 percent, respectively, of our gross
    accounts receivable outstanding with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. As of
    March 31, 2007, we had 11 percent of our gross
    accounts receivable outstanding with GameStop Corp.

Short-term investments are placed with high quality financial
    institutions or in short-duration, investment-grade securities.
    We limit the amount of credit exposure in any one financial
    institution or type of investment instrument.

(k)

Revenue
    Recognition

We evaluate the recognition of revenue based on the criteria set
    forth in

SOP 97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition”

, as amended by

SOP 98-9,

“Modification of

SOP 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
    Transactions”

and Staff Accounting Bulletin
    (“SAB”) No. 101,

“Revenue Recognition in
    Financial Statements”

, as revised by
    SAB No. 104,

“Revenue Recognition”.

We evaluate revenue recognition using the following basic
    criteria and recognize revenue when all four of the following
    criteria are met:

•

Evidence of an arrangement. Evidence of an agreement with the
    customer that reflects the terms and conditions to deliver
    products must be present in order to recognize revenue.

•

Delivery. Delivery is considered to occur when a product is
    shipped and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been
    transferred to the customer. For online game services, delivery
    is considered to occur as the service is provided. For online
    services associated with our packaged goods products (other than
    massively multiplayer online games) such as matchmaking, roster
    updates, tournaments and player rankings, we estimate the
    service period to be six months after the month of sale.



•

Fixed or determinable fee. If a portion of the arrangement fee
    is not fixed or determinable, we recognize revenue as the amount
    becomes fixed or determinable.

•

Collection is deemed probable. We conduct a credit review of
    each customer involved in a significant transaction to determine
    the creditworthiness of the customer. Collection is deemed
    probable if we expect the customer to be able to pay amounts
    under the arrangement as those amounts become due. If we
    determine that collection is not probable, we recognize revenue
    when collection becomes probable (generally upon cash
    collection).

Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been
    satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have
    a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we
    report. For example, for multiple element arrangements, we must
    make assumptions and judgments in order to: (1) determine
    whether and when each element has been delivered;
    (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are
    essential to the functionality of the delivered products and
    services; (3) determine whether vendor-specific objective
    evidence of fair value (“VSOE”) exists for each
    undelivered element; and (4) allocate the total price among
    the various elements we must deliver. Changes to any of these
    assumptions or judgments, or changes to the elements in a
    software arrangement, could cause a material increase or
    decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular
    period.

Product Revenue:

Product revenue, including
    sales to resellers and distributors (“channel
    partners”), is recognized when the above criteria are met.
    We reduce product revenue for estimated future returns, price
    protection, and other offerings, which may occur with our
    customers and channel partners.

Shipping and Handling:

In accordance with
    Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue

No. 00-10,

“Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and
    Costs”

, we recognize amounts billed to customers for
    shipping and handling as revenue. Additionally, shipping and
    handling costs incurred by us are included in cost of goods sold.

Online Subscription Revenue:

Online
    subscription revenue is derived principally from subscription
    revenue collected from customers for online play related to our
    massively multiplayer online games and Pogo-branded online games
    services. These customers generally pay on an annual basis or a

month-to-month

basis and prepaid subscription revenue, including revenue
    collected from credit card sales, is recognized ratably over the
    period for which the services are provided.

Software Licenses:

We license software rights
    to manufacturers of products in related industries (for example,
    makers of personal computers or computer accessories) to include
    certain of our products with the manufacturer’s product, or
    offer our products to consumers who have purchased the
    manufacturer’s product. We call these combined products
    “OEM bundles”. These OEM bundles generally require the
    customer to pay us an upfront nonrefundable fee, which
    represents the guaranteed minimum royalty amount. Revenue is
    generally recognized upon delivery of the product master or the
    first copy. Per-copy royalties on sales that exceed the minimum
    guarantee are recognized as earned.

(l)

Sales
    Returns and Allowances and Bad Debt Reserves

We estimate potential future product returns, price protection
    and stock-balancing programs related to current-period product
    revenue. We analyze historical returns, current sell-through of
    distributor and retailer inventory of our products, current
    trends in retail and the video game segment, changes in customer
    demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors
    when evaluating the adequacy of our sales returns and price
    protection allowances. In addition, we monitor the volume of
    sales to our channel partners and their inventories as
    substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could
    result in high returns or higher price protection costs in
    subsequent periods.

Similarly, significant judgment is required to estimate our
    allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period. We
    analyze customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness,
    current economic trends, and historical experience when
    evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.



(m)

Advertising
    Costs

We generally expense advertising costs as incurred, except for
    production costs associated with media campaigns which are
    recognized as prepaid assets (to the extent paid in advance) and
    expensed at the first run of the advertisement. Cooperative
    advertising with our channel partners is accrued when revenue is
    recognized and such amounts are included in marketing and sales
    expense if there is a separate identifiable benefit for which we
    can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit
    identified. Otherwise, they are recognized as a reduction of net
    revenue. We then reimburse the channel partner when qualifying
    claims are submitted. We sometimes receive reimbursements for
    advertising costs from our vendors, and such amounts are
    recognized as a reduction of marketing and sales expense if the
    advertising (1) is specific to the vendor,
    (2) represents an identifiable benefit to us and
    (3) represents an incremental cost to us. Otherwise, vendor
    reimbursements are recognized as a reduction of cost of goods
    sold as the related revenue is recognized. Vendor reimbursements
    of advertising costs of $28 million, $41 million and
    $42 million reduced marketing and sales expense for the
    fiscal years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, advertising expenses, net of vendor
    reimbursements, totaled approximately $163 million,
    $180 million and $174 million, respectively.

(n)

Software
    Development Costs

Research and development costs, which consist primarily of
    software development costs, are expensed as incurred.
    SFAS No. 86,

“Accounting for the Cost of
    Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
    Marketed”

, provides for the capitalization of certain
    software development costs incurred after technological
    feasibility of the software is established or for development
    costs that have alternative future uses. Under our current
    practice of developing new products, the technological
    feasibility of the underlying software is not established until
    substantially all product development is complete, which
    generally includes the development of a working model. The
    software development costs that have been capitalized to date
    have been insignificant.

(o)

Stock-based
    Compensation

On April 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123
    (revised 2004) (“SFAS No. 123(R)”),
    “

Share-Based Payment

”, and applied the
    provisions of SAB No. 107, “

Share-Based
    Payment

”, on our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires that the cost resulting from
    all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the
    financial statements using a fair-value-based method. We elected
    to use the modified prospective transition method of adoption.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires us to measure compensation
    cost for all outstanding unvested stock-based awards made to our
    employees and directors based on estimated fair values and
    recognize compensation over the service period for awards
    expected to vest.

For stock options and purchases through our employee stock
    purchase plan, we use the Black-Scholes option valuation model
    to determine the grant date fair value. The Black-Scholes option
    valuation model requires us to make certain assumptions about
    the future. The determination of fair value is affected by our
    stock price as well as assumptions regarding subjective and
    complex variables such as expected employee exercise behaviors
    and our expected stock price volatility over the term of the
    award. Generally, our assumptions are based on historical
    information and judgment is required to determine if historical
    trends may be indicators of future outcomes.

As required by SFAS No. 123(R), employee stock-based
    compensation expense is calculated based on awards ultimately
    expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures.
    Forfeitures are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if
    actual forfeitures differ from those estimates and an adjustment
    is recognized at that time.

Changes to our underlying stock price, our assumptions used in
    the Black-Scholes option valuation calculation and our
    forfeiture rate, as well as future grants of equity, could
    significantly impact compensation expense to be recognized in
    fiscal 2008 and future periods.



(p)

Foreign
    Currency Translation

For each of our foreign operating subsidiaries, the functional
    currency is generally its local currency. Assets and liabilities
    of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars
    using month-end exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are
    translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates.
    The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are
    included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    income in stockholders’ equity.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of
    the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated
    in currencies other than the functional currency. Foreign
    currency transaction gains (losses) of $10 million,
    $(1) million and $25 million for the fiscal years
    ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, are
    included in interest and other income, net, in our Consolidated
    Statements of Operations.

(q)

Impact
    of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 155,
    “

Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial
    Instruments — An Amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 133 and 140

”. SFAS No. 155
    (1) permits fair value measurement for any hybrid financial
    instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise
    would require bifurcation, (2) clarifies that interest-only
    strips and principal-only strips are not subject to the
    requirements of SFAS No. 133, “

Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

”,
    (3) establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in
    securitized financial assets to identify interests that are
    freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial
    instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring
    bifurcation, (4) clarifies that concentrations of credit
    risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives,
    and (5) amends SFAS No. 140, “

Accounting
    for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
    Extinguishments of Liabilities — A Replacement of FASB
    Statement No. 125

” to eliminate the prohibition on
    a qualifying special-purpose entity from holding a derivative
    financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest
    other than another derivative financial instrument. In December
    2006, the FASB cleared guidance in Derivatives Implementation
    Group Statement 133 Implementation Issue No. B40,
    “

Embedded Derivatives: Application of
    Paragraph 13(b) to Securitized Interests in Prepayable
    Financial Assets

”. FASB concluded that a securitized
    interest in prepayable financial assets is not subject to the
    conditions in paragraph 13(b) of SFAS No. 133 if
    it meets the two criteria outlined in the Statement 133
    Implementation Issue No. B40. SFAS No. 155 is
    effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued for
    fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. The
    guidance in the Statement 133 Implementation Issue
    No. B40 is applicable upon adoption of
    SFAS No. 155, although the FASB provides certain
    exceptions as described in the Statement 133 Implementation
    Issue No. B40. We do not expect the adoption of
    SFAS No. 155 or Statement 133 Implementation
    Issue No. B40 to have a material impact on our Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
    (“FIN”) No. 48, “

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — An Interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109

”. FIN No. 48
    clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
    recognized in financial statements in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109, “

Accounting for Income
    Taxes

”. FIN No. 48 prescribes a recognition
    threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
    recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected
    to be taken in a tax return and provides guidance on
    derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
    accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. Under
    FIN No. 48, the evaluation of a tax position is a
    two-step process. The first step is a recognition process where
    we are required to determine whether it is more likely than not
    that a tax position will be sustained upon examination,
    including resolution of any related appeals or litigation
    processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In
    evaluating whether a tax position has met the
    more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, it is presumed that
    the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing
    authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
    The second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position
    that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is
    calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in
    the financial statements. FIN No. 48 also requires new
    tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax
    benefits at the beginning and end of the reporting period. The
    provisions of FIN No. 48 are effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2006. As such, we are
    required to adopt it in our first quarter of fiscal year 2008.
    Any changes to our income taxes due to the adoption of



FIN No. 48 are treated as the cumulative effect of a
    change in accounting principle. We are evaluating what impact
    the adoption of FIN No. 48 will have on our
    Consolidated Financial Statements. This impact could be material
    and our future effective tax rates could be more volatile.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “

Fair Value Measurements

”.
    SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
    accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. Fair value refers to the price that would be
    received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
    orderly transaction between market participants in the market in
    which the reporting entity transacts. SFAS No. 157
    establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the
    information used to develop those assumptions. Fair value
    measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the
    fair value hierarchy. The provisions of SFAS No. 157
    are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. We do not expect the adoption of
    SFAS No. 157 to have a material impact on our
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
    Financial Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB
    Statement No. 115

”. SFAS No. 159 permits
    entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and
    certain other items at fair value that are not currently
    required to be measured at fair value. It also establishes
    presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate
    comparisons between entities that choose different measurement
    attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The
    provisions of SFAS No. 159 are effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007. This Statement should not be applied
    retrospectively to fiscal years beginning prior to the effective
    date, except as permitted with early adoption. We are evaluating
    if we will adopt SFAS No. 159 and what impact the
    adoption will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements if
    we adopt. If we adopt SFAS No. 159, it may have a
    material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In March 2007, the EITF issued a tentative conclusion on EITF

07-03,

“

Accounting for Advance Payments for Goods or Services
    to Be Used in Future Research and Development

” and the
    FASB ratified the tentative conclusion. The FASB exposed the
    EITF tentative conclusion for public comment. The comment period
    was expected to end in May 2007. EITF

07-03

addresses the diversity which exists with respect to the
    accounting for the non-refundable portion of a payment made by a
    research and development entity for future research and
    development activities. Under this tentative conclusion, an
    entity would defer and capitalize non-refundable advance
    payments made for research and development activities until the
    related goods are delivered or the related services are
    performed. If a final consensus is reached on this tentative
    conclusion, EITF

07-03

would
    be effective for interim or annual reporting periods in fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2007. We do not expect
    the adoption of EITF

07-03

to
    have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements
    if ratified by the FASB as currently proposed.

We periodically evaluate our securities for impairment. Factors
    considered in the review of securities with an unrealized loss
    include the credit quality of the issuer, the magnitude of the
    unrealized loss position, the length of time that the security
    has been in a loss position, our intentions with respect to the
    selling or holding of such security as well as any contractual
    terms impacting the prepayment or settlement process. Based on
    our review, we do not consider the investments listed above to
    be

other-than-temporarily

impaired as of March 31, 2007.

Gross realized losses of $1 million and gross realized
    gains of less than $1 million were recognized from the sale
    of short-term investments for the year ended March 31,
    2007. Gross realized losses of $9 million and gross
    realized gains of less than $1 million were recognized from
    the sale of short-term investments for the year ended
    March 31, 2006. No material gains or losses were recognized
    from the sale of short-term investments for the year ended
    March 31, 2005.

Asset-backed securities are separately disclosed as they are not
    due at a single maturity date. Our portfolio only includes
    asset-backed securities that have weighted-average maturities of
    three years or less. As of March 31, 2007, the amortized
    cost and fair value of asset-backed securities with a weighted
    average maturity of 2 to 3 years was $102 million and
    $103 million, respectively, while the amortized cost and
    fair value of asset-backed securities with a weighted average
    maturity of 1 to 2 years was $5 million. There were no
    asset-backed securities with a weighted average maturity of less
    than one year.

Our investments in marketable equity securities consist of
    investments in common stock of publicly traded companies. On
    February 3, 2005, we purchased approximately
    19.9 percent of the then outstanding ordinary shares
    (representing 18.4 percent of the voting rights at the
    time) of Ubisoft Entertainment (“Ubisoft”) for
    $91 million. At March 31, 2007, we owned approximately
    15.4 percent of the outstanding shares of Ubisoft
    (representing 14.4 percent of the voting rights). As the
    fair value of our marketable equity securities exceeds the cost
    basis of those investments as of March 31, 2007, we do not
    consider these investments to be

other-than-temporarily

impaired. During fiscal 2006 and 2005, no

other-than-temporary

impairment charges were recognized.

We did not have any realized gains or losses from the sale of
    marketable equity securities for the year ended March 31,
    2007. Realized gains from the sale of marketable equity
    securities were $1 million and $2 million for the
    years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

(d)

Investments
    in Affiliates

As of March 31, 2007 and 2006, the total investment in
    affiliates reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets was
    $6 million and $11 million, respectively.

Prior to the acquisition of the remaining minority interest in
    Digital Illusions, C.E. (“DICE”), our investments in
    affiliates included a warrant to acquire 2,327,602 additional
    shares of DICE common stock. Prior to April 2005, the warrant
    was accounted for as a derivative under SFAS No. 133.
    The warrant was amended in April 2005, such that only
    subscriptions of 500,000 or more shares could be exercised. Due
    to the limited trading volume of DICE’s common stock, there
    was no market mechanism for settlement and the warrant was not
    readily convertible to cash and was therefore accounted for
    under the cost method as prescribed by APB No. 18. As of
    March 31, 2006, the cost basis of the warrant was
    $5 million. In connection with the acquisition of the
    remaining minority interest of DICE in October 2006, the warrant
    was reclassed to goodwill for this wholly owned subsidiary. See
    Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

For cost method investments, we estimate that the fair value
    exceeds the cost basis of those investments. Accordingly, we do
    not consider these investments to be

other-than-temporarily

impaired as of March 31, 2007. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and
    2005, no

other-than-temporary

impairments in investments in affiliates were recognized.

DERIVATIVE
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

We account for our derivative and hedging activities under
    SFAS No. 133. The assets or liabilities associated
    with our derivative instruments and hedging activities are
    recorded at fair value in other current assets or other current
    liabilities, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
    As discussed below, the accounting for gains and losses
    resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the
    derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge
    accounting.

We transact business in various foreign currencies and have
    significant international sales and expenses denominated in
    foreign currencies, subjecting us to foreign currency risk. We
    purchase foreign currency option contracts, generally with
    maturities of 15 months or less, to reduce the volatility
    of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenue and
    expenses denominated in certain foreign currencies. In addition,
    we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate
    foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with
    foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities, primarily
    intercompany receivables and payables. The forward contracts
    generally have a contractual term of approximately one month and
    are transacted near month-end;



therefore, the fair value of the forward contracts generally is
    not significant at each month-end. We do not use foreign
    currency option or foreign exchange forward contracts for
    speculative or trading purposes.

Cash
    Flow Hedging Activities

Our foreign currency option contracts are designated and qualify
    as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133. The
    effectiveness of the cash flow hedge contracts, including time
    value, is assessed monthly using regression as well as other
    timing and probability criteria required by
    SFAS No. 133. To receive hedge accounting treatment,
    all hedging relationships are formally documented at the
    inception of the hedge and the hedges must be highly effective
    in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged
    transactions. The effective portion of gains or losses resulting
    from changes in fair value of these hedges is initially
    reported, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity. The gross
    amount of the effective portion of gains or losses resulting
    from changes in fair value of these hedges was subsequently
    reclassified into net revenue or operating expenses, as
    appropriate, in the period when the forecasted transaction was
    recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The
    ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in
    fair value, if any, is reported in each period in interest and
    other income, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
    The effective portion of hedges recognized in accumulated other
    comprehensive income at the end of each year will be
    reclassified to earnings within 12 months.

The following table summarizes the activity in accumulated other
    comprehensive income, net of related taxes, with regard to the
    changes in fair value of derivative instruments, for fiscal 2007
    and 2006 (in millions):

Hedging ineffectiveness for the years ended March 31, 2007

    was a loss of $1 million for the year ended March 31,
    2005.

Balance
    Sheet Hedging Activities

Our foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated as
    hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133. Accordingly,
    any gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of
    the forward contracts are reported in interest and other income,
    net. The gains and losses on these forward contracts generally
    offset the gains and losses associated with the underlying
    foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities, which are
    also reported in interest and other income, net, in our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Based in Sweden, DICE develops games for PCs and video game
    consoles. In 2003 we acquired (1) approximately
    1,911,403 shares of Class B common stock representing
    a 19 percent equity interest in DICE, and (2) a
    warrant to acquire an additional 2,327,602 shares of
    to-be-issued Class A common stock at an exercise price of
    SEK 43.23. Prior to our tender offer in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2005, we accounted for our Class B common stock
    investment in DICE under the equity method of accounting, as
    prescribed by APB No. 18, “

The Equity Method of
    Accounting for Investments in Common Stock

”.
    Separately, the warrant was recognized at a cost of
    $5 million as of March 31, 2006 and was included in
    investments in affiliates in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

On January 27, 2005, we completed a tender offer by
    acquiring 3,235,053 shares of Class A common stock at
    a price of SEK 61 per share, representing 32 percent
    of the outstanding Class A common stock of DICE. During the
    tender offer period and through the end of fiscal 2005, we
    acquired, through open market purchases at an average price of
    SEK 60.33, an additional 1,190,658 shares of Class A
    common stock, representing approximately 12 percent of the
    outstanding Class A common stock of DICE. During the first
    three months and last two weeks of fiscal 2006, we acquired,
    through open market purchases at an average price of SEK 63.07,
    an additional 1,071,152 shares of Class A common
    stock, representing approximately 10 percent of the
    outstanding Class A common stock of DICE. Accordingly, on a
    cumulative basis as of March 31, 2006, we owned
    approximately 73 percent of DICE on an undiluted basis
    (excluding the warrant discussed above). As a result, we have
    included the assets, liabilities and results of operations of
    DICE in our Consolidated Financial Statements since
    January 27, 2005. The percent of DICE stock that we did not
    own was reflected as minority interest on our Consolidated
    Financial Statements from January 27, 2005 until the
    acquisition date of the remaining minority interest in October
    2006. DICE’s products were primarily sold through
    co-publishing agreements with us and our transactions with DICE
    were recorded on an arm’s-length basis.

In October 2006, the remaining minority interest in DICE was
    acquired for a total of $27 million in cash, including
    transaction costs. In connection with the acquisition of the
    remaining minority interest of DICE, the warrant was
    reclassified to goodwill for this wholly owned subsidiary.

    Consolidated Statements of Operations upon consummation of the
    acquisition, and in each period we increased our ownership
    percentage. Acquired in-process technology includes the value of
    products in the development stage that are not considered to
    have reached technological feasibility or have alternative
    future use.

Mythic
    Entertainment, Inc.

On July 24, 2006, we acquired all outstanding shares of
    Mythic Entertainment, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of
    $76 million in cash, including transaction costs. Based in
    Fairfax, Virginia, Mythic is a developer and publisher of
    massively multiplayer online role-playing games. The results of
    operations of Mythic and the estimated fair market values of the
    acquired assets and assumed liabilities have been included in
    our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of

JAMDAT
    Mobile Inc.

On February 15, 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding
    shares of JAMDAT Mobile Inc. Based in Los Angeles, California,
    JAMDAT was a global publisher of wireless games and other
    wireless entertainment applications. We paid $27 per share
    in cash in exchange for each share of JAMDAT common stock and
    assumed outstanding stock options and restricted stock units
    under certain JAMDAT equity plans for an aggregate purchase
    price of $684 million, including transaction costs. The
    following table summarizes the estimated fair values of assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our
    acquisition of JAMDAT for the fiscal year ended March 31,

Prior to our acquisition of JAMDAT, on April 20, 2005,
    JAMDAT entered into a purchase agreement with the shareholders
    of Blue Lava Wireless, LLC (“Blue Lava”). In
    connection with JAMDAT’s acquisition of Blue Lava, JAMDAT
    stock was placed in escrow to satisfy certain indemnification
    provisions under the Blue Lava purchase agreement. Upon
    completion of our acquisition of JAMDAT, we assumed
    JAMDAT’s contingent liability and replaced the JAMDAT stock
    in escrow with $27 million in cash, also placed in escrow.
    The $27 million is included in our purchase price of JAMDAT
    as a pre-acquisition contingency. We are required to pay
    $9 million on each of the three anniversaries of the Blue
    Lava acquisition, beginning on April 20, 2006, less any
    claims we may have pursuant to the indemnification provisions of
    the Blue Lava purchase agreement. In April 2007 and 2006, we
    made the first two payments of approximately $9 million in
    each period.

In fiscal 2007, we adjusted the purchase price allocation,
    including the allocation of goodwill, related to our acquisition
    of JAMDAT. As a result, we reduced goodwill and the liability
    balance assumed from JAMDAT by $4 million.

The results of operations of JAMDAT and the estimated fair
    market values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities
    have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements
    since the date of acquisition.

Except for acquired in-process technology, which is discussed
    below, the acquired finite-lived intangible assets are being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated lives ranging
    from two to twelve years. The intangible assets that make up

    Accordingly, we expensed acquired in-process technology in our
    Consolidated Statement of Operations upon consummation of the
    acquisition.



Criterion
    Software Group Ltd.

On October 19, 2004, we acquired all outstanding shares of
    Criterion Software Group Ltd. for an aggregate purchase price of
    approximately $68 million, including transaction costs and
    the assumption of outstanding stock options under certain
    Criterion stock option plans. Based in England, Criterion was a
    developer of video games and a provider of middleware solutions
    for the game development and publishing industry. The results of
    operations of Criterion and the estimated fair market values of
    the acquired assets and assumed liabilities have been included
    in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of
    acquisition. The following table summarizes the estimated fair
    values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection

Stock-based employee compensation represents the intrinsic value
    of certain unvested employee stock options that were assumed as
    part of the transaction. The stock options were considered
    modified for accounting purposes and were fully amortized over
    the remaining vesting period in our Consolidated Statement of
    Operations for the year ended March 31, 2005.

During fiscal 2007, we adjusted the purchase price allocation
    including the allocation of goodwill related to our acquisition
    of JAMDAT. As a result, we reduced goodwill and the liability
    balance assumed from JAMDAT by $4 million.

SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets”

requires that purchased goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangibles not be amortized. Rather, goodwill
    and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to at least
    an annual assessment for impairment by applying a
    fair-value-based test.

SFAS No. 142 requires a two-step approach to testing
    goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit. Our reporting
    units are determined by the components that constitute a
    business for which both (1) discreet



financial information is available and (2) management of
    the reporting unit regularly reviews the operating results of
    that component. The first step tests for impairment by applying
    fair value-based tests at the reporting unit level. The second
    step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by
    applying fair value-based tests to individual assets and
    liabilities within each reporting unit. We completed the first
    step of the annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2007 and found no indicators of impairment of
    our recorded goodwill. We did not recognize an impairment loss
    on goodwill in fiscal 2007, 2006 or 2005.

Finite-lived intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization,
    as of March 31, 2007 and 2006, were $210 million and
    $232 million, respectively, and include costs for obtaining
    (1) developed technologies, (2) carrier contracts and
    related, (3) trade names, and (4) subscribers and
    other intangibles. Amortization of intangibles for fiscal 2007,
    2006 and 2005 was $54 million (of which $27 million
    was recognized in cost of goods sold), $16 million (of
    which $9 million was recognized in cost of goods sold) and
    $6 million (of which $3 million was recognized in cost
    of goods sold), respectively. Finite-lived intangible assets are
    amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of
    their estimated useful lives or the agreement terms, typically
    from two to twelve years. As of March 31, 2007 and 2006,
    the weighted-average remaining useful life for finite-lived
    intangible assets was approximately 6.3 years and
    7.2 years, respectively.

Fiscal
    2006 International Publishing Reorganization

In November 2005, we announced plans to establish an
    international publishing headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.
    Through the quarter ended September 30, 2006, we relocated
    certain employees to our new facility in Geneva, closed certain
    facilities in the United Kingdom, and made other related changes
    in our international publishing business.

Since the inception of the restructuring plan, through
    March 31, 2007, we have incurred restructuring charges of
    approximately $29 million, of which $13 million was
    for employee-related expenses, $9 million for the closure
    of certain United Kingdom facilities, and $7 million in
    other costs in connection with our international publishing
    reorganization. The restructuring accrual of $10 million as
    of March 31, 2007 is expected to be utilized by March 2017.
    This accrual is included in other accrued expenses presented in
    Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In connection with our fiscal 2006 international publishing
    reorganization, in fiscal 2008, we expect to incur between
    $5 million and $10 million of restructuring costs.
    Overall, including charges incurred through March 31, 2007,
    we expect to incur between $50 million and $55 million
    of restructuring costs in connection with our fiscal 2006
    international publishing reorganization, substantially all of
    which will result in cash expenditures by 2017. These
    restructuring costs will consist primarily of employee-related
    relocation assistance (approximately $30 million), facility
    exit costs (approximately $15 million), as well as other
    reorganization costs (approximately $7 million).

Fiscal
    2006 Restructuring

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we recorded a total
    pre-tax restructuring charge of $10 million consisting
    entirely of one-time costs related to headcount reductions which
    are included in restructuring charges in our Consolidated
    Statements of Operations. These headcount reductions related to
    our decision in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 to realign our
    resources with our product plan for fiscal 2007 and strategic
    opportunities with next-generation consoles, online and mobile
    platforms. As of March 31, 2006, this accrual was included
    in other accrued expenses presented in Note 8 of the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of March 31, 2007,
    all $10 million had been paid out in cash under the
    restructuring plan.



Fiscal
    2004, 2003 and 2002 Restructurings

In fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, we engaged in various
    restructurings based on management decisions. As of
    March 31, 2007, all $34 million in cash had been paid
    out under these restructuring plans. As of March 31, 2006,
    the restructuring accrual was included in other accrued expenses
    presented in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

(7) ROYALTIES
    AND LICENSES

Our royalty expenses consist of payments to (1) content
    licensors, (2) independent software developers, and
    (3) co-publishing and distribution affiliates. License
    royalties consist of payments made to celebrities, professional
    sports organizations, movie studios and other organizations for
    our use of their trademarks, copyrights, personal publicity
    rights, content

and/or

other
    intellectual property. Royalty payments to independent software
    developers are payments for the development of intellectual
    property related to our games. Co-publishing and distribution
    royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of
    product.

Royalty-based obligations with content licensors and
    distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and
    capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and
    subsequently paid. These royalty-based obligations are generally
    expensed to cost of goods sold generally at the greater of the
    contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on expected
    net product sales. Prepayments made to thinly capitalized
    independent software developers and co-publishing affiliates are
    generally in connection with the development of a particular
    product and, therefore, we are generally subject to development
    risk prior to the release of the product. Accordingly, payments
    that are due prior to completion of a product are generally
    amortized to research and development over the development
    period as the services are incurred. Payments due after
    completion of the product (primarily royalty-based in nature)
    are generally expensed as cost of goods sold.

Our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed
    royalty payments which are initially recorded as an asset and as
    a liability at the contractual amount when no performance
    remains with the licensor. When performance remains with the
    licensor, we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually
    paid and as a liability when incurred, rather than recording the
    asset and liability upon execution of the contract. Minimum
    royalty payment obligations are classified as current
    liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are
    contractually due within the next twelve months. As of
    March 31, 2007 and 2006, approximately $9 million of
    minimum guaranteed royalty obligations had been recognized in
    each period and are included in the royalty-related assets and
    liabilities tables below.

Each quarter, we also evaluate the future realization of our
    royalty-based assets as well as any unrecognized minimum
    commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely
    to be realized through product sales. Any impairments determined
    before the launch of a product are charged to research and
    development expense. Impairments determined post-launch are
    charged to cost of goods sold. In either case, we rely on
    estimated revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid
    royalties and commitments. If actual sales or revised revenue
    estimates fall below the initial revenue estimate, then the
    actual charge taken may be greater in any given quarter than
    anticipated. We had no impairments during fiscal 2007. During
    fiscal 2006 and 2005, we recorded impairment charges of
    $16 million and $8 million, respectively.

The current and long-term portions of prepaid royalties and
    minimum guaranteed royalty-related assets, included in other
    current assets and other assets, consisted of (in millions):

At any given time, depending on the timing of our payments to
    our co-publishing

and/or

distribution affiliates, content licensors

and/or

independent software developers, we recognize unpaid royalty
    amounts owed to these



parties as either accounts payable or accrued liabilities. The
    current and long-term portions of accrued royalties, included in
    accrued and other current liabilities as well as other
    liabilities, consisted of (in millions):

In addition, as of March 31, 2007, we were committed to pay
    approximately $1,546 million to content licensors and
    co-publishing

and/or

distribution affiliates, but performance remained with the
    counterparty (i.e., delivery of the product or content or other
    factors) and such commitments were therefore not recorded in our
    Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 9 of the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements.

    subscription revenue, deferrals related to our Switzerland
    distribution business, advertising revenue, revenue from
    licensing arrangements and other revenue for which revenue
    recognition criteria has not been met. The deferred net revenue,
    other, balance is included in accrued and other current
    liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(9) COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Lease
    Commitments and Residual Value Guarantees

We lease certain of our current facilities, furniture and
    equipment under non-cancelable operating lease agreements. We
    are required to pay property taxes, insurance and normal
    maintenance costs for certain of these facilities and will be
    required to pay any increases over the base year of these
    expenses on the remainder of our facilities.

In February 1995, we entered into a

build-to-suit

lease (“Phase One Lease”) with a third-party lessor
    for our headquarters facilities in Redwood City, California
    (“Phase One Facilities”). The Phase One Facilities
    comprise a total of approximately 350,000 square feet and
    provide space for sales, marketing, administration and research
    and development functions. In July 2001, the lessor refinanced
    the Phase One Lease with Keybank National Association through
    July 2006. The Phase One Lease expires in January 2039, subject
    to early termination in the event the underlying financing
    between the lessor and its lenders is not extended. Subject to
    certain terms and conditions, we may purchase the Phase One
    Facilities or arrange for the sale of the Phase One Facilities
    to a third party.

Pursuant to the terms of the Phase One Lease, we have an option
    to purchase the Phase One Facilities at any time for a purchase
    price of $132 million. In the event of a sale to a third
    party, if the sale price is less than



$132 million, we will be obligated to reimburse the
    difference between the actual sale price and $132 million,
    up to a maximum of $117 million, subject to certain
    provisions of the Phase One Lease, as amended.

On May 26, 2006, the lessor extended its loan financing
    underlying the Phase One Lease with its lenders through July
    2007, and on May 14, 2007, the lenders extended this
    financing again for an additional year through July 2008. We may
    request, on behalf of the lessor and subject to lender approval,
    an additional one-year extension of the loan financing between
    the lessor and the lenders. In the event the lessor’s loan
    financing with the lenders is not extended, we may loan to the
    lessor approximately 90 percent of the financing, and
    require the lessor to extend the remainder through July 2009;
    otherwise the lease will terminate. We account for the Phase One
    Lease arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with
    SFAS No. 13,

“Accounting for Leases”

,
    as amended.

In December 2000, we entered into a second

build-to-suit

lease (“Phase Two Lease”) with Keybank National
    Association for a five and one-half year term beginning in
    December 2000 to expand our Redwood City, California
    headquarters facilities and develop adjacent property
    (“Phase Two Facilities”). Construction of the Phase
    Two Facilities was completed in June 2002. The Phase Two
    Facilities comprise a total of approximately 310,000 square
    feet and provide space for sales, marketing, administration and
    research and development functions. Subject to certain terms and
    conditions, we may purchase the Phase Two Facilities or arrange
    for the sale of the Phase Two Facilities to a third party.

Pursuant to the terms of the Phase Two Lease, we have an option
    to purchase the Phase Two Facilities at any time for a purchase
    price of $115 million. In the event of a sale to a third
    party, if the sale price is less than $115 million, we will
    be obligated to reimburse the difference between the actual sale
    price and $115 million, up to a maximum of
    $105 million, subject to certain provisions of the Phase
    Two Lease, as amended.

On May 26, 2006, the lessor extended the Phase Two Lease
    through July 2009 subject to early termination in the event the
    underlying loan financing between the lessor and its lenders is
    not extended. Concurrently with the extension of the lease, the
    lessor extended the loan financing underlying the Phase Two
    Lease with its lenders through July 2007. On May 14, 2007
    the lenders extended this financing again for an additional year
    through July 2008. We may request, on behalf of the lessor and
    subject to lender approval, an additional one-year extension of
    the loan financing between the lessor and the lenders. In the
    event the lessor’s loan financing with the lenders is not
    extended, we may loan to the lessor approximately
    90 percent of the financing, and require the lessor to
    extend the remainder through July 2009, otherwise the lease will
    terminate. We account for the Phase Two Lease arrangement as an
    operating lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, as
    amended.

We believe that, as of March 31, 2007, the estimated fair
    values of both properties under these operating leases exceeded
    their respective guaranteed residual values.

The two lease agreements with Keybank National Association
    described above require us to maintain certain financial
    covenants as shown below, all of which we were in compliance
    with as of March 31, 2007.

In February 2006, we entered into an agreement with an
    independent third party to lease a studio facility in Guildford,
    Surrey, United Kingdom, which commenced in June 2006 and will
    expire in May 2016. The facility comprises a total of
    approximately 95,000 square feet, which we use for research
    and development functions. Our rental obligation under this
    agreement is approximately $33 million over the initial
    ten-year term of the lease.

In June 2004, we entered into a lease agreement, amended in
    December 2005, with an independent third party for a studio
    facility in Orlando, Florida. The lease commenced in January
    2005 and expires in June 2010, with



one five-year option to extend the lease term. The campus
    facilities comprise a total of 140,000 square feet and
    provide space for research and development functions. Our rental
    obligation over the initial

five-and-a-half

year term of the lease is $15 million.

In July 2003, we entered into a lease agreement with an
    independent third party (the “Landlord”) for a studio
    facility in Los Angeles, California, which commenced in October
    2003 and expires in September 2013 with two five-year options to
    extend the lease term. Additionally, we have options to purchase
    the property after five and ten years based on the fair market
    value of the property at the date of sale, a right of first
    offer to purchase the property upon terms offered by the
    Landlord, and a right to share in the profits from a sale of the
    property. Existing campus facilities comprise a total of
    243,000 square feet and provide space for research and
    development functions. Our rental obligation under this
    agreement is $50 million over the initial ten-year term of
    the lease. This commitment is offset by expected sublease income
    of $6 million for a sublease to an affiliate of the
    Landlord of 18,000 square feet of the Los Angeles facility,
    which commenced in October 2003 and expires in September 2013,
    with options of early termination by the affiliate after five
    years and by us after four and five years.

In October 2002, we entered into a lease agreement, with an
    independent third party for a studio facility in Vancouver,
    British Columbia, Canada, which commenced in May 2003 and
    expires in April 2013. We amended the lease in October 2003. The
    facility comprises a total of approximately 65,000 square
    feet and provides space for research and development functions.
    Our rental obligation under this agreement is approximately
    $16 million over the initial ten-year term of the lease.

Development,
    Celebrity, League and Content Licenses: Payments and
    Commitments

The products we produce in our studios are designed and created
    by our employee designers, artists, software programmers and by
    non-employee software developers (“independent
    artists” or “third-party developers”). We
    typically advance development funds to the independent artists
    and third-party developers during development of our games,
    usually in installment payments made upon the completion of
    specified development milestones. Contractually, these payments
    are generally considered advances against subsequent royalties
    on the sales of the products. These terms are set forth in
    written agreements entered into with the independent artists and
    third-party developers.

In addition, we have certain celebrity, league and content
    license contracts that contain minimum guarantee payments and
    marketing commitments that may not be dependent on any
    deliverables. Celebrities and organizations with whom we have
    contracts include: FIFA, FIFPRO Foundation, UEFA and FAPL
    (Football Association Premier League Limited) (professional
    soccer); NASCAR (stock car racing); National Basketball
    Association (professional basketball); PGA TOUR and Tiger Woods
    (professional golf); National Hockey League and NHL
    Players’ Association (professional hockey); Warner Bros.
    (Harry Potter, Batman and Superman); New Line Productions and
    Saul Zaentz Company (The Lord of the Rings); Red Bear Inc. (John
    Madden); National Football League Properties and PLAYERS Inc.
    (professional football); Collegiate Licensing Company
    (collegiate football, basketball and baseball); Simcoh (Def
    Jam); Viacom Consumer Products (The Godfather); ESPN (content in
    EA
    SPORTS

tm

games); Twentieth Century Fox Licensing and Merchandising (The
    Simpsons); and Marvel Entertainment, Inc. (Marvel character
    fighting games). These developer and content license commitments
    represent the sum of (1) the cash payments due under
    non-royalty-bearing licenses and services agreements and
    (2) the minimum guaranteed payments and advances against
    royalties due under royalty-bearing licenses and services
    agreements, the majority of which are conditional upon
    performance by the counterparty.

Lease commitments include contractual rental commitments of
    $15 million under real estate leases for unutilized office
    space resulting from our restructuring activities. These
    amounts, net of estimated future

sub-lease

income, were expensed in the periods of the related
    restructuring and are included in our accrued and other current
    liabilities reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
    March 31, 2007. See Note 6 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)

Developer/licensor commitments include $9 million of
    commitments to developers or licensors that have been recorded
    in current and long-term liabilities and a corresponding amount
    in current and long-term assets in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets as of March 31, 2007 because payment is not
    contingent upon performance by the developer or licensor.

The amounts represented in the table above reflect our minimal
    cash obligations for the respective fiscal years, but do not
    necessarily represent the periods in which they will be expensed
    in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Total rent expense for all operating leases was
    $88 million, $59 million and $41 million, for the
    fiscal years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

Neowiz
    Investment

In April 2007, we expanded our commercial agreements with and
    made strategic equity investments in Neowiz Corporation and its
    online gaming subsidiary, Neowiz Games. We purchased stock
    representing in aggregate approximately 19 percent of each
    of Neowiz and Neowiz Games for approximately $108 million.
    Based in Korea, Neowiz is an online media and gaming company
    with which we partnered in 2006 to launch

EA Sports FIFA
    Online

in Korea.

Legal
    proceedings

On September 14, 2006, we received an informal inquiry from
    the Securities and Exchange Commission requesting certain
    documents and information relating to our stock option grant
    practices from January 1, 1997 through the date of the
    letter. We have cooperated to date with all matters related to
    this request. We most recently provided the SEC with information
    in December 2006. The SEC has not asked for any further
    information since that time.

We are also subject to claims and litigation arising in the
    ordinary course of business. We believe that any liability from
    any reasonably foreseeable disposition of such claims and
    litigation, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
    or results of operations.



Director
    Indemnity Agreements

We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of the
    members of our Board of Directors at the time they joined the
    Board to indemnify them to the extent permitted by law against
    any and all liabilities, costs, expenses, amounts paid in
    settlement and damages incurred by the directors as a result of
    any lawsuit, or any judicial, administrative or investigative
    proceeding in which the directors are sued or charged as a
    result of their service as members of our Board of Directors.

During fiscal 2006 we recognized a $73 million reduction in
    income taxes payable following a U.S. Tax Court ruling
    regarding the proper allocation of the tax deduction for stock
    options between U.S. and foreign entities. Although the Tax
    Court ruling remains subject to appeal, as a precedent, it is
    relevant to our situation. Accordingly, we released a reserve of
    $73 million during fiscal 2006, whereby, we recorded a
    reduction to our income tax payable and an increase to
    additional paid-in capital with no impact to net income.



The differences between the statutory income tax rate and our
    effective tax rate, expressed as a percentage of income before

For fiscal 2007, our effective income tax rate was higher than
    the U.S. statutory rate of 35.0 percent due to a
    number of factors, including certain non-deductible
    acquisition-related costs, tax expense from integration
    restructurings, and certain non-deductible stock based
    compensation related to SFAS No. 123(R).

Undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to
    approximately $1 billion as of March 31, 2007. Those
    earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and,
    accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided
    thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of
    dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to both
    U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax
    credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign
    countries. It is not practicable to determine the income tax
    liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be
    distributed.

The IRS has examined our U.S. income tax returns for fiscal
    years 1997 through 2003 and has proposed certain adjustments. We
    do not agree with these adjustments and are planning to contest
    them. In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal 2006, we
    recorded various adjustments for the resolution of certain
    tax-related matters with foreign tax authorities that resulted
    in a 6.1 percent rate reduction. While the ultimate
    resolution of tax audits is uncertain, we expect that the
    aggregate tax accruals which have been provided should be
    adequate for the aggregate adjustments that are likely to result
    for these years.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we repatriated
    $375 million of foreign earnings to take advantage of the
    favorable provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act (the
    “Jobs Act”). Under the Jobs Act, the qualifying
    portion of this repatriation was eligible for a temporary
    85 percent dividends received deduction on certain foreign
    earnings. Accordingly, we recorded tax expense in fiscal 2006 of
    $17 million related to this repatriation.

STOCKHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

(a)

Preferred
    Stock

As of March 31, 2007 and 2006, we had
    10,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized but
    unissued. The rights, preferences, and restrictions of the
    preferred stock may be designated by our Board of Directors
    without further action by our stockholders.

(b)

Common
    Stock

On March 22, 2000, our stockholders authorized the issuance
    of a new series of common stock, designated as Class B
    common stock (“Tracking Stock”). The Tracking Stock
    was intended to reflect the performance of the EA.com online
    games business segment. As a result of the approval of the
    Tracking Stock proposal, our existing common stock was
    re-classified as Class A common stock and was intended to
    reflect the performance of our core console and PC business
    segment. With the authorization of the Class B common



stock, we transferred a portion of our consolidated assets,
    liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows to EA.com Inc., a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of Electronic Arts.

In March 2003, we consolidated the operations of EA.com back
    into our core operations in order to increase efficiency,
    simplify our reporting structure and more directly integrate our
    online activities into our core console and PC business. As a
    result, we eliminated dual class reporting starting in fiscal
    2004. The majority of outstanding Class B options and
    warrants not directly held by us were acquired or converted to
    common stock and warrants.

At our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, held on July 29,
    2004, our stockholders approved an amendment and restatement of
    our Certificate of Incorporation to (1) consolidate our
    Class A and Class B common stock into a single class
    of common stock by reclassifying each outstanding share of
    Class A common stock as one share of common stock and
    converting each outstanding share of Class B common stock
    into 0.001 share of common stock, and (2) increase the
    authorized common stock from 500 million total shares of
    Class A and Class B common stock combined to
    1 billion shares of the newly consolidated single class of
    common stock.

Share
    Repurchase Program

On October 18, 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a
    program to repurchase up to an aggregate of $750 million of

    September 2005. We repurchased and retired the following (in

STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Adoption
    of SFAS No. 123(R)

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123
    (revised 2004) (“SFAS No. 123(R)”),
    “

Share-Based Payment

”.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires that the cost resulting from
    all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the
    financial statements using a fair-value-based method. In March
    2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
    released SAB No. 107, “

Share-Based
    Payment

”, which provides the views of the SEC regarding
    the interaction between SFAS No. 123(R) and certain
    SEC rules and regulations for public companies.
    SFAS No. 123(R) replaces SFAS No. 123,
    “

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

”, as
    amended, supersedes APB No. 25, “

Accounting for
    Stock Issued to Employees

”, and amends
    SFAS No. 95, “

Statement of Cash
    Flows

”.

We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) as of April 1, 2006
    and have applied the provisions of SAB No. 107 to our
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). SFAS No. 123(R)
    requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based
    payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing
    model. We elected to use the modified prospective transition
    method of adoption which requires that compensation expense be
    recognized in the financial statements for all awards granted
    after the date of adoption as well as for existing awards for
    which the requisite service has not been rendered as of the date
    of adoption. Accordingly, prior periods are not restated for the
    effect of SFAS No. 123(R).

Prior to April 1, 2006, we accounted for stock-based awards
    to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with
    APB No. 25 and adopted the disclosure-only provisions of
    SFAS No. 123, as amended. Also, as required by
    SFAS No. 148, “

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation — Transition and Disclosure

”, we
    provided pro forma net income (loss) and net income (loss) per
    share disclosures for stock-based awards as if the
    fair-value-based method defined in SFAS No. 123 had
    been applied.



Valuation and Expense Recognition.

Upon
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we began to recognize
    compensation costs for stock-based payment transactions to
    employees based on their grant-date fair value over the service
    period for which such awards are expected to vest. The fair
    value of restricted stock units is determined based on the
    quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair
    value of stock options and stock purchase rights granted
    pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan is determined using
    the Black-Scholes valuation model, which was the same model we
    previously used for the pro forma information required under
    SFAS No. 123. The determination of fair value is
    affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding
    subjective and complex variables such as expected employee
    exercise behavior and our expected stock price volatility over
    the expected term of the award. Generally, our assumptions are
    based on historical information and judgment is required to
    determine if historical trends may be indicators of future
    outcomes. The Black-Scholes valuation model requires us to
    estimate the following key assumptions:

•

Risk-free interest rate.

The risk-free interest rate is
    based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of
    grant for the expected term of the option.

•

Expected volatility.

We use our historical stock price
    volatility and consider the implied volatility computed based on
    the price of short-term options publicly traded on our common
    stock for our expected volatility assumption.

•

Expected term.

The expected term represents the
    weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain
    outstanding. The expected term is determined based on historical
    exercise behavior, post-vesting termination patterns, options
    outstanding and future expected exercise behavior.

•

Expected dividends.

The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes valuation model to
    value our option grants and employee stock purchase plan during
    the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 were as follows:

Stock Option Grants

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Risk-free interest rate

Prior to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we valued
    our stock options based on the multiple-award valuation method
    and recognized the expense using the accelerated approach over
    the requisite service period. In conjunction with our adoption
    of SFAS No. 123(R), we changed our method of
    recognizing our stock-based compensation expense for
    post-adoption grants to the straight-line approach over the
    requisite service period; however, we continue to value our
    stock options based on the multiple-award valuation method.

As required by SFAS No. 123(R), employee stock-based
    compensation expense recognized during the fiscal year ended
    March 31, 2007 was calculated based on awards ultimately
    expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
    In subsequent periods, if actual forfeitures differ from those
    estimates, an adjustment to stock-based compensation expense
    will be recognized at that time.



The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense
    resulting from stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock
    units and our employee stock purchase plan included in our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations (in millions):

As of March 31, 2007, our total unrecognized compensation
    cost related to stock options was $153 million and is
    expected to be recognized over a weighted-average service period
    of 1.6 years. As of March 31, 2007, our total
    unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock and
    restricted stock units was $82 million and is expected to
    be recognized over a weighted-average service period of
    2.3 years.

The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), using the fair value
    method, had the following adverse impact on our pre-tax income,
    net income, and basic and diluted net income per share as
    compared to what would have been reported under APB No. 25
    using the intrinsic value method, which was the method used
    prior to our adoption for the year ended March 31, 2007 (in
    millions, except per share data):

APIC Pool.

In November 2005, the FASB issued
    FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. Financial
    Accounting Standard (“FAS”) 123(R)-3,
    “

Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax
    Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards

”. The FASB allows
    for a practical exception in calculating the additional paid-in
    capital pool (“APIC pool”) of excess tax benefits upon
    adoption that is available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized
    subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). For
    employee stock-based compensation awards that are outstanding
    upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the alternative
    transition method provides a simplified method to establish the
    beginning balance of the APIC pool related to the tax effects of
    employee stock-based compensation. It also provides a simplified
    method to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the tax effects of
    employee stock-based compensation awards. We elected to adopt
    the alternative transition method provided in FSP
    No. FAS 123(R)-3 for calculating the tax effects of
    stock-based compensation pursuant to SFAS No. 123(R).

Cash Flow Impact.

Prior to our adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R), cash retained as a result of tax
    deductions relating to stock-based compensation was presented in
    operating cash flows along with other tax cash flows.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires a classification change in
    the statement of cash flows. As a result, tax benefits relating
    to excess stock-based compensation deductions, which had been
    included in operating cash flow activities, are now presented as
    financing cash flow activities (total cash flows remain
    unchanged). For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007, we
    recognized $34 million of tax benefit from the exercise of
    stock options; of this amount, $36 million of excess tax
    benefit related to stock-based compensation reported in
    financing activities. For the fiscal year ended March 31,
    2006, we recognized $133 million of tax benefit from
    exercise of stock options reported in operating activities.



Summary
    of Plans and Plan Activity

Stock
    Option Plans

Our 2000 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Equity Plan”)
    allows us to grant options to purchase our common stock,
    restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock appreciation
    rights to our employees, officers and directors. Pursuant to the
    Equity Plan, incentive stock options may be granted to employees
    and officers and non-qualified options may be granted to
    employees, officers and directors, at not less than
    100 percent of the fair market value on the date of grant.

We also have options outstanding that were granted under
    (1) the Criterion Software Limited Approved Share Option
    Scheme (the “Criterion Plan”), which we assumed in
    connection with our acquisition of Criterion, and (2) the
    JAMDAT Mobile Inc. Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Incentive
    Plan and the JAMDAT Mobile Inc. 2004 Equity Incentive Plan
    (collectively, the “JAMDAT Plans”), which we assumed
    in connection with our acquisition of JAMDAT.

Options granted under the Equity Plan generally expire ten years
    from the date of grant and are generally exercisable as to
    24 percent of the shares after 12 months, and then
    ratably over the following 38 months. All options granted
    under the Criterion Plan were exercisable as of March 31,
    2005 and expire in January 2012. Certain assumed options granted
    under the JAMDAT Plans have acceleration rights upon the
    occurrence of various triggering events. Otherwise, the terms of
    the JAMDAT Plans are similar to our Equity Plan.

    restricted stock or restricted stock units.

The aggregate intrinsic value represents the total pre-tax
    intrinsic value based on our closing stock price as of

    holders had all option holders exercised their options as of
    that date. We issue new common stock from our authorized shares
    upon the exercise of stock options.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options
    granted during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $17.75,
    $15.19 and $17.70, respectively. The total intrinsic value of
    options exercised during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 was
    $120 million, $199 million and $307 million,
    respectively. The total fair value



(determined at the grant date) of shares vested during fiscal
    years 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $105 million,

Potential dilution is computed by dividing the options in the

    issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2007
    (311 million shares).

Restricted
    Stock Units and Restricted Stock

We grant restricted stock units and restricted stock
    (collectively referred to as “restricted stock
    rights”) under our Equity Plan to employees worldwide.
    Restricted stock units entitle holders to receive shares of
    common stock at the end of a specified period of time. Upon
    vesting, the equivalent number of common shares are typically
    issued net of tax withholdings. Restricted stock is issued and
    outstanding upon grant; however, restricted stock award holders
    are restricted from selling the shares until they vest. Upon
    vesting, we will typically withhold shares to satisfy tax
    withholding requirements. Restricted stock rights are subject to
    forfeiture and transfer restrictions. Vesting for restricted
    stock rights is based on the holders’ continued employment
    with us. If the vesting conditions are not met, unvested
    restricted stock rights will be forfeited. Generally, our
    restricted stock rights vest according to one of the following
    vesting schedules:

•

100 percent after one year;

•

Three-year vesting with 25 percent cliff vesting at the end
    of each of the first and second years, and 50 percent cliff
    vesting at the end of the third year; or

•

Four-year vesting with 25 percent cliff vesting at the end
    of each year.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted stock
    rights is based on the quoted market value of our common stock
    on the date of grant. The weighted-average fair value of
    restricted stock rights granted during fiscal years 2007 and
    2006 was $52.31 and $52.21, respectively. There were no
    restricted stock rights



granted during fiscal year 2005. The total grant date fair value
    of restricted stock rights that vested during fiscal year 2007
    was $10 million. There were no restricted stock rights that
    vested during fiscal years 2006 and 2005.

At our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, held on July 27,
    2006, our stockholders approved amendments to the Equity Plan to
    (1) increase by 11 million shares the limit on the
    total number of shares underlying awards of restricted stock and
    restricted stock units that may be granted under the Equity
    Plan — from 4 million to 15 million shares,
    and (2) to limit the number of shares subject to options
    surrendered and cancelled in the Exchange Program that will
    again become available for issuance under the Equity Plan to
    7 million plus the number of shares necessary for the
    issuance of the restricted stock rights to be granted in
    connection with the Exchange Program.

Exchange
    Program

At our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, held on July 27,
    2006, our stockholders approved a voluntary program (the
    “Exchange Program”) to permit our eligible employees
    to exchange certain outstanding stock options that were
    significantly “underwater” (that is, the exercise
    price is greater than the trading price of our common stock) for
    a lesser number of shares of restricted stock rights to be
    granted under the Equity Plan. The Exchange Program commenced on
    August 16, 2006 and ended on September 15, 2006.

The Exchange Program was open to all of our employees who were
    employed by us on August 16, 2006 and were still employed
    on the date on which the tendered options were cancelled and
    restricted stock rights were granted except (1) our
    “named executive officers” identified in our 2006
    Annual Proxy Statement, (2) members of our Board of
    Directors, and (3) employees who resided in China, Belgium
    and Denmark, due to restrictions arising under the local laws of
    those countries.

Option grants that had an exercise price per share equal to or
    greater than the “threshold price” were considered
    “eligible options”. The threshold price was $61.66,
    which represented 125 percent of the five-business day
    average closing price of our common stock prior to
    August 16, 2006, as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select
    Market, which was $49.324. Due to local tax law restrictions,
    certain options granted to United Kingdom employees were not
    eligible for exchange. Excluded from the offer were any option
    grants for fewer than five shares.

Eligible options exchanged under the program were cancelled in
    exchange for restricted stock rights following the expiration of
    the offer. For restricted stock rights issued in exchange for
    unvested options, compensation expense is recorded based on the
    grant-date fair value of the options tendered over their
    remaining original vesting period of those options. Restricted
    stock rights issued in connection with the Exchange Program vest
    over a period of up to three years.

The Exchange Program resulted in options to purchase
    approximately 1,779,000 shares of our common stock being
    exchanged for approximately 445,000 shares of restricted
    stock rights. In connection with the Exchange Program, a net
    total of 1,334,000 shares of common stock were returned to
    the Equity Plan for future issuance.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

Since September 1991, we have offered our employees the ability
    to participate in an employee stock purchase plan. Pursuant to
    our current plan, the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
    (“ESPP”), eligible employees may authorize payroll
    deductions of up to 10 percent of their compensation to
    purchase shares at 85 percent of the lower of the fair
    market value of the common stock on the date of commencement of
    the offering or on the last day of each six-month purchase
    period.

At our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, held on July 27,
    2006, our stockholders approved an amendment to the ESPP to
    increase the number of shares authorized under the ESPP by
    1.5 million. As of March 31, 2007, we had
    3 million shares of common stock reserved for future
    issuance under the ESPP.



Information related to stock issuances under the ESPP are as
    follows:

We issue new common stock out of the ESPP’s pool of
    authorized shares. The fair value above was estimated on the
    date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
    assumptions described in this note under the headings
    “Adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)” and
    “Pre-SFAS No. 123(R) Pro Forma Accounting
    Disclosures”.

Pre-SFAS No. 123(R)
    Pro Forma Accounting Disclosures

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we accounted
    for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic value
    method in accordance with APB No. 25 and adopted the
    disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended.

Had compensation cost for our stock-based compensation plans
    been measured based on the estimated fair value at the grant
    dates in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123, as amended, we estimate that our
    reported net income and net income per share would have been the
    pro forma amounts indicated below. The fair value of each option
    grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model. The following weighted-average assumptions
    were used for grants made under our stock-based compensation
    plans in fiscal 2006 and 2005:

    Plan and Registered Retirement Savings Plan

We have a 401(k) plan covering substantially all of our
    U.S. employees, and a Registered Retirement Savings Plan
    covering substantially all of our Canadian employees. These
    plans permit us to make discretionary contributions to
    employees’ accounts based on our financial performance. We
    contributed $3 million, $2 million and $4 million
    to these plans in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

COMPREHENSIVE
    INCOME

SFAS No. 130,

“Reporting Comprehensive
    Income”

, requires classifying items of other
    comprehensive income (loss) by their nature in a financial
    statement and displaying the accumulated balance of other
    comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and
    additional paid-in capital in the equity section of a balance
    sheet. Accumulated other comprehensive income primarily includes
    foreign currency translation adjustments, and the

net-of-tax

amounts for unrealized gains (losses) on investments and
    unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives designated as cash flow
    hedges. Foreign currency translation adjustments are not
    adjusted for income taxes as they relate to indefinite
    investments in

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

The change in the components of accumulated other comprehensive
    income is summarized as follows (in millions):

During fiscal 2007, we realized substantially all gains and
    losses outstanding from our derivative instruments. During
    fiscal 2006, we realized all gains and losses outstanding from
    our derivative instruments. In fiscal 2005, activity related to
    derivatives was not material. See Note 3 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

STAFF
    ACCOUNTING BULLETIN No. 108

In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB No. 108,
    “

Financial Statements — Considering the
    Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
    Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements

”.
    SAB No. 108 provides guidance on how prior year
    misstatements should be taken into consideration when
    quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements
    for purposes of determining whether the current year’s
    financial statements are materially misstated. We adopted
    SAB No. 108 in fiscal 2007.

In accordance with SAB No. 108, we considered both the
    “rollover” approach, which quantifies misstatements
    originating in the current year income statement and the
    “iron curtain” approach which quantifies



misstatements based on the effects of correcting the
    misstatements existing in the balance sheet at the end of the
    reporting period. Prior to our application of the guidance in
    SAB No. 108, we used the rollover approach. We elected
    to recognize the cumulative effect of adoption as adjustments to
    assets and liabilities as of the beginning of fiscal 2007 and
    the offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained
    earnings for fiscal 2007.

Property
    and Equipment Capitalization Adjustment

We adjusted the beginning retained earnings balance for fiscal
    2007 related to the correction of our historical accounting
    treatment of certain property and equipment purchases. We
    capitalize property and equipment purchases when certain
    quantitative thresholds are met; otherwise, they are expensed
    when purchased. Our internal review of our capitalization
    thresholds suggested that certain property and equipment should
    have been capitalized and not expensed. We believe the impact of
    the property and equipment capitalization errors were not
    material to prior years’ income statements under the
    rollover approach. However, under the iron curtain method, the
    cumulative property and equipment capitalization errors were
    material to our fiscal 2007 financial statements and, therefore,
    we recognized the following cumulative adjustment to our fiscal
    2007 opening balance sheet (in millions):

Increase in property and
    equipment, net

Increase in deferred income tax

Business
    Tax Expense Adjustment

We adjusted the beginning retained earnings balance for fiscal
    2007 related to the correction of our historical accounting of
    certain business tax expenses. Our internal review indicated
    that we had inadvertently not accrued for approximately
    $7 million in probable business tax obligations related to
    prior years. We believe the impact of these adjustments were not
    material to prior years’ income statements under the
    rollover approach. However, under the iron curtain method, the
    cumulative business tax expense adjustments were material to our
    fiscal 2007 financial statements and, therefore, we recognized
    the following cumulative adjustment to our fiscal 2007 opening
    balance sheet (in millions):

NET
    INCOME PER SHARE

The following table summarizes the computations of basic
    earnings per share (“Basic EPS”) and diluted earnings
    per share (“Diluted EPS”). Basic EPS is computed as
    net income divided by the weighted-average number of common
    shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the
    potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable
    through stock-based compensation plans including stock options,
    restricted stock, restricted stock units, common stock through
    our employee stock purchase plan, warrants and other convertible
    securities using the treasury stock method.

    2005, respectively, as their inclusion would have been
    antidilutive. For fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, the
    weighted-average exercise price of these options was $55.84,
    $63.34 and $63.63 per share, respectively.

RELATED
    PERSON TRANSACTION

On June 24, 2002, we hired Warren C. Jenson as our
    Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative
    Officer and agreed to loan him $4 million to be forgiven
    over four years based on his continuing employment. The loan did
    not bear interest. On June 24, 2004, pursuant to the terms
    of the loan agreement, we forgave $2 million of the loan
    and provided Mr. Jenson approximately $1.6 million to
    offset the tax implications of the forgiveness. On June 24,
    2006, pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement, we forgave
    the remaining outstanding loan balance of $2 million. No
    additional funds were provided to offset the tax implications of
    the forgiveness of the $2 million balance.

SEGMENT
    INFORMATION

Our reporting segments are based upon: our internal
    organizational structure; the manner in which our operations are
    managed; the criteria used by our Chief Executive Officer, our
    chief operating decision maker,



to evaluate segment performance; the availability of separate
    financial information; and overall materiality considerations.

We manage our business primarily based on geographical
    performance. Accordingly, our combined global publishing
    organizations represent our reportable segment, our Publishing
    segment, due to their similar economic characteristics, products
    and distribution methods. Publishing refers to the
    manufacturing, marketing, advertising and distribution of
    products developed or co-developed by us, or distribution of
    certain third-party publishers’ products through our
    co-publishing and distribution program.

The following table summarizes the financial performance of our
    Publishing segment and a reconciliation of our Publishing
    segment’s profit to our consolidated operating income (in

Publishing segment profit differs from consolidated operating

    our research and development expense as well as certain
    corporate functional costs that are not allocated to the
    publishing organizations. Our Chief Executive Officer reviews
    assets on a consolidated basis and not on a segment basis.

    in The9 Limited, a leading online game operator in China, on or
    around May 29, 2007. We expect to purchase approximately
    15 percent of the outstanding common shares of The9 for
    approximately $167 million on or around May 29, 2007. The
    licensing agreement gives The9 exclusive publishing rights for

EA SPORTS FIFA Online

in mainland China.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Electronic Arts Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Electronic Arts Inc. and subsidiaries (Electronic Arts Inc.) as
    of March 31, 2007 and April 1, 2006, and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
    and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended March 31, 2007. In
    connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
    statements, we have also audited the accompanying financial
    statement schedule. These consolidated financial statements and
    financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
    Electronic Arts Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
    based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Electronic Arts Inc. as of March 31, 2007 and
    April 1, 2006, and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
    ended March 31, 2007, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated
    financial statements, effective April 1, 2006, Electronic
    Arts Inc. adopted the provision of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based
    Payment,

and Securities and Exchange Commission Staff
    Accounting Bulletin No. 108,

Considering the
    Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
    Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Electronic Arts Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of March 31, 2007, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated
    May 29, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of,
    internal control over financial reporting.

    (COSO). Electronic Arts Inc.’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
    opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control over
    financial reporting of Electronic Arts Inc. based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Electronic
    Arts Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of March 31, 2007, is fairly stated, in all
    material respects, based on criteria established in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
    Also, in our opinion, Electronic Arts Inc. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of March 31, 2007, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Electronic Arts Inc. and
    subsidiaries as of March 31, 2007 and April 1, 2006,
    and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash
    flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    March 31, 2007, and our report dated May 29, 2007
    expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
    statements.

Item 9:

Changes
    in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure

Not applicable.

Item 9A:

Controls
    and Procedures

Definition
    and Limitations of Disclosure Controls

Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”)) are controls and other procedures
    that are designed to ensure that information required to be
    disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as
    this report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
    forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to
    ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to
    our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial and Administrative Officer, as appropriate to allow
    timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management
    evaluates these controls and procedures on an ongoing basis.

There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any
    system of disclosure controls and procedures. These limitations
    include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or
    overriding of the controls and procedures and reasonable
    resource constraints. In addition, because we have designed our
    system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we
    believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events,
    our system of controls may not achieve its desired purpose under
    all possible future conditions. Accordingly, our disclosure
    controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance, but not
    absolute assurance, of achieving their objectives.

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial and
    Administrative Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of
    our disclosure controls and procedures, believe that as of the
    end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective in providing the
    requisite reasonable assurance that material information
    required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit
    under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our
    management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial and Administrative Officer, as appropriate to allow
    timely decisions regarding the required disclosure.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
    in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act.

Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to
    provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. There are inherent limitations to the
    effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial
    reporting. These limitations include the possibility of human
    error, the circumvention or overriding of the system and
    reasonable resource constraints. Because of its inherent
    limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may
    not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any
    evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
    risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions, or that the degree of compliance with our policies
    or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as of the end of our most
    recently completed fiscal year. In making its assessment,
    management used the criteria set forth in

Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework,

issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
    Based on this assessment, our management believes that, as of
    the end of our most recently completed fiscal year, our internal
    control over financial reporting was effective.



KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has
    issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of
    our internal control over financial reporting. That report
    appears on page 107.

Changes
    in Internal Controls

In preparation for management’s report on internal control
    over financial reporting, we documented and tested the design
    and operating effectiveness of our internal control over
    financial reporting. During fiscal 2007, there were no
    significant changes in our internal controls or, to our
    knowledge, in other factors that could significantly affect our
    disclosure controls and procedures.
