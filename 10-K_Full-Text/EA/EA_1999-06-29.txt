("Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations"), contains forward looking statements regarding future events or our
future  financial  performance  that  involve  certain  risks and  uncertainties

events or actual future results may differ  materially  from any forward looking
statements due to such risks and uncertainties.


Item 1:  BUSINESS

Overview

         Electronic  Arts was initially  incorporated  in California in 1982. In
September 1991, we were reincorporated under the laws of Delaware. Our principal
executive  offices are  located at 209 Redwood  Shores  Parkway,  Redwood  City,
California 94065 and our telephone number is (650) 628-1500.

         We create, market and distribute interactive entertainment software for
a variety of hardware platforms. As of March 31, 1999, we marketed approximately
111 titles  developed  and/or  published  under one of our brand  names in North
America,  including older titles marketed as "Classics" or "Publisher's Choice."
Additionally,  we distribute localized versions of these products in the rest of
the world. We also distributed  approximately 21 additional  titles developed by
other software publishers  ("Affiliated Labels") in North America and over 1,000
Affiliated Label titles in the rest of the world.  Since our inception,  we have
developed products for 38 different computer hardware  platforms,  including the
following:  IBM PC-CD and  compatibles,  16-bit Sega Genesis  video game system,
16-bit  Super  Nintendo  Entertainment  System,  PlayStation,  Nintendo  64  and
PlayStation II. Our fiscal 1999 product releases were for PC-CD, PlayStation and
Nintendo  N64  cartridge  products.  As of March 31,  1999,  we were  developing
products for five different hardware platforms.

         Our product  development  methods and organization are modeled on those
used in the entertainment  industry. We also market our products with techniques
borrowed from other entertainment  companies such as record producers,  magazine
publishers and video  distributors.  Our employees called  "producers",  who are
each  responsible for the  development of one or more products,  oversee product
development  and  direct  teams  comprised  of both our  employees  and  outside
contractors.  Our designers regularly work with celebrities and organizations in
sports,  entertainment  and other areas to develop  products that provide gaming
experiences  that are as realistic and interactive as possible.  Celebrities and
organizations  with  whom we have had  contracts  include:  FIFA,  NASCAR,  John
Madden,  the National  Basketball  Association,  the PGA TOUR,  Tiger Woods, the
National Hockey League, World Championship  Wrestling Inc., Football Association
Premier League,  Formula One, and Sammy Sosa. We maintain development studios in
California, Canada, United Kingdom, Florida, Texas, Japan, Washington,  Maryland
and Nevada.

         We  invest  in the  creation  of  state-of-the-art  software  tools and
utilities that are then used in product development.  These tools allow for more
cost-effective  product  development and the ability to more efficiently convert
products from one hardware platform to another. We have also made investments in
facilities and equipment to facilitate the creation and editing of digital forms
of video and audio recordings and product  development  efforts for new hardware
platforms.

         We distribute our products and those of our Affiliated Labels primarily
by direct sales to retail chains and outlets in the United States and Europe. In
Japan and the Asia Pacific  region,  we  distribute  products  both  directly to
retailers  and through third party  distributors.  Our products are available in
over 58,000 retail





locations worldwide. In fiscal 1999,  approximately 42% of our net revenues were
generated by international operations, compared to 43% in fiscal 1998 and 45% in
fiscal 1997.

Investments and Joint Ventures

         Acquisitions

         Westwood Studios

         In September  1998, we completed the  acquisition of Westwood  Studios,
Inc.  and  certain  assets  of  the  Irvine,   California-based  Virgin  Studios
(collectively  "Westwood") for  approximately  $122,688,000  in cash,  including
transaction  expenses.  The  transaction  was  accounted  for under the purchase
method.  Westwood has produced 13 titles in the past two years and is best known
for its successful PC-CD franchises,  Command and Conquer and Lands of Lore. See
note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  included in item
8 hereof.

         ABC Software

         In July 1998,  we acquired  ABC Software  AG, in  Switzerland,  and ABC
Software GmbH, in Austria  (collectively  "ABC"),  independent  distributors  of
entertainment,   edutainment  and  application   software,   for   approximately
$9,466,000  in cash (net of cash acquired of  $5,099,000)  and $570,000 in other
consideration. The transaction has been accounted for under the purchase method.
See note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated  Financial Statements,  included in
item 8 hereof.

         Joint Ventures

         In May 1998, Electronic Arts and Square Co., Ltd. ("Square"), a leading
developer  and  publisher  of  entertainment  software in Japan,  completed  the
formation  of two new joint  ventures,  in North  America  and  Japan.  In North
America,  the companies formed Square  Electronic Arts, LLC ("Square EA"), which
has  exclusive  publishing  rights  in  North  America  for  future  interactive
entertainment  PlayStation  titles  created  by  Square.  We own a 30%  minority
interest in this joint venture while Square owns 70%. Additionally,  we have the
exclusive right to distribute in North America products  published by this joint
venture.

         In Japan,  the  companies  established  Electronic  Arts Square KK ("EA
Square KK"),  which  localizes and publishes in Japan our properties  originally
created in North America and Europe, as well as develops and publishes  original
video games in Japan. We own a 70% majority interest, while Square owns 30%. See
note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  included in item
8 hereof.

         Investments

         We have made  investments as part of our overall strategy and currently
hold minority equity interests in several companies,  including NovaLogic, Inc.,
Firaxis Software, Inc., Kodiak Inc., Pixel Inc. and The 3DO Company ("3DO").

Market

         Historically,  no hardware  platform or system has  achieved  long-term
dominance  in  the  interactive  entertainment  market.   Accordingly,  we  have
developed products at one time or another for 38 different  hardware  platforms.
In fiscal 1999,  Sony's  PlayStation was the dominant  hardware  platform in our
industry. In





addition,  the installed base of  multimedia-enabled  home computers,  including
those with Internet  accessibility,  has continued to grow as Personal  Computer
("PC")  prices have  declined  and the  quality  and  choices of  software  have
increased dramatically.  We develop and publish products for multiple platforms,
and this diversification continues to be a cornerstone of our strategy.




         Sega launched  DreamcastTM in Japan in December 1998 and it is expected
to be released in North America in late calendar 1999.  Sega designed  Dreamcast
to combine features from the console and PC platforms.

         Sony is scheduled to launch  PlayStation  II in Japan in March 2000 and
the rest of the world starting in September 2000.  PlayStation II specifications
have been  announced  by Sony to be a 128-bit,  Digital  Versatile  Disk ("DVD")
based  system that is Internet and cable ready,  and  backward  compatible  with
PlayStation I software.

         Nintendo announced its plan for a next generation system to be released
in September 2000. Nintendo's new system will offer a DVD drive and have a modem
for Internet access.

         New  entrants  in  the   interactive   entertainment   and   multimedia
industries,  such as cable  television,  telephone  and  diversified  media  and
entertainment companies, and a proliferation of new technologies, such as online
networks and the Internet have increased the competition in the markets in which
we compete.  Our new product  releases in fiscal year 2000 will be primarily for
the IBM PC-CD and  compatibles,  PlayStation  and N64. We are also  scheduled to
release one or more online network gaming  products during fiscal 2000. See Risk
Factors - "New video game  platforms  create  additional  technical and business
model  uncertainties"  at page 25 and "The business  models and  technology  for
e-commerce and online gaming are unproven" at page 25.

         The early investment in products for the 32-bit market,  including both
Compact Disk personal computer  ("PC-CD") and CD-dedicated video game ("CD-video
game")  platforms,  has been  strategically  important in positioning us for the
current  generation  of  32-bit  and  64-bit  machines.  We  believe  that  such
investment   continues  to  be  important,   and  we  will  continue  aggressive
development  activities for 32-bit and 64-bit  platforms.  The  PlayStation  has
achieved significant market acceptance in all geographical territories, however,
as the PlayStation  console market matures,  we believe that its growth will not
continue at the present  rates.  In  addition,  our  revenues  and  earnings are
dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedule and our failure to
meet those  schedules  could result in revenues and earnings which fall short of
analysts'  expectations in any individual  quarter.  See Risk Factors - "Product
development  schedules are frequently  unreliable and make predicting  quarterly
results difficult" at page 25.





Competition

         See Risk Factors - "Our platform  licensors  are our chief  competitors
and frequently control the manufacturing of our video game products" at page 26.

Relationships with Significant Hardware Platform Companies

         Sony

         In fiscal 1999, approximately 43% of our net revenues were derived from
sales of software for the  PlayStation  compared to 42% in fiscal  1998.  During
fiscal 1999,  we released 21  PlayStation  games  compared to 25 in fiscal 1998.
Among these releases were FIFA 99, World Cup 98 and Madden NFL 99. The volume of
sales of PlayStation products significantly  increased in fiscal 1999 due to the
increase in the installed base of PlayStation consoles worldwide and the quality
and timely release of our key franchise titles. Although revenues from the sales
of  PlayStation  products in fiscal 2000 are expected to continue to grow, we do
not  expect  to  maintain  these  growth  rates.  See Risk  Factors  -  "Product
development  schedules are frequently  unreliable and make predicting  quarterly
results difficult" at page 25.

         Under  the  terms of a  licensing  agreement  entered  into  with  Sony
Computer  Entertainment  of  America  in July 1994 (the  "Sony  Agreement"),  as
amended,  we are authorized to develop and distribute CD-based software products
compatible with the PlayStation.  Pursuant to the Sony Agreement, we engage Sony
to supply its  PlayStation  CDs for  distribution  by us.  Accordingly,  we have
limited  ability to control our supply of  PlayStation CD products or the timing
of their  delivery.  See Risk Factors - "Our  platform  licensors  are our chief
competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of our video game products"
at page 26.

         Nintendo

         During fiscal 1999, we released nine new titles for the N64 compared to
two titles in fiscal 1998. In fiscal 1999, approximately 12% of our net revenues
were  derived  from the sale of N64  products  compared to 6% in 1998.  In March
1997, we signed a licensing  agreement  with Nintendo (the "N64  Agreement")  to
develop, publish and market certain sports and other products for the N64. We do
not expect significant growth in revenues for N64 products in fiscal 2000.

         Under the terms of the N64 Agreement, we engage Nintendo to manufacture
our N64 cartridges for distribution by us. Accordingly,  we have limited ability
to control  our supply of N64  cartridges  or the  timing of their  delivery.  A
shortage of  microchips  or other  factors  outside our control could impair our
ability to obtain an adequate supply of cartridges.

          In connection with our purchases of N64 cartridges for distribution in
North America,  Nintendo  requires us to provide  irrevocable  letters of credit
prior to Nintendo's acceptance of purchase orders from us for purchases of these
cartridges.  For  purchases  of N64  cartridges  for  distribution  in Japan and
Europe,  Nintendo  requires  us to make  cash  deposits.  Furthermore,  Nintendo
maintains a policy of not accepting returns of N64 cartridges.  Because of these
and  other  factors,   the  carrying  of  an  inventory  of  cartridges  entails
significant capital and risk. See Risk Factors - "Our platform licensors are our
chief  competitors and frequently  control the  manufacturing  of our video game
products" at page 26.





Products and Product Development

         In fiscal 1999,  we generated  approximately  65% of our revenues  from
products  released  during the year.  See Risk  Factors -  "Product  development
schedules  are  frequently  unreliable  and make  predicting  quarterly  results
difficult"  at page  25.  As of  March  31,  1999,  we were  actively  marketing
approximately  111 titles,  comprising  approximately  193 stock  keeping  units
("sku's"),  that were published by our  development  divisions and  subsidiaries
("EA  Studios").  During fiscal 1999, we introduced  over 39 EA Studios  titles,
representing over 59 sku's, compared to 44 EA Studios titles, comprising over 71
sku's, in fiscal 1998.

         The  products  published  by EA Studios are designed and created by our
in-house   designers  and  artists  and  by  independent   software   developers
("independent  artists").  We typically pay the  independent  artists  royalties
based  on  the  sales  of the  specific  products,  as  defined  in the  related
independent artist agreements.

         For fiscal 1999 and 1998, no title  represented  revenues  greater than
10% of the total fiscal 1999 and 1998 net revenues.  For fiscal 1997, we had one
title,  Madden  Football `97,  published on five  platforms,  which  represented
approximately 10% of the total fiscal 1997 net revenues.

         We publish  products in a number of categories  such as sports,  action
and interactive movies, strategy,  simulations, role playing and adventure, each
of which is becoming  increasingly  competitive.  Our  sports-related  products,
marketed under the EA Sports brand name, accounted for a significant  percentage
of net revenues in fiscal years 1999 and 1998. There can be no assurance that we
will be able to maintain our market share in the sports category.

         The front line retail  selling prices in North America of our products,
excluding  older  titles  (marketed as  "Classics"  and  "Publisher's  Choice"),
typically  range from  $35.00 to $55.00.  "Classics"  and  "Publisher's  Choice"
titles have retail selling  prices that range from $10.00 to $30.00.  The retail
selling  prices of EA titles outside of North America vary based on local market
conditions.

         We currently  develop or publish  products for five different  hardware
platforms and have,  from time to time,  developed  and marketed  products on 38
different and  incompatible  platforms in the past. In fiscal 1999,  our product
releases were predominantly for PC-CD, 32-bit and 64-bit video game systems. Our
planned product  introductions  for fiscal 2000 are predominantly for the PC-CD,
PlayStation,  N64 as well as for  online  Internet  play.  See  Risk  Factors  -
"Product  development  schedules are frequently  unreliable and make  predicting
quarterly  results  difficult" at page 25 and "New video game  platforms  create
additional technical and business model uncertainties" at page 25.

         As compact discs have emerged as the preferred  medium for  interactive
entertainment,  education, and information software, we continued our investment
in the  development  of  CD-ROM  tools and  technologies  in  fiscal  1999.  The
PlayStation  has  achieved  significant  market  acceptance  in  all  geographic
territories, however, as the PlayStation console market matures, we believe that
its growth will not continue at the present  rates.  Most of the  CD-video  game
products will be convertible for use on multiple advanced  hardware systems.  We
had  research and  development  expenditures  of $202.1  million in fiscal 1999,
$146.2  million in fiscal  1998,  and $130.8  million in fiscal  1997.  See Risk
Factors - "Product  development  schedules are  frequently  unreliable  and make
predicting quarterly results difficult" at page 25.





Marketing and Distribution

         We  distribute  both EA Studio  products  and  products  developed  and
published by other software publishers known as "Affiliated Labels."

         In  most  cases,  Affiliated  Label  products  are  delivered  to us as
completed  products.  As of March 31, 1999, we distributed  21 Affiliated  Label
titles in North  America and over 1,000  Affiliated  Label titles in the rest of
the world. No single  Affiliated Label Publisher has accounted for more than 10%
of our net revenue in any of the last three fiscal years.

         In May 1998,  Electronic  Arts and Square Co., Ltd.  formed a new joint
venture in North America,  creating Square Electronic Arts, LLC ("Square EA") as
discussed  in note 11 in the  Notes to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,
included  in Item 8 hereof.  In  conjunction  with the  formation  of this joint
venture,  we will  have  the  exclusive  right in North  America  to  distribute
products  published by this joint venture.  In fiscal 1999,  Square EA published
Parasite  Eve  for  the  PlayStation,  which  was a top ten  selling  title  for
Electronic Arts and expects to release Final Fantasy 8 in fiscal 2000.

         In February  1998, we announced  that we entered into an  international
co-publishing  agreement  with  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer  ("MGM") to be the exclusive
distributor of MGM Interactive  titles in all territories  except North America.
Under this agreement,  we will distribute such titles as Tomorrow Never Dies.

         We generated  approximately 90% of our North American net revenues from
direct sales to retailers  through a field sales  organization of  professionals
and a group of telephone sales  representatives.  The remaining 10% of our North
American sales were made through a limited  number of  specialized  and regional
distributors and rack jobbers in markets where we believe direct sales would not
be  economical.  For the fiscal year ended March 31,  1999,  we had sales to one
customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., which represented 12% of total net revenues. We
had no sales to any one  customer in excess of 10% of total net revenues for the
fiscal years ended March 31, 1998 and 1997.

         We are using the  Internet to market our  products,  build brand equity
and increase our understanding of our customers'  expectations.  We have various
EA websites  offering game tips, user bulletin  boards and matching  service for
head to head competition and tournaments.

         The  video  game and PC  businesses  have  become  increasingly  "hits"
driven,   requiring   significantly   greater  expenditures  for  marketing  and
advertising,  particularly for television advertising. There can be no assurance
that we will  continue to produce  "hit"  titles,  or that  advertising  for any
product will increase sales sufficiently to recoup those advertising expenses.

         We have  stock-balancing  programs for our personal  computer  products
that, under certain  circumstances and up to a specified  amount,  allow for the
exchange of personal computer  products by resellers.  We also typically provide
for price  protection for our personal  computer and video game system  products
that,  under certain  conditions,  allows the reseller a price reduction from us
for unsold  products.  We  maintain a policy of  exchanging  products  or giving
credits, but do not give cash refunds. Moreover, the risk of product returns may
increase as new hardware  platforms  become more popular or market factors force
us to make changes in our distribution  system. We monitor and manage the volume
of our sales to retailers and distributors and their  inventories as substantial
overstocking  in the  distribution  channel  can  result in high  returns or the
requirement for substantial price protection in subsequent  periods.  We believe
that we provide  adequate  reserves for returns and price  protection  which are
based on estimated future returns of products,  taking into account  promotional





activities,  the timing of new product  introductions,  distributor and retailer
inventories  of our products and other  factors,  and that our current  reserves
will be sufficient to meet return and price protection  requirements for current
in-channel inventory.  However, there can be no assurance that actual returns or
price protection will not exceed our reserves.

         We also  have a  fulfillment  group  that  sells  product  directly  to
consumers  through  a  toll-free  number  and  through  our  websites  listed in
advertising by us and our Affiliated Labels.  This group is also responsible for
targeted  direct mail  marketing and sells product  backups and  accessories  to
registered customers.

         The distribution  channels through which consumer software products are
sold have been characterized by change,  including  consolidations and financial
difficulties  of certain  distributors  and  retailers  and the emergence of new
retailers  such as general mass  merchandisers.  The  development  of remote and
electronic delivery systems will create further changes. The bankruptcy or other
business  difficulties  of a distributor  or retailer  could render our accounts
receivable from such entity uncollectible, which could have an adverse effect on
our operating results and financial condition. In addition, an increasing number
of companies are competing for access to these channels.  Our arrangements  with
our  distributors  and  retailers  may be terminated by either party at any time
without cause. Distributors and retailers often carry products that compete with
ours.  Retailers of our products  typically have a limited amount of shelf space
and promotional  resources for which there is intense competition.  There can be
no assurance  that  distributors  and  retailers  will  continue to purchase our
products  or  provide  our  products  with  adequate  levels of shelf  space and
promotional support.

International Operations

         We have  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  throughout  the world,  including
offices in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Germany, Australia,  Canada, South
Africa,  Singapore,  Sweden, Japan, Malaysia, Brazil and Holland. The amounts of
net revenues,  operating profit and identifiable  assets attributable to each of
our geographic  regions for each of the last three fiscal years are set forth in
Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8
hereof.  International net revenues increased by 33% to $516,865,000,  or 42% of
consolidated  fiscal  1999 net  revenues,  compared to  $389,429,000,  or 43% of
consolidated  fiscal 1998 net  revenues.  Europe's  net  revenues  increased  by
$117,999,000  primarily  due to an  increase  in  sales  of  PlayStation  and AL
products.  Japan's net revenues  increased by  $11,371,000  primarily due to the
sales of FIFA:  Road to World Cup 98. Asia  Pacific net  revenues  decreased  by
$1,934,000  due to the weaknesses in Asian  currencies.  In local  currency,  in
spite of weak economies, net revenues for Asia Pacific increased compared to the
prior year.

         Though  international  revenues  are  expected to grow in fiscal  2000,
international  revenues  may not grow at as high a rate as in prior  years.  See
Risk Factors - "Our business,  our products, and our distribution are subject to
increasing  regulation  in key  territories"  at page 25 and "Foreign  Sales and
Currency Fluctuations" at page 26.

Manufacturing

         In  many   instances,   we  are  able  to   acquire   materials   on  a
volume-discount  basis.  We have multiple  potential  sources of supply for most
materials. Except with respect to our PlayStation and N64 products, we also have
alternate  sources for the manufacture and assembly of most of our products.  To
date, we have not experienced any material  difficulties or delays in production
of our software and related documentation and packaging.  However, a shortage of
components  or other  factors  beyond our  control  could  impair our ability to
manufacture,  or have  manufactured,  our  products.  See  Risk  Factors  - "Our
platform  licensors  are  our  chief  competitors  and  frequently  control  the
manufacturing of our video game products" at page 26.





Backlog

         We normally ship products  within a few days after receipt of an order.
However,  a backlog may occur for EA Studio and  Affiliated  Label products that
have been announced for release but not yet shipped.  We do not consider backlog
to be an indicator of future performance.

Seasonality

         Our business is highly  seasonal.  We typically  experience our highest
revenues and profits in the calendar  year-end holiday season and a seasonal low
in revenues  and profits in the quarter  ending in June.  In the June quarter of
our fiscal year 2000, we expect these seasonal trends to be magnified due to the
lack of significant  product releases during the quarter.  Additionally,  we had
exceptional  results for the same period in fiscal 1999 due to the  shipment and
success of World Cup 98.

Employees

         As of March 31, 1999, we employed  approximately  2,500 people, of whom
over 1,200  were  outside  the United  States.  We believe  that our  ability to
attract and retain qualified  employees is an important factor in our growth and
development  and that our future success will depend,  in large measure,  on our
ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees.  To date, we have
been  successful in recruiting  and  retaining  sufficient  numbers of qualified
personnel  to conduct our  business  successfully.  See Risk  Factors - "We face
intense  competition for talent from highly valued  Internet  companies" at page
26.





ITEM 2:  PROPERTIES

         Our  principal  administrative,   sales  and  marketing,  research  and
development,  and support facility is located in two modern buildings in Redwood
City, California,  20 miles south of San Francisco.  We moved into this facility
in October  1998.  We presently  occupy  approximately  350,000 sq. ft. in these
buildings under an operating lease for the buildings and certain  adjoining land
that will expire on December 1, 2001. Monthly lease payments vary based upon the
London  InterBank  Offered Rate. We have the option to purchase the property for
the  unamortized  financed  balance at any time after the  non-cancelable  lease
term, or we may terminate the lease at any time after the non-cancelable term by
arranging a third party sale or by making a termination  payment. In April 1999,
we exercised our option to purchase a parcel of land under the lease and sold it
to a third party.  The proceeds will  mitigate a portion of the occupancy  costs
for this facility.  Should we elect to terminate the lease,  we will guarantee a
residual value of up to 85% of the unamortized value of the property. As part of
the agreement, we must also comply with certain financial covenants.

         Our North American distribution is supported by a 54,000 sq. ft. leased
facility used as an office and warehouse in Hayward,  California,  and an 84,000
sq. ft.  warehouse  facility in Louisville,  Kentucky.  Effective April 1999, we
entered into a lease agreement that increases the Kentucky warehouse  facility's
square  footage  to  250,000  sq.  ft.  We  also  occupy  sales  offices  in the
metropolitan areas of Toronto, Chicago, Dallas and New York.

         In addition to our Redwood City  development  studio,  we own a 206,000
sq. ft.  development  facility in Burnaby,  British Columbia,  Canada and rent a
33,000 sq. ft.  facility in Seattle,  Washington.  The move to the new  Canadian
offices was  completed in June 1999.  We also own a 180,000 sq. ft.  development
facility  in Austin,  Texas and lease a 42,400 sq. ft.  development  facility in
Walnut Creek, California.

         Our  United  Kingdom  subsidiary  occupies   administrative  and  sales
facilities in Langley,  England, under a lease for a total of 44,000 sq. ft. and
a 22,000 sq. ft.  development  facility in Surrey,  England.  In Europe, we also
lease a distribution hub in Heerlen,  Holland and two  administrative  and sales
facilities in Germany, as well as sales and distribution  facilities in: Madrid,
Spain; Lyon, France;  Johannesberg,  South Africa; Neudorf,  Austria and Zurich,
Switzerland. Additionally, we have sales offices throughout Europe.

         In Asia and the South  Pacific,  we maintain a 5,500 sq. ft.  sales and
distribution   facility  in  Brisbane,   Australia.   We  also  have  sales  and
distribution  facilities in Singapore,  Malaysia and Taiwan,  and representative
offices in Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai, China. We also maintain a 27,000 sq.
ft. sales and development office in Tokyo, Japan. See Notes 3 and 9 of the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof.

         We believe that these facilities are adequate for our current needs. We
believe that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed
to accommodate our future needs.





ITEM 3:  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         We are  subject to pending  claims and  litigation.  Management,  after
review and  consultation  with counsel,  considers  that any liability  from the
disposition of such lawsuits  would not have a material  adverse effect upon our
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.


ITEM 4: SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

         There were no matters  submitted to a vote of security  holders  during
the quarter ended March 31, 1999.

ITEM 6:  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA







ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

The following  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations",  contains  forward looking  statements  regarding future
events or our  future  financial  performance  that  involve  certain  risks and
uncertainties  including  those discussed in "Risk Factors" at pages 25 to 26 of
this Annual  Report on Form 10-K.  Actual  events or actual  future  results may
differ  materially  from any forward  looking  statements  due to such risks and
uncertainties.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Comparison of Fiscal 1999 to 1998

                                 1999                  1998             % change
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Net revenues                $1,221,863,000        $  908,852,000           34.4
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We derive revenues  primarily from shipments of  entertainment  software,  which
includes EA Studio CD products for  dedicated  entertainment  systems ("CD-video
games"), EA Studio CD personal computer products ("PC-CD"),  EA Studio cartridge
products  and  Affiliated  Label  ("AL")  products  that are  published by third
parties and  distributed  by us. We also derive  revenues  from  licensing of EA
Studio products and AL products through hardware  companies  ("OEMs") and online
subscription revenues.

Our total net  revenues  increased  compared to the prior year due to  increased
sales of products on PlayStation , Nintendo N64 , PC-CD and increased  worldwide
distribution of AL products. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in
sales of Sega Saturn(R) products and 16-bit video game products.

Sales of PlayStation  products in fiscal 1999 increased to $519,830,000,  or 43%
of total revenue,  compared to  $380,299,000,  or 42% of total revenue in fiscal
1998.  We released 21 new  PlayStation  titles in fiscal 1999  compared to 25 in
fiscal 1998.  The increase in sales was  attributable  to the greater  installed
base of  PlayStation  game  consoles  and the  releases  of key  titles for this
platform  including FIFA 99, World Cup 98 and Madden NFL 99. We expect  revenues
from  PlayStation  products to continue to grow in fiscal 2000,  but as revenues
for these products increase, we do not expect to maintain these growth rates.

Net revenues  derived from other 32-bit  products,  primarily  for Saturn,  were
$749,000 in fiscal 1999 compared to  $17,507,000  in fiscal 1998. We released no
new Saturn  titles in fiscal 1999  compared to eight in fiscal  1998.  We do not
expect to release  any new Saturn  titles in fiscal 2000 and  revenues  from the
sales of Saturn products are not expected to be significant in future years.

Net  revenues  from PC-CD  products  increased to  $270,793,000  in fiscal 1999,
representing 22% of total net revenues,  from $231,034,000,  or 25% of total net
revenues in fiscal 1998.  We released 29 PC-CD titles in fiscal 1999 compared to
30 PC-CD  titles  in  fiscal  1998.  The  worldwide  increase  in sales of PC-CD
products was primarily  attributable to an increase in sales in Europe and North
America due to the related  releases of key titles for this  platform  including
Sim City 3000.

Net revenues derived from N64 video game cartridge  products were  $152,349,000,
or 12% of total net revenues,  compared to  $56,677,000,  or 6%, in fiscal 1998.
The increase in N64 revenues was primarily  due to more title  releases for this
platform  compared to last year and a larger N64 market. We released nine titles
in fiscal 1999, including NASCAR 99,compared to two titles in fiscal 1998. We do
not expect significant growth in revenues for N64 products in fiscal 2000.

Net  revenues  from  shipments  of AL  products  in  fiscal  1999  increased  to
$248,105,000, or 20% of total revenue, compared to $185,865,000, or 20% of total
revenue in fiscal  1998.  The increase was due to higher sales of AL products in
North  America and Europe.  This  increase  was  primarily  attributable  to the
distribution  of  products  published  by  Square  EA in North  America  and the
acquisition of ABC Software in Switzerland.  We expect revenues from AL products
to continue to grow in fiscal 2000, but as revenues for these products increase,
we do not expect to maintain these growth rates.

Net  revenues  generated  by 16-bit  video game  cartridge-based  products  were
$635,000 in fiscal  1999,  compared  to  $17,314,000,  or 2% of net  revenues in
fiscal  1998.  As the 16-bit  video game market has been  replaced by 32-bit and
64-bit  systems,  we did not  release any new titles in fiscal  1999.  We do not
expect to release any new titles in fiscal 2000 and  revenues  from the sales of
16-bit products are not expected to be significant.

Licensing of EA Studio products generated  $17,788,000 in fiscal 1999,  compared
to  $15,431,000  in fiscal 1998.  The increase  was  primarily  the result of an
increase in the revenues generated by the licensing of our products in Europe.

North America net revenues  increased by 36% to  $704,998,000  in fiscal 1999 as
compared to $519,423,000 in fiscal 1998. The increase was mainly attributable to
strong growth in N64 and PlayStation  systems, the distribution of AL titles and
growth in PC-CD sales. Net revenues from PlayStation and N64 revenues  increased
$148,181,000  due to a larger  market  and  greater  installed  base  for  these
platforms  as well as more title  releases  for N64 in  comparison  to the prior
year. North America AL sales increased by




$39,813,000,  compared to the prior year  primarily due to the  distribution  of
products  published by Square EA. PC-CD revenues increased by $13,439,000 due to
key title releases during the year.

International  net  revenues  increased  by  33%  to  $516,865,000,  or  42%  of
consolidated fiscal 1999 net revenues,  compared to $389,429,000,  or 43% of the
fiscal 1998 total. Europe's net revenues increased by $117,999,000 primarily due
to an increase in sales of  PlayStation  and AL  products.  Japan's net revenues
increased by $11,371,000  primarily due to the sales of FIFA:  Road to World Cup
98. Asia Pacific net revenues  decreased  by  $1,934,000  due to the weakness in
Asian currencies.  In local currency,  in spite of weak economies,  net revenues
for Asia Pacific increased compared to the prior year.

The  increase in marketing  and sales  expenses was  primarily  attributable  to
increased print, Internet and television advertising to support new releases and
increased  cooperative  advertising  associated  with  higher  revenues in North
America and Europe as compared to the prior year.  Increases  in  marketing  and
sales  expenses were also due to additional  headcount  related to the continued
expansion of our worldwide  distribution  business and the  acquisitions  of ABC
Software and Westwood Studios.

The  increase in general and  administrative  expenses was  primarily  due to an
increase in headcount and  occupancy  costs to support the increase in growth in
North  America  and Europe  operations,  including  the  opening  of  additional
international offices in Europe and the acquisition of ABC Software.

The  increase  in  research  and  development  expenses  was  due to  additional
headcount-related  expenses attributable to the acquisition of Westwood Studios,
Inc.  and  certain  assets  of  the  Irvine,   California-based   Virgin  Studio
(collectively  "Westwood") in September 1998 and Tiburon Entertainment,  Inc. in
April 1998,  higher  development costs per title, as products are including more
content and are more complex and time  consuming to develop,  and an increase in
development costs for Ultima Online.

We released a total of 59 new  products in fiscal 1999  compared to 71 in fiscal
1998.

Amortization  of intangibles  results from the  acquisitions of Westwood and ABC
Software in the second quarter of fiscal 1999.

In connection  with the purchase of Westwood in September 1998, we allocated and
expensed  $41,836,000 of the $122,688,000  purchase price to in-process research
and development  projects.  This allocation  represents the estimated fair value
based on  risk-adjusted  cash  flows  related  to the  incomplete  research  and
development projects. At the date of acquisition,  this amount was expensed as a
non-recurring   charge  as  the  in-process   technology  had  not  yet  reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses. Westwood had three
major PC-CD projects in progress at the time of the acquisition including two in
the  best-selling  franchise  Command  and  Conquer  and  one in the  critically
acclaimed Lands of Lore series.  As of the acquisition  date,  costs to complete
the Westwood projects acquired were expected to be approximately $9.1 million in
fiscal 1999,  $10.6  million in fiscal 2000 and $1.0 million in fiscal 2001.  We
believe there have been no  significant  changes to these  estimates as of March
31, 1999. We currently  expect to complete the  development of these projects at
various dates





through fiscal 2001 and to publish the products upon completion.

The nature of the efforts required to develop the acquired in-process technology
into commercially  viable products  principally  relate to the completion of all
planning,  designing  and testing  activities  necessary to  establish  that the
product  can be produced to meet our design  requirements  including  functions,
features and technical performance requirements. Though we currently expect that
the acquired in-process technology will be successfully developed,  there can be
no assurance  that  commercial or technical  viability of these products will be
achieved.   Furthermore,  future  developments  in  the  entertainment  software
industry, changes in computer or video game console technology, changes in other
product  offerings or other  developments may cause us to alter or abandon these
plans.

The  value  assigned  to  purchased  in-process  technology  was  determined  by
estimating the completion  percentage of research and development efforts at the
acquisition date,  forecasting risk adjusted revenues considering the completion
percentage,  estimating  the  resulting  net cash  flows from the  projects  and
discounting  the  net  cash  flows  to  their  present  values.  The  completion
percentages  were  estimated  based on cost incurred to date,  importance of the
completed  development  tasks and the elapsed portion of the total project time.
The revenue projection used to value the in-process  research and development is
based on unit sales  forecasts for worldwide  sales  territories and adjusted to
consider only the revenue related to development  achievements  completed at the
acquisition  date. Net cash flow estimates include cost of goods sold and sales,
marketing and general and administrative  expenses and taxes forecasted based on
historical operating characteristics.  In addition, net cash flow estimates were
adjusted to allow for fair return on working  capital and fixed assets,  charges
for  franchise  and  technology   leverage  and  return  on  other  intangibles.
Appropriate risk adjusted  discount rates ranging from 20% to 22.5% were used to
discount  the net  cash  flows  back  to  their  present  value.  The  remaining
identified  intangibles  will be amortized on a straight-line  basis over two to
twelve years based on expected  useful lives of franchise  tradenames,  existing
products and technologies,  retention of workforce, and other intangible assets.
If these projects are not successfully  developed,  we may not realize the value
assigned to the in-process research and development projects.  In addition,  the
value of other acquired intangible assets may also become impaired.

In conjunction with the merger of Westwood, we accrued approximately  $1,500,000
related to direct  transaction  costs and other related  accruals.  At March 31,
1999, there were $725,000 in accruals remaining related to these items.

Additionally,   for  fiscal  1999,  the  charge  for  in-process   research  and
development  also  included   write-offs  of  $2,279,000   associated  with  the
acquisition of two software development companies in the first quarter.

For fiscal 1998,  we incurred a charge of  $1,500,000  for  acquired  in-process
technology  in  connection  with the  acquisition  of the remaining 35% minority
ownership interest in Electronic Arts Victor, Inc. in December 1997. This charge
was made after we concluded  that the  in-process  technology had no alternative
future  use after  taking  into  consideration  the  potential  for usage of the
software in different products and resale of the software.

On July 25,  1997,  we  completed  a  merger  with  Maxis,  Inc.  ("Maxis").  In
conjunction  with the merger,  we recorded costs of  $10,792,000  which included
direct  transaction fees and costs associated with integrating the operations of
the two companies.  At March 31, 1999, there were no accruals  remaining related
to these merger costs.

Operating  income  increased due to higher net revenues and related gross profit
partially  offset by  increased  operating  expenses  including  the charges for

partially  offset by  merger  costs of  $10,792,000  and a charge  for  acquired

The decrease in interest and other income,  net, was primarily  attributable  to
the sale of our 50%  ownership  interest  in Creative  Wonders,  LLC in December
1997. The sale resulted in a gain in the prior year of $12,625,000.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 1999 was  negatively  affected as there was no
tax  benefit  recorded  for a portion of the  charges  related  to the  acquired
in-process technology.  Excluding the effect of these charges, the effective tax
rate for the  current  fiscal  year would have been 32.0% as compared to a 33.0%
tax rate in the  corresponding  prior  year  periods.  The  lower  rate of 32.0%
results  primarily  from a higher portion of  international  income subject to a
lower foreign tax rate as





compared  to  the  prior  year  and an  increase  in the  federal  research  and
experimental credit.

interest for fiscal 1999  represents  Square's 30% interest in the net income of
EA Square KK.

For  fiscal  1998,  the  minority  interest  represented  the  35%  interest  in
Electronic Arts Victor, Inc. ("EAV") owned by Victor  Entertainment  Industries,
Inc. ("VEI").  We acquired the remaining 35% minority  ownership interest in EAV
held by VEI in December 1997.

Reported net income was flat due to the one-time charges related to acquisitions
offsetting  significantly  higher operating income.  The increase in net income,
excluding one-time charges, was due to higher revenues and gross profits, offset
by higher  operating  expenses.  For fiscal 1998, net income included a one-time
gain on sale of Creative Wonders, LLC in the amount of $8,459,000, net of taxes,
offset by Maxis merger costs and a charge for acquired  in-process  developments
of  $8,236,000,  net of taxes.  For fiscal 1999,  net income  included  one-time
charges  for  acquired  in-process  technology  of  $37,506,000,  net of  taxes.
Excluding  one-time items in both years, as noted above, net income increased to
$110,378,000 from $72,339,000, or 53% over the prior year.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Our total net  revenues  increased  compared to the prior year due to  increased
sales of PlayStation products,  increased worldwide distribution of AL products,
sales of N64 video game  cartridge  products and sales of PC-CD  products.  This
increase  was  partially  offset by a  decrease  in sales of 16-bit  video  game
cartridges and License/OEM revenues.

Net revenues from 32-bit CD-video game products,  primarily for the PlayStation,
were  $397,806,000  in fiscal 1998,  representing  44% of the total net revenues
compared  to  $225,875,000,  or 34% of total net  revenues in fiscal  1997.  The
increase in sales of 32-bit video game products was  attributable to the greater
installed base of PlayStation  game consoles and related  releases of key titles
for this platform  during the year offset by a decline in revenues from sales of
products for Saturn.

Sales of PlayStation  products in fiscal 1998 increased to $380,299,000,  or 42%
of total revenue,  compared to  $187,531,000,  or 28% of total revenue in fiscal
1997.  We released 25 new  PlayStation  titles in fiscal 1998  compared to 14 in
fiscal 1997.

Net revenues  derived from the sales of other 32-bit  products,  primarily  from
Saturn,  were $17,507,000 in fiscal 1998 compared to $38,344,000 in fiscal 1997.
As the  installed  base of Saturn  consoles  did not achieve the growth rates of
PlayStation  consoles,  our revenues from sales of Saturn products declined.  We
released eight new Saturn titles in fiscal 1998 compared to 12 in fiscal 1997.

Net  revenues  from  shipments  of AL  products  in  fiscal  1998  increased  to
$185,865,000,  or 20% of total revenue, compared to $96,696,000, or 14% of total
revenue in fiscal 1997.  This increase was due to higher sales of AL products in
North America,  Europe and Asia Pacific.  This increase was  attributable to the
product  releases  under  a  worldwide  exclusive  distribution  agreement  with
DreamWorks  Interactive,  including The Lost World:  Jurassic  Park,  and due to
continued distribution of products from Accolade, Inc. which began in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1997. AL revenues also  increased as a result of our exclusive
distribution  agreement with Twentieth  Century Fox Home  Entertainment  outside
North America.

Net revenues derived from N64 video game cartridge products were $56,677,000, or
6% of total net revenues,  compared to  $17,804,000  in fiscal 1997. We released
two titles in fiscal 1998 compared to one title in fiscal 1997.

Net  revenues  from PC-CD  products  increased to  $231,034,000  in fiscal 1998,
representing 25% of total net revenues,  from $216,338,000,  or 32% of total net
revenues in fiscal 1997.  We released 30 PC-CD titles in fiscal 1998 compared to
32 PC-CD  titles in fiscal  1997.  The  increase in sales of PC-CD  products was
attributable  to the worldwide  growth in the PC market and the expansion of our
direct distribution worldwide.  PC-CD sales growth for fiscal 1998 was partially
offset by a decline in titles  published  by Maxis.  Maxis'  PC-CD  revenues for
fiscal 1998 decreased by $17,010,000 or 45% compared to fiscal 1997.

Net  revenues  generated  by 16-bit  video game  cartridge-based  products  were
$17,314,000, or 2% of total revenues in fiscal





1998, compared to $89,160,000, or 13% of net revenues in fiscal 1997.

Licensing of EA Studio products generated  $15,431,000 in fiscal 1998,  compared
to  $26,749,000  in fiscal  1997.  The decrease  was  primarily  the result of a
decrease in the revenues  generated  by the  licensing of our products in Europe
and Japan.

North America net revenues  increased by 39% to  $519,423,000  in fiscal 1998 as
compared to $372,616,000 in fiscal 1997. The increase was mainly attributable to
strong  growth in  PlayStation  and N64  systems as well as AL product  revenues
partially  offset by the decline in 16-bit  cartridge and Saturn  product sales.
Net revenues from  PlayStation  and N64 products  increased  $172,496,000  while
sales  of  16-bit  cartridge  and  Saturn  products  decreased   $62,671,000  in
comparison  to the prior year.  North  America AL sales  increased  $34,355,000,
compared to the prior year.

International  net  revenues  increased  by  30%  to  $389,429,000,  or  43%  of
consolidated fiscal 1998 net revenues,  compared to $300,412,000,  or 45% of the
fiscal 1997 total.  The  increase in  international  revenues  was due to higher
worldwide sales of PlayStation products and increased sales of PC-CD, N64 and AL
products in Europe and Asia Pacific.  This was partially offset by a decrease in
32-bit  product  sales in  Japan,  international  16-bit  video  game  cartridge
revenues and licensing of our products.

on CD-video game and PC-CD titles as well as higher  manufacturing  royalties on
CD-video game titles.

increased television and print advertising to support new releases and increased

year.  Increases in marketing  and sales  expenses  were also due to  additional
headcount  related to the  continued  expansion  of our  worldwide  distribution
business.

The  increase in general and  administrative  expenses was  primarily  due to an
increase  in  payroll  and  occupancy  costs due to the  opening  of  additional
international offices and additional depreciation related to the installation of
new management information systems worldwide. This increase was partially offset
by lower spending in Japan.

The  increase  in  marketing  and sales as well as  general  and  administrative
expenses were partially  offset by savings  attributable  to the  integration of
Maxis in the second quarter of fiscal 1998.

The  increase  in  research  and  development  expenses  was  due to  additional
headcount related expenses in North America and Europe attributable to increased
in-house development capacity, higher development costs per title and additional
depreciation of computer equipment.

We released a total of 71 new  products in fiscal 1998  compared to 68 in fiscal
1997.

In connection  with the  acquisition  of the  remaining  35% minority  ownership
interest  in EAV in  December  1997,  we  incurred  a charge of  $1,500,000  for
acquired in-process technology. This charge was made after we concluded that the
in-process   technology  had  no  alternative   future  use  after  taking  into
consideration the potential for usage of the software in different  products and
resale of the software.

On July 25, 1997,  we  completed a merger with Maxis.  In  conjunction  with the
merger, we recorded costs of $10,792,000 which included direct  transaction fees
and costs associated with integrating the operations of the two companies.

Operating  income  increased due to higher net revenues and related gross profit

acquired  in-process   technology  as  well  as  merger  costs  related  to  the
acquisition of Maxis.

The  increase  in other  income  is  primarily  due to  higher  interest  income
attributable  to higher cash  balances as compared to the previous  year and the
sale of our 50% ownership  interest in Creative  Wonders,  LLC in December 1997.
The sale of Creative  Wonders  resulted in a gain of $12,625,000.  This increase
was  partially  offset by lower gains on sales of  marketable  securities in the
amount of $4,098,000 compared to $8,393,000 in the prior year.

Our effective tax rate was lower for the year as a result of a higher proportion
of  international  income subject to a lower foreign tax rate as compared to the
prior year and the  reinstatement  of the federal  research and  development tax
credit for the full fiscal year 1998.

As discussed above, we acquired the remaining minority ownership interest in EAV
in December 1997. Prior to the acquisition,  EAV was sixty-five percent owned by
us and  thirty-five  percent  owned  by VEI.  Minority  interest  for  the  year
reflected  only a portion  of  reported  losses for EAV as the net equity of EAV
fell below zero in the first quarter of fiscal 1998.

The increase in net income was due to the growth in revenues  and gross  margins
offset by higher operating expenses.  The impact of the gain on sale of Creative
Wonders,  LLC was offset by the charge for acquired  in-process  technology  and
merger costs.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of  March  31,  1999,  our  working  capital  was  $333,256,000  compared  to
$408,098,000  at  March  31,  1998.   Cash,  cash   equivalents  and  short-term
investments decreased by approximately  $61,738,000 in fiscal 1999. We generated
$150,768,000  of cash from  operations in fiscal 1999. In addition,  $30,577,000
was provided through the sale of equity securities under our stock plans.

Reserves for bad debts and sales returns increased from $51,575,000 at March 31,
1998 to $72,850,000 at March 31, 1999. Reserves have been charged for returns of
product and price protection  credits issued for products sold in prior periods.
Management  believes these reserves are adequate based on historical  experience
and its current estimate of potential returns and allowances.

   During fiscal 1999, we invested  $122,688,000  in cash for the acquisition of
Westwood  Studios,  Inc.,  $9,466,000  for  the  acquisition  of  ABC  Software,
approximately   $7,800,000  for  investment  in  affiliates  and   approximately
$8,000,000  in  long-term  licenses.  In  addition,  we  invested  approximately
$78,800,000  for new facilities in Europe and Canada and $17,800,000 in computer
equipment  worldwide.  In addition,  we repurchased 222,500 shares of our common
stock for approximately $9,001,000.

   Our principal  source of liquidity is $312,822,000 in cash, cash  equivalents
and  short-term  investments.   Management  believes  the  existing  cash,  cash
equivalents,  short-term  investments,  marketable securities and cash generated
from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and investment  requirements for
the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.

YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE

Background of Year 2000 Issues

   Many currently installed computer systems and software products are unable to
distinguish  between  twentieth  century  dates and  twenty-first  century dates
because such systems may have been  developed  using two digits rather than four
to determine  the  applicable  year.  For example,  computer  programs that have
date-sensitive  software may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather
than  the  year  2000.   This  error   could   result  in  system   failures  or
miscalculations  causing  disruptions  of  operations,  including,  among  other
things, a temporary inability to process  transactions,  send invoices or engage
in similar normal business activities. As a result, many companies' software and
computer  systems  may need to be upgraded or replaced to comply with such "Year
2000" requirements.

State of Readiness

   Our  business is dependent  on the  operation of numerous  systems that could
potentially be impacted by Year 2000 related  problems.  Those systems  include,
among  others:  hardware  and software  systems used to deliver  products to our
customers;  communications  networks such as the Internet and private intranets,
which we depend on to  receive  orders  for  products  from our  customers;  the
internal systems of our customers and suppliers; products sold to customers; the
hardware and software systems used internally in the management of our business;
and  non-information  technology  systems and services used in the management of
our business, such as power, telephone systems and building systems.

   Based on an  analysis  of the  systems  potentially  impacted  by  conducting
business  in the  twenty-first  century,  we are  applying a phased  approach to
making such systems, and accordingly,  our operations,  ready for the year 2000.
Beyond  awareness  of the issues and scope of  systems  involved,  the phases of
activities in progress include:  an assessment of specific  underlying  computer
systems, programs and hardware; renovation,  replacement or redeployment of Year
2000  non-compliant  technology;   validation  and  testing  of  technologically
compliant Year 2000  solutions;  and  implementation  of the Year 2000 compliant
systems.

   As a  third  party  providing  software  products,  we are  dependent  on the
hardware and software  products used to deliver such  products and services.  If
such products are  inoperable due to Year 2000 issues,  our business,  financial
condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. An inventory of
our  internal  business  systems has been  completed  and planned  software  and
hardware upgrades to ensure Year 2000 compliance are in process. The upgrades to
these systems are expected to be completed by June, 1999.

Costs

   To date we have not incurred  significant costs directly related to Year 2000
issues,  even in cases where non-compliant  information  technology systems were
redeployed or replaced.

   We  believe  that  future   expenditures  to  upgrade  internal  systems  and
applications will not have a material adverse effect on our business,  financial
condition  and  results of  operations  and are  primarily  included  within our
ongoing  system  development  plan. In addition,  while the  potential  costs of
redeploying  personnel and of any delays in implementing  other projects are not
known, the costs are anticipated to be immaterial.





Risks of the Year 2000 Issues

     Our financial  information  systems include an integrated suite of business
applications  developed and supported by Oracle Corporation.  These applications
systems are in place and currently support daily operations in the United States
and in Europe.  Based on representations made by Oracle Corporation and upon our
limited tests, we believe these systems to be Year 2000 compliant.

     We believe our software products are Year 2000 compliant;  however, success
of our Year 2000  compliance  efforts may depend on the success of our customers
dealing with their Year 2000 issues. Customer difficulties with Year 2000 issues
might require us to devote additional  resources to resolve underlying problems.
Failures of our and/or third  parties'  computer  systems  could have a material
adverse impact on our ability to conduct  business.  For example,  a significant
percentage of purchase orders received from our customers are computer generated
and  electronically  transmitted.  In  addition,  the Year 2000 could affect the
ability of consumers to use our PC based  products.  If the computer  systems on
which  the  consumers  use  our  products  are not  Year  2000  compliant,  such
noncompliance could affect the consumers' ability to use such products.

Contingency Plans

     We continue to assess  certain of our Year 2000 exposure  areas in order to
determine what additional  steps beyond those  identified by our internal review
in the United States are  advisable.  We are currently  developing a contingency
plan for handling Year 2000  problems that are not detected and corrected  prior
to their occurrence.  We expect this plan will be completed by June 30, 1999. We
believe that the systems,  which  represent the principal  exposures,  have been
identified, and to the extent necessary, are in the process of being modified to
become Year 2000  compliant.  Additionally,  we will be conducting  tests of our
principal business systems to verify that those systems are Year 2000 compliant.
Any failure to address any unforeseen Year 2000 issue could adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.


EURO CONVERSION

     On January 1, 1999,  eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European
Union established fixed conversion rates between their existing  currencies (the
"legacy  currency") and the one common legal currency known as the "Euro".  From
January 1, 1999  through June 30, 2002 the  countries  will be able to use their
legacy  currencies  or the Euro to transact  business.  By July 1, 2002,  at the
latest,  the  conversion  to the Euro will be  complete at which time the legacy
currencies  will no  longer be legal  tender.  The  conversion  to the Euro will
eliminate currency exchange rate risk between the member countries.

     We do not  anticipate any material  impact from the Euro  conversion on our
financial  information systems which currently  accommodate multiple currencies.
Computer  software  changes  necessary  to comply  with the Year 2000  issue are
generally compliant to the Euro conversion issue. Due to numerous uncertainties,
we cannot  reasonably  estimate the effect that the Euro  conversion  issue will
have on our pricing or market  strategies,  and the impact, if any, it will have
on our financial condition and results of operations.





- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RISK FACTORS

     EA's business is subject to many risks and  uncertainties  which may affect
our  future   financial   performance.   Some  of  those   important  risks  and
uncertainties  which  may  cause  our  operating  results  to vary or which  may
materially and adversely affect our operating results are as follows:

- - Product  development  schedules are frequently  unreliable and make predicting
quarterly results difficult. Product development schedules, particularly for new
hardware platforms and high-end  multimedia PCs are difficult to predict because
they involve creative processes,  use of new development tools for new platforms
and  the  learning  process,   research  and  experimentation   associated  with
development  for new  technologies.  For example,  SimCity  3000,  the follow on
product to SimCity 2000, was expected to ship in fiscal 1998, at the time of the
merger with Maxis. Due to additional  development  delays,  that product did not
ship until the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1999. Also, Tiberian Sun, which was
expected  to ship in  fiscal  1999 at the time of the  acquisition  of  Westwood
Studios,  is not expected to be released until the second quarter of fiscal 2000
due to development delays.  Additionally,  development risks for CD-ROM products
can cause particular  difficulties in predicting quarterly results because brief
manufacturing  lead times allow finalizing  products and projected release dates
late in a quarter.  Our revenues  and  earnings are  dependent on our ability to
meet our product  release  schedules,  and our  failure to meet those  schedules
could result in revenues and earnings which fall short of analysts' expectations
for any individual quarter and the fiscal year.

- - New video game  platforms  create  additional  technical  and  business  model
uncertainties.  A large  portion of our  revenues  are derived  from the sale of
products for play on proprietary  video game  platforms such as the  PlayStation
and the N64. The success of our products is significantly affected by acceptance
of the new video  game  hardware  systems  and the life  span of older  hardware
platforms and our ability to accurately  predict  which  platforms  will be most
successful.

Sometimes we will spend development and marketing resources on products designed
for new video game systems that have not yet achieved large  installed  bases or
will continued  product  development for older hardware  platforms that may have
shorter  life cycles than we  expected.  Conversely,  if we do not develop for a
platform that achieves significant market acceptance, or discontinue development
for a platform that has a longer life cycle than  expected,  our revenue  growth
may be adversely affected.

For  example,  while the Sega  Dreamcast  console is  scheduled to launch in the
United States in late calendar 1999 and has already  launched in Japan,  we have
no products under development for this platform.  Accordingly,  we will not have
products   available  should  this  platform  achieve  wide  market  acceptance.
Similarly,  we  intend  to  launch  a  variety  of  products  for the  new  Sony
PlayStation platform,  the PlayStation II, expected to be released in the Untied
States in September  2000.  Should that platform not achieve wide  acceptance by
consumers,  we will have spent a  disproportionate  amount of our  resources for
this platform.  Additionally,  we have not negotiated publishing agreements with
Sony, Sega or Nintendo for their next generation  platforms,  and we do not know
whether the terms of those agreements will be favorable.

- - The  business  models and  technology  for  e-commerce  and online  gaming are
unproven.  While we do not  currently  derive  significant  revenues from online
sales of our packaged products or from games played online, we believe that both
will become a more  significant  factor in our business  and in the  interactive
gaming business generally in the future.

E-commerce is becoming an  increasingly  popular method for conducting  business
with consumers.  How that form of distribution  will affect the more traditional
retail distribution,  at which we have historically excelled, and over what time
period, is uncertain.  Additionally,  technology, staffing and support for sales
direct to consumers differ from that required for sales to resellers.

Online gaming,  and  particularly  multiplayer  online gaming such as our Ultima
Online product,  has many risks not currently associated with most packaged good
sales including, but not limited to, the following:

     In  "massively  multiplayer"  games  such as Ultima  Online,  unanticipated
player  conduct  significantly  affects the  performance of the game, and social
issues raised by players' conduct frequently determine player satisfaction.  Our
ability to effectively proctor such games is uncertain.

     The current business model is as yet experimental and maybe  unsustainable;
whether  revenues will  continue to be  sufficient  to maintain the  significant
support,  service and product  enhancement demands of online users is uncertain.
We  have  little  experience  in  pricing  strategies  for  online  games  or in
predicting usage patterns of our customers.

     Additionally, the speed and reliability of the Internet and the performance
of a user's Internet  service  provider are not controlled by us but impact both
e-commerce and online game performance. Whether the Internet infrastructure will
be  adequate  to meet  increasing  demand  will  affect our  ability to grow our
Internet dependent businesses.

- - Our business,  our products,  and our  distribution  are subject to increasing
regulation in key territories.  Legislation is increasingly introduced which may
affect the content of our products and their distribution.  For example, privacy
rules in the United States and Europe  impose  various





restrictions on our web sites. Those rules vary by territory while of course the
Internet recognizes no geographical boundaries.  Other countries such as Germany
have adopted laws  regulating  content  transmitted  over the Internet  that are
stricter than current United States laws. In the United  States,  in response to
recent events, the federal and several state governments are considering content
restrictions  on products  such as those made by us as well as  restrictions  on
distribution  of such products.  Any one or more of these factors could harm our
business.

- - Our platform  licensors are our chief  competitors and frequently  control the
manufacturing  of  our  video  game  products.   Our  agreements  with  hardware
licensors,  which are also our chief  competitors,  typically  give  significant
control to the licensor  over the approval and  manufacturing  of our  products.
This fact could, in certain  circumstances,  leave us unable to get our products
approved,  manufactured and shipped to customers. In most events, control of the
approval and manufacturing  process by the platform licensors increases both our
manufacturing  lead  times  and  costs  as  compared  to  those  we can  achieve
independently.  For example,  in prior years, we experienced delays in obtaining
approvals for and  manufacturing of PlayStation  products which caused delays in
shipping  those  products.  The  potential  for  additional  delay or refusal to
approve or manufacture our products continues with our platform licensors.  Such
occurrences   would  harm  our  business  and  adversely  affect  our  financial
performance.

- - We face intense  competition for talent from highly valued Internet companies.
Competition for employees in the interactive  software business  continues to be
intense. Recently, the most intense competition for recruiting and retaining key
employees is from Internet companies.  The high market valuations,  large equity
positions  for  key  executives  and  creative   talent  and  fast  stock  price
appreciation of these companies make their compensation  packages  attractive to
those who are already working in more mature  companies.  This situation creates
difficulty  for us to compete for the  attraction and retention of executive and
key creative talent.


- - Foreign Sales and Currency  Fluctuations.  For fiscal 1999,  international net
revenues  comprised 42% of total  consolidated  net revenues.  We expect foreign
sales to  continue  to account  for a  significant  and  growing  portion of our
revenues. Such sales are subject to unexpected regulatory requirements,  tariffs
and other  barriers.  Additionally,  foreign sales are  primarily  made in local
currencies which may fluctuate.  As a result of current  economic  conditions in
Asia,  we are subject to  additional  foreign  currency  risk.  Though we do not
currently  derive a significant  portion of revenues and operating  profits from
sales in Asia and other developing countries,  our foreign currency exposure may
increase as operations in these countries grow and if current economic trends in
Asia continue. Any of these factors may significantly harm our business.

- - Fluctuations in Stock Price. Due to analysts' expectations of continued growth
and other  factors,  any  shortfall  in  earnings  could have an  immediate  and
significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given
period.  As a result of the factors  discussed in this report and other  factors
that may arise in the future,  the market price of our common stock historically
has been,  and may  continue to be subject to  significant  fluctuations  over a
short period of time.  These  fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us,
to  changes  in  analysts'  earnings  estimates,  or to  factors  affecting  the
computer,  software,  entertainment,  media  or  electronics  industries  or the
securities  markets in general.  For example,  during the fiscal year 1999,  the
price per share of our common  stock  ranged from  $33.88 to $56.00.  During the
fiscal year 1998,  the price per share of our common stock ranged from $20.13 to
$46.94.

Because of these and other factors affecting our operating results and financial
condition,  past  financial  performance  should  not be  considered  a reliable
indicator of future performance,  and investors should not use historical trends
to anticipate results or trends in future periods.





Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risk

     We are exposed to various  market  risks,  including the changes in foreign
currency  exchange rates and interest  rates.  Market risk is the potential loss
arising from changes in market rates and prices. Foreign exchange contracts used
to hedge foreign  currency  exposures and short-term  investments are subject to
market risk. We do not consider our cash and cash  equivalents  to be subject to
interest  rate  risk  due  to  their  short  maturities.  We do not  enter  into
derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We utilize foreign  exchange  contracts to hedge foreign  currency  exposures of
underlying assets and liabilities,  primarily certain  intercompany  receivables
that are denominated in foreign  currencies thereby limiting our risk. Gains and
losses on foreign exchange  contracts are reflected in the income statement.  At
March 31, 1999, we had foreign exchange  contracts,  all with maturities of less
than nine  months to purchase  and sell  approximately  $178,178,000  in foreign
currencies,  primarily British Pounds,  Canadian Dollars,  German  Deutschmarks,
Japanese Yen and other European currencies.

Fair value  represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate
and the forward rate,  plus the  unamortized  premium or discount.  At March 31,
1999, fair value of these contracts is not significant.  The  counterparties  to
these contracts are substantial and creditworthy multinational commercial banks.
The risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are not
considered  to be  material.  Notwithstanding  our  efforts  to  manage  foreign
exchange  risks,  there can be no assurances  that our hedging  activities  will
adequately  protect  us  against  the risks  associated  with  foreign  currency
fluctuations.

The table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange
contracts  at March  31,  1999.  The  information  is  provided  in U.S.  dollar
equivalents  and presents the notional  amount  (forward  amount),  the weighted
average  contractual  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  and  fair  value.  All
contracts mature within nine months.

While the  contract  amounts  provide  one  measurement  of the  volume of these
transactions,  they do not  represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk.
The amounts (arising from the possible inabilities of counterparties to meet the
terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which
the counterparties' obligations exceed our obligations as these contracts can be
settled on a net basis at our  option.  We control  credit risk  through  credit
approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily
to our investment  portfolio.  We do not use derivative financial instruments in
our  investment  portfolio.  We manage our interest rate risk by  maintaining an
investment  portfolio  primarily  consisting of debt  instruments of high credit
quality and  relatively  short average  maturities.  We also manage our interest
rate risk by maintaining  sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that
we are typically able to hold our  investments  to maturity.  At March 31, 1999,
our  cash  equivalents,  short-term  and  long-term  investments  included  debt
securities of $224,581,000.  Notwithstanding our efforts





to  manage  interest  rate  risks,  there can be no  assurances  that we will be
adequately   protected   against  the  risks   associated   with  interest  rate
fluctuations.

The table below presents the amounts and related weighted average interest rates
of our investment portfolio at March 31, 1999:

ITEM 8:  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

The Report of Independent Auditors,  Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements follow below on pages 29 through 47.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Electronic Arts Inc. and Subsidiaries:


We have audited the accompanying  consolidated balance sheets of Electronic Arts
Inc.  and  subsidiaries  as  of  March  31,  1999  and  1998,  and  the  related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year  period ended March 31, 1999. These  consolidated
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial
statements  based on our audits.  We did not audit the  financial  statements of
Maxis,  Inc.,  a  company  acquired  by  Electronic  Arts  Inc.  in  a  business
combination  accounted  for as a pooling of interests as described in Note 11 to
the consolidated  financial statements,  which statements reflect total revenues
constituting  7% for the year ended March 31, 1997, of the related  consolidated
totals.  Those  statements  were audited by other auditors whose report has been
furnished to us, and our opinion,  insofar as it relates to the amounts included
for Maxis, Inc., is based solely on the report of the other auditors.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  based on our audits and the report of the other  auditors,  the
consolidated  financial  statements  referred to above  present  fairly,  in all
material   respects,   the  financial  position  of  Electronic  Arts  Inc.  and
subsidiaries as of March 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their  operations
and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year  period ended March
31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

ELECTRONIC ARTS AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

March 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997


(1)  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Consolidation

The  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  include the  accounts of
Electronic Arts Inc. and its wholly-owned and  majority-owned  subsidiaries (the
"Company").  All significant  intercompany  balances and transactions  have been
eliminated in consolidation.

     A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation
of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company follows:

(a)  Fiscal Year
The  Company's  fiscal year is reported on a 52/53-week  period that ends on the
Saturday  nearest to March 31 in each year. The results of operations for fiscal
1999,  1998 and 1997 contain 52 weeks.  Since the results of an additional  week
are not material, and for clarity of presentation herein, all fiscal periods are
treated as ending on a calendar month end.

(b)  Revenue Recognition
The  Company's  revenue  recognition  policies are in  compliance  with American
Institute of Certified  Public  Accountants  Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2,
"Software Revenue Recognition",  and SOP 98-4 "Deferral of the Effective Date of
a  Provision  of  SOP  97-2",  which  provide  guidance  on  generally  accepted
accounting principles for recognizing revenue on software transactions. SOP 97-2
requires that revenue recognized from software arrangements be allocated to each
element of the  arrangement  based on the relative  fair values of the elements.
The Company has adopted the  provisions  of these SOPs as of April 1, 1998.  The
adoption  has, in certain  circumstances,  resulted  in the  deferral of certain
revenues  associated  with the  Company's  sales  promotions  and products  with
multiple deliverable elements. Neither the changes in certain business practices
nor the deferral of certain  revenues have resulted in a material  impact on the
Company's  operating  results,  financial  position or cash flows for the period
ended  March 31,  1999.  Total  deferred  revenue at March 31, 1999 and 1998 was
$8,206,000, and $2,797,000, respectively.

Product  Sales:  Revenue is  generally  recognized  when the product is shipped.
Subject  to  certain  limitations,  the  Company  permits  customers  to  obtain
exchanges  within certain  specified  periods and provides  price  protection on
certain  unsold  merchandise.  Revenue is  recognized  net of an  allowance  for
returns and price protection.

Online  Subscription   Revenues:   Monthly  online  subscription   revenues  are
recognized over the period in which the services are provided.

Software Licenses: For those agreements which provide the customers the right to
multiple copies in exchange for guaranteed  minimum royalty amounts,  revenue is
recognized  at  delivery  of the  product  master  or the first  copy.  Per copy
royalties on sales that exceed the guarantee are recognized as earned.

Revenue  from the  licensing  of  software  was  $17,788,000,  $15,431,000,  and
$26,749,000  for  the  fiscal  years  ended  March  31,  1999,  1998  and  1997,
respectively.

(c) Cash and Investments
Cash equivalents  consist of highly liquid  investments with  insignificant rate
risk  and  with  maturities  of three  months  or less at the date of  purchase.
Short-term  investments  include  securities with maturities  greater than three
months  and less than one year,  except  for  certain  investments  with  stated
maturities greater than one year.  Long-term  investments  consist of securities
with maturities greater than one year.

The Company  accounts for investments  under  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards  No.  115,  "Accounting  for  Certain  Investments  in Debt and Equity
Securities,"  ("SFAS 115").  The Company's policy is to protect the value of its
investment  portfolio and to minimize principal risk by earning returns based on
current interest rates. Management determines the appropriate  classification of
its debt and equity  securities  at the time of purchase  and  reevaluates  such
designation  as of each balance sheet date.  Debt  securities  are classified as
held-to-maturity  when the Company has the  positive  intent and ability to hold
the  securities  to maturity.  Securities  classified  as  held-to-maturity  are
carried at amortized  cost,  which is adjusted for  amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts to maturity.  Such  amortization  is included in interest
income. Debt securities,  not classified as held-to-maturity,  are classified as
available-for-sale and  are  stated at fair value.  Securities  sold is based on
the specific identification method.

(d)  Prepaid Royalties
Prepaid royalties consist primarily of prepayments for manufacturing  royalties,
original equipment  manufacturer (OEM) fees and license fees paid to celebrities
and professional sports organizations for use of their trade name. Also included
in prepaid  royalties are prepayments  made to independent  software  developers
under  development  arrangements  that have  alternative  future  uses.  Prepaid
royalties are expensed at the contractual royalty rate as cost of





goods sold based on actual net product  sales.  Management  evaluates the future
realization  of prepaid  royalties  quarterly  and charges to income any amounts
that management  deems unlikely to be realized  through  product sales.  Royalty
advances are classified as current and  non-current  assets based upon estimated
net  product  sales for the  following  year.  The  current  portion  of prepaid
royalties,  included in other current assets, was $35,057,000 and $20,470,000 at
March  31,  1999 and  1998,  respectively.  The  long-term  portion  of  prepaid
royalties,  included in other assets, was $7,602,000 and $2,289,000 at March 31,
1999 and 1998, respectively.

(e)  Software Development Costs
Research and development costs, which consist primarily of software  development
costs, are expensed as incurred.  SFAS No. 86 provides for the capitalization of
certain software  development costs incurred after technological  feasibility of
the  software is  established  or for  development  costs that have  alternative
future uses.  Under the Company's  current  practice of developing new products,
the  technological  feasibility  of the underlying  software is not  established
until  substantially  all  product  development  is  complete,  which  generally
includes the development of a working model. The software development costs that
have been capitalized to date have been insignificant.

(f)  Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Inventories at March 31,
1999 and 1998 consisted of:

================================================================================
                                                 1999           1998
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                    (in thousands)
Raw materials and work in process             $ 2,983         $ 2,392
Finished goods                                 19,393          17,234
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                              $22,376         $19,626
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(g)  Advertising Costs
The  Company  generally  expenses  advertising  costs as  incurred,  except  for
production  costs associated with media campaigns which are deferred and charged
to expense at the first run of the ad. Cooperative advertising with distributors
and  retailers is accrued when revenue is  recognized.  Cooperative  advertising
credits are reimbursed  when  qualifying  claims are  submitted.  For the fiscal
years  ended  March  31,  1999,  1998 and  1997,  advertising  expenses  totaled
approximately $72,437,000, $55,090,000 and $36,159,000, respectively.

(h)  Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation is calculated using the
accelerated and straight-line methods over the following useful lives:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Buildings                             20 to 25 years
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Computer equipment                    3 to 7 years
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Furniture and equipment               3 to 7 years
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leasehold improvements                Lesser of the lease terms or the estimated
                                      useful lives of the improvements
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(i)  Intangible Assets
Intangible   assets  net  of  amortization  at  March  31,  1999  and  1998,  of
$90,682,000, and $2,148,000,  respectively, include goodwill, costs of obtaining
product  technology  and  noncompete  covenants  which are  amortized  using the
straight-line  method  over the lesser of their  estimated  useful  lives or the
agreement terms,  typically from two to twelve years.  Amortization  expense for
fiscal years ended March 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 was $5,880,000,  $692,000,  and
$654,000,  respectively.  The Company assesses the recoverability of goodwill by
determining  whether the carried  value of the assets may be  recovered  through
estimated future cash flows.

(j)  Income Taxes
Income tax expense is based on reported  earnings before income taxes.  Deferred
income taxes  reflect the impact of  temporary  differences  between  assets and
liabilities  recognized  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  such  amounts
recognized for tax purposes.

(k)  Foreign Currency Translation
For each of the Company's  foreign  subsidiaries the functional  currency is its
local currency. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into
U.S.  dollars  using  current  exchange  rates,  and  revenues  and expenses are
translated  into U.S.  dollars  using  average  exchange  rates.  The effects of
foreign  currency  translation  adjustments  are  deferred  and  included  as  a
component of  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income (loss) in  stockholders'
equity.

Foreign  currency  transaction  gains and  losses  are a result of the effect of
exchange rate changes on transactions  denominated in currencies  other than the
functional currency.  Included in interest and other income in the statements of
income are foreign  currency  transaction  losses of  $1,168,000,  $517,000  and
$1,024,000,  for  the  fiscal  years  ended  March  31,  1999,  1998  and  1997,
respectively.

(l)   Net Income Per Share
The following  summarizes the  computations  of Basic Earnings Per Share ("EPS")
and  Diluted  EPS.  Basic  EPS  is  computed  as  net  earnings  divided  by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS
reflects the potential  dilution  that could occur from common  shares  issuable
through stock-based compensation plans including stock options, restricted stock
awards,  warrants and other  convertible  securities  using the  treasury  stock
method.

  Diluted                                          $1.15       $1.19     $  0.86

Excluded from the above computation of  weighted-average  shares for diluted EPS
for the  fiscal  years  ended  March 31,  1999,  1998 and 1997 were  options  to
purchase 645,000, 137,000 and 623,000 shares of common stock,  respectively,  as
the options'  exercise  price was greater  than the average  market price of the
common shares.  For the fiscal year ended March 31, 1999,  the  weighted-average
exercise price of the respective options was $47.33.

(m)  Employee Benefits
The Company has a 401(k) Plan covering  substantially all of its U.S. employees.
The 401(k)  Plan  permits  the Company to make  discretionary  contributions  to
employees'  accounts based on the Company's financial  performance.  The Company
contributed $2,092,000, $902,000 and $925,000 to the Plan in fiscal 1999, fiscal
1998 and fiscal 1997, respectively.

(n)  Stock-based Compensation
The Company  accounts for  stock-based  awards to employees  using the intrinsic
value method in  accordance  with  Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25").

(o)  Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of  Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  133  ("SFAS  133")  "Accounting  for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", which establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities.  SFAS 133
is  effective  as of the  beginning  of the first  quarter  of the  fiscal  year
beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company is determining the effect of SFAS 133
on its financial statements.

In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants  ("AICPA")
issued SOP 98-1,  "Accounting  for the Costs of Computer  Software  Developed or
Obtained for Internal  Use". SOP 98-1 requires that certain costs related to the
development or purchase of  internal-use  software be capitalized  and amortized
over the  estimated  useful  life of the  software.  SOP 98-1 is  effective  for
financial  statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998.
The  adoption  of SOP 98-1 is not  expected  to have a  material  impact  on the
Company's results of operations.

In December  1998,  the Accounting  Standards  Executive  Committee of the AICPA
issued  SOP  98-9,  "Software  Revenue  Recognition,  with  Respect  to  Certain
Arrangements," which required recognition of revenue using the "residual method"
in a multiple element arrangement when fair value does not exist for one or more
of the  undelivered  elements  in the  arrangement.  SOP 98-9 is  effective  for
transactions entered into after March 15, 1999. Under the "residual method", the
total  fair value of the  undelivered  elements  is  deferred  and  subsequently
recognized  in  accordance  with SOP 97-2.  The  Company  will adopt SOP 98-9 in
fiscal  year 2000 and does not expect a material  change to its  accounting  for
revenues as a result of the provisions of SOP 98-9.

(p)  Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosures  of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Such
estimates  include   provisions  for  doubtful   accounts,   sales  returns  and
allowances,  warranty provisions,  and estimates regarding the recoverability of
prepaid royalty advances and inventories. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

(q)  Reclassifications
Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 1999 presentation.

(r) Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for
impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of assets is
measured by a comparison  of the carrying  amount of an asset to future net cash
flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the
carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.

Long-term and short-term  held-to-maturity  investments include commercial notes
with original  maturities of five to eight years secured by U.S.  Treasury Notes
which enable the Company to take  advantage of certain tax  incentives  from its
Puerto Rico operation.  These  investments are treated as  held-to-maturity  for
financial reporting purposes.

The fair value of held-to-maturity  securities at March 31, 1999 was $24,353,000
which  included  gross  unrealized   gains  of  $153,000.   The  fair  value  of
held-to-maturity  securities at March 31, 1998 was  $41,326,000  which  included
gross unrealized gains of $27,000 and gross unrealized losses of $7,000.

(b)  Marketable Securities

Marketable  securities  are  comprised  of equity  securities.  The  Company has
accounted for investments in equity securities as  "available-for-sale"  and has
stated applicable  investments at fair value,  with net unrealized  appreciation
reported as a separate  component  of  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income
(loss) in stockholders'  equity.  Marketable securities had an aggregate cost of
$585,000 and $1,143,000 at March 31, 1999 and 1998,  respectively.  At March 31,
1999,  marketable  securities included gross unrealized gains of $4,299,000.  At
March  31,  1998  marketable  securities  included  gross  unrealized  gains  of
$2,771,000 and gross unrealized losses of $193,000.

For the fiscal years ended March 31, 1999 and 1998, the fair value of marketable
securities sold was $1,818,000 and $7,276,000,  respectively. The gross realized
gains from these sales totaled  $1,454,000  and  $4,098,000  for fiscal 1999 and
1998,  respectively.  The gain on sale of  investments  is based on the specific
identification method.

(c)  Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts

The Company  utilizes  foreign  currency  forward  exchange  contracts  to hedge
foreign  currency market exposures of underlying  assets,  liabilities and other
obligations,  primarily certain intercompany receivables that are denominated in
foreign  currencies.  The Company does not use forward  exchange  contracts  for
speculative or trading  purposes.  The Company's  accounting  policies for these
instruments  are  based on the  Company's  designation  of such  instruments  as
hedging  transactions.   The  criteria  the  Company  uses  for  designating  an
instrument as a hedge include the  instrument's  effectiveness in risk reduction
and   one-to-one   matching  of  forward   exchange   contracts  to   underlying
transactions. Gains and losses on currency forward contracts that are designated
and  effective as hedges of firm  commitments  are deferred  and  recognized  in
income in the same period that the underlying  transactions  are settled.  Gains
and losses on currency  forward  contracts  that are designated and effective as
hedges of existing  transactions  are recognized in income in the same period as
losses and gains on the  underlying  transactions  are  recognized and generally
offset. Gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the above criteria would
be recognized in income in the current period. The Company transacts business in
various foreign currencies.  At March 31, 1999, the Company had foreign exchange
contracts,  all with  maturities of less than nine months,  to purchase and sell
approximately  $178,178,000 in foreign currencies,  primarily in British Pounds,
Canadian  Dollars,   German  Deutschmarks,   Japanese  Yen  and  other  European
currencies.

Fair value  represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate
and the forward rate,  plus the  unamortized  premium or discount.  At March 31,
1999, fair value of these contracts is not significant.  The  counterparties  to
these contracts are substantial and creditworthy multinational commercial banks.
The risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are not
considered to be material.


(3)  COMMITMENTS

Lease Obligations

The Company leases certain of its current facilities and certain equipment under
non-cancelable  operating  lease  agreements.  The  Company is  required  to pay
property  taxes,  insurance  and  normal  maintenance  costs for  certain of its
facilities and will be required to pay any increases over the base year of these
expenses on the remainder of the Company's facilities.





In  February  1995,  the  Company  entered  into a master  operating  lease,  as
subsequently amended, for land and a building to be constructed in Redwood City,
California.  The  initial  term of the lease is for a period of three years from
November 30, 1998.  Monthly lease  payments are based upon the London  InterBank
Offered  Rate.  The  Company  has the option to purchase  the  property  for the
unamortized financed balance at any time after the non-cancelable lease term, or
it may  terminate  the  lease  at any  time  after  the  non-cancelable  term by
arranging  a third  party sale or by making a  termination  payment.  Should the
Company elect to terminate the lease,  it will  guarantee a residual value of up
to 85% of the unamortized value of the property.  As part of the agreement,  the
Company must also comply with certain financial covenants.

Total future minimum lease commitments as of March 31, 1999 are:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Total rent expense for all operating  leases was  $19,480,000,  $13,842,000  and
$11,430,000,  for the  fiscal  years  ended  March  31,  1999,  1998  and  1997,
respectively.

(4)  CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The  Company  extends  credit  to  various  companies  in the  retail  and  mass
merchandising  industry.  Collection  of trade  receivables  may be  affected by
changes in economic or other industry  conditions and may,  accordingly,  impact
the  Company's  overall  credit risk.  Although the Company  generally  does not
require  collateral,  the Company  performs  ongoing  credit  evaluations of its
customers and reserves for potential credit losses are maintained.

Short-term   investments   are  placed   with  high   credit-quality   financial
institutions or in short-duration  high quality  securities.  The Company limits
the  amount of credit  exposure  in any one  institution  or type of  investment
instrument.

(5)  LITIGATION

The  Company  is subject to pending  claims and  litigation.  Management,  after
review and  consultation  with counsel,  considers  that any liability  from the
disposition of such lawsuits  would not have a material  adverse effect upon the
consolidated financial condition of the Company.

(6)  PREFERRED STOCK

At March 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company had 1,000,000  shares of Preferred Stock
authorized  but  unissued.  The rights,  preferences,  and  restrictions  of the
Preferred  Stock may be  designated  by the Board of Directors  without  further
action by the Company's stockholders.

(7)  TREASURY STOCK

In February 1999,  the Board of Directors  approved a plan to purchase up to two
million shares of the Company's common stock. For the year ended March 31, 1999,
the Company repurchased  222,500 shares for approximately  $9,001,000 under this
program.  Of these,  99,937 shares were reissued under the Company's Stock Plans
as of March 31, 1999.

When treasury shares are reissued, any excess of the average acquisition cost of
the shares over the proceeds from reissuance is charged to retained earnings.

(8)  STOCK PLANS

(a)  Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The  Company  has an Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  program  whereby  eligible
employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to 10% of their compensation to
purchase shares at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the Common Stock
on the date of  commencement of the offering or on the last day of the six-month
purchase  period.  The program  commenced  in  September  1991.  In fiscal 1999,
241,514  shares were  purchased by the Company and  distributed  to employees at
prices  ranging  from  $26.19 to $36.60.  In fiscal  1998,  199,680  shares were
purchased by the Company and  distributed  to  employees at prices  ranging from
$26.14 to $26.19.  In fiscal 1997,  184,596 shares were purchased by the Company
and  distributed to employees at prices ranging from $21.25 to $25.18 per share.
The weighted average fair value of the fiscal 1999,  fiscal 1998 and fiscal 1997
awards was $18.27,  $9.43,  and $10.41,  respectively.  Under the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan 30,928 shares were  distributed  from reissued  treasury  stock in
fiscal 1999. No shares were distributed  from reissued  treasury stock in fiscal
1998 or fiscal 1997. At March 1999, the Company had 237,444 shares of its Common
Stock reserved for future issuance under the Plan.

Prior to the  Maxis  merger in July  1997,  Maxis  employees  were  eligible  to
participate in an employee  stock purchase plan. In fiscal 1998 and 1997,  Maxis
purchased  7,684,  and 18,220 shares,  respectively,  under this plan which were
distributed to participating employees.  Shares were purchased at prices ranging
from $27.70 to $27.99 in fiscal 1998, and $28.56 to $46.08 in fiscal 1997.

(b)  Stock Option Plans
The Company's 1991 Stock Option Plan,  1993 Stock Option Plan, 1995 Stock Option
Plan and Directors'  Plan ("Option  Plans") provide stock options for employees,
officers and





independent  contractors,  and for  directors,  respectively.  Pursuant to these
Option Plans, the Board of Directors may grant non-qualified and incentive stock
options to  employees  and officers and  non-qualified  options to  celebrities,
employees of certain  companies  in which the Company has an equity  investment,
and directors, at not less than the fair market value on the date of grant.

Under the  Company's  stock  option  plans,  69,009  shares were  reissued  from
treasury stock in fiscal 1999. No shares were distributed from reissued treasury
stock in fiscal 1998 or fiscal 1997.

The options  generally expire ten years from the date of grant and are generally
exercisable in monthly  increments  over 50 months.  Certain  options assumed in
connection  with the Maxis  merger in fiscal 1998 expire ten years from the date
of  grant,  and  vest  and  become  exercisable  at a rate  of 25% on the  first
anniversary of the date of grant and 25% of the shares each year thereafter.

The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 123,  "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" ("SFAS
123").  Accordingly,  no  compensation  expense has been  recognized for options
granted under the Company's  employee-based stock option plans. Had compensation
expense  been  determined  based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards
under those plans in accordance  with the  provisions of SFAS 123, the Company's
pro forma net income and net  income  per share for fiscal  1999,  1998 and 1997
would have been:

   Pro forma - diluted                            $0.74        $0.88       $0.64

The fair value of each option  grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes  option-pricing model. The following weighted-average  assumptions
are used for grants made in 1999, 1998 and 1997 under the stock plans: risk-free
interest  rates of 4.39% to 5.55% in 1999,  5.31% to 6.42% in 1998; and 5.48% to
6.36% in 1997;  expected volatility of 59% in fiscal 1999 and 58% in both fiscal
1998 and fiscal 1997; expected lives of 2.27 years in fiscal 1999 and 2.25 years
in fiscal  1998 and  fiscal  1997  under the  Option  Plans and one year for the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. No dividends are assumed in the expected term. The
Company's  calculations  are based on a multiple option  valuation  approach and
forfeitures  are  recognized  when they  occur.  The above  disclosures  include
options  granted  under the former Maxis option plans as if they were  initially
granted by the Company.

Because SFAS 123 is applicable only to options  granted  subsequent to March 31,
1995, the impact of non-vested stock options granted prior to this date has been
excluded from the pro forma calculation.  Accordingly, pro forma adjustments are
not  indicative of future period pro forma  adjustments  as the pro forma effect
will not be fully reflected until subsequent years.

(11)  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DIVESTITURE

(a) Westwood Studios

In September 1998, the Company  completed the  acquisition of Westwood  Studios,
Inc.  and  certain  assets  of the  Irvine,  California  - based  Virgin  Studio
(collectively  "Westwood") for  approximately  $122,688,000  in cash,  including
transaction expenses.  The adjusted allocation of the excess purchase price over
the net  tangible  liabilities  assumed  was  $128,573,000  of  which,  based on
management's  estimates  prepared in  conjunction  with a third party  valuation
consultant,  $41,836,000  was  allocated  to purchased  in-process  research and
development and $86,737,000 was allocated to other  intangible  assets.  Amounts
allocated to other  intangibles  include  franchise  trade names of $32,357,000,
existing  technology of $6,510,000,  workforces of $1,680,000 and other goodwill
of  $46,190,000  and are being  amortized  over lives ranging from two to twelve
years.  Purchased  in-process  research  and  development  includes the value of
products  in the  development  stage  that are not  considered  to have  reached
technological  feasibility or to have alternative future use. Accordingly,  this
non-recurring  item was  expensed in the  Consolidated  Statement of Income upon
consummation  of  the  acquisition.  The  non-recurring  charge  for  in-process
research and  development  reduced diluted  earnings per share by  approximately
$0.59 in the fiscal year 1999. The results of the operations of Westwood and the
estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities  assumed are included in
the Company's financial statements from the date of acquisition.

In conjunction  with the merger of Westwood,  the Company accrued  approximately
$1,500,000  related to direct  transaction costs and other related accruals.  At
March 31,  1999,  there were  $725,000  in accruals  remaining  related to these
items.

In  connection  with the  Westwood  acquisition,  the  purchase  price  has been

In management's  opinion, the unaudited pro forma combined results of operations
are not  indicative  of the actual  results  that would  have  occurred  had the
acquisition been consummated at the beginning of fiscal 1998 or at the beginning
of fiscal  1999 or of future  operations  of the  combined  companies  under the
ownership and management of the Company.

(b) ABC Software

In July 1998,  the  Company  acquired  ABC  Software  AG and ABC  Software  GmbH
(collectively "ABC"), independent distributors of entertainment, edutainment and
application software in Switzerland and Austria, respectively, for approximately
$9,466,000  in cash (net of cash acquired of  $5,099,000)  and $570,000 in other
consideration. The transaction has been accounted for under the purchase method.
The  excess  purchase  price  over the fair  value  of the net  tangible  assets
acquired of  approximately  $7,377,000  was  allocated  to goodwill and is being
amortized over 7 years.

(c) Square Co., Ltd.

In May 1998, the Company and Square Co., Ltd.  ("Square"),  a leading  developer
and publisher of entertainment software in Japan, completed the formation of two
new joint ventures in North America and Japan.  In North America,  the companies
formed Square Electronic Arts, LLC ("Square EA"), which has exclusive publishing
rights in North America for future interactive  entertainment  titles created by
Square. Additionally, the Company has the exclusive right to distribute in North
America  products  published  by this joint  venture.  The  Company  contributed
$3,000,000  and owns a 30% minority  interest in this joint venture while Square
owns 70%. This joint venture is accounted for under the equity method.

In Japan, the companies established  Electronic Arts Square KK ("EA Square KK"),
which will  localize and publish in Japan the  Company's  properties  originally
created in North  America  and Europe,  as well as develop and publish  original
video  games in  Japan.  The  Company  contributed  cash and has a 70%  majority
ownership interest, while Square contributed cash and owns 30%. Accordingly, the
assets,  liabilities  and results of operations for EA Square KK are included in
the Company's  Consolidated  Balance Sheets and Results of Operations since June
1, 1998,  the date of formation.  Square's 30% interest in EA Square KK has been
reflected as "Minority  interest in consolidated joint venture" on the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements.

(d) Maxis, Inc.
On July 25, 1997, the Company competed a merger with Maxis,  Inc.  ("Maxis"),  a
California-based   interactive   software  developer.   Under  the  transaction,
approximately  4.1 million  shares of Electronic  Arts' stock were exchanged for
all  outstanding  Maxis common  stock.  The  transaction  was accounted for as a
pooling of interests. The accompanying financial statements,  notes and analyses
have been restated for all periods presented to reflect this transaction.

In  conjunction  with  the  merger  of  Maxis,  the  Company  recorded  costs of
$10,792,000.  This  charge  included  direct  transaction  fees  for  investment
bankers,  attorneys,  accountants,  and  other  related  costs of  approximately
$2,781,000  and costs  associated  with  integrating  the  operations of the two
companies of approximately  $8,011,000.  Included in the integration  costs were
redundant facility costs,  severance payments,  equipment  abandonment costs and
other  asset  write  downs,  contract  termination  charges  and  other  related
expenses.  Of the total merger costs,  approximately  $5,185,000 related to cash
expenditures while approximately $5,607,000 related to noncash charges. At March
31,  1999,  there were no accruals  remaining  related to these  merger  related
costs.

Total net  revenue and net income  (loss) for the  individual  entities  for the
fiscal year ended March 31, 1997 is as follows (in thousands):

 (e)  Creative Wonders, LLC
In December 1997, the Company  completed the sale of its 50% ownership  interest
in Creative  Wonders,  LLC, a joint venture  company formed with the Walt Disney
Company for  $16,750,000 in cash. The Company  recognized a gain of $12,625,000,
which is included in interest and other income.  Prior to the sale,  the Company
distributed  children's  interactive  titles  published  and  sold by the  joint
venture into the retail  channel.  The  investment  was  accounted for under the
equity method prior to sale.

 (f) Other Business Combinations

Additionally,  during the quarter ended June 30, 1998, the Company  acquired two
software  development  companies.  In connection  with these  acquisitions,  the
Company incurred a charge of $2,279,000 for acquired in-process technology.  The
charge was made after the Company  concluded that the in-process  technology had
not reached  technological  feasibility and had no alternative  future use after
taking into  consideration  the potential for usage of the software in different
products and resale of the software.

The  Company  provides  for  U.S.  taxes  on an  insignificant  portion  of  the
undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and does not provide taxes on
the remainder.  At March 31, 1999,  the  undistributed  foreign  earnings of the
foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately  $122,000,000.  If these earnings
were  distributed to the parent  company,  foreign tax credits  available  under
current law would substantially eliminate the resulting Federal tax liability.

The Company's U.S.  income tax returns for the years 1992 through 1995 have been
examined by the Internal  Revenue Service (IRS). In 1998, the Company received a
notice of  deficiencies  from the IRS. These  deficiencies  relate  primarily to
operations in Puerto Rico,  which the Company is  contesting  in Tax Court.  The
Company  believes that any additional  liabilities,  if any, that arise from the
outcome of this examination  will not be material to the Company's  consolidated
financial statements.

(14) Comprehensive Income

In fiscal  1999,  the Company  adopted  SFAS No. 130,  "Reporting  Comprehensive
Income," which establishes  standards for reporting and display of comprehensive
income and its components  (revenues,  expenses,  gains and losses) in financial
statements.  SFAS 130 requires classification of other comprehensive income in a
financial  statement and display of other  comprehensive  income separately from
retained earnings and additional  paid-in capital.  Other  comprehensive  income
includes primarily foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains
(losses) on investments.

The change in the components of accumulated other  comprehensive  income, net of
taxes, is summarized as follows (in thousands):

respectively.

The currency  translation  adjustments are not adjusted for income taxes as they
relate to indefinite investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries.


(15) DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following  methods and  assumptions  were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that
value:

Cash, cash equivalents,  short-term investments,  receivables,  accounts payable
and accrued liabilities - the carrying amount approximates fair value because of
the short maturity of these instruments.

Long-term investments, investments classified as held-to-maturity and marketable
securities - fair value is based on quoted market prices.





(16) SEGMENT INFORMATION





For the fiscal year ended March 31, 1999,  the Company had sales to one customer
which represented 12% of total net revenues. The Company had no sales to any one
customer in excess of 10% of total net revenues for fiscal years ended March 31,
