PART I

Item 1:

Business

Overview

Electronic Arts develops, markets, publishes and distributes
    video game software and content that can be played by consumers
    on a variety of platforms, including:

•

Video game consoles such as the Sony
    PlayStation

®

2 and
    PLAYSTATION

®

3,
    Microsoft
    Xbox 360

tm

and Nintendo
    Wii

tm

,

•

Personal computers, including the Macintosh (we refer to
    personal computers and the Macintosh together as
    “PCs”),

•

Handheld game players such as the
    PlayStation

®

Portable
    (“PSP

tm

”)
    and Nintendo
    DS

tm

and
    iPod

®

, and

•

Cellular handsets.

In fiscal 2008, excluding cell phones, we developed or published
    products for 10 different platforms and since our inception, we
    have published games for over 50 different platforms. In fiscal
    2008 we also published over 30 games for cellular handsets.

We also provide online game-related services (

e.g.

,
    matchmaking and subscription services) for these platforms.

We generate net revenue primarily from sales of packaged goods,
    online subscriptions, online and mobile downloads,
    micro-transactions, and advertising.

Our ability to publish games across multiple platforms has been,
    and will continue to be, a cornerstone of our product strategy.
    Historically, there have been multiple video game consoles and
    handheld game players available to consumers, and there has been
    vigorous competition among hardware manufacturers. In previous
    hardware cycles, Sony’s PlayStation and PlayStation 2
    consoles have significantly outsold their competitors. The
    current hardware cycle is characterized by fierce competition
    from three strong and viable competitors —
    Microsoft’s Xbox 360, the Nintendo Wii and Sony’s
    PLAYSTATION 3. In fiscal 2008, we developed and published
    20 titles for the Xbox 360, 17 titles for the
    PLAYSTATION 3, 15 titles for the PlayStation 2,
    14 titles for the Wii, two titles for the Xbox and one
    title for the Nintendo GameCube. The PC also continues to be an
    important interactive game platform. In fiscal 2008, we
    published 29 titles for the PC (including the Macintosh).
    Similarly, there is also competition in the handheld games
    hardware business, where the Nintendo DS and Sony’s PSP are
    both viable platforms. In fiscal 2008, we published 12 titles
    for the Nintendo DS, nine titles for the PSP and one title for
    the Game Boy Advance. Many of our PC, PlayStation 2, PLAYSTATION
    3, Wii, Xbox 360, Xbox and PSP titles include online
    functionality which enables consumers to participate in online
    communities and play against one another via the Internet.



Our games span a diverse range of categories, including
    action-adventure, casual, sports, family, fantasy, racing,
    music, role-playing, simulation, extreme sports and strategy. We
    have created, licensed and acquired a strong portfolio of
    intellectual property, which we market and sell to a variety of
    consumers. Our portfolio of wholly-owned properties includes
    established brands such as

Need for
    Speed

tm

,

The
    Sims

tm

and

Battlefield,

and games scheduled to debut in fiscal
    2009 such as

Spore

tm

,

Mirror’s
    Edge

tm

and

Dead
    Space

tm

.
    Our portfolio of games based on licensed intellectual property
    includes sports-based titles such as

Madden NFL Football,
    FIFA Soccer

and

Tiger Woods PGA
    Tour

®

,

and titles based on popular culture such as

Harry Potter,
    The
    Godfather

®

,

and the yet-to-be released

Warhammer

®

Online

. Through our EA Partners business, we also
    co-develop, co-publish and distribute video games that are
    developed and published by other companies, including the MTV
    Games/Harmonix game

Rock Band

. Beginning in fiscal 2009,
    we also expect to release video games based on board games and
    toys from Hasbro, including

NERF, MONOPOLY

and

TRIVIAL
    PURSUIT

.

Another cornerstone of our strategy is to publish products that
    can be iterated, or sequeled. For example, many of our sports
    products, such as Madden NFL Football, come out in a new edition
    each year. Other products, such as The Sims and Godfather, can
    be sequeled on a less-frequent basis. We refer to these
    successful, iterated product families as “franchises”.

We develop our games using both internal and external resources.
    We have development studios and related functions located
    worldwide, such as BioWare (Canada and United States), Black Box
    (Canada), Blueprint (United States), Bright Light (United
    Kingdom), Criterion (United Kingdom), DICE (Sweden), EA Canada,
    EA India, EA Los Angeles (United States), EA Montreal (Canada),
    EA Redwood Shores (United States), EA Romania, EA Salt Lake City
    (United States), Mythic Entertainment (United States), Pogo
    (United States and China), Pandemic (United States and
    Australia), Phenomic (Germany), The Sims (United States) and
    Tiburon (United States). We also have quality and assurance
    functions located in several countries such as China, India,
    Korea, Singapore and Spain and localization functions located in
    several countries such as France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Romania
    and Spain. We also engage third-parties to assist with the
    development of our games at their own development and production
    studios.

Our global sales network allows us to market, publish and
    distribute games in over 35 countries throughout the world. In
    North America, we generate a significant portion of our net
    revenue from direct sales to retailers. Outside of North
    America, we generate net revenue primarily from direct-to-retail
    sales although, in some of our smaller territories, we also work
    with third parties to distribute our games. Our games are also
    available via online stores, including our own online store, and
    via direct digital download from our website. We also market and
    distribute games and other content for cellular handsets through
    wireless carriers.

In fiscal 2008, sales of

Rock Band

, distributed for three
    platforms, represented approximately 10 percent of our
    total net revenue. In fiscal 2007, we had two titles,

Need
    for Speed Carbon

and

Madden NFL 07

, published on 10
    platforms, each of which represented approximately
    11 percent of our total net revenue. In fiscal 2006, we had
    one title,

Need for Speed Most Wanted

, published on eight
    platforms, which represented approximately 10 percent of
    our total net revenue.

We were initially incorporated in California in 1982. In
    September 1991, we reincorporated under the laws of Delaware.
    Our principal executive offices are located at 209 Redwood
    Shores Parkway, Redwood City, California 94065 and our telephone
    number is

(650) 628-1500.

Significant
    Business Developments in Fiscal 2008

Label
    Reorganization

As described in more detail below, in fiscal 2008, we
    reorganized our business into four operating
    “labels” — EA Games, EA SPORTS, The Sims and
    EA Casual Entertainment — and an additional group that
    works closely with the labels — Global Publishing,
    which operates in three regions, North America, Europe and Asia.



Acquisition
    of Bioware and Pandemic Studios

In January 2008, we acquired VG Holding Corp. (“VGH”),
    owner of both BioWare Corp. and Pandemic Studios, LLC, game
    development studios that create action-adventure and
    role-playing games, such as

Mass
    Effect

tm

(BioWare) and

Mercenaries

tm

(Pandemic). BioWare has development studios in Edmonton, Canada
    and Austin, Texas and Pandemic Studios are located in Los
    Angeles, California and Brisbane, Australia.

Transition
    to New Video Game Consoles

The video game software industry is cyclical, driven by video
    game hardware systems, which have historically had a life cycle
    of four to six years. The current cycle began with
    Microsoft’s launch of the Xbox 360 in 2005, and continued
    in 2006 when Sony and Nintendo launched their next-generation
    systems, the PLAYSTATION 3 and the Wii, respectively. During
    fiscal 2008, the installed base of each of these systems
    continued to expand and, as a result, sales of our products for
    these systems have also increased significantly. At the same
    time, however, demand for video games for prior-generation
    systems, particularly the original Xbox and the Nintendo
    GameCube, has declined. Given its significant installed base and
    ongoing popularity outside of North America, we expect to
    continue developing and marketing new titles for the PlayStation
    2 in fiscal 2009. We only expect to release one title for the
    original Xbox and no titles for the Nintendo GameCube in fiscal
    2009. The new systems are more complex than their predecessors
    (

e.g.

, some use multi-processor technology, new and
    unique game controllers, online gameplay functionality and high
    definition video capabilities) and development costs have been
    greater on a per-title basis than development costs for
    prior-generation video game systems.

Proposed
    Acquisition of Take-Two Interactive Software

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we announced a proposal to
    acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock
    of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (“Take-Two”),
    for a total purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion
    (including fees and expenses). Take-Two’s Board of
    Directors has stated that our offer undervalues the company and
    is not in the best interests of stockholders. If we were to
    acquire Take-Two, we expect the acquisition would have a
    material impact on our future financial position and results of
    operations and cash flows. Although the offer is not conditional
    upon any financing arrangements, our Board of Directors has
    authorized us to obtain additional financing, a portion of which
    may be used in part to fund the acquisition. There can be no
    assurance that we will acquire Take-Two.

Our
    Operating Structure

Following our fiscal 2008 reorganization, our business is
    organized around four operating labels — EA Games, EA
    SPORTS, The Sims and EA Casual Entertainment — and an
    additional group that works closely with the labels —
    Global Publishing. Each label is structured to operate globally
    and includes several key functions including development
    studios, product marketing, and planning for products and
    services. Global Publishing operates in three regions, North
    America, Europe and Asia. Global Publishing works in partnership
    with the labels and is responsible for strategic planning, field
    marketing, sales, distribution, operations, product
    certification, quality assurance, motion capture, art
    outsourcing and localization within the local markets in which
    we operate.

In fiscal 2008, we generated approximately 55 percent of
    our net revenue from games developed by our studios that were
    initially released during the year, as compared to approximately
    65 percent in fiscal 2007. Excluding titles developed for
    cellular handsets, during fiscal 2008 we released 34 titles
    developed by our studios compared to 32 titles in fiscal 2007.
    For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    research and development expenses were $1,145 million,
    $1,041 million and $758 million, respectively.

EA
    Games Label

The EA Games label is home to the largest number of our studios
    and development teams, which together create an expansive and
    diverse portfolio of games, such as action-adventure, role
    playing, racing and combat games, marketed under the EA brand.
    In addition to traditional packaged-goods games, EA Games also



develops massively-multiplayer online role-playing games which
    are persistent state virtual worlds where thousands of other
    players can interact with one another. For example, we expect to
    launch

Warhammer Online

in the coming fiscal year. The EA
    Games portfolio includes several established franchises such as
    Need for Speed, Battlefield, Mercenaries and Burnout. In
    addition, EA Games has recently launched new franchises
    including SKATE and Army of Two, and has additional titles in
    development. EA Games titles are developed primarily at the
    following EA studios: Bioware (located in Edmonton, Canada and
    Austin, Texas), Black Box (located in Vancouver, Canada),
    Criterion (located in Guildford, England), DICE (located in
    Stockholm, Sweden), EA Los Angeles, EA Montreal, EA Redwood
    Shores, Maxis (located in Emeryville, California), EA Mythic
    (located in Fairfax, Virginia), Pandemic Studios (located in Los
    Angeles, California and Brisbane, Australia) and Phenomic
    (located in Ingelheim, Germany).

EA Games also includes the EA Partners group, which teams with
    external game developers and third party companies, to provide
    these partners with a variety of services including development,
    publishing, and distribution. For example, in fiscal 2008,
    through a co-publishing agreement with Crytek, we released

Crysis

®

on the PC, and we signed a distribution agreement with
    Harmonix, a subsidiary of Viacom, to distribute

Rock Band

.

EA
    SPORTS Label

The EA SPORTS label brings together a wide collection of
    sports-based video games marketed under the EA SPORTS brand. EA
    SPORTS games range from simulated sports titles with realistic
    graphics based on real-world sports leagues, players, events and
    venues to more casual games with arcade-style gameplay and
    graphics. We seek to release new iterations of many of our EA
    SPORTS titles on a regular basis (often annually), in connection
    with the commencement of a sports league’s season or a
    major sporting event when appropriate. Our EA SPORTS franchises
    include FIFA Soccer, Madden NFL Football, Fight Night, NBA Live,
    NCAA Football, NCAA March Madness, Tiger Woods PGA Tour, NHL
    Hockey, Nascar and Rugby. EA SPORTS games are developed
    primarily at our EA Canada (located in Vancouver, British
    Columbia) and EA Tiburon studios (located in Orlando, Florida),
    and, to a lesser extent, use several development studios
    highlighted in the EA Games label description above.

In addition to packaged goods games, the EA SPORTS label offers
    online-only games and entertainment. In Korea, EA SPORTS
    currently offers

EA SPORTS FIFA Online

, a free-to-play
    online game in which players may purchase additional in-game
    content from us (we refer to these consumer purchases of small
    elements of additional content as
    “micro-transactions”). We expect to introduce other
    online games under the EA SPORTS brand in the future. In fiscal
    2009, EA SPORTS will also seek to increase its global presence
    through the introduction of new web-based communities centered
    on our portfolio of sports games.

The
    Sims Label

The Sims label develops and markets life-simulation games and
    online communities with an emphasis on creativity, community and
    humor.

The Sims has sold over 100 million units world-wide since
    it was originally launched in 2000. A significant factor in its
    success has been the regular introduction of expansion packs
    with new content and gameplay features that can be purchased and
    used in connection with our core products,

The Sims

and

The Sims 2

. In fiscal 2008, The Sims label launched two
    expansion packs for

The Sims 2

.

In addition to our expansion packs, The Sims label also launched
    several console products in fiscal 2008, most notably

MySims

tm

— a newly created franchise for the Wii and Nintendo
    DS — and

The Sims 2 Castaway

on the Wii,
    Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2 and PSP.

The Sims 2

online community has 4 million unique
    visitors monthly, with localized communities in 15 countries.
    The centerpiece of this community is the user exchange, where
    users can download both EA and user-created content for use in
    their

The Sims 2

core game. To date, there have been over
    60 million downloads of content from

The Sims 2

exchange.



The Sims label offers a variety of other online communities
    including

The Sims On Stage

— a creative
    community featuring karaoke, comedy, poetry, and movie mashups.

EA
    Casual Entertainment Label

The EA Casual Entertainment label is focused on creating
    compelling casual games for a mass audience of core and non-core
    gamers alike. Casual games are intended to be easily accessible,
    requiring a minimum time commitment to learn, play and enjoy. EA
    Casual Entertainment is responsible for a broad portfolio of
    games designed for consoles, handhelds and PCs (including
    Pogo.com

,

our online casual games and community website),
    as well as cellular phones (through EA Mobile).

Pogo

tm

.  Through
    our Pogo online service, we offer casual games such as card
    games, puzzle games and word games. We had over 1.6 million
    paying Club Pogo subscribers as of March 31, 2008, up from
    1.5 million paying subscribers as of March 31, 2007.
    In addition to paid subscriptions, Pogo also generates revenue
    through online advertising and sales of digital content. We are
    continuing to expand our Pogo offerings in Europe.

EA Mobile.

Through EA Mobile, we are a leading
    global publisher of games and other content (ringtones, images,
    etc.) for cellular handsets. Our customers typically purchase
    and download our games through a wireless carrier’s branded

e-commerce

service accessed directly from their cellular handsets.

We engage third parties to develop games for cellular handsets
    on our behalf at their own development and production studios
    and, to a lesser extent, we develop cellular handset games
    internally at our development and production studios located in
    the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Romania and
    India. In fiscal 2008, we released over 30 games for cellular
    handsets.

Many of our EA Mobile games are designed to take advantage of
    multimedia enhancements in the latest generation of cellular
    handsets, including high-resolution color displays, increased
    processing power, improved audio capabilities and increased
    memory capabilities. We publish games in multiple categories
    designed to appeal to a broad range of wireless subscribers.

Hasbro.

In August 2007, we entered into a
    strategic relationship with Hasbro through which we can create
    digital games based upon a significant number of Hasbro’s
    classic board games and toys, including

MONOPOLY

,

SCRABBLE

(North America only),

YAHTZEE, TRIVIAL
    PURSUIT, NERF, G.I. JOE,

and

LITTLEST PET SHOP

. We
    intend to develop Hasbro’s properties into video games for
    children, families and casual gamers and to publish them across
    a variety of platforms including cellular handsets, handhelds,
    PCs and consoles.

Console, Handheld and PC Games.

EA Casual
    Entertainment works with third party developers and oversees
    internal studios and development teams located in Los Angeles,
    Montreal, Salt Lake City and the United Kingdom that are
    responsible for console, handheld and PC games geared primarily
    towards children, families, and other casual gamers. In fiscal
    2008, these games included

Harry Potter and the Order of the
    Phoenix

tm

,

Boogie

tm

,
    and

Smarty
    Pants

tm

.
    For fiscal 2009, EA Casual is releasing a number of new titles,
    including

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood
    Prince

tm

,
    Boom
    Blox

tm

,
    and

ZUBO

tm

as well as several new titles based on well-known Hasbro games
    and toys.

Global
    Publishing Organization

Our Global Publishing Organization operates in three regions,
    North America, Europe and Asia. These organizations work closely
    with each label to publish (

i.e.,

market, sell and
    distribute) our products (other than EA Mobile games).

Our North America publishing organization is headquartered in
    Redwood City, California. We have local offices in several
    states including California, Washington and New York, among
    others. We also have a distribution center in Kentucky. North
    America net revenue increased by 17 percent to
    $1.942 billion, or 53 percent of total net revenue in
    fiscal 2008, as compared to $1.666 billion, or
    54 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2007.



Internationally, we conduct business and have wholly-owned
    subsidiaries throughout the world, including offices in Europe,
    Australia, Asia and Latin America. International net revenue
    increased by 21 percent to $1.723 billion, or
    47 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2008, compared to
    $1.425 billion, or 46 percent of total net revenue in
    fiscal 2007.

Our international and European regional publishing organization
    headquarters is located in Geneva, Switzerland. We have local
    offices in several European countries including England, France
    and Germany, among others. We also have European distribution
    centers in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe.

We also have a regional publishing headquarters located in
    Singapore. We have local offices in several Asia Pacific
    countries including Australia, Japan and New Zealand.

The amounts of net revenue and long-lived assets attributable to
    each of our geographic regions for each of the last three fiscal
    years are set forth in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this report.

The console, PC and handheld games that we publish are made
    available to consumers as packaged goods (usually in Blu-ray
    Disc, CD, DVD, cartridge or Universal Media Disc format) that
    are typically sold in retail stores and through online stores
    (including our own online store). In North America and Europe,
    our largest markets, we sell these packaged goods products
    primarily to retailers, including mass market retailers (such as
    Wal-Mart), electronics specialty stores (such as Best Buy) or
    game software specialty stores (such as GameStop). Many of our
    PC products and related content (such as booster packs,
    expansion packs and smaller pieces of game content) can also be
    purchased over the Internet through digital download.

Our global sales network allows us to market, publish and
    distribute games for all labels in over 35 countries throughout
    the world. We generated approximately 95 percent of our
    North American net revenue from direct sales to retailers in
    fiscal 2008, with the remaining net revenue being generated
    through a limited number of specialized and regional
    distributors and rack jobbers in markets where we believe direct
    sales would not be economical. Outside of North America, we
    derive revenue primarily from direct sales to retailers. In a
    few of our smaller markets, we sell our products through
    distributors with whom we have agreements. We also distribute
    products of other companies through our rack jobbing business in
    Switzerland. We had direct sales to GameStop Corp. which
    represented approximately 13 percent and 12 percent of
    total net revenue in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. We also
    had direct sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. which represented
    approximately 12 percent of total net revenue in fiscal
    2008 and 13 percent of total net revenue in both fiscal
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

Marketing activities conducted by the Global Publishing
    Organization primarily focus on television and online
    advertising, but also include print advertising, retail
    merchandising, website development, event sponsorship, and trade
    shows.

Our Central Development Services group, which is part of our
    Global Publishing Organization, provides development services to
    our labels, such as product localization, quality assurance and
    certification, motion capture, art outsourcing and media
    mastering. Each service is essential to the development and
    publishing of our games. By grouping these services together
    within a single, centralized organization, we expect to achieve
    cost savings through greater scale and efficiency, while
    improving the overall quality of our games by providing more
    sophisticated and robust services than any of our labels could
    sustain on its own. Key components of Central Development
    Services’ strategy are outsourcing to third parties and
    moving work offshore to lower-cost markets.

Competition

Our industry is intensely competitive. We compete for the
    leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers with other
    video game companies, as well as with other providers of
    different forms of entertainment, such as motion pictures,
    television, social networking, online casual entertainment and
    music. Our competitors vary in size from very small companies
    with limited resources to very large, diversified corporations
    with global operations and greater financial resources than ours.



We also face heavy competition from other video game companies
    and large media companies to obtain license agreements for the
    right to use some of the intellectual property included in our
    products. Some of these content licenses are controlled by the
    diversified media companies, which, in some cases, have decided
    to publish their own games based on popular entertainment
    properties that they control, rather than licensing the content
    to a video game company such as us.

Competition
    in Sales of Packaged Goods

Our packaged goods business is characterized by the continuous
    introduction of innovative new titles and the development of new
    technologies. Competition is also based on product quality and
    features, timing of product releases, brand-name recognition,
    availability and quality of in-game content, access to
    distribution channels, effectiveness of marketing and price.

For sales of packaged goods, we compete directly with Sony,
    Microsoft and Nintendo, each of which develop and publish
    software for their respective console platforms. We also compete
    with numerous companies which, like us, develop and publish
    video games that operate on these consoles and on PCs and
    handheld game players. These competitors include Activision,
    Atari, Capcom, Koei, Konami, LucasArts, Midway, Namco, Sega,
    Take-Two Interactive, THQ and Ubisoft. Diversified media
    companies such as Fox, Disney, Time Warner, Viacom and Vivendi
    are also expanding their software game publishing efforts.

Competition
    in Sales for Cellular Handsets

The wireless entertainment applications market segment, for
    which we develop and publish games, ring tones, music, video and
    wallpapers for cellular handsets, is highly competitive and
    characterized by frequent product introductions, rapidly
    evolving wireless platforms and new technologies. As demand for
    applications continues to increase, we expect new competitors to
    enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more
    resources to develop and market competing applications. As a
    result, we expect competition in the wireless entertainment
    market segment to intensify.

Current and potential competitors in the wireless entertainment
    applications market segment include major media companies,
    traditional video game publishing companies, wireless carriers,
    wireless software providers and other companies that specialize
    in wireless entertainment applications. We also compete with
    wireless content aggregators, who pool applications from
    multiple developers (and sometimes publishers) and offer them to
    carriers or through other sales channels. In addition, new and
    existing competitors are beginning to offer wireless
    entertainment applications on an ad-supported basis. Currently,
    we consider our primary competitors in the wireless
    entertainment applications market segment to be Disney, Fox
    Mobile Entertainment, Gameloft, Glu Mobile, Hands-On Mobile,
    Namco, Sony Pictures and THQ Wireless.

Competition
    in Online Gaming Services

The online games market segment is also highly competitive and
    characterized by frequent product introductions, new and
    evolving business models and new platforms. As the proportion of
    households with a broadband connection continues to grow, we
    expect new competitors to enter the market and existing
    competitors to allocate more resources toward developing online
    games services. As a result, we expect competition in the online
    games services market segment to intensify.

Our current and potential competitors in the online games market
    segment include major media companies, traditional video game
    publishing companies, and companies that specialize in online
    games. In the massively multiplayer online game business our
    competitors include Atari, Midway, NC Soft, Sony and Vivendi
    Games. Competing providers of other kinds of online games
    include MSN, Popcap, Real, AOL, Yahoo! and Nexon.

Intellectual
    Property

Like other entertainment companies, our business is
    significantly based on the creation, acquisition, exploitation
    and protection of intellectual property. Some of this
    intellectual property is in the form of software code, patented
    technology, and other technology and trade secrets that we use
    to develop our games and to make



them run properly. Other intellectual property is in the form of
    audio-visual elements that consumers can see, hear and interact
    with when they are playing our games — we call this
    form of intellectual property “content”.

Our products embody a number of separate forms of intellectual
    property protection:

•

The software and the content of our products are copyrighted;

•

Our products may use patented inventions

and/or

trade
    secrets;

•

Our product brands and names may be trademarks of ours or others;

•

Our products may contain voices and likenesses of actors,
    athletes, celebrities

and/or

commentators (which may be protected by personal publicity
    rights), and

•

Our products often contain musical compositions and recordings
    that are also copyrighted.

Our products also may contain content licensed from others, such
    as trademarks, fictional characters, storylines and software
    code.

We develop products from wholly-owned intellectual properties we
    create within our own studios. We also acquire the rights to
    include proprietary intellectual property in our products
    through acquisitions. We also enter into content license
    agreements such as those with sports leagues and player
    associations, movie studios and performing talent, music labels,
    music publishers and musicians. These licenses are typically
    limited to use of the licensed rights in products for specific
    time periods. In addition, our products that play on game
    consoles, handhelds and cellular handsets include technology
    that is owned by the console or handset manufacturer and
    licensed non-exclusively to us for use. We also license
    technology from providers other than console and handset
    manufacturers. While we may have renewal rights for some
    licenses, our business and the justification for the development
    of many of our products is dependent on our ability to continue
    to obtain the intellectual property rights from the owners of
    these rights on reasonable terms and at reasonable rates.

As with other forms of entertainment, our products are
    susceptible to unauthorized copying. We typically distribute our
    PC products using copy protection technology that we license
    from other companies. In addition, console manufacturers
    typically incorporate security devices in their consoles in an
    effort to prevent the use of unlicensed products. Our primary
    protection against unauthorized use, duplication and
    distribution of our products is enforcement of our copyright and
    trademark interests. We typically own the copyright to the
    software code as well as the brand or title name trademark under
    which our products are marketed. We register our copyrights and
    trademarks in the United States and other countries.

Significant
    Relationships

Console
    Manufacturers

Sony.

Under the terms of agreements we have
    entered into with Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. and its
    affiliates, we are authorized to develop and distribute
    disk-based software products and online content compatible with
    the PlayStation 2, PLAYSTATION 3 and PSP. Pursuant to these
    agreements, we engage Sony to supply PlayStation 2, PLAYSTATION
    3 and PSP disks for our products.

Microsoft.

Under the terms of agreements we
    have entered into with Microsoft Corporation and its affiliates,
    we are authorized to develop and distribute DVD-based software
    products and online content compatible with the Xbox 360.

Nintendo.

Under the terms of agreements we
    have entered into with Nintendo Co., Ltd. and its affiliates, we
    are authorized to develop and distribute proprietary optical
    format disk products and cartridges compatible with the Wii and
    the Nintendo DS. Pursuant to these agreements, we engage
    Nintendo to supply Wii proprietary optical format disk products
    and Nintendo DS cartridges for our products.

Wireless
    Carriers

We have agreements to distribute our wireless applications
    through more than 160 carriers in over 50 countries. Our
    customers download our applications to their cellular handsets
    and their wireless carrier



invoices them a one-time fee or monthly subscription fee. Our
    carrier distribution agreements establish the fees to be
    retained by the carrier for distributing our applications. These
    arrangements are typically terminable on short notice. The
    agreements generally do not obligate the carriers to market or
    distribute any of our applications.

Content
    Licensors

Many of our products are based on or incorporate content and
    trademarks owned by others. For example, our products include
    rights licensed from third parties, including major movie
    studios, publishers, artists, authors, celebrities, traditional
    game and toy companies, athletes and the major sports leagues
    and players associations.

Inventory,
    Working Capital, Backlog, Manufacturing and Suppliers

For all of our labels, we manage inventory by communicating with
    our customers prior to the release of our products, and then
    using our industry experience to forecast demand on a

product-by-product

and

territory-by-territory

basis. Historically, we have experienced high turnover of our
    products, and the lead times on re-orders of our products are
    generally short (

e.g.,

approximately two to three weeks).
    Further, as discussed in “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”,
    we have practices in place with our customers (such as stock
    balancing and price protection) that reduce product returns.

We typically ship orders immediately upon receipt. To the extent
    that any backlog may or may not exist at the end of a reporting
    period, it would be both coincidental and an unreliable
    indicator of future results of any period.

In many instances, we are able to acquire materials on a
    volume-discount basis. We have multiple potential sources of
    supply for most materials, except for the disk component of our
    PLAYSTATION 3, PlayStation 2, PSP and Wii and Nintendo DS
    cartridges.

Our online games and cellular handset applications are delivered
    digitally, and therefore, are not manufactured.

Seasonality

Our business is highly seasonal. We have historically
    experienced our highest sales volume in the holiday season
    quarter ending in December and a seasonal low in sales volume in
    the quarter ending in June. Starting in fiscal 2008, we began to
    defer the recognition of a significant amount of net revenue
    related to our online-enabled packaged goods over an extended
    period of time (

i.e.,

typically six months). As a result,
    the quarter in which we generate the highest sales volume may be
    different than the quarter in which we recognize the highest
    amount of net revenue. Our results can also vary based on a
    number of factors, including title release dates, consumer
    demand for our products, shipment schedules and our revenue
    recognition policies.

Employees

As of March 31, 2008, we had approximately 9,000 regular,
    full-time employees, of whom over 5,100 were outside the United
    States. We believe that our ability to attract and retain
    qualified employees is a critical factor in the successful
    development of our products and that our future success will
    depend, in large measure, on our ability to continue to attract
    and retain qualified employees. Less than 3 percent of our
    employees, all of whom work for DICE, our Swedish development
    studio, are represented by a union, guild or other collective
    bargaining organization.

Item 1A:

Risk
    Factors

Our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, which
    may affect our future financial performance. If any of the
    events or circumstances described below occurs, our business and
    financial performance could be harmed, our actual results could
    differ materially from our expectations and the market value of
    our stock could decline. The risks and uncertainties discussed
    below are not the only ones we face. There may be additional
    risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we
    currently do not believe are material that may harm our business
    and financial performance.



Our business is highly dependent on the success and
    availability of video game hardware systems manufactured by
    third parties, as well as our ability to develop commercially
    successful products for these systems.

We derive most of our revenue from the sale of products for play
    on video game hardware systems (which we also refer to as
    “platforms”) manufactured by third parties, such as
    Sony’s PlayStation 2 and PLAYSTATION 3,
    Microsoft’s Xbox 360 and Nintendo’s Wii. The success
    of our business is driven in large part by the commercial
    success and adequate supply of these video game hardware
    systems, our ability to accurately predict which systems will be
    successful in the marketplace, and our ability to develop
    commercially successful products for these systems. We must make
    product development decisions and commit significant resources
    well in advance of anticipated product ship dates. A platform
    for which we are developing products may not succeed or may have
    a shorter life cycle than anticipated. If consumer demand for
    the systems for which we are developing products is lower than
    our expectations, our revenue will suffer, we may be unable to
    fully recover the investments we have made in developing our
    products, and our financial performance will be harmed.
    Alternatively, a system for which we have not devoted
    significant resources could be more successful than we had
    initially anticipated, causing us to miss out on meaningful
    revenue opportunities.

Our industry is cyclical, driven by the transition from older
    video game hardware systems to new ones. As we continue to move
    through the current cycle, our operating results may be volatile
    and difficult to predict.

Video game hardware systems have historically had a life cycle
    of four to six years, which causes the video game software
    market to be cyclical as well. The current cycle began with
    Microsoft’s launch of the Xbox 360 in 2005, and
    continued in 2006 when Sony and Nintendo launched their
    next-generation systems, the PLAYSTATION 3 and the Wii,
    respectively. During fiscal 2008, the installed base of each of
    these systems continued to expand and, as a result, sales of our
    products for these systems have also increased significantly. At
    the same time, however, demand for video games for
    prior-generation systems, particularly the original Xbox and the
    Nintendo GameCube, has declined significantly. Although we
    expect to continue developing and marketing new titles for the
    prior-generation PlayStation 2 in fiscal 2009, we only expect to
    release one title for the original Xbox and no titles for the
    Nintendo GameCube. As a result, we expect our sales of video
    games for prior-generation systems to continue to decline. The
    decline in prior-generation product sales, particularly the
    PlayStation 2, may be greater or faster than we anticipate, and
    sales of products for the new platforms may be lower or increase
    more slowly than we anticipate. Moreover, we expect development
    costs for the new video game systems to continue to be greater
    on a per-title basis than development costs for prior-generation
    video game systems. As a result of these factors, during the
    next several quarters, we expect our operating results to be
    more volatile and difficult to predict, which could cause our
    stock price to fluctuate significantly.

If we do not consistently meet our product development
    schedules, our operating results will be adversely affected.

Our business is highly seasonal, with the highest levels of
    consumer demand and a significant percentage of our sales
    occurring in the December quarter. In addition, we seek to
    release many of our products in conjunction with specific
    events, such as the release of a related movie or the beginning
    of a sports season or major sporting event. If we miss these key
    selling periods for any reason, including product delays or
    delayed introduction of a new platform for which we have
    developed products, our sales will suffer disproportionately.
    Likewise, if a key event to which our product release schedule
    is tied were to be delayed or cancelled, our sales would also
    suffer disproportionately. Our ability to meet product
    development schedules is affected by a number of factors,
    including the creative processes involved, the coordination of
    large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams
    required by the increasing complexity of our products and the
    platforms for which they are developed, and the need to
    fine-tune our products prior to their release. We have
    experienced development delays for our products in the past,
    which caused us to push back release dates. In the future, any
    failure to meet anticipated production or release schedules
    would likely result in a delay of revenue

and/or

possibly a significant shortfall in our revenue, harm our
    profitability, and cause our operating results to be materially
    different than anticipated.



Our business is intensely competitive and “hit”
    driven. If we do not continue to deliver “hit”
    products and services or if consumers prefer our
    competitors’ products or services over our own, our
    operating results could suffer.

Competition in our industry is intense and we expect new
    competitors to continue to emerge in the United States and
    abroad. While many new products and services are regularly
    introduced, only a relatively small number of “hit”
    titles accounts for a significant portion of total revenue in
    our industry. Hit products or services offered by our
    competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we
    anticipate, which could cause revenue generated from our
    products and services to fall below expectations. If our
    competitors develop more successful products or services, offer
    competitive products or services at lower price points or based
    on payment models perceived as offering a better value
    proposition (such as pay-for-play or subscription-based models),
    or if we do not continue to develop consistently high-quality
    and well-received products and services, our revenue, margins,
    and profitability will decline.

We have recently reorganized our business and operating
    structure. We may encounter a variety of issues in connection
    with the reorganization that could negatively impact our
    operating results, financial condition and ability to report our
    financial results.

In an effort to streamline our internal decision-making
    processes, improve our global focus, and accelerate the process
    of bringing new ideas to market, we have reorganized our
    business into several new divisions, including four new labels.
    The reorganization presents a number of ongoing operational
    challenges, which, if not successfully managed, could cause our
    operating results to suffer in the near-term

and/or

delay
    or inhibit the anticipated benefits of the reorganization.
    Implementing any reorganization necessarily requires time and
    focus from all levels of the organization — time and
    focus that may be taken away from other business needs. For
    example, as our employees assume new responsibilities under the
    new structure, their responsibilities under the old structure
    may not be successfully re-assigned or adequately addressed,
    which could result in operational problems that negatively
    impact our financial condition and operating results. Similarly,
    as our employees’ roles and responsibilities change in a
    new structure, it is possible that we could experience a greater
    loss of key personnel than we have historically.

Technology changes rapidly in our business and if we fail to
    anticipate or successfully implement new technologies or the
    manner in which people play our games, the quality, timeliness
    and competitiveness of our products and services will suffer.

Rapid technology changes in our industry require us to
    anticipate, sometimes years in advance, which technologies we
    must implement and take advantage of in order to make our
    products and services competitive in the market. Therefore, we
    usually start our product development with a range of technical
    development goals that we hope to be able to achieve. We may not
    be able to achieve these goals, or our competition may be able
    to achieve them more quickly and effectively than we can. In
    either case, our products and services may be technologically
    inferior to our competitors’, less appealing to consumers,
    or both. If we cannot achieve our technology goals within the
    original development schedule of our products and services, then
    we may delay their release until these technology goals can be
    achieved, which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our
    development expenses. Alternatively, we may increase the
    resources employed in research and development in an attempt to
    accelerate our development of new technologies, either to
    preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up
    with our competition, which would increase our development
    expenses.

The video game hardware manufacturers set the royalty rates
    and other fees that we must pay to publish games for their
    platforms, and therefore have significant influence on our
    costs. If one or more of these manufacturers change their fee
    structure, our profitability will be materially impacted.

In order to publish products for a video game system such as the
    Xbox 360, PLAYSTATION 3 or Wii, we must take a license from the
    manufacturer, which gives it the opportunity to set the fee
    structure that we must pay in order to publish games for that
    platform. Similarly, certain manufacturers have retained the
    flexibility to change their fee structures, or adopt different
    fee structures for online gameplay and other new features for
    their consoles. The control that hardware manufacturers have
    over the fee structures for their platforms and



online access could adversely impact our costs, profitability
    and margins. Because publishing products for video game systems
    is the largest portion of our business, any increase in fee
    structures would significantly harm our ability to generate
    revenues

and/or

profits.

The video game hardware manufacturers are among our chief
    competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of

and/or

access to our video game products. If they do not approve our
    products, we will be unable to ship to our customers.

Our agreements with hardware licensors (such as Sony for the
    PLAYSTATION 3, Microsoft for the Xbox 360, and Nintendo for the
    Wii) typically give significant control to the licensor over the
    approval and manufacturing of our products, which could, in
    certain circumstances, leave us unable to get our products
    approved, manufactured and shipped to customers. These hardware
    licensors are also among our chief competitors. Generally,
    control of the approval and manufacturing process by the
    hardware licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times
    and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently.
    While we believe that our relationships with our hardware
    licensors are currently good, the potential for these licensors
    to delay or refuse to approve or manufacture our products
    exists. Such occurrences would harm our business and our
    financial performance.

We also require compatibility code and the consent of Microsoft,
    Sony and Nintendo in order to include online capabilities in our
    products for their respective platforms. As online capabilities
    for video game systems become more significant, Microsoft, Sony
    and Nintendo could restrict the manner in which we provide
    online capabilities for our products. If Microsoft, Sony or
    Nintendo refused to approve our products with online
    capabilities or significantly impacted the financial terms on
    which these services are offered to our customers, our business
    could be harmed.

If we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to
    intellectual property, we will publish fewer hit titles and our
    revenue, profitability and cash flows will decline. Competition
    for these licenses may make them more expensive and reduce our
    profitability.

Many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual
    property owned by others. For example, our EA SPORTS products
    include rights licensed from major sports leagues and
    players’ associations. Similarly, many of our other hit
    franchises, such as The Godfather, Harry Potter and Lord of the
    Rings, are based on key film and literary licenses. Competition
    for these licenses is intense. If we are unable to maintain
    these licenses or obtain additional licenses with significant
    commercial value, our revenues and profitability will decline
    significantly. Competition for these licenses may also drive up
    the advances, guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the
    licensor, which could significantly increase our costs and
    reduce our profitability.

Our business is subject to risks generally associated with
    the entertainment industry, any of which could significantly
    harm our operating results.

Our business is subject to risks that are generally associated
    with the entertainment industry, many of which are beyond our
    control. These risks could negatively impact our operating
    results and include: the popularity, price and timing of our
    games and the platforms on which they are played; economic
    conditions that adversely affect discretionary consumer
    spending; changes in consumer demographics; the availability and
    popularity of other forms of entertainment; and critical reviews
    and public tastes and preferences, which may change rapidly and
    cannot necessarily be predicted.

If we do not continue to attract and retain key personnel, we
    will be unable to effectively conduct our business.

The market for technical, creative, marketing and other
    personnel essential to the development and marketing of our
    products and management of our businesses is extremely
    competitive. Our leading position within the interactive
    entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of
    executives and key creative talent. If we cannot successfully
    recruit and retain the employees we need, or replace key
    employees following their departure, our ability to develop and
    manage our business will be impaired.



Acquisitions, investments and other strategic transactions
    could result in operating difficulties, dilution to our
    investors and other negative consequences.

We have engaged in, evaluated, and expect to continue to engage
    in and evaluate, a wide array of potential strategic
    transactions, including (i) acquisitions of companies,
    businesses, intellectual properties, and other assets,
    (ii) minority investments in strategic partners, and
    (iii) investments in new interactive entertainment
    businesses (for example, online and mobile games). Any of these
    strategic transactions could be material to our financial
    condition and results of operations. Although we regularly
    search for opportunities to engage in strategic transactions, we
    may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities. We
    may not be able to consummate potential acquisitions or
    investments or an acquisition or investment we do consummate may
    not enhance our business or may decrease rather than increase
    our earnings. The process of acquiring and integrating a company
    or business, or successfully exploiting acquired intellectual
    property or other assets, could divert a significant amount of
    resources as well as our management’s time and focus and
    may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures,
    particularly for a large acquisition. Additional risks and
    variations of the foregoing risks we face include:

•

The need to implement or remediate controls, procedures and
    policies appropriate for a public company in an acquired company
    that, prior to the acquisition, lacked these controls,
    procedures and policies,

•

Cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from
    an acquired company or business into our organization,

•

Retaining key employees and maintaining the key business and
    customer relationships of the businesses we acquire,

•

The need to integrate an acquired company’s accounting,
    management information, human resource and other administrative
    systems to permit effective management and timely reporting,

•

The possibility that we will not discover important facts during
    due diligence that could have a material adverse impact on the
    value of the businesses we acquire, and

•

Potential impairment charges incurred to write down the carrying
    amount of intangible assets generated as a result of an
    acquisition,

•

Litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of
    claims or litigation risks as a result of, an acquisition,
    including claims from terminated employees, customers or other
    third parties,

•

Significant accounting charges resulting from the completion and
    integration of a sizeable acquisition and increased capital
    expenditures,

•

Significant acquisition-related accounting adjustments,
    particularly relating to an acquired company’s deferred
    revenue, that may cause reported revenue and profits of the
    combined company to be lower than the sum of their stand-alone
    revenue and profits,

•

The possibility that the combined company would not achieve the
    expected benefits, including any anticipated operating and
    product synergies, of the acquisition as quickly as anticipated,

•

The possibility that the costs of, or operational difficulties
    arising from, an acquisition would be greater than anticipated,

•

To the extent that we engage in strategic transactions outside
    of the United States, we face additional risks, including risks
    related to integration of operations across different cultures
    and languages, currency risks and the particular economic,
    political and regulatory risks associated with specific
    countries, and

•

The possibility that a change of control of a company we acquire
    triggers a termination of contractual or intellectual property
    rights important to the operation of its business.

Future acquisitions and investments could also involve the
    issuance of our equity and equity-linked securities (potentially
    diluting our existing stockholders), the incurrence of debt,
    contingent liabilities or amortization



expenses, write-offs of goodwill, intangibles, or acquired
    in-process technology, or other increased cash and non-cash
    expenses such as stock-based compensation. Any of the foregoing
    factors could harm our financial condition or prevent us from
    achieving improvements in our financial condition and operating
    performance that could have otherwise been achieved by us on a
    stand-alone basis. Our stockholders may not have the opportunity
    to review, vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or
    investments.

If patent claims continue to be asserted against us, we may
    be unable to sustain our current business models or profits, or
    we may be precluded from pursuing new business opportunities in
    the future.

Many patents have been issued that may apply to widely-used game
    technologies, or to potential new modes of delivering, playing
    or monetizing game software products. For example, infringement
    claims under many issued patents are now being asserted against
    interactive software or online game sites. Several such claims
    have been asserted against us. We incur substantial expenses in
    evaluating and defending against such claims, regardless of the
    merits of the claims. In the event that there is a determination
    that we have infringed a third-party patent, we could incur
    significant monetary liability and be prevented from using the
    rights in the future, which could negatively impact our
    operating results. We may also discover that future
    opportunities to provide new and innovative modes of game play
    and game delivery to consumers may be precluded by existing
    patents that we are unable to license on reasonable terms.

Other intellectual property claims may increase our product
    costs or require us to cease selling affected products.

Many of our products include extremely realistic graphical
    images, and we expect that as technology continues to advance,
    images will become even more realistic. Some of the images and
    other content are based on real-world examples that may
    inadvertently infringe upon the intellectual property rights of
    others. Although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to
    ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual
    property rights of others, it is possible that third parties
    still may claim infringement. From time to time, we receive
    communications from third parties regarding such claims.
    Existing or future infringement claims against us, whether valid
    or not, may be time consuming and expensive to defend. Such
    claims or litigations could require us to stop selling the
    affected products, redesign those products to avoid
    infringement, or obtain a license, all of which would be costly
    and harm our business.

From time to time we may become involved in other legal
    proceedings which could adversely affect us.

We are currently, and from time to time in the future may
    become, subject to legal proceedings, claims, litigation and
    government investigations or inquiries, which could be
    expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business
    operations. In addition, the outcome of any legal proceedings,
    claims, litigation, investigations or inquiries may be difficult
    to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, operating results, or financial condition.

Our business, our products and our distribution are subject
    to increasing regulation of content, consumer privacy,
    distribution and online hosting and delivery in the key
    territories in which we conduct business. If we do not
    successfully respond to these regulations, our business may
    suffer.

Legislation is continually being introduced that may affect both
    the content of our products and their distribution. For example,
    data and consumer protection laws in the United States and
    Europe impose various restrictions on our web sites. Those rules
    vary by territory although the Internet recognizes no
    geographical boundaries. Other countries, such as Germany, have
    adopted laws regulating content both in packaged games and those
    transmitted over the Internet that are stricter than current
    United States laws. In the United States, the federal and
    several state governments are continually considering content
    restrictions on products such as ours, as well as restrictions
    on distribution of such products. For example, recent
    legislation has been adopted in several states, and could be
    proposed at the federal level, that prohibits the sale of
    certain games (

e.g.

, violent games or those with “M
    (Mature)” or “AO (Adults Only)” ratings) to
    minors. Any one or more of these factors could harm our business
    by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers,
    by limiting the size of the potential market for our products,
    and by requiring costly additional differentiation between
    products for different territories to address varying
    regulations.



If one or more of our titles were found to contain hidden,
    objectionable content, our business could suffer.

Throughout the history of our industry, many video games have
    been designed to include certain hidden content and gameplay
    features that are accessible through the use of in-game cheat
    codes or other technological means that are intended to enhance
    the gameplay experience. However, in several recent cases,
    hidden content or features have been found to be included in
    other publishers’ products by an employee who was not
    authorized to do so or by an outside developer without the
    knowledge of the publisher. From time to time, some hidden
    content and features have contained profanity, graphic violence
    and sexually explicit or otherwise objectionable material. In a
    few cases, the Entertainment Software Ratings Board
    (“ESRB”) has reacted to discoveries of hidden content
    and features by reviewing the rating that was originally
    assigned to the product, requiring the publisher to change the
    game packaging

and/or

fining the publisher. Retailers have on occasion reacted to the
    discovery of such hidden content by removing these games from
    their shelves, refusing to sell them, and demanding that their
    publishers accept them as product returns. Likewise, consumers
    have reacted to the revelation of hidden content by refusing to
    purchase such games, demanding refunds for games they’ve
    already purchased, and refraining from buying other games
    published by the company whose game contained the objectionable
    material.

We have implemented preventative measures designed to reduce the
    possibility of hidden, objectionable content from appearing in
    the video games we publish. Nonetheless, these preventative
    measures are subject to human error, circumvention, overriding,
    and reasonable resource constraints. In addition, to the extent
    we acquire a company without similar controls in place, the
    possibility of hidden, objectionable content appearing in video
    games developed by that company but for which we are ultimately
    responsible could increase. If a video game we published were
    found to contain hidden, objectionable content, the ESRB could
    demand that we recall a game and change its packaging to reflect
    a revised rating, retailers could refuse to sell it and demand
    we accept the return of any unsold copies or returns from
    customers, and consumers could refuse to buy it or demand that
    we refund their money. This could have a material negative
    impact on our operating results and financial condition. In
    addition, our reputation could be harmed, which could impact
    sales of other video games we sell. If any of these consequences
    were to occur, our business and financial performance could be
    significantly harmed.

If we ship defective products, our operating results could
    suffer.

Products such as ours are extremely complex software programs,
    and are difficult to develop, manufacture and distribute. We
    have quality controls in place to detect defects in the
    software, media and packaging of our products before they are
    released. Nonetheless, these quality controls are subject to
    human error, overriding, and reasonable resource constraints.
    Therefore, these quality controls and preventative measures may
    not be effective in detecting defects in our products before
    they have been reproduced and released into the marketplace. In
    such an event, we could be required to recall a product, or we
    may find it necessary to voluntarily recall a product,

and/or

scrap
    defective inventory, which could significantly harm our business
    and operating results.

Our international net revenue is subject to currency
    fluctuations.

For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, international net
    revenue comprised 47 percent of our total net revenue. We
    expect foreign sales to continue to account for a significant
    portion of our total net revenue. Such sales may be subject to
    unexpected regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers.
    Additionally, foreign sales are primarily made in local
    currencies, which may fluctuate against the U.S. dollar. We
    use foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate some foreign
    currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated
    assets and liabilities (primarily certain intercompany
    receivables and payables) and, from time to time, foreign
    currency option contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted
    transactions (primarily related to a portion of the revenue and
    expenses denominated in foreign currency generated by our
    operational subsidiaries). However, these activities do not
    fully protect us from foreign currency fluctuations and, can
    themselves, result in losses. Accordingly, our results of
    operations, including our reported net revenue and net income,
    and financial condition can be adversely affected by unfavorable
    foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the Euro, British
    pound sterling and Canadian dollar.



Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax
    liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial
    condition.

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in
    various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required
    in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, and, in
    the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions
    and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is
    uncertain.

We are also required to estimate what our tax obligations will
    be in the future. Although we believe our tax estimates are
    reasonable, the estimation process and applicable laws are
    inherently uncertain, and our estimates are not binding on tax
    authorities. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected
    by our profit level, by changes in our business or changes in
    our structure resulting from the reorganization of our business
    and operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in
    countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the
    elections we make, changes in applicable tax laws as well as
    other factors. Further, our tax determinations are regularly
    subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those
    audits could adversely affect our income tax provision. Should
    our ultimate tax liability exceed our estimates, our income tax
    provision and net income or loss could be materially affected.

We incur certain tax expenses that do not decline
    proportionately with declines in our consolidated pre-tax income
    or loss. As a result, in absolute dollar terms, our tax expense
    will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower
    levels of pre-tax income or loss than higher levels. In
    addition, at lower levels of pre-tax income or loss, our
    effective tax rate will be more volatile.

We are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes, such
    as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and
    goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various
    foreign jurisdictions. We are regularly under examination by tax
    authorities with respect to these non-income taxes. There can be
    no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations, changes
    in our business or changes in applicable tax rules will not have
    an adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition.

Changes in our worldwide operating structure or the adoption
    of new products and distribution models could have adverse tax
    consequences.

As we expand our international operations, adopt new products
    and new distribution models, implement changes to our operating
    structure or undertake intercompany transactions in light of
    changing tax laws, expiring rulings, acquisitions and our
    current and anticipated business and operational requirements,
    our tax expense could increase. For example, in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2006, we repatriated $375 million under
    the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. As a result, we
    recognized an additional one-time tax expense in fiscal 2006 of
    $17 million.

Our reported financial results could be adversely affected by
    changes in financial accounting standards or by the application
    of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it
    evolves.

As a result of the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the
    review of accounting policies by the SEC and national and
    international accounting standards bodies, the frequency of
    accounting policy changes may accelerate. For example, as
    discussed in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, FIN No. 48 has affected the way we account
    for income taxes and may have a material impact on our financial
    results. Our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standard (“SFAS”) No. 141(R) will have a material
    impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements for material
    acquisitions consummated after March 29, 2009. Similarly,
    changes in accounting standards relating to stock-based
    compensation require us to recognize significantly greater
    expense than we had been recognizing prior to the adoption of
    the new standard. Likewise, policies affecting software revenue
    recognition have and could further significantly affect the way
    we account for revenue related to our products and services. For
    example, we expect a more significant portion of our games will
    be online-enabled in the future and we could be required to
    recognize the related revenue over an extended period of time
    rather than at the time of sale. As we enhance, expand and
    diversify our business and product offerings, the application of
    existing or future financial accounting standards, particularly
    those relating to the way we account for revenue and taxes,
    could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results
    although not necessarily on our cash flows.



The majority of our sales are made to a relatively small
    number of key customers. If these customers reduce their
    purchases of our products or become unable to pay for them, our
    business could be harmed.

In our fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, over
    73 percent of our U.S. sales were made to seven key
    customers. In Europe, our top ten customers accounted for
    approximately 32 percent of our sales in that territory
    during the year ended March 31, 2008. Worldwide, we had
    direct sales to two customers, GameStop Corp. and Wal-Mart
    Stores, which represented approximately 13 percent and
    12 percent, respectively, of total net revenue in the year
    ended March 31, 2008. Though our products are available to
    consumers through a variety of retailers, the concentration of
    our sales in one, or a few, large customers could lead to a
    short-term disruption in our sales if one or more of these
    customers significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to
    carry our products, and could make us more vulnerable to
    collection risk if one or more of these large customers became
    unable to pay for our products. Additionally, our receivables
    from these large customers increase significantly in the
    December quarter as they stock up for the holiday selling
    season. Also, having such a large portion of our total net
    revenue concentrated in a few customers could reduce our
    negotiating leverage with these customers.

Our products are subject to the threat of piracy and
    unauthorized copying, which could negatively impact our growth
    and future profitability.

Software piracy is a persistent problem, particularly in
    countries where laws are less protective of intellectual
    property rights. The global expansion of organized pirate
    operations, the proliferation of technology designed to
    circumvent the protection measures we use in our products, the
    availability of broadband access to the Internet and the ability
    to download pirated copies of our games from various Internet
    sites and through peer-to-peer channels, and the widespread
    proliferation of Internet cafes using pirated copies of our
    products, all have contributed to ongoing and expanding piracy.
    Though we take legal and technical steps to make the
    unauthorized copying and distribution of our products more
    difficult, as do the manufacturers of consoles on which our
    games are played, these efforts may not be successful in
    controlling the piracy of our products. These factors could have
    a negative effect on our growth and profitability in the future.

Our stock price has been volatile and may continue to
    fluctuate significantly.

The market price of our common stock historically has been, and
    we expect will continue to be, subject to significant
    fluctuations. These fluctuations may be due to factors specific
    to us (including those discussed in the risk factors above as
    well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do
    not believe are material), to changes in securities
    analysts’ earnings estimates or ratings, to our results or
    future financial guidance falling below our expectations and
    analysts’ and investors’ expectations, to factors
    affecting the entertainment, computer, software, Internet, media
    or electronics industries, to our ability to successfully
    integrate any acquisitions we may make, or to national or
    international economic conditions.

Redwood
    City Headquarters

In February 1995, we entered into a build-to-suit lease
    (“Phase One Lease”) with a third-party lessor for our
    headquarters facilities in Redwood City, California (“Phase
    One Facilities”). The Phase One Facilities comprise a total
    of approximately 350,000 square feet and provide space for
    sales, marketing, administration and research and development
    functions. In July 2001, the lessor refinanced the Phase One
    Lease with Keybank National Association through July 2006. The
    Phase One Lease expires in January 2039, subject to early
    termination in the event the underlying financing between the
    lessor and its lenders is not extended. Subject to certain terms
    and conditions, we may purchase the Phase One Facilities or
    arrange for the sale of the Phase One Facilities to a third
    party.

Pursuant to the terms of the Phase One Lease, we have an option
    to purchase the Phase One Facilities at any time for a purchase
    price of $132 million. In the event of a sale to a third
    party, if the sale price is less than $132 million, we will
    be obligated to reimburse the difference between the actual sale
    price and $132 million, up to a maximum of
    $117 million, subject to certain provisions of the Phase
    One Lease, as amended.

On May 26, 2006, the lessor extended its loan financing
    underlying the Phase One Lease with its lenders through July
    2007, and on May 14, 2007, the lenders extended this
    financing again for an additional year through July 2008. On
    April 14, 2008, the lenders extended the financing for
    another year through July 2009.



At any time prior to the expiration of the financing in July
    2009, we may re-negotiate the lease and the related financing
    arrangement. We account for the Phase One Lease arrangement as
    an operating lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13,
    “

Accounting for Leases

”, as amended.

In December 2000, we entered into a second build-to-suit lease
    (“Phase Two Lease”) with Keybank National Association
    for a five and one-half year term beginning in December 2000 to
    expand our Redwood City, California headquarters facilities and
    develop adjacent property (“Phase Two Facilities”).
    Construction of the Phase Two Facilities was completed in June
    2002. The Phase Two Facilities comprise a total of approximately
    310,000 square feet and provide space for sales, marketing,
    administration and research and development functions. Subject
    to certain terms and conditions, we may purchase the Phase Two
    Facilities or arrange for the sale of the Phase Two Facilities
    to a third party.

Pursuant to the terms of the Phase Two Lease, we have an option
    to purchase the Phase Two Facilities at any time for a purchase
    price of $115 million. In the event of a sale to a third
    party, if the sale price is less than $115 million, we will
    be obligated to reimburse the difference between the actual sale
    price and $115 million, up to a maximum of
    $105 million, subject to certain provisions of the Phase
    Two Lease, as amended.

On May 26, 2006, the lessor extended the Phase Two Lease
    through July 2009 subject to early termination in the event the
    underlying loan financing between the lessor and its lenders is
    not extended. Concurrently with the extension of the lease, the
    lessor extended the loan financing underlying the Phase Two
    Lease with its lenders through July 2007. On May 14, 2007,
    the lenders extended this financing again for an additional year
    through July 2008. On April 14, 2008, the lenders extended
    the financing for another year through July 2009. At any time
    prior to the expiration of the financing in July 2009, we may
    re-negotiate the lease and the related financing arrangement. We
    account for the Phase Two Lease arrangement as an operating
    lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, as amended.

We believe that, as of March 31, 2008, the estimated fair
    values of both properties under these operating leases exceeded
    their respective guaranteed residual values.

Guildford,
    Orlando, Los Angeles and Vancouver Studios; Louisville
    Distribution Center

In February 2006, we entered into an agreement with an
    independent third party to lease a facility in Guildford,
    Surrey, United Kingdom, which commenced in June 2006 and will
    expire in May 2016. The facility comprises a total of
    approximately 95,000 square feet, which we use for
    administrative, sales and development functions. Our rental
    obligation under this agreement is approximately
    $33 million over the initial ten-year term of the lease.

In June 2004, we entered into a lease agreement, amended in
    December 2005, with an independent third party for a studio
    facility in Orlando, Florida. The lease commenced in January
    2005 and expires in June 2010, with one five-year option to
    extend the lease term. The campus facilities comprise a total of
    140,000 square feet and provide space for research and
    development functions. Our rental obligation over the initial

five-and-a-half

year term of the lease is $15 million.

In July 2003, we entered into a lease agreement with an
    independent third party (the “Landlord”) for a studio
    facility in Los Angeles, California, which commenced in October
    2003 and expires in September 2013 with two five-year options to
    extend the lease term. Additionally, we have options to purchase
    the property after five and ten years based on the fair market
    value of the property at the date of sale, a right of first
    offer to purchase the property upon terms offered by the
    Landlord, and a right to share in the profits from a sale of the
    property. Existing campus facilities comprise a total of
    243,000 square feet and provide space for research and
    development functions. Our rental obligation under this
    agreement is $50 million over the initial ten-year term of
    the lease. This commitment is offset by expected sublease income
    of $6 million for a sublease to an affiliate of the
    Landlord of 18,000 square feet of the Los Angeles facility,
    which commenced in October 2003 and expires in September 2013,
    with options of early termination by either party after October
    2008.

In October 2002, we entered into a lease agreement, with an
    independent third party for a studio facility in Vancouver,
    British Columbia, Canada, which commenced in May 2003 and
    expires in April 2013. We amended the lease in October 2003. The
    facility comprises a total of approximately 65,000 square
    feet and



provides space for research and development functions. Our
    rental obligation under this agreement is approximately
    $16 million over the initial ten-year term of the lease.

Our North American distribution is supported by a centralized
    warehouse facility that we lease in Louisville, Kentucky,
    occupying 250,000 square feet.

In addition to the properties discussed above, we have other
    properties under lease which have been included in our
    restructuring costs as discussed in Note 6 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
    this report. While we continually evaluate our facility
    requirements, we believe that suitable additional or substitute
    space will be available as needed to accommodate our future
    needs.

Item 3:

Legal
    Proceedings

We are subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary
    course of business. We do not believe that any liability from
    any reasonably foreseeable disposition of such claims and
    litigation, individually or in the aggregate, would have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
    or results of operations.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

OVERVIEW

The following overview is a top-level discussion of our
    operating results as well as some of the trends and drivers that
    affect our business. Management believes that an understanding
    of these trends and drivers is important in order to understand
    our results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, as
    well as our future prospects. This summary is not intended to be
    exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the
    detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this

Form 10-K,

including in the “Business” section and the “Risk
    Factors” above, the remainder of “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations”, or the Consolidated Financial Statements and
    related notes.

About
    Electronic Arts

We develop, market, publish and distribute video game software
    and content that can be played by consumers on a variety of
    platforms, including video game consoles (such as the Sony
    PlayStation

®

    and
    PLAYSTATION

®

3,
    Microsoft Xbox

tm

and Nintendo
    Wii

tm

),
    personal computers, handheld game players (such as the
    PlayStation

®

Portable
    (“PSP

tm

”)
    and the Nintendo
    DS

tm

)
    and cellular handsets. Some of our games are based on content
    that we license from others (

e.g.

, Madden NFL Football,
    Harry Potter and FIFA Soccer), and some of our games are based
    on our own wholly-owned intellectual property (

e.g.

, The
    Sims

tm

,
    Need for
    Speed

tm

and
    POGO

tm

).
    Our goal is to publish titles with global mass-market appeal,
    which often means translating and localizing them for sale in
    non-English speaking countries. In addition, we also attempt to
    create software game “franchises” that allow us to
    publish new titles on a recurring basis that are based on the
    same property. Examples of this franchise approach are the
    annual iterations of our sports-based products (

e.g.

,
    Madden NFL Football,
    NCAA

®

Football and FIFA Soccer), wholly-owned properties that can be
    successfully sequeled (

e.g.

, The Sims, Need for Speed and
    Battlefield) and titles based on long-lived literary

and/or

movie
    properties (

e.g.

, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter).

Special
    Note Regarding Deferred Net Revenue

The ubiquity of high-speed Internet access and the integration
    of network connectivity into new generation game consoles are
    expected to continue to increase demand for games with
    online-enabled features. To address this demand, many of our
    software products are developed with the ability to be connected
    to, and played via, the Internet. In order for consumers to
    participate in online communities and play against one another
    via the Internet, we (either directly or through outsourced
    arrangements with third parties) maintain servers which support
    an online service we offer to consumers for activities such as
    matchmaking. In situations where we do not separately sell this
    online service, we account for the sale of the software product
    as a “bundle” sale, or multiple element arrangement,
    in which we sell both the software product and the online
    service for one combined price.

Through fiscal 2007, for accounting purposes, vendor-specific
    objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”) existed for
    the online service. Accordingly, we allocated the revenue
    collected from the sale of the software product between the
    online service offered and the software product and recognized
    the amounts allocated to each element separately. However,
    starting in fiscal 2008, for accounting purposes, the required
    vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value did not exist
    for the online service related to certain of our online-enabled
    software products. This prevented us from allocating and
    separately recognizing revenue related to the software product
    and the online service. Accordingly, starting in fiscal 2008, we
    began to recognize all of the revenue from the sale of our
    online-enabled software products for the PC, PlayStation 2,
    PLAYSTATION 3, Wii and the PSP on a deferred basis over an
    estimated online service period, which we estimate to be six
    months beginning in the month after shipment. On a quarterly
    basis, the deferral amount will vary significantly depending
    upon the number of titles we release, the timing of their
    release, sales volume, returns and price protection provided for
    these online-enabled software products. In addition, we expense
    the cost of goods sold related to these transactions during the
    period in which the product is delivered (rather than on a
    deferred basis), which inherently creates volatility in our
    reported gross margin percentages.



As of March 31, 2008, we had an accumulated balance of
    $387 million of deferred net revenue related to
    online-enabled packaged goods and digital content, substantially
    all of which was driven by sales made during the six months
    ended March 31, 2008. As of March 31, 2007, we had an
    accumulated balance of $32 million of deferred net revenue
    related to online-enabled packaged goods and digital content.

Financial
    Results

Total net revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008
    was $3.665 billion, up 19 percent as compared to the
    fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. The impact of deferrals
    related to packaged goods and digital content for the fiscal
    year ended March 31, 2008 decreased our reported net
    revenue and operating income by $355 million. Net revenue
    was driven by sales of

Rock Band, Madden NFL 08

,

FIFA 08

,

Need for Speed ProStreet,

and

The
    Simpsons

tm

Game.

Net loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 was
    $454 million as compared to net income of $76 million
    for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007. Diluted loss per
    share for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008 was $1.45 as
    compared to diluted income per share of $0.24 for the fiscal
    year ended March 31, 2007. Net income decreased during
    fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to
    (1) an increase in cost of goods sold of $593 million,
    (2) an increase in sales of online-enabled titles for which
    we were unable to establish VSOE that resulted in the net
    deferral of $355 million of net revenue out of fiscal 2008
    and into future periods, (3) an increase of
    $135 million in acquired in-process technology primarily
    due to our acquisition of VG Holding Corp., (4) losses
    on strategic investments of $118 million, (5) an
    increase of $108 million in personnel-related costs,
    (6) an increase of $90 million in marketing,
    advertising and promotional expenses primarily to support our
    launch of new franchises and incremental spending on recurring
    franchises, and (7) an increase of $88 million in
    restructuring charges primarily as a result of our fiscal 2008
    reorganization. These items were partially offset by (1) an
    increase in $574 million in net revenue and
    (2) $119 million lower income tax expense.

We generated $338 million of cash from operating activities
    during the year ended March 31, 2008, as compared to
    $397 million for fiscal 2007. The decrease in cash provided
    by operating activities for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal
    2007 was primarily due to (1) an increase in operating
    expenses paid resulting from an increase in advertising and
    marketing costs, external development expenses and
    personnel-related expenses, and (2) a $90 million
    increase in incentive-based cash compensation paid in fiscal
    2008 which were earned with respect to fiscal 2007 performance.
    These decreases were significantly offset by higher net revenue
    collected during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007.

Management’s
    Overview of Historical and Prospective Business
    Trends

Fiscal 2008 Reorganization.

In fiscal 2008, we
    reorganized our business into four operating
    “labels” — EA Games, EA SPORTS,
    The Sims and EA Casual Entertainment — and an
    additional group that works closely with the labels —
    Global Publishing. Each label is structured to operate globally
    and includes several key functions including development
    studios, product marketing, and planning for products and
    services. Global Publishing operates in three regions, North
    America, Europe and Asia, and is responsible for strategic
    planning, field marketing, sales, distribution, operations,
    product certification, quality assurance, motion capture, art
    outsourcing and localization.

In October 2007, our Board of Directors approved a plan of
    reorganization (“fiscal 2008 reorganization plan”).
    Since the inception of the fiscal 2008 reorganization plan
    through March 31, 2008, we incurred charges associated with
    (1) the closure of our Chertsey, England and Chicago,
    Illinois facilities, which included asset impairment and lease
    termination costs, (2) employee-related expenses, and
    (3) other costs including other contract terminations as
    well as IT and consulting costs to assist in the reorganization
    of our business support functions. During the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2008, we completed the closure of our Chertsey facility
    and consolidated our local operations and employees into our
    Guildford, England facility. Over the next 18 months, we
    expect to continue to incur IT and consulting costs to assist in
    the reorganization of our business support functions.



Including charges incurred through March 31, 2008, we
    expect to incur cash and non-cash charges between
    $115 million and $125 million by fiscal 2010 related
    to our fiscal 2008 reorganization plan. These charges will
    consist primarily of employee-related costs (approximately
    $10 million in cash charges), facility exit costs
    (approximately $60 million in cash and non-cash charges),
    as well as other reorganization costs including other contract
    terminations and IT and consulting costs to assist in the
    reorganization of our business support functions (approximately
    $50 million in cash and non-cash charges).

Transition to a New Generation of
    Consoles.

Video game hardware systems have
    historically had a life cycle of four to six years, which
    causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well.
    The current cycle began with Microsoft’s launch of the
    Xbox 360 in 2005, and continued in 2006 when Sony and
    Nintendo launched their next-generation systems, the
    PLAYSTATION 3 and the Wii, respectively. During fiscal
    2008, the installed base of each of these systems continued to
    expand and, as a result, sales of our products for these systems
    have also increased significantly. At the same time, however,
    demand for video games for prior-generation systems,
    particularly the original Xbox and the Nintendo GameCube, has
    declined significantly. Although we expect to continue
    developing and marketing new titles for the prior-generation
    PlayStation 2 in fiscal 2009, we only expect to release one
    title for the original Xbox and no titles for the Nintendo
    GameCube. As a result, we expect our sales of video games for
    prior-generation systems will continue to decline. The decline
    in prior-generation product sales, particularly the
    PlayStation 2, may be greater or faster than we anticipate,
    and sales of products for the new platforms may be lower or
    increase more slowly than we anticipate. Moreover, we expect
    development costs for the new video game systems continue to be
    greater on a per-title basis than development costs for
    prior-generation video game systems.

We have incurred increased costs during this transition as we
    have continued to develop and market new titles for certain
    prior-generation video game platforms, while also making
    significant investments in products for the new generation
    platforms. We expect research and development expenses to
    increase on an absolute basis in fiscal 2009 as compared to
    fiscal 2008 (although not necessarily as a percentage of net
    revenue).

Online.

Today, we generate net revenue from a
    variety of online products and services, including casual games
    and downloadable content marketed under our Pogo brand,
    persistent state world games such as

Ultima
    Online

tm

and

Dark Age of
    Camelot

®

,

PC-based downloadable content and online-enabled packaged
    goods. In addition, we are anticipating the release of a new
    massively multiplayer online role-playing game,

Warhammer

®

Online

. We intend to make significant investments in online
    products, infrastructure and services and believe that online
    gameplay will become an increasingly important part of our
    business in the long term.

Expansion of Mobile Platforms.

Advances in
    mobile technology have resulted in a variety of new and evolving
    platforms for on-the-go interactive entertainment that appeal to
    a broader demographic of consumers. Our efforts to capitalize on
    the growth in mobile interactive entertainment are focused in
    two broad areas — packaged goods games for handheld
    game systems and downloadable games for cellular handsets.

We have developed and published games for a variety of handheld
    platforms for several years. More recently, the Sony PSP and the
    Nintendo DS, with their enhanced graphics, deeper gameplay, and
    online functionality, provide a richer mobile gaming experience
    for consumers.

We expect sales of games for handhelds and cellular handsets to
    continue to be an important part of our business worldwide.

Acquisitions and Investments.

We have engaged
    in, evaluated, and expect to continue to engage in and evaluate,
    a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including
    acquisitions of companies, businesses, intellectual properties,
    and other assets. Since the beginning of fiscal 2007, we have
    announced

and/or

completed several acquisitions and investments, including:

•

In January 2008, we completed our acquisition of VG Holding
    Corp. (“VGH”), owner of both BioWare Corp. and
    Pandemic Studios, LLC, which create action, adventure, and
    role-playing games. VGH was headquartered in Menlo Park,
    California. BioWare Corp. and Pandemic Studios are located in
    Edmonton, Canada; Los Angeles, California; Austin, Texas; and
    Brisbane, Australia.



•

In May 2007, we entered into a licensing agreement with and made
    a strategic equity investment in The9 Limited, a leading online
    game operator in China. The licensing agreement gives The9
    exclusive publishing rights for

EA SPORTS

tm

FIFA
    Online

in mainland China.

•

In April 2007, we expanded our commercial agreements with and
    made strategic equity investments in Neowiz Corporation and a
    related online gaming company, Neowiz Games (we refer to Neowiz
    Corporation and Neowiz Games collectively as
    “Neowiz”). Based in Korea, Neowiz is an online media
    and gaming company with which we partnered in 2006 to launch

EA SPORTS FIFA Online

in Korea.

•

In October 2006, the remaining outstanding shares of Digital
    Illusions C.E. (“DICE”) located in Sweden, were
    purchased, thereby completing the acquisition of the remaining
    minority interest of DICE.

•

In July 2006, we acquired Mythic Entertainment, Inc., located in
    Virginia, as part of our efforts to accelerate our growth in the
    massively multiplayer online role-playing market.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we announced a proposal to
    acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock
    of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.(“Take-Two”),
    for a total purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion
    (including fees and expenses). Take-Two’s Board of
    Directors has stated that our offer undervalues the company and
    is not in the best interests of stockholders. If we were to
    acquire Take-Two, we expect the acquisition would have a
    material impact on our future financial position and results of
    operations and cash flows. Although the offer is not conditional
    upon any financing arrangements, our Board of Directors has
    authorized us to obtain additional financing, a portion of which
    may be used in part to fund the acquisition. There can be no
    assurance that we will acquire Take-Two.

International Operations and Foreign Currency Exchange
    Impact.

International sales are a fundamental
    part of our business. Net revenue from international sales
    accounted for approximately 47 percent of our total net
    revenue during fiscal 2008 and approximately 46 percent of
    our total net revenue during fiscal 2007. Our international net
    revenue was primarily driven by sales in Europe and, to a much
    lesser extent, in Asia. Year-over-year, we estimate that foreign
    exchange rates had a favorable impact on our net revenue of
    $125 million, or 4 percent, for the year ended
    March 31, 2008. We believe that in order to succeed
    internationally, it is important to locally develop content that
    is specifically directed toward local cultures and consumers.

Stock-Based Compensation.

Beginning on
    April 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standard No. 123 (revised 2004)
    (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), “

Share-Based
    Payment

”, and applied the provisions of Staff
    Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107,
    “

Share-Based Payment

”, to our adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R). During fiscal 2008, we recognized
    stock-based compensation of $150 million, pre-tax, and
    $123 million, net of tax. During fiscal 2007, we recognized
    stock-based compensation of $133 million, pre-tax, and
    $107 million, net of tax. Stock-based compensation expense
    has been reflected in the respective functional line items on
    our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial
    Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    contingent assets and liabilities, and revenue and expenses
    during the reporting periods. The policies discussed below are
    considered by management to be critical because they are not
    only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and
    results of operations, but also because application and
    interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and
    estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown.
    As a result, actual results may differ materially from our
    estimates.

Revenue
    Recognition, Sales Returns, Allowances and Bad Debt
    Reserves

We derive revenue principally from sales of interactive software
    games designed for play on video game consoles (such as the
    PlayStation 2, PLAYSTATION 3, Xbox 360 and Wii), PCs and mobile
    platforms including handheld game players (such as the PSP and
    Nintendo DS), and cellular handsets. We evaluate the



recognition of revenue based on the criteria set forth in
    Statement of Position (“SOP”)

97-2,

“Software Revenue Recognition”

, as amended by

SOP 98-9,

“Modification of

SOP 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
    Transactions”

and SAB No. 104,

“Revenue Recognition”

. We evaluate and
    recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are
    met:

•

Evidence of an arrangement.

Evidence of an agreement
    with the customer that reflects the terms and conditions to
    deliver products that must be present in order to recognize
    revenue.

•

Delivery.

Delivery is considered to occur when a
    product is shipped and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership
    have been transferred to the customer. For online game services,
    delivery is considered to occur as the service is provided. For
    digital downloads that do not have an online service component,
    delivery is considered to occur generally when the download
    occurs.

•

Fixed or determinable fee.

If a portion of the
    arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable, we recognize
    revenue as the amount becomes fixed or determinable.

•

Collection is deemed probable.

We conduct a credit
    review of each customer involved in a significant transaction to
    determine the creditworthiness of the customer. Collection is
    deemed probable if we expect the customer to be able to pay
    amounts under the arrangement as those amounts become due. If we
    determine that collection is not probable, we recognize revenue
    when collection becomes probable (generally upon cash
    collection).

Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been
    satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have
    a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we
    report in each period. For example, for multiple element
    arrangements, we must make assumptions and judgments in order
    to: (1) determine whether and when each element has been
    delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or
    services are essential to the functionality of the delivered
    products and services; (3) determine whether VSOE exists
    for each undelivered element; and (4) allocate the total
    price among the various elements we must deliver. Changes to any
    of these assumptions or judgments, or changes to the elements in
    a software arrangement, could cause a material increase or
    decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular
    period. For example, in connection with some of our packaged
    goods product sales, we offer an online service without an
    additional fee. Prior to fiscal 2008, we were able to determine
    VSOE for the online service to be delivered; therefore, we were
    able to allocate the total price received from the combined
    product and online service sale between these two elements and
    recognize the related revenue separately. However, starting in
    fiscal 2008, VSOE does not exist for the online service to be
    delivered for certain platforms and all revenue from these
    transactions are recognized over the estimated online service
    period. More specifically, starting in fiscal 2008, we began to
    recognize the revenue from sales of certain online-enabled
    packaged goods on a straight-line basis over a six month period
    beginning in the month after shipment. Accordingly, this
    relatively small change (from having VSOE for the online service
    to no longer having VSOE) has had a significant effect on our
    reported results.

Determining whether a transaction constitutes an online game
    service transaction or a download of a product requires judgment
    and can be difficult. The accounting for these transactions is
    significantly different. Revenue from product downloads is
    generally recognized when the download occurs (assuming all
    other recognition criteria are met). Revenue from online game
    services is recognized as the services are rendered. If the
    service period is not defined, we recognize the revenue over the
    estimated service period. Determining the estimated service
    period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular
    revision based on historical online usage.

Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors
    (“channel partners”), is recognized when the above
    criteria are met. We reduce product revenue for estimated future
    returns, price protection, and other offerings, which may occur
    with our customers and channel partners. Price protection
    represents the right to receive a credit allowance in the event
    we lower our wholesale price on a particular product. The amount
    of the price protection is generally the difference between the
    old price and the new price. In certain countries, we have
    stock-balancing programs for our PC and video game system
    products, which allow for the exchange of these products by
    resellers under certain circumstances. It is our general
    practice to exchange products or give credits rather than to
    give cash refunds.



In certain countries, from time to time, we decide to provide
    price protection for both our PC and video game system products.
    When evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price
    protection allowances, we analyze historical returns, current
    sell-through of distributor and retailer inventory of our
    products, current trends in retail and the video game segment,
    changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products, and
    other related factors. In addition, we monitor the volume of
    sales to our channel partners and their inventories, as
    substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could
    result in high returns or higher price protection costs in
    subsequent periods.

In the future, actual returns and price protections may
    materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the
    distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer
    preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due
    to new platforms, product updates or competing products. For
    example, the risk of product returns

and/or

price
    protection for our products may continue to increase as the
    PlayStation 2 console moves through its lifecycle. While we
    believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters,
    these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our
    estimates changed, our returns and price protection reserves
    would change, which would impact the total net revenue we
    report. For example, if actual returns

and/or

price
    protection were significantly greater than the reserves we have
    established, our actual results would decrease our reported
    total net revenue. Conversely, if actual returns

and/or

price
    protection were significantly less than our reserves, this would
    increase our reported total net revenue. In addition, if our
    estimates of returns and price protection related to
    online-enabled packaged goods products change, the amount of net
    deferred revenue we recognize in the future would change.

Significant judgment is required to estimate our allowance for
    doubtful accounts in any accounting period. We determine our
    allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer
    creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends and
    historical experience. Depending upon the overall economic
    climate and the financial condition of our customers, the amount
    and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could
    change significantly.

Fair
    Value Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular
    item in order to fairly present our financial statements.
    Without an independent market or another representative
    transaction, determining the fair value of a particular item
    requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently
    difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the
    conclusion on the appropriate accounting.

There are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair
    value. These include (1) the market approach where market
    transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities
    are used to determine the fair value, (2) the income
    approach which uses valuation techniques to convert future
    amounts (for example, future cash flows or future earnings) to a
    single present amount, and (3) the cost approach which is
    based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset.
    For many of our fair value estimates, including our estimates of
    the fair value of acquired intangible assets, acquired
    in-process technology and equity instruments granted for
    services, we use the income approach. Using the income approach
    requires the use of financial models which require us to make
    various estimates including, but not limited to (1) the
    potential future cash flows for the asset, liability or equity
    instrument being measured, (2) the timing of receipt or
    payment of those future cash flows, (3) the time value of
    money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such
    cash flows, and (4) the inherent risk associated with the
    cash flows (risk premium). Making these cash flow estimates are
    inherently difficult and subjective, and, if any of the
    estimates used to determine the fair value using the income
    approach turns out to be inaccurate, our financial results may
    be negatively impacted. Furthermore, relatively small changes in
    many of these estimates can have a significant impact to the
    estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the
    related accounting conclusion reached. For example, a relatively
    small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change
    a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired.



While we are required to make certain fair value assessments
    associated with the accounting for several types of
    transactions, the following areas are the most sensitive to the
    assessments:

Business Combinations.

We must estimate the
    fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and acquired
    in-process technology in a business combination. Our assessment
    of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material
    affect on our reported results as intangible assets are
    amortized over various lives and acquired in-process technology
    is expensed upon consummation. Furthermore, a change in the
    estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct
    impact on the amount to recognize as goodwill, an asset that is
    not amortized. Often determining the fair value of these assets
    and liabilities assumed requires an assessment of expected use
    of the asset, the expected cost to extinguish the liability or
    our expectations related to the timing and the successful
    completion of development of an acquired in-process technology.
    Such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can
    have a material impact on our financial statements.

Assessment of Impairment of Assets.

Current
    accounting standards require that we assess the recoverability
    of purchased intangible assets and other long-lived assets
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
    remaining value of the assets recorded on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets is potentially impaired. In order to determine if
    a potential impairment has occurred, management must make
    various assumptions about the estimated fair value of the asset
    by evaluating future business prospects and estimated cash
    flows. For some assets, our estimated fair value is dependent
    upon our predictions of which of our products we develop will be
    successful which is dependent upon several things beyond our
    control, such as which operating platforms will be successful in
    the marketplace. Also, our revenue and earnings are dependent on
    our ability to meet our product release schedules.

SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets”

requires at least an annual assessment for
    impairment of goodwill by applying a fair-value-based test.
    Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment,
    including identification of reporting units, assignment of
    assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of
    goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value
    of each reporting unit. Determining the estimated fair value for
    each reporting unit could be materially affected by changes in
    estimates and assumptions which could trigger impairment.

Stock-Based Compensation.

We are required to
    estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the
    date of grant. The estimated fair value of stock options and
    stock purchase rights granted pursuant to our employee stock
    purchase plan is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation
    model which requires us to make certain assumptions about the
    future. Determining the estimated fair value is affected by our
    stock price as well as assumptions regarding subjective and
    complex variables such as expected employee exercise behavior
    and our expected stock price volatility over the term of the
    award. We estimated the following key assumptions for the
    Black-Scholes valuation calculation:

•

Risk-free interest rate.

The risk-free interest rate
    is based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of
    grant for the expected term of the option.

•

Expected volatility.

We use a combination of
    historical stock price volatility and implied volatility
    computed based on the price of options publicly traded on our
    common stock for our expected volatility assumption.

•

Expected term.

The expected term represents the
    weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain
    outstanding. The expected term is determined based on historical
    exercise behavior, post-vesting termination patterns, options
    outstanding and future expected exercise behavior.

•

Expected dividends

.

Changes to our underlying stock price, our assumptions used in
    the Black-Scholes option valuation calculation and our
    forfeiture rate, which is based on historical data, as well as
    future equity granted or assumed through acquisitions could
    significantly impact compensation expense to be recognized in
    future periods.



Royalties
    and Licenses

Our royalty expenses consist of payments to (1) content
    licensors, (2) independent software developers, and
    (3) co-publishing and distribution affiliates. License
    royalties consist of payments made to celebrities, professional
    sports organizations, movie studios and other organizations for
    our use of their trademarks, copyrights, personal publicity
    rights, content

and/or

other
    intellectual property. Royalty payments to independent software
    developers are payments for the development of intellectual
    property related to our games.

Co-publishing

and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties
    for the delivery of product.

Royalty-based obligations with content licensors and
    distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and
    capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and
    subsequently paid. These royalty-based obligations are generally
    expensed to cost of goods sold generally at the greater of the
    contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on the total
    projected net revenue. Significant judgment is required to
    estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract.
    Because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us
    to project future revenue, it is inherently subjective as our
    future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors,
    including (1) the total number of titles subject to the
    contract, (2) the timing of the release of these titles,
    (3) the number of software units we expect to sell which
    can be impacted by a number of variables, including product
    quality and competition, and (4) future pricing.
    Determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is
    particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in
    predicting the popularity of entertainment products.
    Accordingly, if our future revenue projections change, our
    effective royalty rates would change, which could impact the
    royalty expense we recognize. Prepayments made to thinly
    capitalized independent software developers and co-publishing
    affiliates are generally made in connection with the development
    of a particular product and, therefore, we are generally subject
    to development risk prior to the release of the product.
    Accordingly, payments that are due prior to completion of a
    product are generally expensed to research and development over
    the development period as the services are incurred. Payments
    due after completion of the product (primarily royalty-based in
    nature) are generally expensed as cost of goods sold.

Our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed
    royalty payments which are initially recorded as an asset and as
    a liability at the contractual amount when no performance
    remains with the licensor. When performance remains with the
    licensor, we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually
    paid and as a liability when incurred, rather than recording the
    asset and liability upon execution of the contract. Minimum
    royalty payment obligations are classified as current
    liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are
    contractually due within the next twelve months. As of
    March 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately $10 million and
    $9 million, respectively, of minimum guaranteed royalty
    obligations had been recognized.

Each quarter, we also evaluate the future realization of our
    royalty-based assets as well as any unrecognized minimum
    commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely
    to be realized through product sales. Any impairments or losses
    determined before the launch of a product are charged to
    research and development expense. Impairments or losses
    determined post-launch are charged to cost of goods sold. In
    either case, we rely on estimated revenue to evaluate the future
    realization of prepaid royalties and commitments. If actual
    sales or revised revenue estimates fall below the initial
    revenue estimate, then the actual charge taken may be greater in
    any given quarter than anticipated. During fiscal 2008 and 2006,
    we recognized impairment charges of $4 million and
    $16 million, respectively. We had no impairments during
    fiscal 2007.

Income
    Taxes

We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48,
    “

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes —
    An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

”, in
    the first quarter of fiscal 2008. See Note 10 of the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the ordinary course of our business, there are many
    transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax
    determination is uncertain. As part of the process of preparing
    our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to
    estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which
    we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for
    such periods. This process requires estimating both our
    geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each
    jurisdiction where we operate. These



estimates involve complex issues and require us to make
    judgments, such as anticipating the positions that we will take
    on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns and
    the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities. The ultimate
    resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due
    to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations.
    We are also required to make determinations of the need to
    record deferred tax liabilities and the recoverability of
    deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is established to the
    extent that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax
    assets will not be realized based on our estimation of future
    taxable income in each jurisdiction.

In addition, changes in our business, including acquisitions,
    changes in our international corporate structure, changes in the
    geographic location of business functions or assets, changes in
    the geographic mix and amount of income, as well as changes in
    our agreements with tax authorities, valuation allowances,
    applicable accounting rules, applicable tax laws and
    regulations, rulings and interpretations thereof, developments
    in tax audit and other matters, and variations in the estimated
    and actual level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall
    effective income tax rate.

The calculation of our tax liabilities involves accounting for
    uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules,
    regulations and practices. As a result of the implementation of
    FIN No. 48, we recognize benefits for uncertain tax
    positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to
    evaluate the tax position for recognition of a benefit (or the
    absence of a liability) by determining if the weight of
    available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not
    that the position taken will be sustained upon audit, including
    resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
    If it is not, in our judgment, “more likely than not”
    that the position will be sustained, then we do not recognize
    any benefit for the position. If it is more likely than not that
    the position will be sustained, a second step in the process is
    required to estimate how much of the benefit we will ultimately
    receive. This second step requires that we estimate and measure
    the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than
    50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate
    settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to
    estimate such amounts. We reevaluate these uncertain tax
    positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on a
    number of factors including, but not limited to, changes in
    facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, new facts,
    correspondence with tax authorities during the course of an
    audit, effective settlement of audit issues, and commencement of
    new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement
    could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an
    additional charge to the tax provision in the period. As a
    result of the adoption of FIN No. 48, we expect our
    tax rate to be more volatile.

We historically have considered undistributed earnings of our
    foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of
    the United States and, accordingly, no U.S. taxes have been
    provided thereon. Although we repatriated funds under the
    American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 in fiscal 2006, we currently
    intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed
    earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the United
    States.

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS

Our fiscal year is reported on a 52 or 53-week period that ends
    on the Saturday nearest March 31. For simplicity of
    disclosure, all fiscal periods are referred to as ending on a
    calendar month end. Our results of operations for the fiscal
    years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 contained 52 weeks
    and ended on March 29, 2008 and March 31, 2007,
    respectively. Our results of operations for the fiscal year
    ended March 31, 2006 contained 53 weeks and ended on
    April 1, 2006.

Comparison
    of Fiscal 2008 to Fiscal 2007

Net
    Revenue

Net revenue consists of sales generated from (1) video
    games sold as packaged goods and designed for play on hardware
    consoles (such as the PlayStation 2, PLAYSTATION 3,
    Xbox 360 and Wii), PCs and handheld game players (such as
    the Sony PSP, Nintendo DS and Nintendo Game Boy Advance),
    (2) video games for cellular handsets, (3) interactive
    online-enabled packaged goods, digital content, and online
    services associated with these games, (4) services in
    connection with some of our online games, (5) programming
    third-party web sites with our game content, (6) allowing
    other companies to manufacture and sell our products in
    conjunction with other products, and (7) advertisements on
    our online web pages and in our games.



During fiscal 2008 and 2007, we recognized total net revenue of
    $3,665 million and $3,091 million, respectively. Our
    total net revenue during fiscal 2008 includes $831 million
    recognized from sales of certain online-enabled packaged goods
    and digital content for which we were not able to objectively
    determine the fair value (as defined by U.S. Generally
    Accepted Accounting Principles for software sales) of a free
    online service that we provided in connection with the sale. The
    deferral of net revenue related to certain of our packaged goods
    and digital content sales, which will be recognized in future
    periods, decreased our reported net revenue by $355 million
    during fiscal 2008, as compared to the same period a year ago.

From a geographical perspective, our total net revenue for the
    fiscal years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 was as follows
    (in millions):

North
    America

For fiscal 2008, net revenue in North America was
    $1,942 million, driven by sales of

Rock Band, Madden
    NFL 08,

and

NCAA Football 08

.

Net revenue for fiscal 2008 increased 17 percent as
    compared to fiscal 2007. The deferral of net revenue related to
    certain of our packaged goods and digital content sales, which
    will be recognized in future periods, decreased our reported net
    revenue by $158 million during fiscal 2008. From an
    operational perspective, the increase in net revenue was driven
    by (1) a $445 million increase in net revenue from
    co-publishing and distribution titles (which does not include an
    additional $10 million of deferred net revenue that will be
    recognized in future periods), and (2) a $118 million
    increase in net revenue from sales of titles for the Wii (which
    does not include an additional $17 million of deferred net
    revenue that will be recognized in future periods). These
    increases were partially offset by (1) a $208 million
    decrease in net revenue from sales of titles for the
    PlayStation 2 (this decrease will be partially offset,
    however, by $29 million of deferred net revenue that will
    be recognized in future periods), and (2) a
    $105 million decrease in net revenue from sales of titles
    for the Xbox.

We continue to expect net revenue in North America to increase
    during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008.

Europe

For fiscal 2008, net revenue in Europe was $1,541 million,
    driven by sales of

FIFA 08, Need for Speed ProStreet,

and

The Simpsons Game

. Net revenue for fiscal 2008 increased
    22 percent as compared to fiscal 2007. We estimate that
    foreign exchange (primarily the Euro and the British pounds
    sterling) increased reported net revenue by approximately
    $113 million, or 9 percent, for fiscal 2008 as
    compared to fiscal 2007. Excluding the effect of foreign
    exchange rates, we estimate that net revenue increased by
    approximately $167 million, or 13 percent, for fiscal
    2008 as compared to fiscal 2007.

The deferral of net revenue related to certain of our packaged
    goods and digital content sales, which will be recognized in
    future periods, decreased our reported net revenue by
    $169 million during fiscal 2008. From an operational
    perspective the increase in net revenue was driven by (1) a
    $109 million increase in net revenue from sales of titles
    for the PLAYSTATION 3 (which does not include an additional
    $86 million of deferred net revenue that will be recognized
    in future periods), (2) $108 million of net revenue
    from sales of titles for the



Wii (which does not include an additional $8 million of
    deferred net revenue that will be recognized in future periods),
    and (3) a $77 million increase in net revenue from
    sales of titles for the Nintendo DS.

We continue to expect net revenue in Europe to increase during
    fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008.

Asia

For fiscal 2008, net revenue in Asia was $182 million,
    driven by sales of

Need for Speed ProStreet

,

The
    Simpsons Game

, and

FIFA 08

. Net revenue for
    fiscal 2008 increased 11 percent as compared to fiscal
    2007. We estimate that foreign exchange increased reported net
    revenue by approximately $12 million, or 7 percent,
    for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. Excluding the effect
    of foreign exchange rates, we estimate that net revenue
    increased by $6 million, or 4 percent during fiscal
    2008 as compared to fiscal 2007.

The deferral of net revenue related to certain of our packaged
    goods and digital content sales, which will be recognized in
    future periods, decreased our reported net revenue by
    $28 million during fiscal 2008. From an operational
    perspective, the increase in net revenue was driven by
    (1) a $12 million increase in sales of titles for the
    PLAYSTATION 3 (which does not include an additional
    $14 million of deferred net revenue that will be recognized
    in future periods), (2) $12 million increase in net
    revenue from sales of titles for the Wii (which does not include
    an additional $1 million of deferred net revenue that will
    be recognized in future periods), and (3) an
    $11 million increase in net revenue from sales of titles
    for the Nintendo DS. These increases were partially offset by
    (1) a $9 million decrease in net revenue from sales of
    titles for the PC (this decrease will be offset, however, by
    $3 million of deferred net revenue that will be recognized
    in future periods), (2) a $6 million decrease in net
    revenue from sales of titles for the Xbox, and (3) a
    $6 million decrease in net revenue from sales of titles for
    the PSP (this decrease will be offset, however, by
    $4 million of deferred net revenue that will be recognized
    in future periods).

Cost
    of Goods Sold

Cost of goods sold for our packaged-goods business consists of
    (1) product costs, (2) certain royalty expenses for
    celebrities, professional sports and other organizations and
    independent software developers, (3) manufacturing
    royalties, net of volume discounts and other vendor
    reimbursements, (4) expenses for defective products,
    (5) write-offs of post-launch prepaid royalty costs,
    (6) amortization of certain intangible assets,
    (7) personnel-related costs, and (8) distribution
    costs. We generally recognize volume discounts when they are
    earned from the manufacturer (typically in connection with the
    achievement of unit-based milestones), whereas other vendor
    reimbursements are generally recognized as the related revenue
    is recognized. Cost of goods sold for our online products
    consists primarily of data center and bandwidth costs associated
    with hosting our web sites, credit card fees and royalties for
    use of third-party properties. Cost of goods sold for our web
    site advertising business primarily consists of server costs.

Cost of goods sold for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 were as

10.1%

For fiscal 2008, cost of goods sold increased by
    10.1 percent as a percentage of total net revenue as
    compared to fiscal 2007. This increase was primarily due to:

•

Higher co-publishing and distribution royalty costs of
    approximately 8 percent as a percentage of total net
    revenue primarily driven by sales of

Rock Band

, and, to a
    lesser extend, other co-publishing and distribution titles that
    have a lower gross margin, and

•

The increase in net revenue deferrals of $355 million
    related to certain online-enabled packaged goods and digital
    content. Overall, we estimate the deferral of net revenue
    negatively impacted cost of goods sold as a percent of total net
    revenue by 4 percent.

As a percentage of total net revenue, the overall increase in
    cost of goods sold was partially offset by lower license royalty
    rates of approximately 1 percent as a percentage of total
    net revenue primarily due to a higher



proportion of sales in fiscal 2008 from our owned intellectual
    property franchises that have lower royalty rates as compared to
    fiscal 2007.

Although there can be no assurance, and our actual results could
    differ materially, in the short term we expect our gross margin
    as a percentage of total net revenue to increase in fiscal 2009
    as compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of (1) a decrease in
    the change in deferred net revenue related to certain
    online-enabled packaged goods (we expense the cost of goods sold
    related to these transactions when delivered) and (2) a
    favorable mix of EA Studio revenue.

Marketing
    and Sales

Marketing and sales expenses consist of personnel-related costs
    and advertising, marketing and promotional expenses, net of
    qualified advertising cost reimbursements from third parties.

As a percentage of net revenue, marketing and sales expenses

    fiscal 2008.

Marketing and sales expenses increased by $122 million, or
    26 percent, in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The
    increase was primarily due to (1) an increase of
    $90 million in marketing, advertising and promotional
    expenses primarily to support our launch of new franchises and
    incremental spending on established franchises, as well as
    (2) a $23 million increase in personnel-related costs
    primarily resulting from an increase in headcount.

Marketing and sales expenses included vendor reimbursements for
    advertising expenses of $54 million and $28 million in
    fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively.

We expect marketing and sales expenses to increase in absolute
    dollars in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due
    to higher advertising and marketing activity to support our
    titles.

General
    and Administrative

General and administrative expenses consist of personnel and
    related expenses of executive and administrative staff, fees for
    professional services such as legal and accounting, and
    allowances for doubtful accounts.

General and administrative expenses increased by
    $51 million, or 18 percent, in fiscal 2008 as compared
    to fiscal 2007 primarily due to (1) an increase of
    $23 million in additional personnel-related costs to help
    support our administrative functions worldwide, (2) an
    increase in contracted services associated with IT systems
    initiatives, professional services and business development of
    $21 million to support the growth of the organization, and
    (3) an increase in facilities-related expenses of
    $12 million in support of our administrative functions
    worldwide. These increases were partially offset by a
    $7 million reduction in incentive-based compensation
    expense.

We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in
    absolute dollars in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008
    primarily due to an increase in personnel-related costs.



Research
    and Development

Research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred
    by our production studios for personnel-related costs,
    contracted services, equipment depreciation and any impairment
    of prepaid royalties for pre-launch products. Research and
    development expenses for our online business include expenses
    incurred by our studios consisting of direct development and
    related overhead costs in connection with the development and
    production of our online games. Research and development
    expenses also include expenses associated with the development
    of web site content, software licenses and maintenance, network
    infrastructure and management overhead.

Research and development expenses increased by
    $104 million, or 10 percent, in fiscal 2008 as
    compared to fiscal 2007. The increase was primarily due to
    (1) an increase of $93 million in additional
    personnel-related costs primarily due to an increase in
    headcount and partially as a result of our acquisition of VGH,
    (2) higher external development costs of $32 million
    to support new releases such as our Union of European Football
    Association’s EURO soccer franchise and titles from The
    Sims franchise, and (3) an increase in depreciation of
    $12 million. These increases were partially offset by a
    $24 million reduction in incentive-based compensation
    expense and $6 million reduction in facilities-related
    expenses.

We expect research and development expenses to increase in
    absolute dollars in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008

    by $7 million, or 26 percent, in fiscal 2008 as

Acquired in-process technology includes the value of products in
    the development stage that are not considered to have reached
    technological feasibility or have an alternative future use.
    Accordingly, upon consummation of an acquisition, we generally
    incur a charge for the related acquired in-process technology,
    as reflected in our



Consolidated Statement of Operations. See Note 4 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
    Item 8 of this report. In connection with our acquisition
    of VGH, we incurred acquired in-process technology charges of
    $138 million in relation to game software that had not
    reached technical feasibility at the date of acquisition. The
    fair values of VGH’s products under development were
    determined using the income approach, which discounts expected
    future cash flows from the acquired in-process technology to
    present value. The discount rates used in the present value
    calculations were derived from a weighted average cost of
    capital of 17 percent. Should the in-process software not
    be successfully completed, completed at a higher cost, or the
    development efforts go beyond the timeframe estimated by
    management, we will not receive the full benefits anticipated
    from the acquisition. Benefits from the development efforts are
    expected to commence in fiscal years 2009 through 2011. The
    acquired in-process technology charge we incurred in fiscal 2007
    resulted from our acquisitions of Mythic and the remaining

Our effective income tax benefit rate was 10.3 percent for
    fiscal 2008. Our income tax expense rate was 48.2 percent
    for fiscal 2007. For fiscal 2008, our effective income tax
    benefit rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of
    35.0 percent due to a number of factors, including
    non-deductible acquisition-related costs, losses on strategic
    investments and certain loss on facility impairment for which
    future tax benefit is uncertain and not more likely than not to
    be realized, as well as certain non-deductible stock based
    compensation expenses. For fiscal 2007, our effective income tax
    rate was higher than the U.S. statutory rate of
    35.0 percent due to a number of factors, including certain
    non-deductible stock based compensation expenses and additional
    charges resulting from certain non-deductible
    acquisition-related costs.

Our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2009 and future
    periods will depend on a variety of factors, including changes
    in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany
    transactions (for example, we expect to incur significant
    intercompany tax charges in connection with our acquisition of
    VGH in fiscal 2009), changes in our international structure,
    changes in the geographic location of business functions or
    assets, changes in the geographic mix of income, as well as
    changes in, or termination of, our agreements with tax
    authorities, valuation allowances, applicable accounting rules,
    applicable tax laws and regulations, rulings and interpretations
    thereof, developments in tax audit and other matters, and
    variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre-tax
    income or loss. We incur certain tax expenses that do not
    decline proportionately with declines in our pre-tax
    consolidated income or loss. As a result, in absolute dollar
    terms, our tax expense will have a greater influence on our
    effective tax rate at lower levels of pre-tax income or loss
    than at higher levels. In addition, at lower levels of pre-tax
    income or loss, our effective tax rate will be more volatile.

We historically have considered undistributed earnings of our
    foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of
    the United States and, accordingly, no U.S. taxes have been
    provided thereon. Although we repatriated funds under the
    American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 in fiscal 2006, we currently
    intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed
    earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the United
    States.

    (2) the net deferral of $355 million of net revenue
    out of fiscal 2008 and into future periods, (3) an increase
    of $135 million in acquired in-process technology primarily
    due to our acquisition of VGH, (4) losses on strategic
    investments of $118 million, (5) an increase of
    $108 million in personnel-related costs, (6) an
    increase of $90 million in marketing, advertising and
    promotional expenses primarily to support our launch of new
    franchises and incremental spending on recurring franchises, and
    (7) an increase of $88 million in restructuring
    charges primarily as a result of our fiscal 2008 reorganization.
    These items were partially offset by (1) an increase in
    $574 million in net revenue (which amount would have been
    $355 million higher absent the deferral of net revenue that
    will be recognized in future periods) and
    (2) $119 million lower income tax expense.

North
    America

For fiscal 2007, net revenue in North America was
    $1,666 million, driven by sales of

Madden NFL 07

,

Need for Speed Carbon

, and

NCAA Football 07

.

The increase in net revenue for fiscal 2007 as compared to
    fiscal 2006 was driven by (1) a $239 million increase
    in net revenue from sales of titles for the Xbox 360, (2) a
    $95 million increase in cellular handset net revenue, and
    (3) $68 million in net revenue from sales of titles
    for the PLAYSTATION 3. These increases were partially offset by
    (1) a $168 million decrease in net revenue from sales
    of titles for the Xbox, and (2) a $127 million
    decrease in net revenue from sales of titles for the PlayStation
    2.

Europe

For fiscal 2007, net revenue in Europe was $1,261 million,
    driven primarily by sales of

FIFA 07

and

Need for
    Speed Carbon

. We estimate that foreign exchange rates
    (primarily the Euro and the British pounds sterling) increased
    reported European net revenue by approximately $57 million,
    or 5 percent, for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006.
    Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates, we estimate that
    European net revenue increased by approximately
    $30 million, or 2 percent, for fiscal 2007 as compared
    to fiscal 2006.

The increase in net revenue for fiscal 2007 as compared to
    fiscal 2006 was driven by (1) a $90 million increase
    in net revenue from sales of titles for the Xbox 360, and
    (2) a $76 million increase in net revenue from sales
    of titles for the PC. These increases were partially offset by a
    $101 million decrease in net revenue from sales of titles
    for the PlayStation 2.

Asia

For fiscal 2007, net revenue in Asia was $164 million,
    driven primarily by sales of

Need for Speed Carbon

. We
    estimate that changes in foreign exchange rates decreased
    reported net revenue in Asia by approximately $4 million,
    or 2 percent, for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006.
    Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates, we estimate that
    Asia net revenue decreased by approximately $25 million, or
    13 percent, for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006.

The decrease in net revenue for fiscal 2007 as compared to
    fiscal 2006 was driven primarily by (1) a $21 million
    decrease in net revenue from co-publishing and distribution
    titles, (2) a $13 million decrease in net revenue from
    sales of titles for the PlayStation 2, and (3) an
    $11 million decrease in net revenue from sales of titles
    for the Xbox. These decreases were partially offset by an
    $11 million increase in net revenue from sales of titles
    for the Xbox 360.

(0.8%

In fiscal 2007, cost of goods sold decreased by
    0.8 percentage points as a percentage of total net revenue
    as compared to fiscal 2006. This decrease was primarily due to
    lower average product costs as a percentage of total net revenue
    primarily driven by (1) fewer returns and lower pricing
    actions taken, or expected to be taken, in fiscal 2007 as
    compared to fiscal 2006 and (2) improved inventory
    management. As a result, we estimate average product costs as a
    percentage of total net revenue decreased by approximately
    2 percent in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006.

As a percentage of total net revenue, the decrease in average
    product costs was partially offset by an estimated
    1 percent increase in license royalties during fiscal 2007
    as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to (1) license
    agreements associated with our EA SPORTS titles and (2) our
    acquisition of JAMDAT. This was partially offset by lower
    license royalties from movie-based titles in fiscal 2007.

Marketing and sales expenses increased by $35 million, or

    increase was primarily due to (1) an increase of
    $17 million in stock-based compensation expense recognized
    as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R),
    (2) an increase of $10 million in our annual bonus
    expense, and (3) $10 million in additional
    personnel-related costs primarily resulting from an increase in
    headcount. These increases were partially offset by a decrease
    of $9 million in our marketing, advertising, promotional
    and related services as a result of higher advertising in the
    prior year to support our product releases, primarily from our
    Harry Potter and BLACK franchises.

Marketing and sales expenses included vendor reimbursements for

    acquisitions of JAMDAT and Mythic, and partially to support
    development of games for the new generation of consoles,
    (4) an increase of $50 million in external development

    acquisition of JAMDAT. Acquired in-process technology includes
    the value of products in the development stage that are not
    considered to have reached technological feasibility or have an
    alternative future use. Accordingly, upon consummation of these

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we recorded a total

    which is included in restructuring charges in our Consolidated
    Statement of Operations. These headcount reductions related to
    our decision in



the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 to realign our resources with
    our product plan for fiscal 2007 and strategic opportunities for
    the new generation of consoles, online and mobile platforms.

During fiscal 2006, restructuring charges related to the
    establishment of our international publishing headquarters in
    Geneva, Switzerland were approximately $14 million, of
    which $8 million was for the closure of certain United
    Kingdom facilities. During fiscal 2007, restructuring charges

    2007. For fiscal 2006, our effective income tax rate is higher
    than the U.S. statutory rate of 35.0 percent for
    fiscal 2006 due to a number of factors, including the
    repatriation of foreign earnings in connection with the American
    Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and additional charges resulting from

    to a $395 million increase in our operating expenses
    primarily due to (1) an increase of $128 million in
    stock-based compensation expense recognized as a result of our
    adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), (2) an
    $83 million increase in our annual bonus expense, and
    (3) a $75 million increase in additional
    personnel-related costs due to an increase in headcount (related
    in part to our acquisitions and growth in our EA Mobile
    business). These increases in operating expenses were mitigated
    by (1) a $140 million increase in net revenue and
    (2) an $81 million decrease in our income tax
    provision.



Impact of
    Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

“Fair Value Measurements”

.
    SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
    accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. Fair value refers to the price that would be
    received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
    orderly transaction between market participants in the market in
    which the reporting entity transacts. SFAS No. 157
    establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the
    information used to develop those assumptions. Fair value
    measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the
    fair value hierarchy. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB
    Staff Position (“FSP”) Financial Accounting Standard
    (“FAS”)

157-1,

“Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB
    Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That
    Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease
    Classification or Measurement under Statement 13”

and
    FSP

FAS 157-2,

“Effective Date of FASB Statement
    No. 157”

. These FSPs (1) defer the effective
    date in SFAS No. 157 for one year for certain
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those
    that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually),
    (2) exclude certain leasing transactions accounted for
    under SFAS No. 13,

“Accounting for
    Leases”

, from the scope of Statement 157, and
    (3) include several specific examples of items eligible or
    not eligible for the one-year deferral. The provisions of
    SFAS No. 157 are effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007,
    and interim periods within those fiscal years. FSP

FAS 157-1

is effective upon the initial adoption of
    SFAS No. 157. FSP

FAS 157-2

defers the effective date of certain provisions of
    SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal
    years for items within the scope of the FSP. We do not expect
    the adoption of SFAS No. 157, FSP

FAS 157-1

and FSP

FAS 157-2

to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
    Financial Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB
    Statement No. 115”

. SFAS No. 159 permits
    entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and
    certain other items at fair value that are not currently
    required to be measured at fair value. It also establishes
    presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate
    comparisons between entities that choose different measurement
    attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The
    provisions of SFAS No. 159 are effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007. This Statement should not be applied
    retrospectively to fiscal years beginning prior to the effective
    date, except as permitted with early adoption. We are evaluating
    whether to adopt SFAS No. 159 and what impact the
    adoption would have on our Consolidated Financial Statements if
    we were to adopt it. If we adopt SFAS No. 159, it
    could have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

In June 2007, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task
    Force’s (“EITF”) consensus conclusion on

EITF 07-03,

“Accounting for Advance Payments for Goods or Services
    to Be Used in Future Research and Development”

.

EITF 07-03

addresses the diversity which exists with respect to the
    accounting for the non-refundable portion of a payment made by a
    research and development entity for future research and
    development activities. Under this conclusion, an entity is
    required to defer and capitalize non-refundable advance payments
    made for research and development activities until the related
    goods are delivered or the related services are performed.

EITF 07-03

is effective for interim or annual reporting periods in fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2007 and requires
    prospective application for new contracts entered into after the
    effective date. The adoption of

EITF 07-03

will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (Revised 2007) (“SFAS No. 141(R)”),

“Business Combinations”

, which requires the
    recognition of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any
    noncontrolling interest in an acquiree at the acquisition date
    fair value with limited exceptions.
    SFAS No.

141(R)

will change the accounting treatment for certain
    specific items and includes a substantial number of new
    disclosure requirements.

SFAS No. 141(R)

applies prospectively to business combinations for which
    the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
    annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,
    2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will have a
    material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements for
    material acquisitions consummated on or after March 29,
    2009.



In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

“Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — An Amendment of ARB
    No. 51”

, which establishes new accounting and
    reporting standards for noncontrolling interest (minority
    interest) and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary.
    SFAS No. 160 also includes expanded disclosure
    requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its
    noncontrolling interest. SFAS No. 160 is effective for
    fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
    beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We do not expect
    the adoption of SFAS No. 160 to have a material impact
    on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2007, the FASB ratified EITF consensus conclusion on

EITF 07-01,

“Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements”

.

EITF 07-01

defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting
    requirements for transactions between participants in a
    collaborative arrangement and between participants in the
    arrangement and third parties. Under this conclusion, a
    participant to a collaborative arrangement should disclose
    information about the nature and purpose of its collaborative
    arrangements, the rights and obligations under the collaborative
    arrangements, the accounting policy for collaborative
    arrangements, and the income statement classification and
    amounts attributable to transactions arising from the
    collaborative arrangement between participants for each period
    an income statement is presented.

EITF 07-01

is effective for interim or annual reporting periods in fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008 and requires
    retrospective application to all prior periods presented for all
    collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date.
    While we have not yet completed our analysis, we do not
    anticipate the implementation of

EITF 07-01

to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

“Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — An Amendment of
    SFAS No. 133”

. SFAS 161 requires
    enhanced disclosures about an entity’s derivative and
    hedging activities, including how an entity uses derivative
    instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items
    are accounted for under SFAS No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities”

, and how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
    financial performance, and cash flows. The provisions of
    SFAS No. 161 are effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008,
    and interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect
    the adoption of SFAS No. 161 to have a material impact
    on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Changes
    in Cash Flow

During fiscal 2008, we generated $338 million of cash from
    operating activities as compared to $397 million for fiscal
    2007. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for
    fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to
    (1) an increase in operating expenses paid resulting from
    an increase in advertising and marketing costs, external
    development expenses and personnel-related expenses and
    (2) a $90 million increase in incentive-based cash
    compensation paid in fiscal 2008 which were earned with respect
    to fiscal 2007 performance. These decreases were significantly
    offset by higher net revenue collected during fiscal 2008 as
    compared to fiscal 2007.

For fiscal 2008, we generated $2,306 million of cash
    proceeds from maturities and sales of short-term investments and
    $192 million in proceeds from sales of common stock through
    our stock-based compensation plans. Our primary use of cash in
    non-operating activities consisted of
    (1) $1,739 million used to purchase short-term
    investments, (2) $607 million for the acquisition of
    VGH, and (3) $277 million used to purchase marketable
    equitable securities and other investments.

Short-term
    investments and marketable equity securities

Due to our mix of fixed and variable rate securities, our
    short-term investment portfolio is susceptible to changes in
    short-term interest rates. As of March 31, 2008, our
    short-term investments had gross unrealized gains of
    $9 million, or 1 percent of the total in short-term
    investments, and gross unrealized losses of less than
    $1 million, or less than 1 percent of the total in
    short-term investments. From time to time, we may liquidate some
    or all of our short-term investments to fund operational needs
    or other activities, such as capital expenditures, business
    acquisitions or stock repurchase programs. Depending on which
    short-term investments we liquidate to fund these activities, we
    could recognize a portion, or all, of the gross unrealized gains
    or losses.

Marketable equity securities increased to $729 million as
    of March 31, 2008, from $341 million as of
    March 31, 2007, primarily due to (1) an increase of
    $251 million in the fair value of our investment in Ubisoft
    Entertainment, (2) our $167 million investment in
    The9, and (3) our $83 million common stock investment
    in Neowiz. These increases were partially offset by (1) an
    $81 million impairment recognized on The9 investment and
    (2) a $28 million impairment recognized on the Neowiz
    common stock investment. In addition to the Neowiz common stock
    investment noted above, we made a $27 million preferred
    stock investment in Neowiz which is classified in other assets
    on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We recognized a
    $9 million impairment on our Neowiz preferred stock
    investment.

Receivables,
    net

Our gross accounts receivable balances were $544 million
    and $470 million as of March 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The increase in our accounts receivable balance
    was primarily due to higher sales volumes during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2007. Reserves for sales returns, pricing allowances and
    doubtful accounts increased in absolute dollars from
    $214 million as of March 31, 2007 to $238 million
    as of March 31, 2008. As a percentage of trailing nine
    month net revenue, reserves decreased from 8 percent as of
    March 31, 2007, to 7 percent as of March 31,
    2008. We believe these reserves are adequate based on historical
    experience and our current estimate of potential returns,
    pricing allowances and doubtful accounts.

Inventories

Inventories increased to $168 million as of March 31,
    2008 from $62 million as of March 31, 2007, primarily
    as a result of (1) $64 million in

Rock Band

inventory, of which approximately $43 million was
    in-transit as of March 31, 2008, and (2) the overall
    growth of our business.



Other
    current assets

Other current assets increased to $290 million as of
    March 31, 2008, from $219 million as of March 31,
    2007, primarily due to the reclassification as an asset held for
    sale of our facility in Chertsey, England from property and
    equipment, net, to other current assets.

Other
    assets

Other assets increased to $157 million as of March 31,
    2008, from $96 million as of March 31, 2007, primarily
    due to (1) $19 million higher prepaid royalties,
    (2) higher other investments of $15 million
    substantially resulting from our purchase of Neowiz preferred
    stock, and (3) $13 million of prepaid taxes
    reclassified from current assets.

Accounts
    payable

Accounts payable increased to $229 million as of
    March 31, 2008, from $180 million as of March 31,
    2007, primarily due to higher inventory purchases related to

Rock Band

.

Accrued
    and other current liabilities

Our accrued and other liabilities decreased to $683 million
    as of March 31, 2008 from $814 million as of
    March 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily due to
    (1) $273 million of current income taxes accrued being
    reclassified to non-current tax obligations as a result of our
    adoption of FIN No. 48 (see Note 10 of the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements), and (2) a decrease
    of $32 million in accrued incentive-based compensation.
    These decreases were partially offset by an increase of
    $106 million in royalties payable primarily due to

Rock
    Band

.

Deferred
    income taxes, net

Our net deferred income tax asset position increased by
    $197 million as of March 31, 2008 as compared to
    March 31, 2007 primarily due to increases of
    (1) $76 million in deferred taxes related to current
    year tax provision, (2) $53 million in deferred taxes
    related to our acquisition of VGH, (3) $43 million in
    deferred tax assets related to our adoption of
    FIN No. 48 and current year activities, and
    (4) $25 million in deferred tax assets related to
    stock-based compensation.

Financial
    Condition

We believe that cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments,
    marketable equity securities, cash generated from operations and
    available financing facilities will be sufficient to meet our
    operating requirements for at least the next twelve months,
    including working capital requirements, capital expenditures
    and, potentially, future acquisitions or strategic investments.
    We may choose at any time to raise additional capital to
    strengthen our financial position, facilitate expansion, pursue
    strategic acquisitions and investments or to take advantage of
    business opportunities as they arise. There can be no assurance,
    however, that such additional capital will be available to us on
    favorable terms, if at all, or that it will not result in
    substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.

On March 13, 2008, we commenced an unsolicited $26.00 per
    share cash tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of
    Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation
    (“Take-Two”), for a total purchase price of
    approximately $2.1 billion. On April 18, 2008, we
    adjusted the purchase price in the cash tender offer to $25.74
    per share following the approval by Take-Two stockholders of
    amendments to Take-Two’s Incentive Stock Plan, which would
    permit the issuance of additional shares of restricted stock to
    ZelnickMedia Corporation pursuant to its management agreement
    with Take-Two. The total aggregate purchase price for Take-Two
    did not change as a result of the adjustment to the per share
    purchase price in the tender offer. On May 9, 2008, we
    received a commitment from certain financial institutions to
    provide us with up to $1.0 billion of senior unsecured term
    loan financing at any time until January 9, 2009, to be
    used to provide a portion of the funds for the offer

and/or

merger. We will be required to repay any funds we borrow under
    the term loan



facility, plus accrued interest, on the earlier of
    (a) 364 days from the date on which we initially
    borrow the funds and (b) August 9, 2009. On
    May 19, 2008, we extended the expiration date of the tender
    offer until June 16, 2008. We intend to pay for the
    Take-Two shares and related transaction fees and expenses with
    internally available cash and borrowings under the term loan
    facility or other financing sources, which may be available to
    us in the future.

The loan financing arrangements supporting our Redwood City
    headquarters leases with Keybank National Association, described
    in the “Off-Balance Sheet Commitments” section below,
    are scheduled to expire in July 2009. At any time prior to the
    expiration of the financing in July 2009, we may re-negotiate
    the lease and the related financing arrangement. Upon expiration
    of the leases, we may purchase the facilities for
    $247 million, or arrange for a sale of the facilities to a
    third party. In the event of a sale to a third party, if the
    sale price is less than $247 million, we will be obligated
    to reimburse the difference between the actual sale price and
    $247 million, up to maximum of $222 million, subject
    to certain provisions of the leases.

As of March 31, 2008, approximately $1,357 million of
    our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and
    marketable equity securities that was generated from operations
    was domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions. While we have no
    plans to repatriate these funds to the United States in the
    short term, if we choose to do so, we would accrue and pay
    additional taxes on any portion of the repatriation where no
    United States income tax had been previously provided.

We have a “shelf” registration statement on

Form S-3

on file with the SEC. This shelf registration statement, which
    includes a base prospectus, allows us at any time to offer any
    combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or
    more offerings up to a total amount of $2 billion. Unless
    otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement accompanying the
    base prospectus, we would use the net proceeds from the sale of
    any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration
    statement for general corporate purposes, including for working
    capital, financing capital expenditures, research and
    development, marketing and distribution efforts and, if
    opportunities arise, for acquisitions or strategic alliances.
    Pending such uses, we may invest the net proceeds in
    interest-bearing securities. In addition, we may conduct
    concurrent or other financings at any time.

Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity could be affected
    by various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited
    to, those related to customer demand and acceptance of our
    products on new platforms and new versions of our products on
    existing platforms, our ability to collect our accounts
    receivable as they become due, successfully achieving our
    product release schedules and attaining our forecasted sales
    objectives, the impact of acquisitions and other strategic
    transactions in which we may engage, the impact of competition,
    economic conditions in the United States and abroad, the
    seasonal and cyclical nature of our business and operating
    results, risks of product returns and the other risks described
    in the “Risk Factors” section, included in
    Part I, Item 1A of this report.

Contractual
    Obligations and Commercial Commitments

Development,
    Celebrity, League and Content Licenses: Payments and
    Commitments

The products we produce in our studios are designed and created
    by our employee designers, artists, software programmers and by
    non-employee software developers (“independent
    artists” or “third-party developers”). We
    typically advance development funds to the independent artists
    and third-party developers during development of our games,
    usually in installment payments made upon the completion of
    specified development milestones. Contractually, these payments
    are generally considered advances against subsequent royalties
    on the sales of the products. These terms are set forth in
    written agreements entered into with the independent artists and
    third-party developers.

In addition, we have certain celebrity, league and content
    license contracts that contain minimum guarantee payments and
    marketing commitments that may not be dependent on any
    deliverables. Celebrities and organizations with whom we have
    contracts include: FIFA, FIFPRO Foundation, UEFA and FAPL
    (Football Association Premier League Limited) (professional
    soccer); NASCAR (stock car racing); National Basketball
    Association (professional basketball); PGA TOUR and Tiger Woods
    (professional golf); National Hockey League and NHL
    Players’ Association (professional hockey); Warner Bros.
    (Harry Potter and Batman); New



Line Productions and Saul Zaentz Company (The Lord of the
    Rings); Red Bear Inc. (John Madden); National Football League
    Properties and PLAYERS Inc. (professional football); Collegiate
    Licensing Company (collegiate football and basketball); Viacom
    Consumer Products (The Godfather); ESPN (content in EA
    SPORTS

tm

games); Twentieth Century Fox Licensing and Merchandising (The
    Simpsons); and Hasbro, Inc. (a wide array of Hasbro intellectual
    properties). These developer and content license commitments
    represent the sum of (1) the cash payments due under
    non-royalty-bearing licenses and services agreements, and
    (2) the minimum guaranteed payments and advances against
    royalties due under royalty-bearing licenses and services
    agreements, the majority of which are conditional upon
    performance by the counterparty. These minimum guarantee
    payments and any related marketing commitments are included in
    the table below.

The following table summarizes our minimum contractual
    obligations and commercial commitments as of March 31,
    2008, and the effect we expect them to have on our liquidity and
    cash flow in future periods (in millions):

See discussion on operating leases in the “Off-Balance
    Sheet Commitments” section below for additional
    information. Lease commitments include contractual rental
    commitments of $13 million under real estate leases for
    unutilized office space resulting from our restructuring
    activities. These amounts, net of estimated future sub-lease
    income, were expensed in the periods of the related
    restructuring and are included in our accrued and other current
    liabilities reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
    March 31, 2008. See Note 6 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)

Developer/licensor commitments include $10 million of
    commitments to developers or licensors that have been recorded
    in current and long-term liabilities and a corresponding amount
    in current and long-term assets in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets as of March 31, 2008 because payment is not
    contingent upon performance by the developer or licensor.

The amounts represented in the table above reflect our minimal
    cash obligations for the respective fiscal years, but do not
    necessarily represent the periods in which they will be expensed
    in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition to what is included in the table above, as discussed
    in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, we have adopted the provisions of
    FIN No. 48. As of March 31, 2008, we had a
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the
    payment of related interest totaling $360 million, of which
    approximately $41 million is offset by prior cash deposits
    to tax authorities for issues pending resolution. For the
    remaining liability, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable
    estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will
    occur.

Related
    Person Transaction

Prior to becoming Chief Executive Officer of Electronic Arts,
    John Riccitiello was a Founder and Managing Director of
    Elevation Partners, L.P., and also served as Chief Executive
    Officer of VGH, which we acquired in



January 2008. At the time of the acquisition,
    Mr. Riccitiello held an indirect financial interest in VGH
    resulting from his interest in the entity that controlled
    Elevation Partners, L.P. and his interest in a limited partner
    of Elevation Partners, L.P. Elevation Partners, L.P. was a
    significant stockholder of VGH. As a result of the acquisition,
    Mr. Riccitiello’s financial returns related to these
    interests, including returns of deemed capital contributions,
    have been $2.4 million to date (some of which
    Mr. Riccitiello could be required to return depending on
    the performance of the Elevation entities), and could be up to
    an additional $1.6 million plus any interest or other
    amounts earned thereon. This amount could be reduced, however,
    by a variety of factors, including investment losses of
    Elevation, if any, as well as certain expenses of Elevation that
    could offset partnership profits. Upon his separation from
    Elevation Partners, L.P., Mr. Riccitiello ceased to have
    any further control or influence over these factors.

From the commencement of negotiations with VGH, at the direction
    of EA’s Board of Directors, EA’s Audit Committee
    engaged directly with EA management (independently from
    Mr. Riccitiello) to analyze and consider the potential
    benefits, risks and material terms of the acquisition. EA’s
    Board of Directors approved the acquisition after reviewing with
    EA’s management and members of the Audit Committee the
    terms of the acquisition and the potential benefits and risks
    thereof, as well as Mr. Riccitiello’s personal
    financial interest in VGH and the acquisition.
    Mr. Riccitiello recused himself from the Board of Directors
    meeting during the Board’s deliberation of the acquisition
    and he did not vote on the acquisition.

OFF-BALANCE
    SHEET COMMITMENTS

We lease certain of our current facilities, furniture and
    equipment under non-cancelable operating lease agreements. We
    are required to pay property taxes, insurance and normal
    maintenance costs for certain of these facilities and will be
    required to pay any increases over the base year of these
    expenses on the remainder of our facilities.

In February 1995, we entered into a build-to-suit lease
    (“Phase One Lease”) with a third-party lessor for our
    headquarters facilities in Redwood City, California (“Phase
    One Facilities”). The Phase One Facilities comprise a total
    of approximately 350,000 square feet and provide space for
    sales, marketing, administration and research and development
    functions. In July 2001, the lessor refinanced the Phase One
    Lease with Keybank National Association through July 2006. The
    Phase One Lease expires in January 2039, subject to early
    termination in the event the underlying financing between the
    lessor and its lenders is not extended. Subject to certain terms
    and conditions, we may purchase the Phase One Facilities or
    arrange for the sale of the Phase One Facilities to a third
    party.

Pursuant to the terms of the Phase One Lease, we have an option
    to purchase the Phase One Facilities at any time for a purchase
    price of $132 million. In the event of a sale to a third
    party, if the sale price is less than $132 million, we will
    be obligated to reimburse the difference between the actual sale
    price and $132 million, up to a maximum of
    $117 million, subject to certain provisions of the Phase
    One Lease, as amended.

On May 26, 2006, the lessor extended its loan financing
    underlying the Phase One Lease with its lenders through July
    2007, and on May 14, 2007, the lenders extended this
    financing again for an additional year through July 2008. On
    April 14, 2008, the lenders extended the financing for
    another year through July 2009. At any time prior to the
    expiration of the financing in July 2009, we may re-negotiate
    the lease and the related financing arrangement. We account for
    the Phase One Lease arrangement as an operating lease in
    accordance with SFAS No. 13,

“Accounting for
    Leases”

, as amended.

In December 2000, we entered into a second build-to-suit lease
    (“Phase Two Lease”) with Keybank National Association
    for a five and one-half year term beginning in December 2000 to
    expand our Redwood City, California headquarters facilities and
    develop adjacent property (“Phase Two Facilities”).
    Construction of the Phase Two Facilities was completed in June
    2002. The Phase Two Facilities comprise a total of approximately
    310,000 square feet and provide space for sales, marketing,
    administration and research and development functions. Subject
    to certain terms and conditions, we may purchase the Phase Two
    Facilities or arrange for the sale of the Phase Two Facilities
    to a third party.



Pursuant to the terms of the Phase Two Lease, we have an option
    to purchase the Phase Two Facilities at any time for a purchase
    price of $115 million. In the event of a sale to a third
    party, if the sale price is less than $115 million, we will
    be obligated to reimburse the difference between the actual sale
    price and $115 million, up to a maximum of
    $105 million, subject to certain provisions of the Phase
    Two Lease, as amended.

On May 26, 2006, the lessor extended the Phase Two Lease
    through July 2009 subject to early termination in the event the
    underlying loan financing between the lessor and its lenders is
    not extended. Concurrently with the extension of the lease, the
    lessor extended the loan financing underlying the Phase Two
    Lease with its lenders through July 2007. On May 14, 2007,
    the lenders extended this financing again for an additional year
    through July 2008. On April 14, 2008, the lenders extended
    the financing for another year through July 2009. At any time
    prior to the expiration of the financing in July 2009, we may
    re-negotiate the lease and the related financing arrangement. We
    account for the Phase Two Lease arrangement as an operating
    lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, as amended.

We believe that, as of March 31, 2008, the estimated fair
    values of both properties under these operating leases exceeded
    their respective guaranteed residual values.

The two lease agreements with Keybank National Association
    described above require us to maintain certain financial
    covenants as shown below, all of which we were in compliance
    with as of March 31, 2008.

In February 2006, we entered into an agreement with an
    independent third party to lease a facility in Guildford,
    Surrey, United Kingdom, which commenced in June 2006 and will
    expire in May 2016. The facility comprises a total of
    approximately 95,000 square feet, which we use for
    administrative, sales and development functions. Our rental
    obligation under this agreement is approximately
    $33 million over the initial ten-year term of the lease.

In June 2004, we entered into a lease agreement, amended in
    December 2005, with an independent third party for a studio
    facility in Orlando, Florida. The lease commenced in January
    2005 and expires in June 2010, with one five-year option to
    extend the lease term. The campus facilities comprise a total of
    140,000 square feet and provide space for research and
    development functions. Our rental obligation over the initial

five-and-a-half

year term of the lease is $15 million.

In July 2003, we entered into a lease agreement with an
    independent third party (the “Landlord”) for a studio
    facility in Los Angeles, California, which commenced in October
    2003 and expires in September 2013 with two five-year options to
    extend the lease term. Additionally, we have options to purchase
    the property after five and ten years based on the fair market
    value of the property at the date of sale, a right of first
    offer to purchase the property upon terms offered by the
    Landlord, and a right to share in the profits from a sale of the
    property. Existing campus facilities comprise a total of
    243,000 square feet and provide space for research and
    development functions. Our rental obligation under this
    agreement is $50 million over the initial ten-year term of
    the lease. This commitment is offset by expected sublease income
    of $6 million for a sublease to an affiliate of the
    Landlord of 18,000 square feet of the Los Angeles facility,
    which commenced in October 2003 and expires in September 2013,
    with options of early termination by either party after October
    2008.

In October 2002, we entered into a lease agreement, with an
    independent third party for a studio facility in Vancouver,
    British Columbia, Canada, which commenced in May 2003 and
    expires in April 2013. We amended the lease in October 2003. The
    facility comprises a total of approximately 65,000 square
    feet and provides space for research and development functions.
    Our rental obligation under this agreement is approximately
    $16 million over the initial ten-year term of the lease.



Director
    Indemnity Agreements

We entered into indemnification agreements with each of the
    members of our Board of Directors at the time they joined the
    Board to indemnify them to the extent permitted by law against
    any and all liabilities, costs, expenses, amounts paid in
    settlement and damages incurred by the directors as a result of
    any lawsuit, or any judicial, administrative or investigative
    proceeding in which the directors are sued or charged as a
    result of their service as members of our Board of Directors.

INFLATION

We believe the impact of inflation on our results of operations
    has not been significant in any of the past three fiscal years.

Item 7A:

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market
    Risk

We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and market
    prices. Market risk is the potential loss arising from changes
    in market rates and market prices. We employ established
    policies and practices to manage these risks. Foreign exchange
    option and forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated
    exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign
    exchange risk as discussed below. We have not historically, nor
    do we currently, hedge our short-term investment portfolio. We
    do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be exposed to
    significant interest rate risk because our cash and cash
    equivalent portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with
    original maturities of three months or less (see Note 2 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
    this report). We also do not currently hedge our market price
    risk relating to our equity investments. Further, we do not
    enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for
    trading or speculative purposes (see Note 3 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
    this report).

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Cash Flow Hedging Activities.

From time to
    time, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to
    forecasted foreign-currency-denominated sales and expense
    transactions by purchasing option contracts that generally have
    maturities of 15 months or less. These transactions are
    designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. The derivative
    assets associated with our hedging activities are recorded at
    fair value in other current assets in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. The effective portion of gains or losses resulting from
    changes in fair value of these hedges is initially reported, net
    of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
    in stockholders’ equity and subsequently reclassified into
    net revenue or operating expenses, as appropriate in the period
    when the forecasted transaction is recorded. The ineffective
    portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value,
    if any, is reported in each period in interest and other income,
    net, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our hedging
    programs are designed to reduce, but do not entirely eliminate,
    the impact of currency exchange rate movements in revenue and
    operating expenses. As of March 31, 2008, we had foreign
    currency option contracts to purchase approximately
    $48 million in foreign currencies and to sell approximately
    $254 million of foreign currencies. As of March 31,
    2008, these foreign currency option contracts outstanding had a
    total fair value of $5 million, included in other current
    assets. As of March 31, 2007, we had foreign currency
    option contracts to purchase approximately $28 million in
    foreign currencies and to sell approximately $72 million of
    foreign currencies. As of March 31, 2007, these foreign
    currency option contracts outstanding had a total fair value of
    less than $1 million, included in other current assets.

Balance Sheet Hedging Activities.

We use
    foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency
    risk associated with foreign-currency-denominated assets and
    liabilities, primarily intercompany receivables and payables.
    The forward contracts generally have a contractual term of three
    months or less and are transacted near month-end. Our foreign
    exchange forward contracts are not designated as hedging
    instruments under SFAS No. 133 and are accounted for
    as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts are
    reported as other current assets or other current liabilities in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and gains and losses



from changes in fair value are reported in interest and other
    income, net. The gains and losses on these forward contracts
    generally offset the gains and losses on the underlying
    foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities, which are
    also reported in interest and other income, net, in our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations. In certain cases, the
    amount of such gains and losses will significantly differ from
    the amount of gains and losses recognized on the underlying
    foreign currency denominated asset or liability, in which case
    our results will be impacted. As of March 31, 2008, we had
    forward foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell
    approximately $540 million in foreign currencies. Of this
    amount, $479 million represented contracts to sell foreign
    currencies in exchange for U.S. dollars, $13 million
    to sell foreign currencies in exchange for British pounds
    sterling and $48 million to purchase foreign currencies in
    exchange for U.S. dollars. As of March 31, 2007, we
    had forward foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell
    approximately $104 million in foreign currencies. Of this
    amount, $73 million represented contracts to sell foreign
    currencies in exchange for U.S. dollars, $8 million to
    sell foreign currencies in exchange for British pounds sterling
    and $23 million to purchase foreign currencies in exchange
    for U.S. dollars. The fair value of our forward contracts
    was immaterial as of March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2007.

The counterparties to these forward and option contracts are
    creditworthy multinational commercial banks; therefore, the risk
    of counterparty nonperformance is not considered to be material.

Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency
    exchange rate risks, there can be no assurance that our hedging
    activities will adequately protect us against the risks
    associated with foreign currency fluctuations. As of
    March 31, 2008, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency
    exchange rate movement of 10 percent or 15 percent
    would have resulted in a potential loss in fair value of our
    option contracts used in cash flow hedging of $4 million in
    both scenarios. As of March 31, 2007, a hypothetical
    adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement would have
    resulted in a potential loss in fair value of our option
    contracts used in cash flow hedging of $1 million in both
    scenarios. A hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate
    movement of 10 percent or 15 percent would have
    resulted in potential losses on our forward contracts used in
    balance sheet hedging of $56 million and $82 million,
    respectively, as of March 31, 2008, and $9 million and
    $14 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2007. This
    sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift in foreign
    currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Exchange
    rates do not always move in the same direction. Actual results
    may differ materially.

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates
    relates primarily to our short-term investment portfolio. We
    manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment
    portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high
    credit quality and relatively short maturities. However, because
    short-term securities mature relatively quickly and are required
    to be reinvested at the then current market rates, interest
    income on a portfolio consisting of short-term securities is
    more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer
    term securities. Additionally, the contractual terms of the
    securities do not permit the issuer to call, prepay or otherwise
    settle the securities at prices less than the stated par value
    of the securities. Our investments are held for purposes other
    than trading. Also, we do not use derivative financial
    instruments in our short-term investment portfolio.

As of March 31, 2008 and 2007, our short-term investments
    were classified as available-for-sale and, consequently,
    recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses
    resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of any
    tax effects, in



stockholders’ equity. Our portfolio of short-term
    investments consisted of the following investment categories,
    summarized by fair value as of March 31, 2008 and 2007 (in
    millions):

Notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks, there
    can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against
    risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. At any time, a
    sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact
    on the fair value of our investment portfolio. The following
    table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value in our
    short-term investment portfolio as of March 31, 2008,
    arising from potential changes in interest rates. The modeling
    technique estimates the change in fair value from immediate
    hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus
    50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS.

Market
    Price Risk

The value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies
    is subject to market price volatility and foreign currency risk
    for investments denominated in foreign currencies. As of
    March 31, 2008 and 2007, our marketable equity securities
    were classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, were
    recorded in our



Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair market value with unrealized
    gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income, net of any tax effects, in
    stockholders’ equity. The fair value of our marketable
    equity securities was $729 million and $341 million as
    of March 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In fiscal 2008,
    we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss of
    $109 million.

At any time, a sharp change in market prices in our investments
    in marketable equity securities could have a significant impact
    on the fair value of our investments. The following table
    presents hypothetical changes in the fair value of our
    marketable equity securities as of March 31, 2008, arising
    from changes in market prices plus or minus 25 percent,
    50 percent and 75 percent.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1)

DESCRIPTION
    OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

We develop, market, publish and distribute video game software
    and content that can be played by consumers on a variety of
    platforms, including video game consoles (such as the Sony
    PlayStation

®

2 and
    PLAYSTATION

®

3, Microsoft Xbox

tm

and Nintendo
    Wii

tm

),
    personal computers, handheld game players (such as the
    PlayStation

®

Portable
    (“PSP

tm

”)
    and the Nintendo
    DS

tm

)
    and cellular handsets. Some of our games are based on content
    that we license from others (

e.g.

, Madden NFL Football,
    Harry Potter and FIFA Soccer), and some of our games are based
    on our own wholly-owned intellectual property (

e.g.

, The
    Sims

tm

,
    Need for
    Speed

tm

and
    POGO

tm

).
    Our goal is to publish titles with global mass-market appeal,
    which often means translating and localizing them for sale in
    non-English speaking countries. In addition, we also attempt to
    create software game “franchises” that allow us to
    publish new titles on a recurring basis that are based on the
    same property. Examples of this franchise approach are the
    annual iterations of our sports-based products (

e.g.

,
    Madden NFL Football,
    NCAA

®

Football and FIFA Soccer), wholly-owned properties that can be
    successfully sequeled (

e.g.

, The Sims, Need for Speed and
    Battlefield) and titles based on long-lived literary

and/or

movie
    properties (

e.g.

, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter).

A summary of our significant accounting policies applied in the
    preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements follows:

(a)

Consolidation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the
    accounts of Electronic Arts Inc. and its wholly- and
    majority-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and
    transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

(b)

Fiscal
    Year

Our fiscal year is reported on a 52 or 53-week period that ends
    on the Saturday nearest March 31. For simplicity of
    disclosure, all fiscal periods are referred to as ending on a
    calendar month end. Our results of operations for the fiscal
    years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 contained 52 weeks
    and ended on March 29, 2008 and March 31, 2007,
    respectively. Our results of operations for the fiscal year
    ended March 31, 2006 contained 53 weeks and ended on
    April 1, 2006.

(c)

Reclassifications

Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to
    the fiscal 2008 presentation.

(d)

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities, contingent assets
    and liabilities, and revenue and expenses during the reporting
    period. Such estimates include sales returns and allowances,
    provisions for doubtful accounts, accrued liabilities, service
    period for deferred net revenue, income taxes, estimates
    regarding the recoverability of prepaid royalties and royalty
    commitments, inventories, long-lived assets, acquired in-process
    technology, certain estimates related to the measurement and
    recognition of costs resulting from our share-based payment
    transactions, deferred income tax assets as well as estimates
    used in our goodwill impairment test. These estimates generally
    involve complex issues and require us to make judgments, involve
    analysis of historical and future trends, can require extended
    periods of time to resolve, and are subject to change from
    period to period. In all cases, actual results could differ
    materially from our estimates.



(e)

Cash,
    Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments, Marketable Equity
    Securities and Other Investments

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with
    insignificant interest rate risk and original or remaining
    maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.

Short-term investments consist of securities with original or
    remaining maturities of greater than three months at the time of
    purchase. The short-term investments are available for use in
    current operations or other activities such as capital
    expenditures and business acquisitions.

As of March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2007, short-term
    investments and marketable equity securities were classified as

available-for-sale

and stated at fair value based upon quoted market prices for the
    securities. Unrealized gains and losses are included as a
    separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income,
    net of any related tax effect, in stockholders’ equity.
    Realized gains and losses are calculated based on the specific
    identification method. We recognize an impairment charge when we
    determine that a decline in the fair value of a security below
    its cost basis is

other-than-temporary.

Other investments, included in other assets on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets primarily consist of investments in equity
    securities accounted for under the cost method in accordance
    with Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”)
    No. 18, “

The Equity Method Of Accounting For
    Investments In Common Stock

”. The cost method of
    accounting is used for investments where we are not able to
    exercise significant influence over the operating and financing
    decisions of the investee. We evaluate other investments to
    determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate an

other-than-temporary

impairment in value. We recognize an impairment charge when we
    determine an

other-than-temporary

impairment in value exists.

(f)

Inventories

Inventories consist of materials (including manufacturing
    royalties paid to console manufacturers), labor and freight-in.
    Inventories are stated at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out method) or market value.

(g)

Property
    and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment, net, are stated at cost. Depreciation is
    calculated using the straight-line method over the following
    useful lives:

Buildings

20 to 25 years

Computer equipment and software

3 to 5 years

Furniture and equipment

3 to 5 years

Leasehold improvements

Lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the
    improvements, generally 1 to 10 years

Under the provisions of American Institute of Certified Public
    Accountants Statement of Position (“SOP”)

98-1,

“

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed
    or Obtained for Internal Use

”, we capitalize costs
    associated with customized internal-use software systems that
    have reached the application development stage and meet
    recoverability tests. Such capitalized costs include external
    direct costs utilized in developing or obtaining the
    applications and payroll and payroll-related expenses for
    employees who are directly associated with the development of
    the applications. Capitalization of such costs begins when the
    preliminary project stage is complete and ceases at the point in
    which the project is substantially complete and ready for its
    intended purpose. The net book value of capitalized costs
    associated with internal-use software amounted to
    $24 million and $18 million as of March 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively, and are being depreciated on a
    straight-line basis over each asset’s estimated useful life
    that ranges from three to five years.

(h)

Long-Lived
    Assets

We evaluate long-lived assets and certain identifiable
    intangibles for impairment, in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 144,
    “

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets

”, whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may



not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is measured by a
    comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future
    undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the
    asset. This may include assumptions about future prospects for
    the business that the asset relates to and typically involves
    computations of the estimated future cash flows to be generated
    by these businesses. Based on these judgments and assumptions,
    we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to
    reduce the value of the asset stated on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet to reflect its actual fair value. Judgments and
    assumptions about future values and remaining useful lives are
    complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety
    of factors, including but not limited to, significant negative
    industry or economic trends, significant changes in the manner
    of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall
    business and significant under-performance relative to expected
    historical or projected future operating results. If we were to
    consider such assets to be impaired, the amount of impairment we
    recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying
    amount of the asset exceeds its fair value which is estimated by
    discounted cash flows. We recognized $56 million in
    impairment charges in fiscal 2008. We recognized an
    insignificant amount of impairment in fiscal 2007 and 2006.

(i)

Taxes
    Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental
    Authorities

Taxes assessed by a government authority that are both imposed
    on and concurrent with specific revenue transactions between us
    and our customers is presented on a net basis in our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

(j)

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

We extend credit to various companies in the retail and mass
    merchandising industries. Collection of trade receivables may be
    affected by changes in economic or other industry conditions and
    may, accordingly, impact our overall credit risk. Although we
    generally do not require collateral, we perform ongoing credit
    evaluations of our customers and maintain reserves for potential
    credit losses. As of March 31, 2008 and 2007, we had
    11 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of our gross
    accounts receivable outstanding with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. As of
    both March 31, 2008 and 2007, we had 11 percent of our
    gross accounts receivable outstanding with GameStop Corp.

Short-term investments are placed with high quality financial
    institutions or in short-duration, investment-grade securities.
    We limit the amount of credit exposure in any one financial
    institution or type of investment instrument.

(k)

Revenue
    Recognition

We evaluate the recognition of revenue based on the criteria set
    forth in

SOP 97-2,

“

Software Revenue Recognition

”, as amended by

SOP 98-9,

“

Modification of

SOP 97-2,

Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
    Transactions

” and Staff Accounting Bulletin
    (“SAB”) No. 101, “

Revenue Recognition in
    Financial Statements

”, as revised by
    SAB No. 104,

“Revenue Recognition”

.
    We evaluate and recognize revenue when all four of the following
    criteria are met:

•

Evidence of an arrangement

. Evidence of an agreement with
    the customer that reflects the terms and conditions to deliver
    products that must be present in order to recognize revenue.

•

Delivery

. Delivery is considered to occur when a product
    is shipped and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership have
    been transferred to the customer. For online game services,
    delivery is considered to occur as the service is provided. For
    online services associated with our packaged goods products
    (other than massively multiplayer online games) such as
    matchmaking, we estimate the service period to be six months
    after the month of sale. For digital downloads that do not have
    an online service component, delivery is considered to occur
    generally when the download occurs.

•

Fixed or determinable fee

. If a portion of the
    arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable, we recognize
    revenue as the amount becomes fixed or determinable.



•

Collection is deemed probable

. We conduct a credit review
    of each customer involved in a significant transaction to
    determine the creditworthiness of the customer. Collection is
    deemed probable if we expect the customer to be able to pay
    amounts under the arrangement as those amounts become due. If we
    determine that collection is not probable, we recognize revenue
    when collection becomes probable (generally upon cash
    collection).

Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been
    satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have
    a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we
    report. For example, for multiple element arrangements, we must
    make assumptions and judgments in order to: (1) determine
    whether and when each element has been delivered;
    (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are
    essential to the functionality of the delivered products and
    services; (3) determine whether vendor-specific objective
    evidence of fair value (“VSOE”) exists for each
    undelivered element; and (4) allocate the total price among
    the various elements we must deliver. Changes to any of these
    assumptions or judgments, or changes to the elements in a
    software arrangement, could cause a material increase or
    decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular
    period.

Product Revenue:

Product revenue, including
    sales to resellers and distributors (“channel
    partners”), is recognized when the above criteria are met.
    We reduce product revenue for estimated future returns, price
    protection, and other offerings, which may occur with our
    customers and channel partners.

Shipping and Handling:

In accordance with
    Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue

No. 00-10,

“

Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and
    Costs

”, we recognize amounts billed to customers for
    shipping and handling as revenue. Additionally, shipping and
    handling costs incurred by us are included in cost of goods sold.

Online Subscription Revenue:

Online
    subscription revenue is derived principally from subscription
    revenue collected from customers for online play related to our
    massively multiplayer online games and Pogo-branded online games
    services. These customers generally pay on an annual basis or a

month-to-month

basis and prepaid subscription revenue is recognized ratably
    over the period for which the services are provided.

Software Licenses:

We license software rights
    to manufacturers of products in related industries (for example,
    makers of personal computers or computer accessories) to include
    certain of our products with the manufacturer’s product, or
    offer our products to consumers who have purchased the
    manufacturer’s product. We call these combined products
    “OEM bundles”. These OEM bundles generally require the
    customer to pay us an upfront nonrefundable fee, which
    represents the guaranteed minimum royalty amount. Revenue is
    generally recognized upon delivery of the product master or the
    first copy. Per-copy royalties on sales that exceed the minimum
    guarantee are recognized as earned.

(l)

Sales
    Returns and Allowances and Bad Debt Reserves

We estimate potential future product returns, price protection
    and stock-balancing programs related to product revenue. We
    analyze historical returns, current sell-through of distributor
    and retailer inventory of our products, current trends in retail
    and the video game segment, changes in customer demand and
    acceptance of our products and other related factors when
    evaluating the adequacy of our sales returns and price
    protection allowances. In addition, we monitor the volume of
    sales to our channel partners and their inventories as
    substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could
    result in high returns or higher price protection costs in
    subsequent periods.

Similarly, significant judgment is required to estimate our
    allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period. We
    analyze customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness,
    current economic trends, and historical experience when
    evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.

(m)

Advertising
    Costs

We generally expense advertising costs as incurred, except for
    production costs associated with media campaigns which are
    recognized as prepaid assets (to the extent paid in advance) and
    expensed at the first run of the advertisement. Cooperative
    advertising with our channel partners is accrued when revenue is
    recognized



and such amounts are included in marketing and sales expense if
    there is a separate identifiable benefit for which we can
    reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit identified.
    Otherwise, they are recognized as a reduction of net revenue. We
    then reimburse the channel partner when qualifying claims are
    submitted. We sometimes receive reimbursements for advertising
    costs from our vendors, and such amounts are recognized as a
    reduction of marketing and sales expense if the advertising
    (1) is specific to the vendor, (2) represents an
    identifiable benefit to us, and (3) represents an
    incremental cost to us. Otherwise, vendor reimbursements are
    recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold as the related
    revenue is recognized. Vendor reimbursements of advertising
    costs of $54 million, $28 million and $41 million
    reduced marketing and sales expense for the fiscal years ended
    March 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. For the fiscal
    years ended March 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, advertising
    expense, net of vendor reimbursements, totaled approximately
    $234 million, $163 million and $180 million,
    respectively.

(n)

Software
    Development Costs

Research and development costs, which consist primarily of
    software development costs, are expensed as incurred.
    SFAS No. 86, “

Accounting for the Cost of
    Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
    Marketed

”, provides for the capitalization of certain
    software development costs incurred after technological
    feasibility of the software is established or for development
    costs that have alternative future uses. Under our current
    practice of developing new products, the technological
    feasibility of the underlying software is not established until
    substantially all product development is complete, which
    generally includes the development of a working model. The
    software development costs that have been capitalized to date
    have been insignificant.

(o)

Stock-based
    Compensation

We recognize the cost resulting from all share-based payment
    transactions in our financial statements using a
    fair-value-based method. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123
    (revised 2004) (“SFAS No. 123(R)”),
    “

Share-Based Payment

”, we elected to use the
    modified prospective transition method of adoption. We measure
    compensation cost for all outstanding unvested stock-based
    awards made to our employees and directors based on estimated
    fair values and recognize compensation over the service period
    for awards expected to vest.

The estimated fair value of stock options and stock purchase
    rights granted pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan is
    determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The
    Black-Scholes valuation model requires us to make certain
    assumptions about the future. Estimation of these equity
    instruments’ fair value is affected by our stock price as
    well as assumptions regarding subjective and complex variables
    such as expected employee exercise behavior and our expected
    stock price volatility over the term of the award. Generally,
    our assumptions are based on historical information and judgment
    is required to determine if historical trends may be indicators
    of future outcomes.

Employee stock-based compensation expense is calculated based on
    awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated
    forfeitures. Forfeitures are revised, if necessary, in
    subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
    estimates and an adjustment is recognized at that time.

Changes to our underlying stock price, our assumptions used in
    the Black-Scholes option valuation calculation and our
    forfeiture rate as well as future equity granted or assumed
    through acquisitions could significantly impact compensation
    expense to be recognized in fiscal 2009 and future periods.

(p)

Acquired
    In-Process Technology

The value assigned to acquired in-process technology is
    determined by identifying those acquired specific in-process
    research and development projects that would be continued and
    for which (1) technological feasibility had not been
    established as of the acquisition date, (2) there is no
    alternative future use, and (3) the fair value is estimable
    with reasonable reliability.



(q)

Foreign
    Currency Translation

For each of our foreign operating subsidiaries, the functional
    currency is generally its local currency. Assets and liabilities
    of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars
    using month-end exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are
    translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates.
    The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are
    included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    income in stockholders’ equity.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of
    the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated
    in currencies other than the functional currency. Net foreign
    currency transaction gains (losses) of $20 million,
    $10 million and $(1) million for the fiscal years
    ended March 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, are
    included in interest and other income, net, in our Consolidated
    Statements of Operations.

(r)

Impact
    of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 157, “

Fair
    Value Measurements

”. SFAS No. 157 defines
    fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
    generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures
    about fair value measurements. Fair value refers to the price
    that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
    liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
    in the market in which the reporting entity transacts.
    SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that
    prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions.
    Fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level
    within the fair value hierarchy. In February 2008, the FASB
    issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) Financial
    Accounting Standard (“FAS”)

157-1,

“

Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB
    Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That
    Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease
    Classification or Measurement under Statement 13

” and
    FSP

FAS 157-2,

“

Effective Date of FASB Statement
    No. 157

”. These FSPs (1) defer the effective
    date in SFAS No. 157 for one year for certain
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those
    that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually),
    (2) exclude certain leasing transactions accounted for
    under SFAS No. 13, “

Accounting for
    Leases

”, from the scope of Statement 157, and
    (3) include several specific examples of items eligible or
    not eligible for the one-year deferral. The provisions of
    SFAS No. 157 are effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007,
    and interim periods within those fiscal years. FSP

FAS 157-1

is effective upon the initial adoption of
    SFAS No. 157. FSP

FAS 157-2

defers the effective date of certain provisions of
    SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal
    years for items within the scope of the FSP. We do not expect
    the adoption of SFAS No. 157, FSP

FAS 157-1

and FSP

FAS 157-2

to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
    Financial Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB
    Statement No. 115

”. SFAS No. 159 permits
    entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and
    certain other items at fair value that are not currently
    required to be measured at fair value. It also establishes
    presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate
    comparisons between entities that choose different measurement
    attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The
    provisions of SFAS No. 159 are effective for financial
    statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007. This Statement should not be applied
    retrospectively to fiscal years beginning prior to the effective
    date, except as permitted with early adoption. We are evaluating
    whether to adopt SFAS No. 159 and what impact the
    adoption would have on our Consolidated Financial Statements if
    we were to adopt it. If we adopt SFAS No. 159, it
    could have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

In June 2007, the FASB ratified EITF consensus conclusion on

EITF 07-03,

“

Accounting for Advance Payments for Goods or Services
    to Be Used in Future Research and Development

”.

EITF 07-03

addresses the diversity which exists with respect to the
    accounting for the non-refundable portion of a payment made by a
    research and development entity for future research and
    development activities. Under this conclusion, an entity is
    required to defer and capitalize non-refundable advance payments
    made for research and development



activities until the related goods are delivered or the related
    services are performed.

EITF 07-03

is effective for interim or annual reporting periods in fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2007 and requires
    prospective application for new contracts entered into after the
    effective date. The adoption of

EITF 07-03

will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (Revised 2007) (“SFAS No. 141(R)”),
    “

Business Combinations

”, which requires the
    recognition of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any
    noncontrolling interest in an acquiree at the acquisition date
    fair value with limited exceptions. SFAS No. 141(R)
    will change the accounting treatment for certain specific items
    and includes a substantial number of new disclosure
    requirements. SFAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to
    business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or
    after the beginning of the first annual reporting period
    beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The adoption of
    SFAS No. 141(R) will have a material impact on our
    Consolidated Financial Statements for material acquisitions
    consummated on or after March 29, 2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — An Amendment of ARB
    No. 51

”, which establishes new accounting and
    reporting standards for noncontrolling interest (minority
    interest) and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary.
    SFAS No. 160 also includes expanded disclosure
    requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its
    noncontrolling interest. SFAS No. 160 is effective for
    fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
    beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We do not expect
    the adoption of SFAS No. 160 to have a material impact
    on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2007, the FASB ratified EITF consensus conclusion on

EITF 07-01,

“

Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements

”.

EITF 07-01

defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting
    requirements for transactions between participants in a
    collaborative arrangement and between participants in the
    arrangement and third parties. Under this conclusion, a
    participant to a collaborative arrangement should disclose
    information about the nature and purpose of its collaborative
    arrangements, the rights and obligations under the collaborative
    arrangements, the accounting policy for collaborative
    arrangements, and the income statement classification and
    amounts attributable to transactions arising from the
    collaborative arrangement between participants for each period
    an income statement is presented.

EITF 07-01

is effective for interim or annual reporting periods in fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2008 and requires
    retrospective application to all prior periods presented for all
    collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date.
    While we have not yet completed our analysis, we do not
    anticipate the implementation of

EITF 07-01

to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161

,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — An Amendment of
    SFAS No. 133

”. SFAS 161 requires
    enhanced disclosures about an entity’s derivative and
    hedging activities, including how an entity uses derivative
    instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items
    are accounted for under SFAS No. 133,
    “

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

”, and how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
    financial performance, and cash flows. The provisions of
    SFAS No. 161 are effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008,
    and interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect
    the adoption of SFAS No. 161 to have a material impact
    on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of March 31, 2008 and 2007, we had less than
    $1 million and $1 million, respectively, in gross
    unrealized losses primarily attributable to our corporate bond
    investments. These gross unrealized losses were in loss
    positions for less than 12 months and 12 months or
    greater, as of March 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

We periodically evaluate our securities for impairment. Factors
    considered in the review of securities with an unrealized loss
    include the credit quality of the issuer, the magnitude of the
    unrealized loss position, the length of time that the security
    has been in a loss position, our intentions with respect to the
    selling or holding of such security as well as any contractual
    terms impacting the prepayment or settlement process. Based on
    our review, we do not consider the investments listed above to
    be

other-than-temporarily

impaired as of March 31, 2008.

Gross realized losses of $2 million and gross realized
    gains of $9 million were recognized from the sale of
    short-term investments for the year ended March 31, 2008.
    Gross realized losses of $1 million and gross realized
    gains of less than $1 million were recognized from the sale
    of short-term investments for the year ended March 31,

    cost and fair value of asset-backed securities with a weighted
    average maturity less than 1 year was $55 million and
    $56 million, respectively, while the amortized cost and
    fair value of asset-backed securities with a weighted average
    maturity of 1 to 2 years was $8 million. There were no
    asset-backed securities with a weighted average maturity of 2 to
    3 years.

Our investments in marketable equity securities consist of
    investments in common stock of publicly traded companies.

In May 2007, we entered into a licensing agreement with and made
    a strategic equity investment in The9 Limited, a leading online
    game operator in China. We purchased approximately
    15 percent of the outstanding common shares (representing
    15 percent of the voting rights at that time) of The9 for
    approximately $167 million. Our agreement with The9
    requires us to hold these common shares until May 2008. The
    licensing agreement gives The9 exclusive publishing rights for

EA
    SPORTS

tm

FIFA Online in mainland China.

In April 2007, we expanded our commercial agreements with, and
    made strategic equity investments in, Neowiz Corporation and a
    related online gaming company, Neowiz Games. We refer to Neowiz
    Corporation and Neowiz Games collectively as “Neowiz”.
    Based in Korea, Neowiz is an online media and gaming company
    with which we partnered in 2006 to launch

EA SPORTS FIFA
    Online

in Korea. We purchased 15 percent of the
    then-outstanding common shares (representing 15 percent of
    the voting rights at that time) of Neowiz Corporation and
    15 percent of the outstanding common shares (representing
    15 percent of the voting rights at the time) of Neowiz
    Games, for approximately $83 million. As discussed below,
    we also purchased preferred shares of Neowiz which we classified
    in other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In February 2005, we purchased approximately 19.9 percent
    of the then-outstanding ordinary shares (representing
    approximately 18 percent of the voting rights at the time)
    of Ubisoft Entertainment (“Ubisoft”) for
    $91 million. As of March 31, 2007, we owned
    approximately 15 percent of the outstanding shares of
    Ubisoft (representing approximately 14 percent of the
    voting rights). As of March 31, 2008, we owned
    approximately 15 percent of the outstanding shares of
    Ubisoft (representing approximately 24 percent of the
    voting rights). Our Ubisoft investment is accounted for as

available-for-sale

under the provisions of SFAS 115, “

Accounting for
    Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

”, as
    amended, and not under the equity method of accounting, because
    we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence
    over Ubisoft.

During fiscal 2008, we recognized an impairment charge of
    $81 million with respect to our investment in The9 and
    $28 million with respect to our Neowiz common shares. Both
    The9 and Neowiz are publicly traded companies and due to various
    factors, including the extent and duration during which the
    market price had been below cost, we concluded the decline in
    value was

other-than-temporary

as defined by SFAS No. 115, as amended. The
    $109 million impairment is included in losses on strategic
    investments on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

As of March 31, 2008, we had gross unrealized gains of
    $501 million and gross unrealized losses of $4 million
    in our marketable security investments. Based on our review, we
    do not consider the investments with gross unrealized losses to
    be

other-than-temporarily

impaired as of March 31, 2008. We evaluate our investments
    for impairment quarterly. If we conclude that an investment is

other-than-temporarily

impaired, we will recognize an impairment charge in income at
    that time. During fiscal 2007 and 2006, no

other-than-temporary

impairment charges were recognized.



We did not have any realized gains or losses from the sale of
    marketable equity securities for the years ended March 31,
    2008 and 2007. Realized gains from the sale of marketable equity
    securities were $1 million for the year ended
    March 31, 2006.

(d)

Other
    Investments Included in Other Assets

In April 2007, we also purchased all of the then-outstanding
    non-voting preferred shares of Neowiz for approximately
    $27 million and have included it in other assets in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. The preferred shares became
    convertible at our option into approximately 4 percent of
    the outstanding voting common shares of Neowiz in April 2008. We
    account for our investment in Neowiz under the cost method as
    prescribed by APB No. 18, as amended, “

The Equity
    Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock

”.

During fiscal 2008, we recognized an impairment charge of
    $9 million with respect to our Neowiz preferred stock. Due
    to various factors, including the extent and duration during
    which the fair value had been below cost, we concluded the
    decline in value was

other-than-temporary

as defined by APB No. 18, as amended. The $9 million
    impairment is included in losses on strategic investments on our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

During fiscal 2007 and 2006, no

other-than-temporary

impairment in other investments were recognized.

DERIVATIVE
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

We account for our derivative and hedging activities under
    SFAS No. 133. The assets or liabilities associated
    with our derivative instruments and hedging activities are
    recorded at fair value in other current assets or other current
    liabilities, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
    As discussed below, the accounting for gains and losses
    resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the
    derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge
    accounting.

We transact business in various foreign currencies and have
    significant international sales and expenses denominated in
    foreign currencies, subjecting us to foreign currency risk. We
    purchase foreign currency option contracts, generally with
    maturities of 15 months or less, to reduce the volatility
    of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenue and
    expenses denominated in certain foreign currencies. In addition,
    we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate
    foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with
    foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities, primarily
    intercompany receivables and payables. The forward contracts
    generally have a contractual term of approximately three months
    or less and are transacted near month-end. At quarter end, the
    fair value of the forward contracts generally is not
    significant. We do not use foreign currency option or foreign
    exchange forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes.

(a)

Cash
    Flow Hedging Activities

Our foreign currency option contracts are designated and qualify
    as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133. The
    effectiveness of the cash flow hedge contracts, including time
    value, is assessed monthly using regression as well as other
    timing and probability criteria required by
    SFAS No. 133. To receive hedge accounting treatment,
    all hedging relationships are formally documented at the
    inception of the hedge and the hedges must be highly effective
    in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged
    transactions. The effective portion of gains or losses resulting
    from changes in fair value of these hedges is initially
    reported, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity. The gross
    amount of the effective portion of gains or losses resulting
    from changes in fair value of these hedges is subsequently
    reclassified into net revenue or operating expenses, as
    appropriate, in the period when the forecasted transaction is
    recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The
    ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in
    fair value, if any, is reported in each period in interest and
    other income, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
    The effective portion of hedges recognized in accumulated other
    comprehensive income at the end of each year will be
    reclassified to earnings within 12 months.



The following table summarizes the activity in accumulated other
    comprehensive income, net of related taxes, with regard to the
    changes in fair value of derivative instruments, for fiscal 2008
    and 2007 (in millions):

Balance
    Sheet Hedging Activities

Our foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated as
    hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133. Accordingly,
    any gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of
    the forward contracts are reported in interest and other income,
    net. The gains and losses on these forward contracts generally
    offset the gains and losses associated with the underlying
    foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities, which are
    also reported in interest and other income, net, in our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

BUSINESS
    COMBINATIONS

VG
    Holding Corp.

On January 4, 2008, we acquired all of the outstanding
    shares of VG Holding Corp. (“VGH”), owner of both
    Bioware Corp. and Pandemic Studios, LLC, which create action,
    adventure and role-playing games. BioWare and Pandemic Studios
    are located in Edmonton, Canada; Los Angeles, California;
    Austin, Texas; and Brisbane, Australia. This acquisition
    positions us for further growth in role-playing, action and
    adventure genres. We paid approximately $2 per share to the
    stockholders of VGH and assumed all outstanding stock options
    for an aggregate purchase price of $682 million, including
    transaction costs. Separate from the purchase price and prior to
    January 4, 2008, we loaned VGH $30 million. The
    following table summarizes the estimated fair values of assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our
    acquisition of VGH for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008

Except for acquired in-process technology, which is discussed
    below, acquired finite-lived intangible assets are being

Approximately $47 million of the goodwill recognized upon
    acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.

In connection with our acquisition of VGH, we incurred acquired
    in-process technology charges of $138 million in relation
    to game software that had not reached technical feasibility as
    of the date of acquisition. The fair value of VGH’s
    products under development was determined using the income
    approach, which discounts expected future cash flows from the
    acquired in-process technology to present value. The discount
    rates used in the present value calculations were derived from a
    weighted average cost of capital of 17 percent. Should the
    in-process software not be successfully completed, completed at
    a higher cost, or the development efforts go beyond the
    timeframe estimated by management, we will not receive the full
    benefits anticipated from the acquisition. Benefits from the
    development efforts are expected to commence in fiscal years
    2009 through 2011.

The following table sets forth the estimated percent completion,
    the estimated cost to complete, and the value assigned to each

Based in Sweden, DICE develops games for PCs and video game
    consoles. This acquisition positions us for further growth in
    the PC and video game console market. In 2003 we acquired
    (1) approximately 1,911,403 shares of Class B
    common stock representing a 19 percent equity interest in
    DICE, and (2) a warrant to acquire an additional
    2,327,602 shares of to-be-issued Class A common stock
    at an exercise price of SEK 43.23. Prior to our tender offer in
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we accounted for our
    Class B common stock investment in DICE under the equity
    method of accounting, as prescribed by APB No. 18,
    “

The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in
    Common Stock

”. Separately, the warrant was recognized
    at a cost of $5 million as of March 31, 2006 and was
    included in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

On January 27, 2005, we completed a tender offer for
    3,235,053 shares of Class A common stock at a price of
    SEK 61 per share, representing 32 percent of the
    outstanding Class A common stock of DICE. During the tender
    offer period and through the end of fiscal 2005, we acquired,
    through open market purchases at an average price of SEK 60.33,
    an additional 1,190,658 shares of Class A common
    stock, representing approximately 12 percent of the
    outstanding Class A common stock of DICE. During the first
    three months and last two weeks of fiscal 2006, we acquired,
    through open market purchases at an average price of SEK 63.07,
    an additional 1,071,152 shares of Class A common
    stock, representing approximately 10 percent of the
    outstanding Class A common stock of DICE. Accordingly, on a
    cumulative basis as of March 31, 2006, we owned
    approximately 73 percent of DICE on an undiluted basis
    (excluding the warrant discussed above). As a result, we have
    included the assets, liabilities and results of operations of
    DICE in our Consolidated Financial Statements since
    January 27, 2005. The percent of DICE stock that we did not
    own was reflected as minority interest on our Consolidated
    Financial Statements from January 27, 2005 until the
    acquisition date of the remaining minority interest in October
    2006. DICE’s products were primarily sold through
    co-publishing agreements with us and our transactions with DICE
    were recorded on an arm’s-length basis.

In October 2006, the remaining minority interest in DICE was
    acquired for a total of $27 million in cash, including
    transaction costs. In connection with the acquisition of the
    remaining minority interest of DICE, the warrant was
    reclassified to goodwill for this wholly owned subsidiary.



Except for acquired in-process technology, which is discussed
    below, acquired finite-lived intangible assets are being

Mythic
    Entertainment, Inc.

On July 24, 2006, we acquired all outstanding shares of
    Mythic Entertainment, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of
    $76 million in cash, including transaction costs. Based in
    Fairfax, Virginia, Mythic is a developer and publisher of
    massively multiplayer online role-playing games. This
    acquisition positions us for further growth in the massively
    multiplayer online role-playing games market. The results of
    operations of Mythic and the estimated fair market values of the
    acquired assets and assumed liabilities have been included in
    our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of

JAMDAT
    Mobile Inc.

On February 15, 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding
    shares of JAMDAT Mobile Inc. Based in Los Angeles, California,
    JAMDAT was a global publisher of wireless games and other
    wireless entertainment



applications. This acquisition positions us for further growth
    in the mobile entertainment market. We paid $27 per share in
    cash in exchange for each share of JAMDAT common stock and
    assumed outstanding stock options and restricted stock units
    under certain JAMDAT equity plans for an aggregate purchase
    price of $684 million, including transaction costs. The

Prior to our acquisition of JAMDAT, on April 20, 2005,
    JAMDAT entered into a purchase agreement with the shareholders
    of Blue Lava Wireless, LLC (“Blue Lava”). In
    connection with JAMDAT’s acquisition of Blue Lava, JAMDAT
    stock was placed in escrow to satisfy certain indemnification
    provisions under the Blue Lava purchase agreement. Upon
    completion of our acquisition of JAMDAT, we assumed
    JAMDAT’s contingent liability and replaced the JAMDAT stock
    in escrow with $27 million in cash, also placed in escrow.
    The $27 million is included in our purchase price of JAMDAT
    as a pre-acquisition contingency. We were required to pay
    $9 million on each of the three anniversaries of the Blue
    Lava acquisition, beginning on April 20, 2006, less any
    claims we may have pursuant to the indemnification provisions of
    the Blue Lava purchase agreement. In April 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    we made payments of approximately $9 million in each
    period, thereby completing our payment of $27 million to
    Blue Lava.

The results of operations of JAMDAT and the estimated fair
    market values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities
    have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements
    since the date of acquisition.

Except for acquired in-process technology, which is discussed
    below, acquired finite-lived intangible assets are being

SFAS No. 142, “

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets

” requires that purchased goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangibles not be amortized. Rather, goodwill
    and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to at least
    an annual assessment for impairment by applying a
    fair-value-based test.

SFAS No. 142 requires a two-step approach to testing
    goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit. Our reporting
    units are determined by the components that constitute a
    business for which both (1) discreet financial information
    is available and (2) management of the reporting unit
    regularly reviews the operating results of that component. The
    first step tests for impairment by applying fair value-based
    tests at the reporting unit level. The second step (if
    necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair
    value-based tests to individual assets and liabilities within
    each reporting unit. We completed the first step of the annual
    goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008
    and found no indicators of impairment of our recorded goodwill.
    We did not recognize an impairment loss on goodwill in fiscal
    2008, 2007 or 2006.

Finite-lived intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization,
    as of March 31, 2008 and 2007, were $265 million and
    $210 million, respectively, and include costs for obtaining
    (1) developed technologies, (2) carrier contracts and
    related, (3) trade names, and (4) subscribers and
    other intangibles. Amortization of intangibles for fiscal 2008,
    2007 and 2006 was $60 million (of which $26 million
    was recognized in cost of goods sold), $54 million (of
    which $27 million was recognized in cost of goods sold) and
    $16 million (of which $9 million was recognized in
    cost of goods sold), respectively. Finite-lived intangible
    assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the
    lesser of their estimated useful lives or the agreement terms,
    typically from two to twelve years. As of March 31, 2008
    and 2007, the weighted-average remaining useful life for
    finite-lived intangible assets was approximately 5.2 years
    and 6.3 years, respectively.

Fiscal
    2008 Reorganization

In June 2007, we announced a plan to reorganize our business
    into several new divisions, including four new
    “Labels”: EA SPORTS, EA Games, EA Casual Entertainment
    and The Sims. Each Label operates with dedicated studio and
    product marketing teams focused on consumer-driven priorities.
    The new structure is designed to streamline decision-making,
    improve global focus, and speed new ideas to the market. In
    October 2007, our Board of Directors approved a plan of
    reorganization (“fiscal 2008 reorganization plan”) in
    connection with the reorganization of our business into four new
    Labels.

Since the inception of the fiscal 2008 reorganization plan
    through March 31, 2008, we incurred charges of
    $97 million, of which (1) $12 million were
    employee-related expenses, (2) $58 million related to
    the closure of our Chertsey, England and Chicago, Illinois
    facilities which included asset impairment and lease termination
    costs, and (3) $27 million related to other costs
    including other contract terminations as well as IT and
    consulting costs to assist in the reorganization of our business
    support functions. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we
    completed the closure of our Chertsey facility and consolidated
    our local operations and employees into our Guildford, England
    facility. Over the next 18 months, we expect to continue to
    incur IT and consulting costs to assist in the reorganization of
    our business support functions. The restructuring accrual of
    $5 million related to our fiscal 2008 reorganization as of
    March 31, 2008 is expected to be utilized by



June 30, 2008. This accrual is included in other accrued
    expenses presented in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

During fiscal 2008, we commenced marketing our facility in
    Chertsey, England for sale. Our reorganization charges include
    $50 million to write our Chertsey facility down to its
    estimated fair value (less costs to sell the property). We also
    reclassified the estimated fair value of the Chertsey facility
    from property and equipment, net, to other current assets as an
    asset held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In fiscal 2009, we anticipate incurring approximately
    $20 million of restructuring charges related to the fiscal
    2008 reorganization. Overall, including charges incurred through
    March 31, 2008, we expect to incur cash and non-cash
    charges between $115 million and $125 million by
    fiscal 2010. These charges will consist primarily of
    employee-related costs (approximately $10 million),
    facility exit costs (approximately $60 million), as well as
    other reorganization costs including other contract terminations
    and IT and consulting costs to assist in the reorganization of
    our business support functions (approximately $50 million).

Fiscal
    2006 International Publishing Reorganization

In November 2005, we announced plans to establish an
    international publishing headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.
    Through the quarter ended September 30, 2006, we relocated
    certain employees to our new facility in Geneva, closed certain
    facilities in the United Kingdom, and made other related changes
    in our international publishing business.

Since the inception of the restructuring plan, through
    March 31, 2008, we have incurred restructuring charges of
    approximately $35 million, of which $19 million was
    for employee-related expenses, $9 million for the closure
    of certain United Kingdom facilities, and $7 million in
    other costs. The restructuring accrual of $9 million
    related to our fiscal 2006 international publishing
    reorganization as of March 31, 2008 is expected to be
    utilized by March 2017. This accrual is included in other
    accrued expenses presented in Note 8 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

In connection with our fiscal 2006 international publishing
    reorganization, in fiscal 2009, we expect to incur approximately
    $5 million of restructuring charges. Overall, including
    charges incurred through March 31, 2008, we expect to incur
    between $50 million and $55 million of restructuring
    charges in connection with our fiscal 2006 international
    publishing reorganization, substantially all of which will
    result in cash expenditures by 2017. These restructuring charges
    will consist primarily of employee-related relocation assistance
    (approximately $30 million), facility exit costs
    (approximately $15 million), as well as other
    reorganization costs (approximately $7 million).

Other
    Restructurings

We engaged in various restructurings based on management
    decisions. As of March 31, 2008, all $44 million in
    cash had been paid out under these restructuring plans.

(7)

ROYALTIES
    AND LICENSES

Our royalty expenses consist of payments to (1) content
    licensors, (2) independent software developers, and
    (3) co-publishing and distribution affiliates. License
    royalties consist of payments made to celebrities, professional
    sports organizations, movie studios and other organizations for
    our use of their trademarks, copyrights, personal publicity
    rights, content

and/or

other
    intellectual property. Royalty payments to independent software
    developers are payments for the development of intellectual
    property related to our games. Co-publishing and distribution
    royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of
    product.

Royalty-based obligations with content licensors and
    distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and
    capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and
    subsequently paid. These royalty-based obligations are generally
    expensed to cost of goods sold generally at the greater of the
    contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on the total
    projected net revenue. Prepayments made to thinly capitalized
    independent software developers and co-publishing affiliates are
    generally in connection with the development of a particular
    product and, therefore, we are generally subject to development
    risk prior to the release of the



product. Accordingly, payments that are due prior to completion
    of a product are generally expensed to research and development
    over the development period as the services are incurred.
    Payments due after completion of the product (primarily
    royalty-based in nature) are generally expensed as cost of goods
    sold.

Our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed
    royalty payments which are initially recorded as an asset and as
    a liability at the contractual amount when no performance
    remains with the licensor. When performance remains with the
    licensor, we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually
    paid and as a liability when incurred, rather than recording the
    asset and liability upon execution of the contract. Minimum
    royalty payment obligations are classified as current
    liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are
    contractually due within the next twelve months. As of
    March 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately $10 million and
    $9 million, respectively, of minimum guaranteed royalty
    obligations had been recognized and are included in the
    royalty-related assets and liabilities tables below.

Each quarter, we also evaluate the future realization of our
    royalty-based assets as well as any unrecognized minimum
    commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely
    to be realized through product sales. Any impairments or losses
    determined before the launch of a product are charged to
    research and development expense. Impairments or losses
    determined post-launch are charged to cost of goods sold. In
    either case, we rely on estimated revenue to evaluate the future
    realization of prepaid royalties and commitments. If actual
    sales or revised revenue estimates fall below the initial
    revenue estimate, then the actual charge taken may be greater in
    any given quarter than anticipated. During fiscal 2008 and 2006,
    we recognized impairment charges of $4 million and
    $16 million, respectively. We had no impairment charges
    during fiscal 2007.

The current and long-term portions of prepaid royalties and
    minimum guaranteed royalty-related assets, included in other
    current assets and other assets, consisted of (in millions):

At any given time, depending on the timing of our payments to

and/or

independent software developers, we recognize unpaid royalty
    amounts owed to these parties as either accounts payable or
    accrued liabilities. The current and long-term portions of

    liabilities as well as other liabilities, consisted of (in

In addition, as of March 31, 2008, we were committed to pay
    approximately $1,540 million to content licensors and
    co-publishing

and/or

distribution affiliates, but performance remained with the
    counterparty (

i.e.

, delivery of the product or content or
    other factors) and such commitments were therefore not recorded
    in our Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 9 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

During the three months ended December 31, 2007, we

    Chertsey facility from property and equipment, net, to other
    current assets as an asset held for sale on our Consolidated
    Balance Sheet.

Depreciation expense associated with property and equipment
    amounted to $126 million, $113 million and

Deferred
    Net Revenue (Packaged Goods and Digital Content)

Deferred net revenue (packaged goods and digital content), was
    $387 million as of March 31, 2008 and $32 million
    as of March 31, 2007. Deferred net revenue (packaged goods
    and digital content), includes the deferral of (1) the
    total net revenue from the sale of certain online-enabled
    packaged goods and PC digital downloads for which we do not have
    VSOE for the online service we provide in connection with the
    sale of the software, and (2) revenue from the sale of
    certain incremental content associated with our core
    subscription services that can only be played online, which are
    types of “micro-transactions”. We recognize revenue
    from sales of online-enabled software products for which we do
    not have VSOE for the online service on a straight-line basis
    over an estimated six month period beginning in the month after
    shipment. In addition, we expense the cost of goods sold related
    to these transactions during the period in which the product is
    delivered (rather than on a deferred basis).

(9)

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Lease
    Commitments and Residual Value Guarantees

We lease certain of our current facilities, furniture and
    equipment under non-cancelable operating lease agreements. We
    are required to pay property taxes, insurance and normal
    maintenance costs for certain of these facilities and will be
    required to pay any increases over the base year of these
    expenses on the remainder of our facilities.

In February 1995, we entered into a build-to-suit lease
    (“Phase One Lease”) with a third-party lessor for our
    headquarters facilities in Redwood City, California (“Phase
    One Facilities”). The Phase One Facilities comprise a total
    of approximately 350,000 square feet and provide space for
    sales, marketing, administration and research and development
    functions. In July 2001, the lessor refinanced the Phase One
    Lease with Keybank National Association through July 2006. The
    Phase One Lease expires in January 2039, subject to early
    termination in the event the underlying financing between the
    lessor and its lenders is not extended. Subject to certain terms
    and conditions, we may purchase the Phase One Facilities or
    arrange for the sale of the Phase One Facilities to a third
    party.

Pursuant to the terms of the Phase One Lease, we have an option
    to purchase the Phase One Facilities at any time for a purchase
    price of $132 million. In the event of a sale to a third
    party, if the sale price is less than $132 million, we will
    be obligated to reimburse the difference between the actual sale
    price and $132 million, up to a maximum of
    $117 million, subject to certain provisions of the Phase
    One Lease, as amended.

On May 26, 2006, the lessor extended its loan financing
    underlying the Phase One Lease with its lenders through July
    2007, and on May 14, 2007, the lenders extended this
    financing again for an additional year through July 2008. On
    April 14, 2008, the lenders extended the financing for
    another year through July 2009. At any time prior to the
    expiration of the financing in July 2009, we may re-negotiate
    the lease and the related financing arrangement. We account for
    the Phase One Lease arrangement as an operating lease in
    accordance with SFAS No. 13, “

Accounting for
    Leases

”, as amended.

In December 2000, we entered into a second build-to-suit lease
    (“Phase Two Lease”) with Keybank National Association
    for a five and one-half year term beginning in December 2000 to
    expand our Redwood City, California headquarters facilities and
    develop adjacent property (“Phase Two Facilities”).
    Construction of the Phase Two Facilities was completed in June
    2002. The Phase Two Facilities comprise a total of approximately
    310,000 square feet and provide space for sales, marketing,
    administration and research and development functions. Subject
    to certain terms and conditions, we may purchase the Phase Two
    Facilities or arrange for the sale of the Phase Two Facilities
    to a third party.

Pursuant to the terms of the Phase Two Lease, we have an option
    to purchase the Phase Two Facilities at any time for a purchase
    price of $115 million. In the event of a sale to a third
    party, if the sale price is less than $115 million, we will
    be obligated to reimburse the difference between the actual sale
    price and $115 million, up to a maximum of
    $105 million, subject to certain provisions of the Phase
    Two Lease, as amended.



On May 26, 2006, the lessor extended the Phase Two Lease
    through July 2009 subject to early termination in the event the
    underlying loan financing between the lessor and its lenders is
    not extended. Concurrently with the extension of the lease, the
    lessor extended the loan financing underlying the Phase Two
    Lease with its lenders through July 2007. On May 14, 2007,
    the lenders extended this financing again for an additional year
    through July 2008. On April 14, 2008, the lenders extended
    the financing for another year through July 2009. At any time
    prior to the expiration of the financing in July 2009, we may
    re-negotiate the lease and the related financing arrangement. We
    account for the Phase Two Lease arrangement as an operating
    lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, as amended.

We believe that, as of March 31, 2008, the estimated fair
    values of both properties under these operating leases exceeded
    their respective guaranteed residual values.

The two lease agreements with Keybank National Association
    described above require us to maintain certain financial
    covenants as shown below, all of which we were in compliance
    with as of March 31, 2008.

In February 2006, we entered into an agreement with an
    independent third party to lease a facility in Guildford,
    Surrey, United Kingdom, which commenced in June 2006 and will
    expire in May 2016. The facility comprises a total of
    approximately 95,000 square feet, which we use for
    administrative, sales and development functions. Our rental
    obligation under this agreement is approximately
    $33 million over the initial ten-year term of the lease.

In June 2004, we entered into a lease agreement, amended in
    December 2005, with an independent third party for a studio
    facility in Orlando, Florida. The lease commenced in January
    2005 and expires in June 2010, with one five-year option to
    extend the lease term. The campus facilities comprise a total of
    140,000 square feet and provide space for research and
    development functions. Our rental obligation over the initial

five-and-a-half

year term of the lease is $15 million.

In July 2003, we entered into a lease agreement with an
    independent third party (the “Landlord”) for a studio
    facility in Los Angeles, California, which commenced in October
    2003 and expires in September 2013 with two five-year options to
    extend the lease term. Additionally, we have options to purchase
    the property after five and ten years based on the fair market
    value of the property at the date of sale, a right of first
    offer to purchase the property upon terms offered by the
    Landlord, and a right to share in the profits from a sale of the
    property. Existing campus facilities comprise a total of
    243,000 square feet and provide space for research and
    development functions. Our rental obligation under this
    agreement is $50 million over the initial ten-year term of
    the lease. This commitment is offset by expected sublease income
    of $6 million for a sublease to an affiliate of the
    Landlord of 18,000 square feet of the Los Angeles facility,
    which commenced in October 2003 and expires in September 2013,
    with options of early termination by either party after October
    2008.

In October 2002, we entered into a lease agreement, with an
    independent third party for a studio facility in Vancouver,
    British Columbia, Canada, which commenced in May 2003 and
    expires in April 2013. We amended the lease in October 2003. The
    facility comprises a total of approximately 65,000 square
    feet and provides space for research and development functions.
    Our rental obligation under this agreement is approximately
    $16 million over the initial ten-year term of the lease.

Development,
    Celebrity, League and Content Licenses: Payments and
    Commitments

The products we produce in our studios are designed and created
    by our employee designers, artists, software programmers and by
    non-employee software developers (“independent
    artists” or “third-party developers”). We
    typically advance development funds to the independent artists
    and third-party developers during development



of our games, usually in installment payments made upon the
    completion of specified development milestones. Contractually,
    these payments are generally considered advances against
    subsequent royalties on the sales of the products. These terms
    are set forth in written agreements entered into with the
    independent artists and third-party developers.

In addition, we have certain celebrity, league and content
    license contracts that contain minimum guarantee payments and
    marketing commitments that may not be dependent on any
    deliverables. Celebrities and organizations with whom we have
    contracts include: FIFA, FIFPRO Foundation, UEFA and FAPL
    (Football Association Premier League Limited) (professional
    soccer); NASCAR (stock car racing); National Basketball
    Association (professional basketball); PGA TOUR and Tiger Woods
    (professional golf); National Hockey League and NHL
    Players’ Association (professional hockey); Warner Bros.
    (Harry Potter and Batman); New Line Productions and Saul Zaentz
    Company (The Lord of the Rings); Red Bear Inc. (John Madden);
    National Football League Properties and PLAYERS Inc.
    (professional football); Collegiate Licensing Company
    (collegiate football and basketball); Viacom Consumer Products
    (The Godfather); ESPN (content in EA
    SPORTS

tm

games); Twentieth Century Fox Licensing and Merchandising (The
    Simpsons); and Hasbro, Inc. (a wide array of Hasbro intellectual
    properties). These developer and content license commitments
    represent the sum of (1) the cash payments due under
    non-royalty-bearing licenses and services agreements, and
    (2) the minimum guaranteed payments and advances against
    royalties due under royalty-bearing licenses and services
    agreements, the majority of which are conditional upon
    performance by the counterparty. These minimum guarantee
    payments and any related marketing commitments are included in
    the table below.

The following table summarizes our minimum contractual
    obligations and commercial commitments as of March 31, 2008

Lease commitments include contractual rental commitments of
    $13 million under real estate leases for unutilized office
    space resulting from our restructuring activities. These
    amounts, net of estimated future sub-lease income, were expensed
    in the periods of the related restructuring and are included in
    our accrued and other current liabilities reported on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2008. See
    Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)

Developer/licensor commitments include $10 million of
    commitments to developers or licensors that have been recorded
    in current and long-term liabilities and a corresponding amount
    in current and long-term assets in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets as of March 31, 2008 because payment is not
    contingent upon performance by the developer or licensor.

The amounts represented in the table above reflect our minimum
    cash obligations for the respective fiscal years, but do not
    necessarily represent the periods in which they will be expensed
    in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition to what is included in the table above, as discussed
    in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, we have adopted the provisions of FASB
    Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48,
    “

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes —
    An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

”. As
    of March 31, 2008, we had



a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the
    payment of related interest totaling $360 million, of which
    approximately $41 million is offset by prior cash deposits
    to tax authorities for issues pending resolution. For the
    remaining liability, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable
    estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will
    occur.

Total rent expense for all operating leases was
    $94 million, $88 million and $59 million, for the
    fiscal years ended March 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Legal
    proceedings

We are subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary
    course of business. We do not believe that any liability from
    any reasonably foreseeable disposition of such claims and
    litigation, individually or in the aggregate, would have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position
    or results of operations.

Director
    Indemnity Agreements

We entered into indemnification agreements with each of the
    members of our Board of Directors at the time they joined the
    Board to indemnify them to the extent permitted by law against
    any and all liabilities, costs, expenses, amounts paid in
    settlement and damages incurred by the directors as a result of
    any lawsuit, or any judicial, administrative or investigative
    proceeding in which the directors are sued or charged as a
    result of their service as members of our Board of Directors.

Undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to
    approximately $1.3 billion as of March 31, 2008. Those
    earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and,
    accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided
    thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of
    dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to both
    U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax
    credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign
    countries. It is not practicable to determine the income tax
    liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be
    distributed.

As of March 31, 2008, deferred tax assets, net, of
    $145 million were classified as current assets,
    $164 million were classified as non-current assets and
    deferred tax liabilities, net, of $5 million were
    classified as current liabilities, $5 million were
    classified as non-current liabilities. As of March 31,
    2007, deferred tax assets, net, of $84 million were
    classified as current assets, $25 million were classified
    as non-current assets and deferred tax liabilities, net, of
    $8 million were classified as non-current liabilities.

The net deferred tax asset valuation allowance was
    $22 million at March 29, 2008 and $5 million at
    March 31, 2007. Of the $22 million total valuation
    allowance, approximately $3 million is attributable to
    acquisition-related assets, the benefit of which will reduce
    goodwill when and if realized. The valuation allowance increased
    by $17 million in fiscal year 2008, primarily due to the
    loss on the impairment of our facility in Chertsey, England.

As of March 31, 2008, we have net operating loss
    (“NOL”) carryforwards attributable to various acquired
    companies of approximately $149 million. These net
    operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation
    under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, but are expected
    to be fully realized. The federal NOL if not fully realized,
    will expire beginning 2026 through 2028. Furthermore, we have
    state net loss carryforwards of approximately $328 million
    of which approximately $135 million is attributable to
    various acquired companies. The state NOL if not fully realized,
    will expire beginning 2016 through 2018. We also have
    U.S. federal and California tax credit carryforwards of
    $43 million and $66 million respectively. The
    U.S. tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates
    beginning in 2015 through 2028. The California tax credit
    carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we repatriated
    $375 million of foreign earnings to take advantage of the
    favorable provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act (the
    “Jobs Act”). Under the Jobs Act, the qualifying
    portion of this repatriation was eligible for a temporary
    85 percent dividends received deduction on certain foreign
    earnings. Accordingly, we recorded tax expense in fiscal 2006 of
    $17 million related to this repatriation.

During fiscal 2006 we recognized a $73 million reduction in
    income taxes payable following a U.S. Tax Court ruling
    regarding the proper allocation of the tax deduction for stock
    options between U.S. and foreign entities. Although the Tax
    Court ruling remains subject to appeal, as a precedent, it is
    relevant to our situation. Accordingly, we released a reserve of
    $73 million during fiscal 2006, whereby, we recorded a
    reduction to our income tax payable and an increase to
    additional paid-in capital with no impact to net income.

In February 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48 that
    clarifies the accounting and recognition for income tax
    positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns. On
    May 2, 2007, the FASB issued FSP

FIN 48-1,

“

Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation
    No. 48

”, which amended FIN No. 48 to
    provide guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax
    position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing
    previously unrecognized tax benefits. We adopted
    FIN No. 48 and FSP

FIN 48-1

on April 1, 2007, and recognized the cumulative effect of a
    change in accounting principle by recognizing a decrease in the
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $18 million,
    with a corresponding increase to beginning retained earnings. We
    also recognized an additional decrease in the liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits of $14 million with a
    corresponding increase in beginning paid-in capital related to
    the tax benefits of employee stock options. In our second
    quarter of fiscal 2008, we increased the beginning retained
    earnings by approximately $1 million to reflect an
    immaterial revision to the cumulative effect of the adoption of
    FIN No. 48.



The total liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits included
    in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of April 1, 2007 was
    $283 million. The liability for gross unrecognized tax
    benefits increased by approximately $29 million during the
    current year to a total liability as of March 31, 2008 of
    $312 million. Of these amounts, $41 million of
    liabilities would be offset by prior cash deposits to tax
    authorities for issues pending resolution. A reconciliation of
    the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits is
    summarized as follows (in millions):

As of March 31, 2008, approximately $257 million of
    the unrecognized tax benefits would affect our effective tax
    rate, as compared to $239 million as of April 1, 2007,
    if recognized upon resolution of the uncertain tax positions.

Interest and penalties related to estimated obligations for tax
    positions taken in our tax returns are recognized in income tax
    expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The
    combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax
    positions taken on our tax returns and included in non-current
    other liabilities was approximately $55 million as of
    March 31, 2008, as compared to $42 million as of
    April 1,2007. Approximately $13 million of accrued
    interest expense related to estimated obligations for
    unrecognized tax benefits was recognized during fiscal 2008.

Prior to April 1, 2007, we presented our estimated
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits as a current liability.
    Beginning on April 1, 2007, however, FIN No. 48
    requires us to classify liabilities for unrecognized tax
    benefits based on whether we expect payment will be made within
    the next 12 months. Amounts expected to be paid within the
    next 12 months are classified as a current liability and
    all other amounts are classified as a non-current liability. In
    addition, prior to April 1, 2007 we presented our estimated
    state, local and interest liabilities net of the estimated
    benefit we expect to receive from deducting such payments on
    future tax returns (

i.e.

, on a “net” basis).
    Beginning on April 1, 2007, FIN No. 48 requires
    this estimated benefit to be classified as a deferred tax asset
    instead of a reduction of the overall liability (

i.e.

, on
    a “gross” basis).

We file income tax returns in the United States, including
    various state and local jurisdictions. Our subsidiaries file tax
    returns in various foreign jurisdictions, including Canada,
    France, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The
    Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has completed its
    examination of our federal income tax returns through fiscal
    year 2003. As of March 31, 2008, the IRS had proposed, and
    we had agreed to, certain adjustments to our tax returns. The
    effects of these adjustments have been considered in estimating
    our future obligations for unrecognized tax benefits and are not
    expected to have a material impact on our financial position or
    results of operations. As of March 31, 2008, we had not
    agreed to certain other proposed adjustments for fiscal years
    1997 through 2003, and those issues were pending resolution by
    the Appeals section of the IRS. Furthermore, the IRS has
    commenced an examination of our fiscal year 2004 and 2005 tax
    returns. We are also under income tax examination in Canada for
    fiscal years 2004 and 2005. We remain subject to income tax
    examination in Canada for fiscal years after 1999, in France,
    Germany, and the United Kingdom for fiscal years after 2003, and
    in Switzerland for fiscal years after 2006.

The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is
    highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon
    resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may
    differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year. While
    it is reasonably possible that some of the issues in the IRS and
    Canadian examinations could be resolved in the next
    12 months, at this stage of the process it is not
    practicable to estimate a range of the potential change in the
    underlying unrecognized tax benefits.

PREFERRED
    STOCK

As of March 31, 2008 and 2007, we had
    10,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized but
    unissued. The rights, preferences, and restrictions of the
    preferred stock may be designated by our Board of Directors
    without further action by our stockholders.

STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Adoption
    of SFAS No. 123(R)

We adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004)
    (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), “

Share-Based
    Payment

”, as of April 1, 2006 and have applied the
    provisions of SAB No. 107, “

Share-Based
    Payment

”, to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).
    We are required to estimate the fair value of share-based
    payment awards on the date of grant. Upon adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R), we elected to use the modified
    prospective transition method of adoption which requires that
    compensation expense be recognized in the financial statements
    for all awards granted after the date of adoption as well as for
    existing awards for which the requisite service has not been
    rendered as of the date of adoption. Accordingly, prior periods
    are not restated for the effect of SFAS No. 123(R).

Prior to April 1, 2006, we accounted for stock-based awards
    to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with
    APB No. 25 and adopted the disclosure-only provisions of
    SFAS No. 123, as amended. Also, as required by
    SFAS No. 148, “

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation — Transition and Disclosure

”, we
    provided pro forma net income (loss) and net income (loss) per
    share disclosures for stock-based awards as if the
    fair-value-based method defined in SFAS No. 123 had
    been applied.

Valuation and Expense Recognition.

We
    recognize compensation costs for stock-based payment
    transactions to employees based on their grant-date fair value
    over the service period for which such awards are expected to
    vest. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined
    based on the quoted price of our common stock on the date of
    grant. The fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights
    granted pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan is
    determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The
    determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as
    well as assumptions regarding subjective and complex variables
    such as expected employee exercise behavior and our expected
    stock price volatility over the expected term of the award.
    Generally, our assumptions are based on historical information
    and judgment is required to determine if historical trends may
    be indicators of future outcomes. We estimated the following key
    assumptions for the Black-Scholes valuation calculation:

•

Risk-free interest rate.

The risk-free interest rate is
    based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of
    grant for the expected term of the option.

•

Expected volatility.

We use a combination of historical
    stock price volatility and implied volatility computed based on
    the price of options publicly traded on our common stock for our
    expected volatility assumption.

•

Expected term.

The expected term represents the
    weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain
    outstanding. The expected term is determined based on historical
    exercise behavior, post-vesting termination patterns, options
    outstanding and future expected exercise behavior.

•

Expected dividends

.

The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes valuation model to
    value our option grants and employee stock purchase plan were as
    follows:

Prior to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we valued
    our stock options based on the multiple-award valuation method
    and recognized the expense using the accelerated approach over
    the requisite service period. In conjunction with our adoption
    of SFAS No. 123(R), we changed our method of
    recognizing our stock-based compensation expense for
    post-adoption grants to the straight-line approach over the
    requisite service period; however, we continue to value our
    stock options based on the multiple-award valuation method.

Employee stock-based compensation expense recognized during the
    fiscal years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 was calculated
    based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced
    for estimated forfeitures. In subsequent periods, if actual
    forfeitures differ from those estimates, an adjustment to
    stock-based compensation expense will be recognized at that time.

The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense
    resulting from stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock
    units and our employee stock purchase plan included in our
    Consolidated Statements of Operations (in millions):

As of March 31, 2008, our total unrecognized compensation
    cost related to stock options was $186 million and is
    expected to be recognized over a weighted-average service period
    of 2.5 years. As of March 31, 2008, our total
    unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock and
    restricted stock units was $274 million and is expected to
    be recognized over a weighted-average service period of
    2.4 years.

APIC Pool.

We elected to adopt the alternative
    transition method provided in FSP FAS 123(R)-3,
    “

Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax
    Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards”,

for calculating
    the tax effects of stock-based compensation pursuant to
    SFAS No. 123(R), which allows for a practical
    exception in calculating the additional paid-in capital pool
    (“APIC pool”) of excess tax benefits upon adoption
    that is available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized
    subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). For
    employee stock-based compensation awards that are outstanding
    upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the alternative
    transition method provides a simplified method to establish the
    beginning balance of the APIC pool related to the tax effects of
    employee stock-based compensation. It also provides a simplified
    method to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the tax effects of
    employee stock-based compensation awards.

Cash Flow Impact.

Prior to our adoption of
    SFAS No. 123(R), cash retained as a result of tax
    deductions relating to stock-based compensation was presented in
    operating cash flows along with other tax cash flows.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires a classification change in
    the statement of cash flows. As a result, tax benefits relating
    to excess stock-based compensation deductions, which had been
    included in operating cash flow activities, are now presented as
    financing cash flow activities (total cash flows remain
    unchanged). For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, we
    recognized $45 million of tax benefit from the exercise of
    stock options, net of $6 million of deferred tax asset
    write-offs; of this amount, $51 million of excess tax
    benefit related to stock-based compensation was reported in
    financing activities. For the fiscal year ended March 31,
    2007, we recognized $34 million of tax benefit from
    exercise of stock options reported in operating activities, net
    of $2 million of deferred tax asset write-offs; of this
    amount, $36 million of excess tax benefit related to
    stock-based compensation was reported in financing activities.
    For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, we recognized
    $133 million of tax benefit from exercise of stock options
    reported in operating activities.



Summary
    of Plans and Plan Activity

Equity
    Incentive Plans

Our 2000 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Equity Plan”)
    allows us to grant options to purchase our common stock,
    restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock appreciation
    rights to our employees, officers and directors. Pursuant to the
    Equity Plan, incentive stock options may be granted to employees
    and officers and non-qualified options may be granted to
    employees, officers and directors, at not less than
    100 percent of the fair market value on the date of grant.

We also have options outstanding that were granted under
    (1) the Criterion Software Limited Approved Share Option
    Scheme (the “Criterion Plan”), which we assumed in
    connection with our acquisition of Criterion, and (2) the
    JAMDAT Mobile Inc. Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Incentive
    Plan and the JAMDAT Mobile Inc. 2004 Equity Incentive Plan
    (collectively, the “JAMDAT Plans”), which we assumed
    in connection with our acquisition of JAMDAT. We also have
    options and restricted stock units outstanding under the VG
    Holding Corp. 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the “VGH 2005
    Plan”), which plan we assumed in connection with our
    acquisition of VGH.

In connection with our acquisition of VGH, we also established
    the 2007 Electronic Arts VGH Acquisition Inducement Award Plan
    (the “VGH Inducement Plan”), which allowed us to grant
    restricted stock units to service providers who were employees
    of VGH or a subsidiary of VGH immediately prior to the
    consummation of the acquisition and who became employees of EA
    following the acquisition. The restricted stock units granted
    under the VGH Inducement Plan vest pursuant to either
    (1) time-based vesting schedules over a period of up to
    four years, or (2) the achievement of pre-determined
    performance-based milestones, and in all cases are subject to
    earlier vesting in the event we terminate a recipient’s
    employment without “cause” or the recipient terminates
    employment for “good reason”. We do not intend to
    grant any further awards under the VGH Inducement Plan.

In addition, in connection with our acquisition of VGH, in
    exchange for outstanding stock options and restricted stock, we
    granted service-based non-interest bearing notes payable solely
    in shares of our common stock to certain employees of VGH who
    became employees of EA following the acquisition. These notes
    payable vest over a period of four years, subject to earlier
    vesting in the event we terminate a recipient’s employment
    without “cause” or the recipient terminates employment
    for “good reason”.

Options granted under the Equity Plan generally expire ten years
    from the date of grant and are generally exercisable as to
    24 percent of the shares after 12 months, and then
    ratably over the following 38 months. All options granted
    under the Criterion Plan were exercisable as of March 31,
    2005 and expire in January 2012. The material terms of options
    granted under the JAMDAT and VGH 2005 Plans are similar to our
    Equity Incentive Plan.

As of March 31, 2008, the weighted-average contractual term
    for our stock options outstanding was 6.2 years and the
    aggregate intrinsic value of our stock options outstanding was

A total of 17 million shares were available for grant under
    our Equity Plan as of March 31, 2008, of which no more than
    6 million shares were eligible for grant in the form of
    restricted stock or restricted stock units.

The aggregate intrinsic value represents the total pre-tax
    intrinsic value based on our closing stock price as of

    shares upon the exercise of stock options.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options
    granted during fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $16.85,
    $17.75 and $15.19, respectively. The total intrinsic value of
    options exercised during fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006 was
    $144 million, $120 million and $199 million,
    respectively. The total estimated fair value (determined as of
    the grant date) of shares vested during fiscal years 2008, 2007
    and 2006 was $82 million, $105 million and
    $150 million, respectively.

Potential dilution is computed by dividing the options in the
    related range of exercise prices by 318 million shares of
    common stock, which were issued and outstanding as of
    March 31, 2008.

At our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, held on July 26,
    2007, our stockholders approved amendments to the 2000 Equity
    Incentive Plan to (a) increase the number of shares
    authorized for issuance under the Equity Plan by 9 million,
    (b) decrease by 4 million shares the limit on the
    total number of shares underlying awards of restricted stock and
    restricted stock units that may be granted under the Equity
    Plan — from 15 million to 11 million shares,
    and (c) revise the amount and nature of automatic initial
    and annual grants to our non-employee directors under the Equity
    Plan by adding restricted stock units and decreasing the size of
    stock option grants.

Restricted
    Stock Units and Restricted Stock

We grant restricted stock units and restricted stock
    (collectively referred to as “restricted stock
    rights”) under our Equity Plan to employees worldwide
    (except in certain countries where doing so is not feasible due
    to local legal requirements). Restricted stock units entitle
    holders to receive shares of common stock at the end



of a specified period of time. Upon vesting, the equivalent
    number of common shares are typically issued net of required tax
    withholdings, if any. Restricted stock is issued and outstanding
    upon grant; however, restricted stock award holders are
    restricted from selling the shares until they vest. Upon
    vesting, we will typically withhold shares to satisfy tax
    withholding requirements. Restricted stock rights are subject to
    forfeiture and transfer restrictions. Vesting for restricted
    stock rights is based on the holders’ continued employment
    with us. If the vesting conditions are not met, unvested
    restricted stock rights will be forfeited. Generally, our
    restricted stock rights vest according to one of the following
    vesting schedules:

•

100 percent after one year;

•

Three-year vesting with 25 percent cliff vesting at the end
    of each of the first and second years, and 50 percent cliff
    vesting at the end of the third year;

•

Four-year vesting with 25 percent cliff vesting at the end
    of each year; or

•

26 Month vesting with 50 percent cliff vesting after
    13 months and 50 percent after 26 months.

The following table summarizes our restricted stock rights
    activity, including the restricted stock units and notes payable
    in shares of common stock that we granted in connection with our
    acquisition of VGH, but exclude performance-based restricted
    stock unit grants discussed below, for the fiscal year ended

Includes (i) approximately 1,560,000 shares of common
    stock underlying service-based non-interest bearing notes
    payable solely in shares of our common stock, which we issued in
    exchange for VGH stock options and restricted stock to certain
    former VGH employees who became employees of EA following the
    acquisition, (ii) 529,000 restricted stock units granted
    under the VGH Inducement Plan, and (iii) 252,000 restricted
    stock units granted under the VGH 2005 Plan. The table above
    does not include performance-based restricted stock units
    granted under the VGH Inducement Plan, which are discussed below.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted stock
    rights is based on the quoted market value of our common stock
    on the date of grant. The weighted-average fair value of
    restricted stock rights granted during fiscal years 2008, 2007
    and 2006 was $52.06, $52.31 and $52.21, respectively. The total
    grant date fair value of restricted stock rights that vested
    during fiscal year 2008 and 2007 was $31 million and
    $10 million, respectively. There were no restricted stock
    rights that vested during fiscal year 2006.

Performance-Based
    Restricted Stock Units

Upon consummation of our acquisition of VGH, we granted
    approximately 691,000 performance-based restricted stock units
    under the VGH Inducement Plan to certain former VGH employees
    who became employees of EA following the acquisition. These
    performance-based restricted stock units vest contingent upon
    the achievement of pre-determined performance-based milestones,
    which we expect to occur over a period of up to approximately
    four years. If these performance-based milestones are not met,
    the restricted stock units will not vest, in which case, any
    compensation expense we have recognized to date will be reversed.

    stock unit activity for the fiscal year ended March 31,

The weighted-average grant date fair value of performance-based

    our common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average fair
    value of performance-based restricted stock units granted during
    fiscal year 2008 was $54.51. There were no performance-based
    restricted stock units granted during fiscal years 2007 and
    2006. There were no performance-based restricted stock units
    that vested during fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

Pursuant to our 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
    (“ESPP”), eligible employees may authorize payroll
    deductions of between 2 and 10 percent of their
    compensation to purchase shares at 85 percent of the lower
    of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of
    commencement of the offering or on the last day of each
    six-month purchase period.

At our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, held on July 26,
    2007, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2000
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase by 1.5 million the
    number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the
    Purchase Plan. As of March 31, 2008, we had 4 million
    shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under the
    ESPP.

During fiscal 2008, we issued 892 thousand shares under the ESPP
    with exercise prices for purchase rights ranging from $40.15 to
    $42.86. During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 the estimated
    weighted-average fair value of purchase rights was $14.57,
    $16.51 and $15.42, respectively.

We issue new common stock out of the ESPP’s pool of
    authorized shares. The fair value above was estimated on the
    date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
    assumptions described in this note under the headings
    “Adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)” and
    “Pre-SFAS No. 123(R) Pro Forma Accounting
    Disclosures”.

Pre-SFAS No. 123(R)
    Pro Forma Accounting Disclosures

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we accounted
    for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic value
    method in accordance with APB No. 25 and adopted the
    disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended.

Had compensation cost for our stock-based compensation plans
    been measured based on the estimated fair value at the grant
    dates in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123, as amended, we estimate that our
    reported net income and net income per share would have been the
    pro forma amounts indicated below. The fair value of each option
    grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model.



The following weighted-average assumptions were used for grants
    made under our stock-based compensation plans in fiscal 2006:

We have a 401(k) plan covering substantially all of our

    covering substantially all of our Canadian employees. These
    plans permit us to make discretionary contributions to
    employees’ accounts based on our financial performance. We
    contributed an aggregate of $13 million, $3 million
    and $2 million to these plans in fiscal 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively.

COMPREHENSIVE
    INCOME

We are required to classify items of other comprehensive income
    (loss) by their nature in a financial statement and display the
    accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately
    from retained earnings and additional paid-in capital in the
    equity section of a balance sheet. Accumulated other
    comprehensive income primarily includes foreign currency
    translation adjustments, and the net-of-tax amounts for
    unrealized gains (losses) on investments and unrealized gains
    (losses) on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. Foreign
    currency translation adjustments are not adjusted for income
    taxes as they relate to indefinite investments in

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

STAFF
    ACCOUNTING BULLETIN No. 108

In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB No. 108,
    “

Financial Statements — Considering the
    Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
    Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements

”.
    SAB No. 108 provides guidance on how prior year
    misstatements should be taken into consideration when
    quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements
    for purposes of determining whether the current year’s
    financial statements are materially misstated. We adopted
    SAB No. 108 in fiscal 2007.

In accordance with SAB No. 108, we considered both the
    “rollover” approach, which quantifies misstatements
    originating in the current year income statement and the
    “iron curtain” approach which quantifies misstatements
    based on the effects of correcting the misstatements existing in
    the balance sheet at the end of the reporting period. Prior to
    our application of the guidance in SAB No. 108, we
    used the rollover approach. We elected to recognize the
    cumulative effect of adoption as adjustments to assets and
    liabilities as of the beginning of fiscal 2007 and the
    offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained
    earnings for fiscal 2007.

Property
    and Equipment Capitalization Adjustment

We adjusted the beginning retained earnings balance for fiscal
    2007 related to the correction of our historical accounting
    treatment of certain property and equipment purchases. We
    capitalize property and equipment purchases when certain
    quantitative thresholds are met; otherwise, they are expensed
    when purchased. Our internal review of our capitalization
    thresholds suggested that certain property and equipment should
    have been capitalized and not expensed. We believe the impact of
    the property and equipment capitalization errors were not
    material to prior years’ income statements under the
    rollover approach. However, under the iron curtain method, the
    cumulative property and equipment capitalization errors were
    material to our fiscal 2007 financial statements and, therefore,
    we recognized the following cumulative adjustment to our fiscal
    2007 opening balance sheet (in millions):

Increase in property and equipment, net

Increase in deferred income tax liabilities

Business
    Tax Expense Adjustment

We adjusted the beginning retained earnings balance for fiscal
    2007 related to the correction of our historical accounting of
    certain business tax expenses. Our internal review indicated
    that we had inadvertently not accrued for approximately
    $7 million in probable business tax obligations related to
    prior years. We believe the impact of these adjustments were not
    material to prior years’ income statements under the
    rollover approach. However, under the iron curtain method, the
    cumulative business tax expense adjustments were material to our
    fiscal 2007 financial statements and, therefore, we recognized
    the following cumulative adjustment to our fiscal 2007 opening
    balance sheet (in millions):

NET
    INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE

The following table summarizes the computations of basic
    earnings per share (“Basic EPS”) and diluted earnings
    per share (“Diluted EPS”). Basic EPS is computed as
    net income divided by the weighted-average number of common
    shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the
    potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable
    through stock-based compensation plans including stock options,
    restricted



stock, restricted stock units, common stock through our employee
    stock purchase plan, warrants and other convertible securities
    using the treasury stock method.

As a result of our net loss for the fiscal year ended
    March 31, 2008, we have excluded certain stock awards from
    the diluted loss per share calculation as their inclusion would
    have been antidilutive. Had we reported net income during this
    period, an additional 7 million shares of common stock
    would have been included in the number of shares used to
    calculate diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended
    March 31, 2008.

Options to purchase 18 million, 16 million and
    7 million shares of common stock were excluded from the
    above computation of diluted shares for the fiscal years ended
    March 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, as their
    inclusion would have been antidilutive. For fiscal 2008, 2007
    and 2006, the weighted-average exercise price of these shares
    was $53.89, $55.84 and $63.64 per share, respectively.

RELATED
    PERSON TRANSACTIONS

Prior to becoming Chief Executive Officer of Electronic Arts,
    John Riccitiello was a Founder and Managing Director of
    Elevation Partners, L.P., and also served as Chief Executive
    Officer of VGH, which we acquired in January 2008. At the time
    of the acquisition, Mr. Riccitiello held an indirect
    financial interest in VGH resulting from his interest in the
    entity that controlled Elevation Partners, L.P. and his interest
    in a limited partner of Elevation Partners, L.P. Elevation
    Partners, L.P. was a significant stockholder of VGH.

On June 24, 2002, we hired Warren C. Jenson as our
    Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative
    Officer and agreed to loan him $4 million to be forgiven
    over four years based on his continuing employment. The loan did
    not bear interest. On June 24, 2004, pursuant to the terms
    of the loan agreement, we forgave $2 million of the loan
    and provided Mr. Jenson approximately $1.6 million to
    offset the tax implications of the forgiveness. On June 24,
    2006, pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement, we forgave
    the remaining outstanding loan balance of $2 million. No
    additional funds were provided to offset the tax implications of
    the forgiveness of the $2 million balance.

SEGMENT
    INFORMATION

Our reporting segments are based upon: our internal
    organizational structure; the manner in which our operations are
    managed; the criteria used by our Chief Executive Officer, our
    chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), to evaluate
    segment performance; the availability of separate financial
    information; and overall materiality considerations.

Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we managed our
    business primarily based on geographical performance.
    Accordingly, our combined global publishing organizations
    represented our reportable segment, namely Publishing, due to
    their similar economic characteristics, products and
    distribution methods. Publishing refers to the manufacturing,
    marketing, advertising and distribution of products developed or
    co-developed by us, or distribution of certain third-party
    publishers’ products through our co-publishing and
    distribution program.



During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we updated our
    financial systems to provide our CODM financial information
    based upon management’s new organizational structure (the
    “Label Structure”); that is, the EA Games, EA SPORTS,
    The Sims and EA Casual Entertainment businesses. In addition,
    our CODM now regularly receives separate financial information
    for four distinct businesses within the EA Casual Entertainment
    Label — EA Mobile, POGO, Hasbro and Casual
    Entertainment. Accordingly in assessing performance and
    allocating resources, our CODM reviews the results of seven
    operating segments: EA Games; EA SPORTS; The Sims; POGO; EA
    Mobile, and Hasbro and Casual Entertainment. Due to their
    similar economic characteristics, products and distribution
    methods, EA Games, EA SPORTS, The Sims, POGO, Hasbro and Casual
    Entertainment’s results are aggregated into one Reportable
    Segment (the “Label segment”) as shown below. The
    remaining operating segments’ results are not material for
    separate disclosure and are included in the reconciliation to
    consolidated operating loss below.

The following table summarizes the fiscal 2008 financial
    performance of the Label segment and a reconciliation of the
    Label segment’s profit to our consolidated operating loss

(487

Label segment profit differs from consolidated operating loss
    primarily due to the exclusion of (1) certain corporate and
    other functional costs that are not allocated to the Labels
    (2) the deferral of certain net revenue related to packaged
    goods and digital content (see Note 8 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements), and (3) the results of
    EA Mobile. Our Chief Executive Officer reviews assets on a
    consolidated basis and not on a segment basis.

When we updated our financial systems to provide our CODM
    financial information based upon the Label Structure, we did not
    recast our financial information for periods prior to fiscal
    2008. Accordingly, it is not practicable to provide comparable
    results based on the Label Structure for the fiscal years ended
    March 31, 2007 and 2006.

PROPOSED
    ACQUISITION OF TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE, INC. AND RELATED
    LINE OF CREDIT

On March 13, 2008, we commenced an unsolicited $26.00 per
    share cash tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of
    Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation
    (“Take-Two”), for a total purchase price of
    approximately $2.1 billion. On April 18, 2008, we
    adjusted the purchase price in the cash tender offer to $25.74
    per share following the approval by Take-Two stockholders of
    amendments to Take-Two’s Incentive Stock Plan, which would
    permit the issuance of additional shares of restricted stock to
    ZelnickMedia Corporation pursuant to its management agreement
    with Take-Two. The total aggregate purchase price for Take-Two
    did not change as a result of the adjustment to the per share
    purchase price in the tender offer. On May 9, 2008, we
    received a commitment from certain financial institutions to
    provide us with up to $1.0 billion of senior unsecured term
    loan financing at any time until January 9, 2009, to be
    used to provide a portion of the funds for the offer

and/or

merger. We will be required to repay any funds we borrow under
    the term loan facility, plus accrued interest, on the earlier of
    (a) 364 days from the date on which we initially
    borrow the funds and (b) August 9, 2009. On
    May 19, 2008, we extended the expiration date of the tender
    offer until June 16, 2008. We intend to pay for the
    Take-Two shares and related transaction fees and expenses with
    internally available cash and borrowings under the term loan
    facility or other financing sources, which may be available to
    us in the future.

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENT

In April 2008, we entered into definitive agreements to acquire
    certain assets from Hands-On Mobile Inc. and its affiliates
    relating to its Korean mobile games business based in Seoul,
    Korea. The purchase price to be paid for the assets at closing
    will be approximately $29 million in cash. The acquisition
    is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to
    close during our first quarter of fiscal 2009.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Electronic Arts Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Electronic Arts Inc. and subsidiaries (Electronic Arts Inc.) as
    of March 29, 2008 and March 31, 2007, and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
    and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the
    years in the three year period ended March 29, 2008. In
    connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
    statements, we have also audited the accompanying financial
    statement schedule. These consolidated financial statements and
    financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
    Electronic Arts Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
    based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Electronic Arts Inc. as of March 29, 2008 and
    March 31, 2007, and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
    ended March 29, 2008, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in notes 10, 12 and 14 to the consolidated
    financial statements, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation
    No. 48 (FIN 48),

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109,

effective April 1, 2007 and the
    provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment,

and the
    Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior
    Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current
    Year Financial Statements,

effective April 2, 2006.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Electronic Arts Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of March 29, 2008, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated
    May 23, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the
    effectiveness of Electronic Arts Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Electronic Arts Inc.:

We have audited Electronic Arts Inc. and subsidiaries’
    internal control over financial reporting as of March 29,
    2008, based on criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). Electronic Arts Inc.’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on Electronic Arts
    Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on
    our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Electronic Arts Inc. and subsidiaries
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of March 29, 2008, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded
    from their evaluation of their internal control over financial
    reporting as of March 29, 2008 the internal control over
    financial reporting of VG Holding Corp. (VGH), which the Company
    acquired on January 4, 2008. As of March 29, 2008,
    total assets, excluding goodwill and acquired intangible assets,
    subject to VGH’s internal control over financial reporting
    represented 2% of the Company’s consolidated total assets.
    For the period from January 4, 2008 through March 29,
    2008, total net revenue subject to VGH’s internal control
    over financial reporting represented less than 1% of the
    Company’s consolidated net revenue. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting of Electronic Arts Inc. also
    excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial
    reporting of VGH.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Electronic Arts Inc. and
    subsidiaries as of March 29, 2008 and March 31, 2007,
    and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss), and
    cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    March 29, 2008, and our report dated May 23, 2008
    expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
    statements.

Item 9:

Changes
    in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure

Not applicable.

Item 9A:

Controls
    and Procedures

Definition
    and Limitations of Disclosure Controls

Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”)) are controls and other procedures
    that are designed to ensure that information required to be
    disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as
    this report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
    forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to
    ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to
    our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
    regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluates these
    controls and procedures on an ongoing basis.

There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any
    system of disclosure controls and procedures. These limitations
    include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or
    overriding of the controls and procedures and reasonable
    resource constraints. In addition, because we have designed our
    system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we
    believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events,
    our system of controls may not achieve its desired purpose under
    all possible future conditions. Accordingly, our disclosure
    controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance, but not
    absolute assurance, of achieving their objectives.

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer,
    after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
    and procedures, believe that as of the end of the period covered
    by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were
    effective in providing the requisite reasonable assurance that
    material information required to be disclosed in the reports
    that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and is accumulated
    and communicated to our management, including our Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to
    allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
    in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act.

Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to
    provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. There are inherent limitations to the
    effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial
    reporting. These limitations include the possibility of human
    error, the circumvention or overriding of the system and
    reasonable resource constraints. Because of its inherent
    limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may
    not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any
    evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
    risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions, or that the degree of compliance with our policies
    or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as of the end of our most
    recently completed fiscal year. We have excluded from our
    evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting the
    internal control over financial reporting of VG Holding Corp
    (“VGH”), which we acquired on January 4, 2008. As
    of March 31, 2008, total assets, excluding goodwill and
    acquired intangible assets, subject to VGH’s internal
    control over financial reporting represented 2 percent of
    our consolidated total assets. For the period from
    January 4, 2008 through March 31, 2008, total net
    revenue subject to VGH’s internal control over financial
    reporting represented less than 1 percent of our
    consolidated net revenue. In



making its assessment, management used the criteria set forth in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework,

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). Based on this assessment, our management believes that,
    as of the end of our most recently completed fiscal year, our
    internal control over financial reporting was effective.

KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has
    issued an auditors’ report on the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting. That report appears
    on page 107.

Changes
    in Internal Controls

In preparation for management’s report on internal control
    over financial reporting, we documented and tested the design
    and operating effectiveness of our internal control over
    financial reporting. During fiscal 2008, there were no
    significant changes in our internal controls or, to our
    knowledge, in other factors that could significantly affect our
    disclosure controls and procedures.
