Item 1: Business

Overview

Electronic Arts develops, markets, publishes and
distributes interactive software games that are playable by
consumers on the following platforms:

n

Home videogame machines (such as the Sony
    PlayStation 2®, Microsoft Xbox®, Nintendo
    GameCube

TM

and Sony PlayStation consoles),

n

Personal computers (PCs),

n

Hand-held game machines (such as the Game
    Boy® Advance), and

n

Online, over the Internet and other proprietary
    online networks.

We were initially incorporated in California in
1982. In September 1991, we were reincorporated under the laws
of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located near
San Francisco, California at 209 Redwood Shores
Parkway, Redwood City, California 94065 and our telephone number
is (650) 628-1500.

One of our strengths is our ability to publish
interactive software games for multiple platforms. Our products,
designed to play on consoles and handhelds, are published under
license from the manufacturers of these platforms (for example,
Sony for the PlayStation and PlayStation 2, Microsoft for
the Xbox and Nintendo for the Nintendo GameCube and Game Boy
Advance) and we pay a fee to these console manufacturers for the
right to publish products on their platforms. We invest in the
creation of state-of-the-art software tools that we use in
product development and to convert products from one platform to
another. We also make important investments in facilities and
equipment that allow us to create and edit video and audio
recordings that are used in our games. Since our inception, we
have published games for over 43 different platforms.

Our product development methods and organization
are modeled on those used in other sectors of the entertainment
industry. Employees whom we call “producers” are
responsible for overseeing the development of one or more
products. The interactive software games that we develop and
publish are broken down into three major categories:
(1) EA studio products, (2) co-publishing
products, and (3) distribution products.

EA Studio Products

We develop games internally and also engage
third-parties to develop games on our behalf at our development
and production studios located near San Francisco,
Los Angeles, Orlando (Florida), Chicago, Vancouver,
Montreal, London and Tokyo. We publish our EA Studio
products under three major brands:

n

EA SPORTS

TM

— examples
    of some of our recent products published under the
    EA SPORTS brand are

Madden NFL 2004

(professional
    football),

    examples of some of our recent products published under the
    EA SPORTS BIG brand are

NFL STREET

(football),

SSX 3

(snowboarding),

Def Jam VENDETTA

(wrestling)
    and

NBA STREET Vol. 2

(basketball).

Co-publishing Products

Mainly through our EA Partners global
business unit, we team with other game developers who develop
their own interactive software games with our assistance, which
we then publish, market and distribute. An example of a recent
co-publishing product is

Battlefield
Vietnam

TM

, which was developed by Digital
Illusions, C.E. (“DICE”).

Distribution Products

We distribute interactive software games that are
developed by other companies. An example of a recent
distribution product is

Final Fantasy X-2

, which was
produced by Square Co. Ltd.

During fiscal 2004, we published 32 new
internally developed titles and co-published an additional 11
new titles. Of these titles, 27 sold over one million units
(aggregated across all platforms). In fiscal 2004, approximately
45 percent of our net revenue was generated by
international operations, compared to approximately
42 percent in fiscal 2003 and 37 percent in fiscal
2002.

Another strength of our business is that we have
developed many of our products to become franchise titles that
can be regularly iterated. For example, every year we release
new versions of most of our EA SPORTS titles. Likewise,
several of the EA GAMES and EA SPORTS BIG products
listed above are part of new or continuing product franchises.
We also release products called “expansion packs” for
PC titles that provide additional content (characters,
storylines, settings, missions) for games that we have
previously published. For example, we have published expansion
packs for

Battlefield 1942

, including

Battlefield
1942: The Road to Rome

and

Battlefield 1942: Secret
Weapons of WWII,

each of which expands the characters,
settings and gameplay of the original

Battlefield 1942

game. We consider titles that iterate, sequel or spawn
expansion packs to be franchise titles.

Method of Delivery

The console, PC and hand-held games that we
publish are made available to consumers on a disk (usually CD or
DVD format) or a cartridge that is packaged and typically sold
in retail stores and through our own online store. We refer to
these as packaged goods products. In North America and Europe,
our largest markets, these packaged goods products are sold
primarily to retailers that may be mass market retailers (such
as Wal-Mart), electronics specialty stores (such as Best Buy) or
game software specialty stores (such as Electronics Boutique).
We also maintain a smaller business where we license to
manufacturers of products in related industries (for example,
makers of personal computers or computer accessories) rights to
include certain of our products with the manufacturer’s
product or offer our products to consumers who have purchased
the manufacturer’s product. We call these combined products
“OEM bundles”.

There are three ways in which we publish games
that are playable online by consumers. First, we include online
capability features in certain of our PC and PlayStation 2
products and soon Xbox, which enable consumers to play against
one another via the Internet. We also publish games that are
playable only online. One type of these online-only games is
called “persistent state worlds” or massively
multiplayer online games and is server based. Consumers
experience these games as interactive virtual worlds where
thousands of other consumers can interact with one another.
Examples of our persistent state world products are

Ultima
Online

TM

and

The Sims Online.

These
persistent state world games are often sold to consumers in the
form of a CD or DVD that contains much of the software necessary
to play the game online. Other types of online-only games that
we publish are available on the World Wide Web and include card
games, puzzle games and word games (marketed under the
“Pogo” brand), all of which are made available to
consumers on our website, www.pogo.com, and on certain online
services provided by America Online, Inc.



Intellectual Property

Like other entertainment companies, our business
is based on the creation, acquisition, exploitation and
protection of intellectual property. Each of our products
embodies a number of separately protected intellectual
properties: our products are copyrighted both as software and as
audiovisual works; our product names are trademarks of ours or
others; and our products may contain voices and likenesses of
third parties or the musical compositions and performances of
third parties. Our products may also contain other content
licensed from third parties, such as trademarks, fictional
characters, storylines and software code.

We acquire intellectual property rights to
include in our products through license agreements such as those
with sports leagues and player associations, movie studios and
performing talent, music labels, music publishers and musicians.
These licenses are typically limited to use of the licensed
rights in products for specific time periods. In addition, our
products that play on videogame platforms such as the Sony
PlayStation 2 console include intellectual properties owned
by the platform company and licensed non-exclusively to us for
use. While we may have renewal rights for some licenses, our
business and the justification for the development of many of
our products is dependent on our ability to continue to obtain
the intellectual property rights from third parties at
reasonable rates.

Our products are susceptible to unauthorized
copying. Our primary protection against unauthorized use,
duplication and distribution of our products is copyright and
trademark. We typically own the copyright to the software code
as well as the brand or title name trademark under which our
products are marketed. We register our copyrights in the United
States, and register our significant trademarks in multiple
countries including the United States. In addition, console
manufacturers such as Sony typically incorporate security
devices in their consoles in an effort to prevent unlicensed use
of products.

Market

Historically, there have been multiple consoles
available in our business segment and vigorous competition
between console manufacturers. While Sony has for the past
several years been the clear leader (with its PlayStation and
PlayStation 2 consoles), Microsoft and Nintendo are large
and viable competitors, and PCs continue to be a strong
interactive game platform. We develop and publish products for
multiple platforms, and this diversification continues to be a
cornerstone of our strategy.

The following table details select information on
a sample of the console platforms for which we have published
titles:

We currently develop or publish products for ten
different hardware platforms. In fiscal 2004, our product
releases were for PlayStation 2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube,
PlayStation, PC, Game Boy Advance, Nokia N-Gage and online
Internet play. Our planned product introductions for fiscal 2005
are for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube,
PlayStation, PC, Game Boy Advance, Nokia N-Gage, Sony PSP,
Nintendo Dual Screen and online Internet play.

PlayStation 2.

Sony released the PlayStation 2 console in Japan in
March 2000, in North America in October 2000, and in
Europe in November 2000. The PlayStation 2 console is
a 128-bit, DVD-based system



that, with a network adaptor, is Internet ready,
as well as backward compatible with games published for its
predecessor, the PlayStation. We have published and are
currently developing numerous products for the Sony
PlayStation 2.

Nintendo GameCube.

Nintendo launched the Nintendo GameCube console in Japan in
September 2001, North America in November 2001 and in
Europe in May 2002. The Nintendo GameCube plays games that
are manufactured on a proprietary optical disk. We have
published and are currently developing numerous products for the
Nintendo GameCube.

Xbox.

Microsoft
launched the Xbox console in North America in
November 2001, in Japan in February 2002 and in Europe
in March 2002. The Microsoft Xbox is a 128-bit, DVD-based
system that is Internet ready. We have published and are
currently developing numerous products for the Microsoft Xbox.

Our early investment in products designed for
play on 32-bit PCs and consoles (such as the PlayStation), has
been strategically important in positioning us for the current
generation of 128-bit machines. We believe that such investment
continues to be important. During fiscal years 2004, 2003 and
2002, the video and computer games industry experienced a
platform transition from 32-bit CD-based and 64-bit
cartridge-based consoles to the current generation of 128-bit,
DVD-based game consoles and related software. The transition to
the current generation systems was initiated by the launch of
Sony’s PlayStation 2 in fiscal 2001, and continued
with the launches of the Nintendo GameCube and Microsoft’s
Xbox in fiscal 2002. As consumers shifted to the current
generation systems, our sales of 32-bit and 64-bit products
declined, a trend we expect to continue in fiscal 2005.

Online Games.

The
online gaming component of our business is still in its early
stages. To date, we have had limited success in finding ways of
generating revenue and profits from online games, including
subscription fees, “pay-to-play” fees and advertising.
In addition, we have had limited experience with developing
optimal pricing strategies or predicting usage patterns for our
online games. In our history, we have launched five persistent
state world products with mixed results. While we have achieved
success with

Ultima Online

, our other persistent state
world products, most notably

The Sims Online

and

Earth & Beyond

TM

, have not met
our expectations. Since the beginning of fiscal 2003, we have
launched our free EA SPORTS and EA GAMES NATION online
offerings, which can be accessed through certain of our PC and
PlayStation 2 titles. In fiscal 2004, we launched Club
Pogo, a subscription service for Pogo, offering exclusive games
and premium features. We had over 300,000 paying subscribers as
of March 31, 2004, however, the subscription fees to date
have been immaterial. The continued growth of the online sector
of our industry will depend on the following key factors:

n

Growing interest in multiplayer games,

n

Willingness by consumers to pay for online game
    content,

n

Rapid innovation of new online entertainment
    experiences,

n

Mass market adoption of broadband technologies,

n

Convergence of online capabilities in
    next-generation consoles, and

n

Ability to create on-line products that appeal to
    consumers in diverse global markets.

Competition

We consider ourselves to be part of the
entertainment industry. At the most fundamental level, our
products compete with other forms of entertainment, such as
motion pictures, television and music, for the leisure time and
discretionary spending of consumers. We believe that large
software companies and media companies are increasing their
focus in the interactive entertainment software market and, as a
result, stand to become more direct competitors. Several large
software companies and media companies (e.g., Microsoft and
Sony) are already established competitors in the software games
segment, and other diversified media/entertainment companies
(e.g., Time Warner and Disney) have announced their intent
to significantly expand their software game publishing efforts
in the future. Therefore, we believe that the software games
segment is best viewed as a segment of the overall entertainment
market.



The software games business is highly
competitive. It is characterized by the continuous introduction
of new titles and the development of new technologies. Our
competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited
resources to very large, diversified corporations with greater
financial and marketing resources than ours. Our business is
driven by hit titles, which requires us to invest significantly
in production and in marketing. Therefore, the availability of
significant financial resources has become a major competitive
factor in the software games segment, primarily as a result of
the costs associated with the development and marketing of game
software. Competition in the software games segment is also
based on product quality and features, timing of product
releases, brand-name recognition, access to distribution
channels, effectiveness of marketing and price.

In the software games segment, we compete with
Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, each of which develop and publish
software for their respective console platforms. We also compete
with numerous companies which are, like us, licensed by the
console manufacturers to develop and publish software games that
operate on their consoles. These competitors include Acclaim
Entertainment, Activision, Capcom, Eidos, Infogrames, Koei,
Konami, Lucas Arts, Midway, Namco, Sega, Square Enix, Take-Two
Interactive, THQ, Ubi Soft and Vivendi Universal Games,
among others. As discussed above, diversified media companies
such as Time Warner and Disney have also indicated their intent
to significantly expand their software game publishing efforts
in the future. In addition to competing for product sales, we
face heavy competition from other software game companies to
obtain license agreements which allow us the right to use
intellectual property included in our products; and many of
these content licenses are controlled by the diversified media
companies, many of which intend to expand their software game
publishing divisions.

Finally, the market for our products is
characterized by significant price competition, and we regularly
face pricing pressures from our competitors. These pressures
have, from time to time, required us to reduce our prices on
certain products. Our experience has been that software game
prices tend to decline once a generation of consoles has been in
the market for a significant period of time due to the
increasing number of software titles competing for acceptance by
consumers and the anticipation of the next generation of
consoles.

Relationships with Significant Hardware
Platform Companies

Sony.

Under the
terms of a licensing agreement we entered into with Sony
Computer Entertainment of America, effective as of April 2000
and as subsequently amended, we are authorized to develop and
distribute DVD-based software products compatible with the
PlayStation 2. Pursuant to this agreement, we engage Sony
to supply PlayStation 2 DVDs for our products. Many of our
PlayStation 2 products released during fiscal 2004 include
the capability of online play. Customers who have an online
adaptor, which is manufactured and sold by Sony, for their
PlayStation 2 consoles, are able to play these products
online.

In fiscal 2004, approximately 44 percent of
our net revenue was derived from sales of EA Studio
software for the PlayStation 2, compared to 37 percent
in fiscal 2003. We released 24 titles worldwide in fiscal 2004
for the PlayStation 2, compared to 19 titles in fiscal
2003. Our top five PlayStation 2 releases for the year were

Need for Speed Underground, Madden NFL 2004, Medal of Honor
Rising Sun, The Lord of the Rings; The Return of the King

and

FIFA Soccer 2004.

As expected, PlayStation product sales decreased
in fiscal 2004 primarily due to the transition to current
generation console systems. Although our PlayStation products
can be played on the PlayStation 2 console, we expect sales
of current PlayStation products to continue to decline in fiscal
2005.

Microsoft.

Under the
terms of a licensing agreement we entered into with Microsoft in
December 2000, as amended, we are authorized to develop and
distribute DVD-based software products compatible with the Xbox.
In May 2004, we announced that we would make many of our
games capable of being played online via Microsoft’s Xbox
Live service. Customers will be able to play these products
online once they have paid the Xbox Live subscription fee.

In fiscal 2004, approximately 13 percent of
our net revenue was derived from sales of EA Studio
software for the Xbox, compared to nine percent in fiscal 2003.
We released 21 titles worldwide in fiscal 2004 for the



Xbox, compared to 16 titles in fiscal 2003. Our
top five Xbox releases for the year were

Need for Speed
Underground, Madden NFL 2004

,

Medal of Honor Rising Sun,
The Lord of the Rings; The Return of the King

and

FIFA
Soccer 2004.

Nintendo.

Under the
terms of a licensing agreement we entered into with Nintendo of
America, effective as of November 2001, we are authorized to
develop and distribute proprietary optical format disk products
compatible with the Nintendo GameCube. Pursuant to this
agreement, we engage Nintendo to supply Nintendo GameCube
proprietary optical format disk products for our products.

In fiscal 2004, approximately seven percent of
our net revenue was derived from sales of EA Studio
software for the Nintendo GameCube, compared to seven percent in
fiscal 2003. We released 19 titles worldwide in fiscal 2004
for the Nintendo GameCube, compared to 17 titles in fiscal
2003. Our top five Nintendo GameCube releases for the year were

Need for Speed Underground, The Lord of the Rings; The Return
of the King, Medal of Honor Rising Sun, Madden NFL 2004

and

James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing

.

Products and Product Development

In fiscal 2004, we generated approximately
69 percent of our net revenue from EA Studio-produced
products released during the year. During fiscal 2004, we
introduced 32 EA Studios titles, representing
97 stock keeping units, or SKUs, compared to
31 EA Studios titles, comprising 86 SKUs, in
fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2004, we had 27 titles that sold
over one million units (aggregated across all platforms). In
fiscal 2003, we had 22 titles and in fiscal 2002 we had
16 titles that sold over one million units (aggregated
across all platforms). A SKU is a version of a title designed
for play on a particular platform and intended for distribution
in a particular territory.

For fiscal 2004, no title represented more than
10 percent of our total fiscal 2004 net revenue. For
fiscal 2003, we had one title,

Harry Potter and the Chamber
of Secrets

TM

, published on seven different
platforms, which represented approximately 10 percent of
our total fiscal 2003 net revenue. For fiscal 2002,

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone

TM

,
published on four different platforms, represented approximately
12 percent of our total fiscal 2002 net revenue.

The products produced by EA Studios are designed
and created by our employee designers and artists and by
non-employee software developers (“independent
artists” or “third-party developers”). We
typically advance development funds to the independent artists
and third-party developers during development of our games,
which payments are considered advances against subsequent
royalties based on the sales of the products. These terms are
typically set forth in written agreements entered into with the
independent artists and third-party developers.

We publish products in a number of categories
such as sports, action, strategy, simulations, role playing and
adventure, each of which is becoming increasingly competitive.
Our sports-related products, marketed under the EA SPORTS
brand name, accounted for a significant percentage of net
revenue in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002. The sports category
is highly competitive, and there can be no assurance that we
will be able to maintain our historical success in this category
or that our licenses will be renewed.

The retail selling prices of our newly released
products in North America (excluding re-releases of older titles
marketed as “Classics”), typically range from $30.00
to $50.00. “Classics” titles have retail selling
prices that range from $10.00 to $20.00. The retail selling
prices of our titles outside of North America vary widely
depending on factors such as local market conditions.

Our goal is to maintain our position as a leading
publisher of games sold for play on the current generation of
128-bit video game consoles and to extend our success into the
next generation of consoles and technology. We will continue to
invest in tools and technologies designed to facilitate
development of our products for current generation platforms
while also investing in tools and technologies for the next
generation of consoles and technology. These investments are
recorded in research and development in our Consolidated
Statement of Operations. We had research and development
expenditures of $511 million in fiscal 2004,
$401 million in fiscal 2003 and $381 million in fiscal
2002.

Earth & Beyond

have been below our
expectations. We intend to discontinue our

Earth &
Beyond

service in September 2004.

Our EA.com website offerings and persistent state
world games focus on targeting and serving consumers by:

n

Offering engaging and accessible online games,

n

Building a community in which consumers can
    interact with one another via chat, bulletin boards, events and
    match-making services for multi-player games and other contests,

n

Delivering innovative content that continually
    entertains, and

n

Establishing a direct relationship with each
    audience member through personalization and customization of
    user experiences.

Marketing and Distribution

We market the products produced by EA Studios
under the EA GAMES, EA SPORTS and EA SPORTS BIG
brands. Products marketed under the EA SPORTS brand
typically simulate professional and collegiate sports and
include franchises such as Madden NFL, FIFA Soccer and
NBA Live. Products marketed under the EA SPORTS BIG
brand typically feature extreme sports or modified traditional
sports and include such titles as

SSX 3, Def Jam
VENDETTA

and

NFL STREET.

Formerly known as Electronic Arts Distribution,
our EA Partners global business unit operates under a
variety of deal types and structures with the intent of
generating, leveraging and/or owning intellectual properties
conceived by third party developers, publishers or licensors
worldwide. Through EA Partners we provide direct
development expertise to our partners via an internal production
staff, while also making available our publishing resources to
provide sales, marketing and distribution services on a global
basis.

EA Partners currently has relationships with
DICE, Lionhead, Krome Studios, Black Hole Games, Free Radical
Design, Gas Powered Games, Castaway Entertainment and Eurocom
Developments, among others. EA Partners’ largest
co-publishing arrangement is with DICE, headquartered in
Stockholm, Sweden, in which we hold an equity interest. DICE is
the creator of the hit Battlefield series of online multiplayer
games, which include worldwide best-sellers

Battlefield

and

Battlefield Vietnam

on the PC.

EA Partners also distributes finished goods
on behalf of other third-party publishers. These titles are
developed and manufactured by other publishers and delivered to
us as completed products, for which we provide distribution
services. Our distribution partners have included Square Enix,
Capcom, Namco, Koei and NovaLogic.

The interactive software game business has become
increasingly “hit” driven, requiring significantly
greater expenditures for marketing and advertising of our
products, particularly for television advertising. There can be
no assurance that we will continue to produce “hit”
titles, or that advertising for any product will increase sales
sufficiently to recoup those advertising expenses.

We generated approximately 95 percent of our
North American net revenue from direct sales to retailers
through a field sales organization of professionals and a group
of telephone sales representatives. The remaining 5 percent
of our North American sales were made through a limited number
of specialized and regional distributors and rack jobbers in
markets where we believe direct sales would not be economical.
We had direct sales to one customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,
which represented 13 percent of total net revenue in fiscal
2004, 12 percent in fiscal 2003, and 14 percent in
fiscal 2002.

Outside of North America, we derive revenues
primarily from direct sales to retailers. Our largest indirect
sales relationship is with Pinnacle in Europe. Sales of our
products through Pinnacle make up approximately 12 percent
of our total net revenue. We use Pinnacle to provide logistical
and collection services to our retail customers. Under the terms
of our agreement with Pinnacle, our products are held by
Pinnacle on consignment until shipment to the retailer. In
addition, we authorize returns from, or price protection to,
retailers and we are obliged to give Pinnacle the corresponding
credit. In a few of our smaller markets, we sell



our products through distributors with whom we
have written agreements or informal arrangements, depending on
the business customs of the territories.

In North America, we have stock-balancing
programs for our PC products, which allow for the exchange of PC
products by resellers under certain circumstances. In all of our
major geographical markets, we accept product returns on our PC
products and we may decide to accept product returns or provide
price protection under certain circumstances for our console
products after we analyze inventory remaining in the channel,
the rate of inventory sell-through in the channel, and our
remaining inventory on hand. It is our policy to exchange
products or give credits, rather than give cash refunds. We
actively monitor and manage the volume of our sales to retailers
and distributors and their inventories as substantial
overstocking in the distribution channel can result in high
returns or the requirement for substantial price protection in
subsequent periods.

The distribution channels through which our games
are sold have been characterized by change, including
consolidations and financial difficulties of certain
distributors and retailers. The bankruptcy or other business
difficulties of a distributor or retailer could render our
accounts receivable from such entity uncollectible, which could
have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial
condition. In addition, an increasing number of companies are
competing for access to our distribution channels. Our
arrangements with our distributors and retailers may be
terminated by either party at any time without cause.
Distributors and retailers often carry products that compete
with ours. Retailers of our products typically have a limited
amount of shelf space and promotional resources that they are
willing to devote to the software games category, and there is
intense competition for these resources. There can be no
assurance that distributors and retailers will continue to
purchase our products or provide our products with adequate
levels of shelf space and promotional support.

Inventory and Working Capital

Our management focuses considerable attention to
managing our inventories and other working-capital-related
items. We manage inventories by communicating with our customers
prior to the release of our products, and then using our
industry experience to forecast demand on a product-by-product
and territory-by-territory basis. We then place manufacturing
orders for our products that match this forecasted demand. We do
not maintain substantial inventories of our products because
(1) historically, a substantial portion of a particular
product sales occur within the first 60-90 days after the
product’s release, and (2) the lead times on re-orders
of our products are generally short, approximately two to three
weeks. Further, as discussed in “Marketing and
Distribution” and in “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”,
we have practices in place with our customers (such as stock
balancing and price protection) that reduce product returns.

International Operations

We conduct business and have wholly-owned
subsidiaries throughout the world, including offices in
Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, the Czech Republic,
Denmark, England, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary,
Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland,
Portugal, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Taiwan, and Thailand. International net revenue
increased by 29 percent to $1,348 million, or
45 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2004, compared to
$1,047 million, or 42 percent of total net revenue in
fiscal 2003. Although we expect international revenue to grow in
fiscal 2005, we do not believe it will continue to grow at the
same rate as fiscal 2004.

The amounts of net revenue and identifiable
assets attributable to each of our geographic regions for each
of the last three fiscal years are set forth in Note 18 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in
Item 8 hereof.



Manufacturing and Suppliers

The suppliers we use to manufacture our games can
be characterized in three types:

n

Manufacturing entities that press our game disks,

n

Entities that print our game instruction
    booklets, and

n

Entities that package the disks and printed game
    instruction booklets into the jewel cases and boxes for shipping
    to customers.

In many instances, we are able to acquire
materials on a volume-discount basis. We have multiple potential
sources of supply for most materials, except for the disk
component of our PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and Nintendo
GameCube disk products, as discussed in “Relationships with
Significant Hardware Platform Companies”. We also have
alternate sources for the manufacture and assembly of most of
our products. To date, we have not experienced any material
difficulties or delays in production of our software and related
documentation and packaging. However, a shortage of components,
manufacturing delays by Sony or Nintendo, or other factors
beyond our control could impair our ability to manufacture, or
have manufactured, our products.

Backlog

We typically ship orders immediately upon
receipt. To the extent that any backlog may or may not exist at
the end of a reporting period, it would be both coincidental and
an unreliable indicator of future results of any period.

Seasonality

Our business is highly seasonal. We typically
experience our highest revenue and profits in the holiday season
quarter ending in December and a seasonal low in revenue and
profits in the quarter ending in June. However, our results can
vary based on title release dates and shipment schedules.

Employees

As of March 31, 2004, we employed
approximately 4,800 people, of whom over 2,300 were outside
the United States. We believe that our ability to attract and
retain qualified employees is a critical factor in the
successful development of our products and that our future
success will depend, in large measure, on our ability to
continue to attract and retain qualified employees. To date, we
have been successful in recruiting and retaining sufficient
numbers of qualified personnel to conduct our business
successfully. We believe that our relationships with our
employees are strong. None of our employees are represented by a
union, guild or other collective bargaining organization.

Item 2: Properties

We own or lease the following facilities. We
believe that suitable additional or substitute space will be
available as needed to accommodate our future needs.

Redwood City, California Headquarters
Campus

Our principal administrative, sales and
marketing, and support facility is located in Redwood City,
California. This location also includes facilities for research
and development.

In February 1995, we entered into a build-to-suit
lease with a third party for our headquarters facility in
Redwood City, California, which was refinanced with Keybank
National Association in July 2001 and expires in July 2006. We
accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in
accordance with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 13,

“Accounting for
Leases”

, as amended. Existing campus facilities
developed in phase one comprise a total of 350,000 square
feet and provide space for sales, marketing, administration and
research and development functions. We have an option to
purchase the property (land and facilities) for a maximum of
$145.0 million or, at the end of the lease, to arrange for
(i) an extension of the lease or (ii) sale of the
property to a third party while we retain an obligation to the
owner for approximately 90 percent of the difference
between the sale price and the guaranteed residual value of up
to $128.9 million if the sales price is less than this
amount, subject to certain provisions of the lease.

In December 2000, we entered into a second
build-to-suit lease with Keybank National Association for a
five-year term beginning December 2000 to expand our Redwood
City, California headquarters facilities and develop adjacent
property adding approximately 310,000 square feet to our
campus. Construction was completed in June 2002. We accounted
for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with
SFAS No. 13, as amended. The facilities provide space
for marketing, sales and research and development. We have an
option to purchase the property for a maximum of
$130.0 million or, at the end of the lease, to arrange for
(i) an extension of the lease, or (ii) sale of the
property to a third party while we retain an obligation to the
owner for approximately 90 percent of the difference
between the sale price and the guaranteed residual value of up
to $118.8 million if the sales price is less than this
amount, subject to certain provisions of the lease.

and development facility in Chertsey, England and a
5,000 sq. ft. development facility in Warrington,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations

OVERVIEW

The following overview is a top-level discussion
of our operating results as well as the trends and drivers of
our business. Management believes that an understanding of these
trends and drivers is important in order to understand our
results for fiscal 2004, as well as our future prospects. This
summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to
be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis
provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including in

About Electronic Arts

We develop, market, publish and distribute
interactive software games that are playable by consumers on
home videogame machines (such as the Sony
PlayStation 2®, Microsoft Xbox® and Nintendo
GameCube

TM

consoles), personal computers, hand-held
game machines (such as the Game Boy® Advance) and online,
over the Internet and other proprietary online networks. Many of
our games are based on content that we license from others
(e.g., Madden NFL Football, Harry Potter

TM

and FIFA
Soccer), and many of our games are based on our own wholly-owned
intellectual property (e.g., The Sims

TM

, Medal of
Honor

TM

). Our goal is to develop titles which appeal
to the mass markets and, as a result, we develop, market,
publish and distribute our games in over 100 countries, often
translating and localizing them for sale in non-English speaking
countries. Our goal is to create software game
“franchises” that allow us to publish new titles on a
recurring basis that are based on the same property. Examples of
this are the annual iterations of our sports-based franchises
(e.g., NCAA Football and FIFA Soccer), titles based on
long-lived movie properties (e.g., James Bond

TM

and
Harry Potter) and wholly-owned properties that can be
successfully sequeled (e.g., The Sims and Medal of Honor).

Overview of Fiscal 2004 Financial
Results

Net revenue for fiscal 2004 was
$2,957.1 million, up 19.1 percent as compared with
$2,482.2 million for fiscal 2003. We had 27 platinum titles
(over one million units sold) in fiscal 2004 as compared to 22
platinum titles in 2003. In fiscal 2004, six franchises sold
more than five million units: The Sims, Need for
Speed

TM

, Medal of Honor, FIFA Soccer, The Lord of the
Rings

TM

and Madden NFL Football

.

Net income for fiscal 2004 was
$577.3 million, an 82.1 percent increase over fiscal
2003. Diluted earnings per share increased 73.1 percent to
$1.87 as compared with $1.08 for fiscal 2003. The growth in
earnings was primarily driven by higher sales volume and
increased gross margin.

Operating cash flow was $669.3 million as
compared with $714.5 million for fiscal 2003. The decline
was primarily a result of the timing of sales during the fourth
quarter.

Management’s Overview of Historical and
Prospective Business Trends

Sales of “Hit”
Titles.

During fiscal 2004, sales of a
number of “hit” titles contributed to our revenue
growth, several of which were top sellers across a number of
international markets. Our top-five-selling titles across all
platforms worldwide in fiscal 2004 were

Need for
Speed

TM

Underground, Madden NFL 2004,
The Lord of the Rings

TM

; The Return of the
King

TM

, Medal of Honor

TM

Rising Sun

and

FIFA Soccer 2004

. Hit titles are
important to our financial performance because they benefit from
overall economies of scale. We have developed, and it is our
objective to continue to develop, many of our hit titles to
become franchise titles that can be regularly iterated.

Increased Console Installed
Base.

As consumers purchase the
current generation of consoles, either as first time buyers or
by upgrading from a previous generation, the console installed
base increases. As the installed base for a particular console
increases, we are generally able to increase our unit volume;
however, as consumers anticipate the next generation of
consoles, unit volumes often decrease. In the U.S. and Europe,



we believe the installed base for the current
generation of consoles — PlayStation2, Xbox and
Nintendo GameCube — increased over 30 percent,
60 percent and 80 percent, respectively, during fiscal
2004. Accordingly, we believe the significant increase in the
installed base for these consoles was a contributing factor to
our net revenue growth in fiscal 2004. In March 2004, Microsoft
reduced the retail price of its Xbox consoles in the U.S. and in
May 2004 Sony did the same with its PlayStation2 consoles. As
price reductions drive sales of consoles and the related
installed base of these current generation consoles increases
during fiscal 2005, we expect unit sales of current generation
titles to remain strong.

Software Prices.

As
current generation console prices decrease, we expect more
value-oriented consumers to become part of the interactive
entertainment software market. We experienced this trend several
years ago when prices were reduced on previous generation
consoles (e.g., Sony PlayStation and Nintendo 64). We believe
that hit titles will continue to be launched at premium price
points and will maintain those premium price points longer than
less popular games, however, as a result of a more
value-oriented consumer base, and a greater number of software
titles being published, we expect average software prices to
gradually come down, which we expect to negatively impact our
gross margin.

International Sales
Growth.

Our fiscal 2004 net
revenue from international sales accounted for approximately
45 percent of our worldwide net revenue, up from
42 percent in fiscal 2003. Our fiscal 2004 increase in
international net revenue was driven primarily by increased
sales in Europe. In fiscal 2005, we anticipate that
international net revenue will continue to increase as a
percentage of our worldwide net revenue, although not at the
same rate as in fiscal 2004, as we strengthen our presence in
new territories and as the console installed base expands more
rapidly outside of North America.

Foreign Exchange
Impact.

Given that a significant
portion of our business is conducted internationally in foreign
currency, fluctuations in currency prices can have a material
impact on our results of operations. For example, the average
exchange rate for one Euro, as compared to the U.S. dollar,
increased from $0.99 in fiscal 2003 to $1.17 in fiscal 2004. We
estimate that we had a total foreign exchange benefit on net
revenue of approximately $156 million during fiscal 2004 as
compared to fiscal 2003. Although we intend to continue to
utilize foreign exchange forward and option contracts to either
mitigate or hedge against some foreign currency exposures, we
cannot predict the effect foreign currency fluctuations will
have on us in fiscal 2005.

Increasing Cost of
Titles.

Hit titles have become
increasingly more expensive to produce and market as the
platforms on which they are played continue to advance
technologically and consumers demand continual improvements in
the overall gameplay experience. We expect this trend to
continue as we require larger production teams to create our
titles, the technology needed to develop titles becomes more
complex, we continue to develop and expand the online gaming
capabilities included in our products and we develop new methods
to distribute our content via the Internet. Any increase in the
cost of licensing third-party intellectual property used in our
products would also make these products more expensive to
publish.

Expansion of Studio Resources and
Technology.

During fiscal 2004, as
part of our effort to more efficiently utilize our resources and
technology, we expanded our studio facilities in Los Angeles and
Vancouver, allowing us to consolidate several smaller studios
and resources. In fiscal 2005, we expect to devote significant
resources primarily to the expansion of our studios in North
America and Europe. As we move through the life cycle of current
generation consoles, we will devote increased resources to
developing current generation titles, and increase spending
associated with tools and technologies for the next generation
of consoles. We expect to develop more titles internally as a
result of our studio expansions. We expect these activities to
increase our research and development expenses and decrease our
third-party development costs, both as a percentage of net
revenue. In addition, we expect the decrease in third-party
development costs to positively impact our gross margin.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND
ESTIMATES

Our financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial
statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
contingent assets and



liabilities, and revenue and expenses during the
reporting periods. The policies discussed below are considered
by management to be critical because they are not only important
to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of
operations but also because application and interpretation of
these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters
that are inherently uncertain and unknown. As a result, actual
results may differ materially from our estimates.

Sales Returns and Allowances and Bad Debt
Reserves

We principally derive revenue from sales of
packaged interactive software games designed for play on
videogame platforms (such as the PlayStation 2, Xbox and
Nintendo GameCube), PCs and hand-held game machines (such as the
Nintendo Game Boy Advance). Product revenue is recognized net of
sales allowances. We also have stock-balancing programs for our
PC products, which allow for the exchange of PC products by
resellers under certain circumstances. We may decide to provide
price protection for both our personal computer and videogame
system products. In making this determination, we evaluate
inventory remaining in the channel, the rate of inventory
sell-through in the channel, and our remaining inventory on
hand. It is our general practice to exchange products or give
credits, rather than give cash refunds.

We estimate potential future product returns,
price protection and stock-balancing programs related to
current-period product revenue. We analyze historical returns,
current sell-through of distributor and retailer inventory of
our products, current trends in the videogame market and the
overall economy, changes in customer demand and acceptance of
our products and other related factors when evaluating the
adequacy of the sales returns and price protection allowances.
In addition, management monitors and manages the volume of our
sales to retailers and distributors and their inventories, as
substantial overstocking in the distribution channel can result
in high returns or substantial price protection requirements in
subsequent periods. In the past, actual returns have not
generally exceeded our reserves. However, actual returns and
price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold
products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid
changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or
technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates
or competing products. For example, the risk of product returns
for our products may increase as the PlayStation 2, Xbox and
Nintendo GameCube consoles pass the midpoint of their lifecycle
and an increasing number and aggregate amount of competitive
products heighten pricing and competitive pressures. While
management believes it can make reliable estimates regarding
these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective.
Accordingly, if our estimates changed, our returns reserves
would change, which would impact the net revenue we report. For
example, if actual returns were significantly greater than the
reserves we have established, our actual results would decrease
our reported net revenue. Conversely, if actual returns were
significantly less than our reserves, this would increase our
reported net revenue.

Similarly, significant judgment is required to
estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting
period. We determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by
evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current
economic trends. Depending upon the overall economic climate and
the financial condition of our customers, the amount and timing
of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change
significantly.

We cannot predict customer bankruptcies or an
inability of any of our customers to meet their financial
obligations to us. Therefore, our estimates could differ
materially from actual results.

Royalties & Licenses

Our royalty expenses consist of payments to
(1) co-publishing and/or distribution affiliates,
(2) content licensors, and (3) independent software
developers. Co-publishing and distribution royalties are
payments made to third parties for delivery of product. License
royalties consist of payments made to celebrities, professional
sports organizations, movie studios and other organizations for
our use of their trademark, copyright, personal publicity
rights, content and/or other intellectual property. Royalty
payments to independent software developers are payments for the
development of intellectual property related to our games.



Royalty-based payments made to content licensors
and distribution affiliates that are paid in advance are
generally capitalized as prepaid royalties and expensed to cost
of goods sold at the greater of the contractual or effective
royalty rate based on net product sales. With regard to payments
made to independent software developers and co-publishing
affiliates, we are generally subject to development risk prior
to the general release of the product. Accordingly, payments
that are due prior to completion of the product are generally
expensed as research and development as the services are
incurred. Payments due after completion of the product
(primarily royalty-based in nature) are generally expensed as
cost of goods sold at the higher of the contractual or effective
royalty rate based on net product sales.

Each quarter, we also evaluate the future
realization of any prepaid royalties as well as minimum
commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely
to be realized through product sales. Any impairments determined
before the launch of a product are charged to research and
development expense. Impairments determined post-launch are
charged to cost of goods sold. In either case, we rely on
estimated revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid
royalties. If actual revenue, or revised sales estimates, fall
below the initial sales estimate, then the actual charge taken
may be greater in any given quarter than anticipated. As of
March 31, 2004 we had $22.7 million of prepaid royalty
assets and approximately $130.3 million in future
obligations to our co-publishing and/or distribution affiliates
and content licensors that could be impaired if our sales
estimates changed.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets

We evaluate both purchased intangible assets and
other long-lived assets in order to determine if events or
changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in
value exists. This evaluation requires us to estimate, among
other things, the remaining useful lives of the assets and
future cash flows of the business. These evaluations and
estimates require the use of judgment. Our actual results could
differ materially from our current estimates.

Under current accounting standards, we make
judgments about the remaining useful lives of purchased
intangible assets and other long-lived assets whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in the
remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated
balance sheet. In order to determine if a potential impairment
has occurred, management makes various assumptions about the
future value of the asset by evaluating future business
prospects and estimated cash flows. Our future net cash flows
are primarily dependent on the sale of products for play on
proprietary videogame consoles, hand-held game machines and PCs
(“platforms”). The success of our products is affected
by our ability to accurately predict which platforms and which
products we develop will be successful. Also, our revenue and
earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product
release schedules. Due to product sales shortfalls, we may not
realize the future net cash flows necessary to recover our
long-lived assets, which may result in an impairment charge
being recorded in the future. We recorded $0.5 million of
impairment charges on long-lived assets during fiscal 2004,
$66.3 million during fiscal 2003 and $12.8 million in
fiscal 2002.

Income Taxes

In the ordinary course of our business, there are
many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax
determination is uncertain. As part of the process of preparing
our consolidated financial statements, we are required to
estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which
we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for
such periods. This process requires estimating both our
geographic mix of income and our current tax exposures in each
jurisdiction where we operate. These estimates involve complex
issues, require extended periods of time to resolve, and require
us to make judgments, such as anticipating the positions that we
will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the
returns. We are also required to make the determinations of the
need to record deferred tax liabilities and the recoverability
of deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is established to
the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based
on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction.

In addition, changes in our business, including
the geographic mix of income, as well as changes in valuation
allowances, the applicable accounting rules, the applicable tax
laws and regulations and interpretations



thereof, developments in tax audit matters, and
estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall
effective income tax rate. For example, in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004, we resolved certain tax-related matters with the
Internal Revenue Service, which lowered our income tax expense
by $19.7 million and resulted in a 2.5 percent rate
reduction.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our fiscal year is reported on a 52/53-week
period that ends on the final Saturday of March in each year.
The results of operations for the fiscal years ended
March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 each contain 52 weeks
and ended on March 27, 2004, March 29, 2003 and
March 30, 2002, respectively. For simplicity of
presentation, all fiscal periods are treated as ending on a
calendar month end.

On October 20, 2003, our Board of Directors
authorized a two-for-one stock split of our Class A common
stock which was distributed on November 17, 2003 in the
form of a stock dividend for shareholders of record at the close
of business on November 3, 2003. All issued and outstanding
share and per-share amounts related to the Class A common
stock have been restated to reflect the stock split for all
periods presented.

Comparison of Fiscal 2004 to Fiscal

Net Revenue

We principally derive net revenue from sales of
packaged interactive software games designed for play on
videogame consoles (such as the PlayStation 2, Xbox and
Nintendo GameCube), PCs and hand-held game machines (such as the
Nintendo Game Boy Advance). Additionally, in Europe and Asia we
generate a significant portion of net revenue by marketing and
selling third-party interactive software games through our
established distribution network. We also derive net revenue
from selling subscriptions to online games, programming
third-party web sites, allowing other companies to manufacture
and sell our products in conjunction with other products, and
selling advertisements on our online web pages.

From a geographical perspective, our net revenue
for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004 and 2003 was as
follows (in thousands):

North America

For fiscal 2004, net revenue in North America
increased by 12.1 percent as compared to fiscal 2003. From
a franchise perspective, the net revenue increase was primarily
driven by higher sales of products released during the year
ended March 31, 2004 in the following eight franchises:
Need for Speed

TM

, NBA STREET, NFL STREET, Madden NFL,
Def Jam

TM

, SSX, Tiger Woods/ PGA TOUR® and
MVP Baseball

TM

. Increased sales in these
franchises resulted in increased net revenue of
$353.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2004 as
compared to the year ended March 31, 2003. Increases in net
revenue from these franchises were partially offset by
(1) a decrease in our Harry Potter franchise, as the fiscal
2004 title,

Harry Potter

TM

:

Quidditch

TM

World Cup

, had no
associated movie release, while our fiscal 2003 product,

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

TM

, was
released in conjunction with the blockbuster movie of the same
title, (2) the termination of our Square EA joint venture
agreement, and (3) a decrease in net revenue in our



Bond franchise as a result of the timing of the
release of

James Bond 007

TM

:

Everything or Nothing

TM

(on all platforms
except the Game Boy Advance) in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004, as compared to the strong sales of

James Bond 007:
NIGHTFIRE

TM

, which was released in the
third quarter of fiscal 2003. Together, lower sales in these
franchises reduced net revenue by $176.8 million for the
year ended March 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended
March 31, 2003.

Europe

For fiscal 2004, net revenue in Europe increased
by 34.3 percent as compared to fiscal 2003. We estimate
foreign exchange rates (primarily the Euro and the British pound
sterling) strengthened reported European net revenue by
approximately $136 million or 15 percent for the year
ended March 31, 2004. From a franchise perspective, the net
revenue increase was primarily driven by higher sales of
products released during the year ended March 31, 2004 in
the following eleven franchises: Need for Speed, The Sims, FIFA
Soccer, Lord of the Rings

TM

, Medal of Honor, Final
Fantasy, SSX, Football Manager, Freedom Fighters, Tiger Woods/
PGA TOUR and Rugby. Increased sales in these franchises resulted
in an increase in net revenue of $372.6 million for the
year ended March 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended
March 31, 2003. The increase was partially offset by
(1) a decrease in our Harry Potter franchise, as the fiscal
2004 title,

Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup,

had no
associated movie release, while our fiscal 2003 product,

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,

was released in
conjunction with the blockbuster movie of the same title, and
(2) an expected decrease in sales of our World Cup
franchise due to strong sales in the year ended March 31,
2003 in conjunction with the World Cup event and no similar
event in the year ended March 31, 2004. Together, the two
items noted above, reduced net revenue by $92.3 million for
the year ended March 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended
March 31, 2003.

Asia Pacific

For fiscal 2004, net revenue from sales in the
Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan, increased by
10.4 percent as compared to fiscal 2003. The growth in net
revenue was driven by the Need for Speed,

The Sims and
other franchises, partially offset by declines in the Harry
Potter and World Cup franchises. We estimate foreign exchange
rates strengthened reported Asia Pacific net revenue by
approximately $15 million or 17 percent, for the year
ended March 31, 2004. Excluding the effect of foreign
exchange rates, we estimate that Asia Pacific net revenue
decreased by approximately $6 million or 7 percent,
for the year ended March 31, 2004.

Japan

For fiscal 2004, net revenue from sales in Japan
decreased by 11.8 percent as compared to fiscal 2003
primarily due to declines in sales in the World Cup, Harry
Potter and Final Fantasy franchises. In addition, we estimate
that favorable changes in foreign exchange rates offset the
decline in reported net revenue in Japan by approximately
$6 million or 7 percent, for the year ended
March 31, 2004.



Our worldwide net revenue by product line for
fiscal years 2004 and 2003 was as follows (in thousands):

PlayStation 2

Net revenue from PlayStation 2 products increased
from $910.7 million in fiscal 2003 to $1,314.8 million
in fiscal 2004. As a percentage of total net revenue, sales of
PlayStation 2 products increased by 7.7 percent in
fiscal 2004. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to
growth in the installed base and greater demand for our products.

PC

Net revenue from PC-based products decreased from
$499.6 million in fiscal 2003 to $469.7 million in
fiscal 2004. As a percentage of total net revenue, sales of PC
products decreased by 4.3 percent in fiscal 2004. PC net
revenue declined, largely due to declines of sales in the Harry
Potter, World Cup and Bond franchises as discussed above, which
were partially offset by an increase in sales of the Lord of the
Rings franchise.

Xbox

Net revenue from Xbox products increased from
$219.4 million in fiscal 2003 to $384.3 million in
fiscal 2004. As a percentage of total net revenue, sales of Xbox
products increased by 4.2 percent in fiscal 2004. The
increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth in the
installed base and greater demand for our products.

Nintendo GameCube

Net revenue from Nintendo GameCube products
increased from $176.7 million in fiscal 2003 to
$199.9 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in net revenue
was primarily due to growth in the installed base of the
Nintendo GameCube.

Subscription Services

In fiscal 2004, net revenue from subscription
services products increased by $4.9 million to
$49.5 million as compared to fiscal 2003. The increase in
net revenue was primarily due to the number of users for Club
Pogo (launched in July 2003) and Pogo Downloadables (launched in
May 2003), partially offset by a decrease in



subscription net revenue from

The
Sims

TM

Online

,

Ultima
Online

TM

, and

Earth &
Beyond

TM

subscription services.

PlayStation

In fiscal 2004, net revenue from PlayStation
products decreased by $70.3 million to $29.6 million
as compared to fiscal 2003. We anticipated the decline in net
revenue from PlayStation products as we continued to transition
away from that platform. Although our PlayStation products are
playable on the PlayStation 2 console, we expect sales of
current PlayStation products to continue to decline in the
future.

Co-Publishing and Distribution

In fiscal 2004, net revenue from co-publishing
and distribution products increased by $22.5 million to
$398.2 million as compared to fiscal 2003. The increase was
due to a $74.5 million increase in Europe primarily from
increased sales in the Final Fantasy, Freedom Fighters and
Battlefield franchises, partially offset by a decline in the
Kingdom Hearts franchise in North America. Although
co-publishing and distribution net revenue increased, it
declined as a percentage of net revenue.

Advertising, Programming, Licensing and
Other

In fiscal 2004, net revenue from advertising,
programming, licensing and other products decreased by
$42.6 million to $33.8 million as compared to fiscal
2003. The decrease was a result of expected declines in our
advertising and programming net revenue following our
renegotiation of the terms of our relationship with AOL during
the three months ended June 30, 2003 and an expected
decline in our Game Boy Color net revenue as we transitioned
away from that platform.

Operations by Segment

In March 2003, we consolidated the operations of
the EA.com business segment into our core business. We now
consider online capability and gameplay to be integral to our
existing and future products. Accordingly, beginning
April 1, 2003, we no longer manage our online products and
services as a separate business segment, and we have
consolidated the reporting related to our online products and
services into reporting for the overall development and
publication of our core products for all reporting periods
ending after that date. We believe that this will better reflect
the way in which our Chief Executive Officer (our chief
operating decision maker) reviews and manages our business and
reflects the importance of our online products and services
relative to the rest of our business. Concurrently, we have also
eliminated separate reporting for our Class B common stock
for all reporting periods ending after April 1, 2003.
Fiscal 2003 and 2002 have been restated to conform with our
fiscal 2004 presentation. See Note 18 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8
hereof.

Our view and reporting of business segments may
change due to changes in underlying business facts and
circumstances and the evolution of our reporting to our Chief
Executive Officer.

Cost of Goods Sold

Cost of goods sold for our disk-based and
cartridge-based products consists of (1) product costs,
(2) certain royalty expenses for celebrities, professional
sports and other organizations and independent software
developers, (3) manufacturing royalties, net of volume
discounts, (4) expenses for defective products,
(5) write-off of post-launch prepaid royalty costs, and
(6) operations expenses. Cost of goods sold for our online
product subscription business consists primarily of data center
and bandwidth costs associated with hosting our websites, credit
card fees and royalties for use of third party properties. Cost
of goods sold for our website advertising business primarily
consists of ad serving costs.



Costs of goods sold for fiscal years 2004 and
2003 (in thousands):

In fiscal 2004, cost of goods sold as a
percentage of net revenue decreased by 5.9 percentage
points to 37.3 percent from 43.2 percent for fiscal
2003 primarily due to a 3.3 percent decrease in product
costs and a 2.8 percent decrease in royalty rates.

The 3.3 percent decrease in product costs
was primarily a result of:

n

Lower co-publishing and distribution product
    costs, as a percentage of net revenue, due to a higher mix of
    co-publishing titles relative to distribution titles in fiscal
    2004. Co-publishing titles generally have higher gross margins
    than distribution titles. Lower co-publishing and distribution
    costs, as a percentage of net revenue, increased total gross
    margin by 1.6 percent in fiscal 2004.

n

Lower average manufacturing costs increased total
    gross margin by 1.0 percent in fiscal 2004.

n

Lower period costs primarily due to improved
    inventory management in North America. Lower period costs
    increased total gross margin by 0.5 percent in fiscal 2004.

The 2.8 percent decrease in royalty rates
was primarily the result of:

n

Decreased third-party development royalties
    primarily due to a higher mix of titles developed internally
    rather than externally in fiscal 2004. Significant titles that
    were developed internally in fiscal 2004 for which a comparable
    title had been developed externally in fiscal 2003 included

James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing

and

The
    Lord of the Rings; The Return of the King.

We estimate that
    lower development royalties increased gross margin by
    1.9 percent, which was spread across multiple platforms.

n

Lower license royalties, as a percentage of net
    revenue, as

Need for Speed Underground

, our highest
    grossing title of fiscal 2004, had a significantly lower license
    royalty rate than

Harry Potter and the Chamber of
    Secrets,

our highest grossing title of fiscal 2003. Lower
    license royalties, as a percentage of net revenue, increased
    total gross margin by 1.1 percent in fiscal 2004.

We expect cost of goods sold as a percentage of
net revenue to increase in fiscal 2005 as a result of (1) a
gradual decrease in the average selling price due to the
current-generation lifecycle, (2) overall product mix, and
(3) higher license royalties as a percentage of net revenue.

Marketing and Sales

Marketing and sales expenses consist of
personnel-related costs and advertising, marketing and
promotional expenses, net of advertising expense reimbursements
from third parties. In fiscal 2003, marketing and sales expense
also included the amortization of the carriage fees payable for
the distribution of our online games on AOL, which we are no
longer required to pay. See Note 7 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8
hereof.

Marketing and sales expenses for fiscal years
2004 and 2003 (in thousands):

Marketing and sales expenses increased by
11.4 percent in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003
primarily due to:

n

An increase in our advertising, contract services
    and promotional expenses of $38.0 million as we
    incrementally increased our advertising campaigns to support the
    release of new titles.



n

A 13.6 percent increase in average headcount
    to further support the growth of our marketing and sales
    functions worldwide, which resulted in an increase to
    personnel-related costs of approximately $16.5 million.

The increase in marketing and sales expenses was
partially offset by the discontinuance of carriage fee payments
to AOL, which resulted in a decrease of $17.9 million.

As a percentage of net revenue, marketing and
sales expenses declined from 13.4 percent in fiscal 2003 to
12.5 percent in fiscal 2004. Marketing and sales expenses
included vendor reimbursements for advertising expenses of
$44.8 million in fiscal 2004 and $28.2 million in
fiscal 2003.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses consist of
personnel and related expenses of executive and administrative
staff, fees for professional services such as legal and
accounting, and allowances for bad debts.

General and administrative expenses for fiscal
years 2004 and 2003 (in thousands):

General and administrative expenses increased by
41.2 percent, or 1.0 percent of net revenue, in fiscal
2004 compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to:

n

An increase in depreciation expense of
    approximately $17.8 million primarily due to accelerated
    depreciation on equipment and software that are being replaced
    and to write-off assets that have been taken out of service.

n

An increase of approximately 9 percent, or
    $14.8 million, in personnel-related costs to support the
    continued growth of our business.

n

An increase in contributions of $8.5 million
    as we invest in our strategic university relationships.

n

An increase of approximately $11.5 million
    in professional services.

n

An increase of approximately $9.6 million in
    information technology and facilities expenses.

The increase in general and administrative
expenses was partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense
of $9.1 million, primarily as a result of collecting on
accounts that we had previously deemed uncollectible.

Research and Development

Research and development expenses consist of
expenses incurred by our production studios for
personnel-related costs, consulting, equipment depreciation and
any impairment of prepaid royalties for pre-launch products.
Research and development expenses for our online business
include expenses incurred by our studios consisting of direct
development costs and related overhead costs in connection with
the development and production of our online games. Research and
development expenses also include expenses associated with
development of website content, network infrastructure direct
expenses, software licenses and maintenance, and network and
management overhead.

Research and development expenses for fiscal
years 2004 and 2003 (in thousands):

Research and development expenses increased by
27.4 percent, or 1.2 percentage points of net revenue,
in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to:

n

Increases in personnel-related costs of
    $100.8 million of which approximately $64.3 million
    resulted from a 22.2 percent increase in average regular
    full-time employee headcount.



n

An overall increase in external development
    expenses of $23.4 million related to development of new
    products.

The increase in research and development expenses
was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and other
operating expenses due to asset impairments recognized in the
third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2003.

We expected increased research and development
expenses in fiscal 2004 as we continued to support the global
growth of our research and development capabilities. In recent
quarters, we have developed a greater number of titles
internally. We expect increased research and development
spending to continue in fiscal 2005 due to the development of
next-generation tools and technologies and to a lesser extent,
increased spending on current-generation console products
including the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Nintendo GameCube, as
well as extending our investment in the development of games for
the PC.

Amortization of Intangibles

Amortization of intangibles for fiscal years 2004
and 2003 (in thousands):

Amortization of intangibles results primarily
from our acquisitions of Westwood, Kesmai, DreamWorks
Interactive, ABC Software, Pogo and other acquisitions. The
decline in amortization was a result of the impairment charges
taken in fiscal 2003.

Restructuring and Asset Impairment
Charges

Restructuring and asset impairment charges for
fiscal years 2004 and 2003 (in thousands):

Fiscal 2004 Studio Restructuring

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we
closed the majority of our leased studio facility in Walnut
Creek, California and our entire owned studio facility in
Austin, Texas. The studio closures were the result of a
strategic decision to consolidate local development efforts in
Redwood City, California. We recorded total pre-tax charges of
$9.2 million, consisting of $7.0 million for
consolidation of facilities, $1.7 million for workforce
reductions and $0.5 million for the write-off of
non-current assets, primarily leasehold improvements. The
facilities charge included contractual rental commitments under
the real estate lease for unutilized office space at our Walnut
Creek location, offset by estimated future sub-lease income. The
exit plans resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately
117 personnel in development and administrative
departments, the majority of whom are expected to be terminated
in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. In addition, we also expect
immaterial charges to be incurred during the first quarter of
fiscal 2005, primarily related to the Texas facility relocation.

Fiscal 2003 Studio Restructuring

During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we
closed our office located in San Francisco, California and
our studio located in Seattle, Washington. The office and studio
closures were the result of a strategic decision to consolidate
local development efforts in Redwood City, California and
Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. We recorded total pre-tax
charges of $9.4 million, consisting of $7.3 million
for consolidation of facilities, $1.5 million for the
write-off of non-current assets, primarily leasehold
improvements, and $0.6 million for workforce reductions.
The facilities charge was net of a reduction in deferred rent of
$0.5 million. The exit plans resulted in a workforce
reduction of approximately 33 personnel in development and
administrative



departments. The estimated costs for
consolidation of facilities included contractual rental
commitments under the real estate lease for unutilized office
space, offset by estimated future sub-lease income.

Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2003, we approved a plan to consolidate the Los Angeles,
California, Irvine, California and Las Vegas, Nevada, studios
into one major game studio in Los Angeles. These measures were
taken in order to maximize efficiencies and streamline the
creative development process and operations of our studios. In
connection with these consolidation activities, we recorded a
total pre-tax restructuring charge of $5.1 million,
including $1.6 million for the shutdown of facilities
related to non-cancelable lease payments for permanently vacated
properties and associated costs, $2.0 million for the
write-off of abandoned equipment and leasehold improvements at
facilities that were permanently vacated and $1.5 million
for employee severance expenses related to involuntary
terminations.

Fiscal 2003 Online Restructuring

In March 2003, we consolidated the operations of
EA.com into our core business, and eliminated separate reporting
for its Class B common stock for all future reporting
periods after fiscal 2003. We consider online functionality to
be an integral component of our existing and future products.

During fiscal 2003, we recorded restructuring
charges, including asset impairment, of $67.0 million,
consisting of $1.8 million for workforce reductions,
$2.3 million for consolidation of facilities and other
administrative charges, and $62.9 million for the write-off
of non-current assets. The estimated costs for workforce
reduction included severance charges for terminated employees,
costs for certain outplacement service contracts and costs
associated with the tender offer to retire employee Class B
options. The workforce reduction resulted in the termination of
approximately 50 positions. The consolidation of facilities
resulted in the closure of EA.com’s Chicago and Virginia
facilities and an adjustment for the closure of EA.com’s
San Diego studio in fiscal 2002. The estimated costs for
consolidation of facilities and other administrative charges
included contractual rental commitments under real estate leases
for unutilized office space reduced by estimated future
sub-lease income and costs to close the facilities.

As part of the restructuring efforts, we
performed impairment tests under SFAS No. 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets”

, to evaluate the recoverability of our
long-lived assets and remaining finite-lived identifiable
intangible assets utilized in the EA.com business. This test was
performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 in conjunction
with the overall valuation of the EA.com legal entity and its
Class B common stock. In February 2003, our only outside
holder of Class B common stock, AOL, exercised its right to
exchange its Class B shares for shares of Class A
common stock. In late December 2002, EA.com launched

The Sims
Online,

an online game based on our “The Sims”
line of PC games, which have sold over 20 million units
worldwide.

The Sims Online

was expected to be
EA.com’s flagship online subscription offering. As of
March 31, 2003, the number of units sold and the number of
subscribers for this product along with other EA.com revenue
were significantly below our expectations. We considered these
developments to be a triggering event under
SFAS No. 144, which caused us to cancel most of our
plans to develop similar online products that would have
utilized long-lived assets associated with the EA.com business.
Impairment charges on long-lived assets amounted to
$62.9 million and included $24.9 million relating to
impaired customized internal-use software systems for the EA.com
infrastructure, $25.6 million for other long-lived assets
and $12.4 million of finite-lived intangibles impairment
charges relating to EA.com’s acquisitions of Kesmai
Corporation and Pogo Corporation (now referred to as
“Kesmai” and “Pogo”, respectively) studios.
As of March 31, 2003, there were no finite-lived intangible
balances remaining related to Kesmai and Pogo studios.

In conjunction with our annual policy to reassess
the remaining useful lives of goodwill and certain
indefinite-lived intangibles and test the recoverability of
these long-lived assets in accordance with
SFAS No. 142, our fair value based tests did not
indicate an impairment of our recorded goodwill and certain
indefinite-lived intangibles at the EA.com reporting unit level
as of January 1, 2003. The remaining portion of Kesmai
goodwill assets as of March 31, 2003 was
$13.8 million. The remaining portion of Pogo goodwill
assets as of March 31, 2003 was $15.9 million. There
are no assurances that future impairment tests will not result
in a charge to earnings and a corresponding write down of
goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangibles.



The following table reflects our unaudited pro
forma consolidated basic earnings per share for the fiscal years
ended 2003 and 2002 as if the consolidation of the operations of
our EA.com business segment into our core business had occurred
at the beginning of each of the periods presented (in thousands,
except per share data):

All restructuring charges recorded prior to
December 31, 2002 were recorded in accordance with Emerging
Issues Task Force (“EITF”) No. 94-3,

“Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)”

,
EITF No. 95-3,

“Recognition of Liabilities in
Connection with a Purchase Business Combination”

, and
Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 100,

“Restructuring and Impairment Charges”

. All
restructuring charges recorded subsequent to December 31,
2002 were recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 146,

“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities”

. Adjustments to the restructuring reserves
will be made in future periods, if necessary, based upon the
then-current events and circumstances.

asset impairment charges, please see Note 6 in our
Consolidated Financial Statements, included in item 8
hereof.

Interest and Other Income,
Net

Interest and other income, net, for fiscal years
2004 and 2003 (in thousands):

Interest and other income, net, in fiscal 2004
increased from fiscal 2003 primarily due to:

n

Interest income increased $7.9 million in
    fiscal 2004 as a result of higher average cash balances in the
    current year.

n

During the year ended March 31, 2003, we
    recorded $10.6 million for an other-than-temporary
    impairment of investments in affiliates, offset by income of
    $5.5 million recorded from our equity investment in Square
    EA, LLC.

Income Taxes

Income taxes for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 (in
thousands):



Our effective income tax rate reflects tax
benefits derived from significant operations outside the U.S.,
which are generally taxed at rates lower than the
U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent. The effective
income tax rate was 27.5 percent for fiscal 2004 and
31.0 percent for fiscal 2003. The reduced effective income
tax rate in fiscal 2004 primarily reflects the resolution of
certain tax-related matters with the Internal Revenue Service in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, which lowered our income tax
expense by $19.7 million and resulted in a 2.5 percent
rate reduction and a change in the geographic mix of taxable
income subject to lower tax rates.

We intend to indefinitely reinvest our
international earnings outside the U.S. and, accordingly, have
not provided U.S. taxes that would be incurred if such
earnings were repatriated back to the U.S. Undistributed
earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately
$738.3 million at March 31, 2004.

We are currently projecting an effective income
tax rate of approximately 29 percent for fiscal 2005. An
effective income tax rate projection, which is inherently
uncertain, is based on current tax law and current projections
of the mix of income in various taxing jurisdictions and assumes
no material changes in our business or the applicable tax or
accounting rules.

Our actual effective income tax rates for fiscal
2005 and future periods can differ from the projected effective
income tax rates due to a variety of factors, including changes
in our business that were not taken into account in connection
with our projection, a variation between the projected and
actual mix of income between international and domestic
operations, changes or interpretations to applicable tax laws
and regulations, changes in the applicable accounting rules or
our ability to realize deferred tax assets, or developments in
tax audit matters with various tax authorities. For example, in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we resolved certain
tax-related matters with the Internal Revenue Service, which
lowered our income tax expense by $19.7 million and
resulted in a 2.5 percent rate reduction.

Finally, our projected effective income tax rate
for fiscal 2005 does not take into account a new election that
is available under the U.S. income tax rules regarding the
allocation between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions tax deductions
attributable to employee stock option compensation. If we take
advantage of this election, it could detrimentally affect our
effective income tax rate. We have not yet determined the impact
that the election would have on our reported results.

Net Income

Net income for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 (in
thousands):

Reported net income increased in fiscal 2004
compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to the reasons discussed
above. Although the dollar amount of our expenses increased in
fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, net income as a
percentage of net revenue increased to 19.5 percent as
compared to 12.8 percent in fiscal 2003 because expenses,
including our cost of goods sold, grew at a slower rate than did
our net revenue.



Comparison of Fiscal 2003 to Fiscal

Net Revenue

From a geographical perspective, our net revenue
for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 was as
follows (in thousands):

North America

For fiscal 2003, net revenue in North America
increased by 31.3 percent as compared to fiscal 2002. From
a franchise perspective, the net revenue increase was primarily
driven by sales of products released during the year ended
March 31, 2003 in the following nine franchises: Medal of
Honor, Lord of the Rings, Kingdom Hearts, The Sims, Need for
Speed, Harry Potter, NCAA Football, Bond and Tiger Woods/ PGA
TOUR. Increased sales in these franchises resulted in increased
net revenue of $451.1 million for the year ended
March 31, 2003 as compared to the year ended March 31,
2002. The increase was offset by decreases in net revenue in our
Final Fantasy, SSX and NBA Street franchises as none of these
franchises had products released during fiscal 2003. Together,
decreased sales in these franchises reduced net revenue by
$108.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2003 as
compared to the year ended March 31, 2002.

Europe

For fiscal 2003, net revenue in Europe increased
by 69.2 percent as compared to fiscal 2002. From a
franchise perspective, the net revenue increase was primarily
driven by sales of products released during the year ended
March 31, 2003 in the following eleven franchises: Lord of
the Rings, Medal of Honor, The Sims, FIFA Soccer, Bond, World
Cup, Harry Potter, Need for Speed, Battlefield,
SimCity

TM

and Tiger Woods/ PGA TOUR. Increased sales
in these franchises resulted in increased net revenue of
$345.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2003 as
compared to the year ended March 31, 2002.

Asia Pacific

For fiscal 2003, net revenue from sales in the
Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan, increased by
64.1 percent compared to the year ended March 31,
2002. Our net revenue from sales of products on the
PlayStation 2 and Xbox platforms increased by $15.7 and
$6.3 million, respectively, for the year ended
March 31, 2003 primarily due to the higher installed base
on both platforms and the fact that 20 Xbox titles were
available in the Asia Pacific region in 2003 as compared to
three in 2002. Sales of co-publishing and distribution titles
increased $11.1 million primarily due to sales of

Final
Fantasy X

and

Battlefield 1942

in fiscal 2003.

Japan

For fiscal 2003, net revenue from sales in Japan
increased by 36.6 percent compared to fiscal 2002. The
increase was due primarily to the higher PlayStation 2 installed
base and strong sales of PlayStation 2 titles, most notably

Medal of Honor Frontline

TM

, 2002 FIFA World
Cup

and

Project FIFA World Cup

which generated an
additional $15.7 million in net revenue in fiscal 2003. We
also had an increase in revenues from co-publishing and
distribution products of $11.0 million due in large part to
sales of

Final Fantasy 11.

These increases were offset by
a decrease in PlayStation revenue of $5.7 million.



Our worldwide net revenue by product line for
fiscal 2003 and 2002 was as follows (in thousands):

PlayStation 2

Net revenue from sales of PlayStation 2 products
increased from $482.9 million in fiscal 2002 to
$910.7 million in fiscal 2003. As a percentage of total net
revenue, sales of PlayStation 2 products increased by
8.7 percent in fiscal 2003. The increase in net revenue was
primarily due to growth in the installed base and greater demand
for our products. For example, in the U.S., the installed base
for the PlayStation 2 increased approximately 115 percent,
as compared to fiscal 2002, due in part to Sony’s hardware
price cut in North America in May 2002.

PC

Net revenue from sales of titles for the PC
increased in fiscal 2003 by 9.5 percent to
$499.6 million as compared to $456.3 million in fiscal
2002. The increase was primarily due to strong sales of The Sims
franchise titles, and the release of

SimCity

TM

, for a combined increase of
$71.0 million, partially offset by lower net revenue from
fiscal 2002 releases

Black and White

TM

and

Dune Emperor

totaling $32.2 million. Although PC
net revenue increased in fiscal 2003, PC net revenue declined as
a percentage of net revenue as consumers migrated to console
gameplay.

Xbox

Net revenue from sales of Xbox products increased
from $78.4 million to $219.4 million, or
4.3 percent of net revenue, in fiscal 2003 as compared to
fiscal 2002. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to
growth in the installed base and greater demand for our products
.. The installed base increased in fiscal 2003 due to the launch
of Xbox in the United States in November 2001 and in Europe in
March 2002. In fiscal 2002, there was only a short period (five
months in the United States and one month in Europe) during
which the consoles were available as compared to twelve months
in fiscal 2003. As a result, we were able to release Xbox
products during all of fiscal 2003.

Nintendo GameCube

Net revenue from Nintendo GameCube products
increased from $51.7 million to $176.7 million, or
4.1 percent of net revenue, in fiscal 2003 as compared to
fiscal 2002. The increase in net revenue for fiscal 2003 was
primarily due to growth in the installed base of the Nintendo
GameCube, which was available in every



major market in which we operated during fiscal
2003. The Nintendo GameCube was launched in Japan in September
2001 and North America in November 2001, but not in Europe until
May 2002.

Game Boy Advance

Net revenue from sales of Game Boy Advance titles
increased in fiscal 2003 by 81.2 percent to
$79.1 million as compared to $43.7 million in fiscal
2002, primarily due to increased net revenue in the Lord of the
Rings and Harry Potter franchises and the increased number of
Game Boy Advance titles available in fiscal 2003. In fiscal
2003, we released seven titles on the Game Boy Advance platform
compared to three in fiscal 2002.

PlayStation

In fiscal 2003, net revenue from PlayStation
products decreased by $89.6 million to $100.0 million
as compared to fiscal 2002. The decrease in net revenue was
attributable to the market transition to newer generation
console systems and our transition away from that platform.

Co-Publishing and Distribution

Net revenue from co-publishing products and
distribution products increased 39.7 percent to
$375.8 million in fiscal 2003 compared to
$269.0 million in fiscal 2002 primarily due to strong sales
of hit titles including

Kingdom Hearts, 1503 A.D. The New
World

and higher Battlefield 1942 franchise net revenue.

Advertising, Programming, Licensing and
Other

In fiscal 2003, net revenue from advertising,
programming, licensing and other products decreased by
$42.5 million to $76.4 million as compared to fiscal
2002. The decrease was primarily a result of an expected decline
in our Game Boy Color and Nintendo 64 net revenue as we
transitioned away from those platforms. In addition, revenue
derived from advertising on our online games sites decreased
16 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to the prior fiscal year
primarily due to $3.8 million in lower advertising revenue
generated from AOL and co-branded AOL online properties, and a
$1.8 million decrease in online advertising purchased by
online game companies that link their games sites to ours.

Cost of Goods Sold

Costs of goods sold for fiscal years 2003 and
2002 (in thousands):

In fiscal 2003, cost of goods sold as a
percentage of net revenue decreased by 4.0 percent to
43.2 percent in fiscal 2003 from 47.2 percent in
fiscal 2002 primarily due to:

n

Higher PC margins resulting from (1) higher
    sales of wholly-owned intellectual properties such as

SimCity

and

Command & Conquer Generals,

(2) lower developer royalties in general, and
    (3) higher average sales prices of our products. Higher PC
    margins increased our total gross margin by 1.7 percent.

n

Higher margins on co-publishing and distribution
    products primarily due to a higher volume of co-publishing
    products, which have a higher gross margin than distribution
    products, released in fiscal 2003, such as

Battlefield 1942,
    Ty the Tasmanian Tiger

and

The Simpsons Road Rage.

Higher margins on co-publishing and distribution products
    contributed 0.9 percent to our total gross margin.

n

Higher margins on PlayStation 2 products
    primarily due to volume discounts received from Sony and overall
    lower average manufacturing royalty rates, all of which
    contributed 0.8 percent to our total gross margin.



Marketing and Sales

Marketing and sales expenses for fiscal years
2003 and 2002 (in thousands):

Marketing and sales expenses increased by
37.9 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002
primarily due to:

n

Higher advertising spending of $46.1 million
    to support product releases on multiple platforms and across
    multiple territories including

Madden NFL

TM


,

NBA Live 2003

,

The Lord of the Rings, The
    Two Towers, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,

The
    Sims franchise titles and

The Sims Online.

Overall, we
    released 86 SKUs in fiscal 2003 versus 64 SKUs in fiscal
    2002.

n

An increase in headcount and related expenses of
    $20.5 million to support the growth of our marketing and
    sales functions worldwide.

As a percentage of net revenue, marketing and
sales expenses declined from 14.0 percent of net revenue in
fiscal 2002 to 13.4 percent of net revenue in fiscal 2003.
Marketing and sales includes vendor reimbursements for
advertising expenses of $28.2 million in fiscal 2003 and
$8.9 million in fiscal 2002.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses for fiscal
years 2003 and 2002 (in thousands):

General and administrative expenses increased by
22.2 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002
primarily due to an increase in payroll costs of
$26.9 million to support the increased growth of these
functions worldwide.

As a percentage of net revenue, general and
administrative expenses declined from 6.2 percent of net
revenue in fiscal 2002 to 5.3 percent of net revenue.

Research and Development

Research and development expenses for fiscal
years 2003 and 2002 (in thousands):

Research and development expenses increased by
5.4 percent in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002
primarily due to additional headcount-related expenses, offset
by lower advance write-offs and development spending on
discontinued products in fiscal 2003.

As a percentage of revenue, research and
development expenses declined from 22.0 percent of net
revenue in fiscal 2002 to 16.1 percent of net revenue in
fiscal 2003. Research and development includes vendor
reimbursements for development expenses of $15.0 million in
fiscal 2003 and $17.0 million in fiscal 2002.

Amortization of Intangibles

Amortization of intangibles for fiscal years 2003
and 2002 (in thousands):



The decrease in amortization in fiscal 2003 of
$17.9 million was primarily due to:

n

Adoption of SFAS No. 142 in fiscal
    2003, which required us to stop amortizing goodwill. For fiscal
    2002, amortization of goodwill totaled $13.1 million.

n

Certain identifiable intangible assets related to
    Westwood and DreamWorks were amortized in fiscal 2002, resulting
    in a decrease of $3.5 million.

n

Impairment of Pogo and Kesmai finite-lived
    intangible assets as a result of the restructuring of the EA.com
    segment in fiscal 2003 and 2002, resulting in lower amortization
    expense of $2.9 million.

In addition, we recorded intangible impairment
charges relating to our restructuring of the EA.com business
segment of $12.4 million in fiscal 2003 and
$1.6 million in fiscal 2002. For further information,
please see our discussion under “Restructuring and Asset
Impairment Charges” below.

Restructuring and Asset Impairment
Charges

Restructuring and asset impairment charges for
fiscal years 2003 and 2002 (in thousands):

For a discussion of our Fiscal 2003
restructurings, please refer to “Comparison of Fiscal 2004
to Fiscal 2003” above.

Fiscal 2002 Restructuring

In October 2001, we announced a restructuring
plan for EA.com. The restructuring initiatives involved
strategic decisions to discontinue certain product offerings and
focus only on key online priorities that aligned with our fiscal
2003 operational objectives. A concurrent workforce reduction
resulted in the termination of approximately 270 positions.

During fiscal 2002, we recorded restructuring
charges of $20.3 million, consisting of $4.2 million
for workforce reductions, $3.3 million for consolidation of
facilities and other administrative charges, and
$12.8 million for the write-off of non-current assets and
facilities. The estimated costs for workforce reduction included
severance charges for terminated employees and costs for certain
outplacement service contracts. The consolidation of facilities
resulted in the closure of EA.com’s San Diego studio
and consolidation of its San Francisco and Virginia
facilities. The estimated costs for consolidation of facilities
included contractual rental commitments under real estate leases
for unutilized office space offset by estimated future sub-lease
income, costs to close or consolidate facilities, and costs to
write off a portion of the assets from these facilities.
Impairment charges on long-lived assets amounted to
$12.8 million and included $11.2 million relating to
abandoned technologies consisting of customized internal-use
software systems for the EA.com infrastructure,
$1.0 million of Kesmai intangibles impairment because
associated products and services were discontinued and
$0.6 million of goodwill charges relating to EA.com’s
San Diego studio closure. The remaining portion of Kesmai
assets as of March 31, 2002 was $15.9 million,
consisting of $13.1 million of goodwill and
$2.8 million of intangibles relating to Kesmai’s
developed and core technology and acquired workforce.

For further discussion on our restructurings and
asset impairment charges, please see Note 6 in our
Consolidated Financial Statements, included in item 8 hereof.

Interest and Other Income,
Net

Interest and other income, net, for fiscal years
2003 and 2002 (in thousands):



Interest and other income, net, in fiscal 2003
decreased from fiscal 2002 primarily due to an
other-than-temporary impairment of investments in affiliates of
$10.6 million in fiscal 2003, partially offset by higher
interest income in fiscal 2003 of $5.1 million, as a result
of higher average cash balances during the fiscal year.

Income Taxes

Income taxes for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 (in
thousands):

Our effective tax rate was 31.0 percent for
fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002.

Net Income

Net income for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 (in
thousands):

Reported net income increased in fiscal 2003
compared to fiscal 2002 primarily due to the reasons discussed
above. Although the dollar amount of expenses rose in fiscal
2003 versus fiscal 2002, net income as a percentage of net
revenue increased to 12.8 percent versus 5.9 percent
as expenses grew at a slower rate than did our net revenue.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting
Standards

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Interpretation
No. 46 (“FIN 46”),

“Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities”

. This interpretation of
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,

“Consolidated
Financial Statements

,” addresses consolidation by
business enterprises of variable interest entities
(“VIEs”) that either (i) do not have sufficient
equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its
activities without additional subordinated financial support, or
(ii) are owned by equity investors who lack an essential
characteristic of a controlling financial interest. This
interpretation applies immediately to VIEs created after
January 31, 2003. With regard to VIEs already in existence
prior to February 1, 2003, the implementation of
FIN 46 was delayed and currently applies to the first
fiscal year or interim period beginning after December 15,
2003. FIN 46 requires disclosure of VIEs in financial
statements issued after January 31, 2003, if it is
reasonably possible that as of the transition date (i) we
will be the primary beneficiary of an existing VIE that will
require consolidation, or (ii) we will hold a significant
variable interest in, or have significant involvement with, an
existing VIE. We adopted FIN 46 in the quarter ended
December 31, 2003; however, it did not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

In January 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force
reached consensus on Issue No. 00-21
(“EITF 00-21”),

“Revenue Arrangements
with Multiple Deliverables”

. EITF 00-21 provides
guidance on how to determine whether an arrangement involving
multiple deliverables requires that such deliverables be
accounted for separately. EITF 00-21 allows for prospective
adoption for arrangements entered into after June 15, 2003
or adoption via a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle. We adopted EITF 00-21 in the quarter ended
June 30, 2003; however, it did not have a material impact
on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force
ratified the consensus reached on paragraphs 6 through 23
of Issue No. 03-01 (“EITF 03-1”),

“The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
Application to Certain Investments”

. EITF 03-1
requires that certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures
should be required for debt and marketable equity securities
classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity under
SFAS No. 115,

“Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities”

and
SFAS No. 124,



“Accounting for Certain Investments Held
by Not-for-Profit Organizations”

that are impaired at the balance sheet
date but for which an other-than-temporary impairment has not
been recognized. We adopted EITF 03-1 in the year ended
March 31, 2004; however, it did not have a material impact
on the disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In March 2004, the FASB, issued an exposure draft
on the Proposed Statement of Financial Accounting Standards,

“Share-Based Payment — an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 123 and 95”

. The proposed statement
addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions
with employees and other third-parties. The proposed standard
would eliminate the ability to account for share-based
compensation transactions using Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees”

, and generally would require
that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based
method. If the final standard is approved as currently drafted
in the exposure draft, it would have a material impact on the
amount of earnings we report. Management has not yet determined
the impact that the proposed statement will have on our business.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES

Changes in Cash Flow

During the year ended March 31, 2004, we
generated $669.3 million of cash from operating activities
compared to $714.5 million for the year ended
March 31, 2003. This decline was primarily the result of
our fourth quarter sales in fiscal 2004 occurring later in the
quarter as compared to fiscal 2003, particularly in Europe. We
expect to continue to generate similar levels of operating cash
flow in fiscal 2005. For the year ended March 31, 2004, our
primary use of cash in non-operating activities consisted of
$89.6 million in capital expenditures, primarily related to
the expansions of our Los Angeles and Vancouver studios. These
non-operating expenditures were offset by net proceeds of
$371.8 million in short-term investments and
$227.8 million in proceeds from the sale of our common
stock through stock plans during the year ended March 31,
2004.

Receivables, Net

Our gross accounts receivable balance was
$366.6 million and $246.7 million as of March 31,
2004 and March 31, 2003, respectively. The increase in our
accounts receivable balance was primarily due to our fourth
quarter sales in fiscal 2004 occurring later in the quarter as
compared to fiscal 2003, particularly in Europe. We expect to
collect a substantial portion of these amounts in the three
months ended June 30, 2004. Reserves for sales returns,
pricing allowances and doubtful accounts decreased from
$164.6 million as of March 31, 2003 to
$154.7 million as of March 31, 2004. Both the sales
return and price protection reserves decreased in absolute
dollars and as a percentage of trailing six and nine month net
revenue as of March 31,



2004. We believe these reserves are adequate
based on historical experience and our current estimate of
potential returns and allowances.

Inventories

Inventories increased to $55.1 million as of
March 31, 2004 from $39.7 million as of March 31,
2003 primarily due to overall growth in Europe. We typically
have a higher inventory balance, as a percentage of net revenue,
on hand in Europe compared to North America, due to the need to
provide multiple language versions of each title in that region.
No single title represented more than $4.0 million of
inventory as of March 31, 2004.

Other Current Assets

Other current assets increased to
$143.9 million as of March 31, 2004 from
$83.5 million as of March 31, 2003 primarily due to
increases in volume rebates and advertising credits owed to us
by our suppliers and VAT receivable, both relating to the growth
of our business, offset by lower prepaid royalties as we
continue to increase internal title development.

Accounts Payable

Accounts payable increased to $114.1 million
as of March 31, 2004 from $106.3 million as of
March 31, 2003 primarily due to the higher sales volume we
experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 as compared to
fiscal 2003.

Accrued and Other Liabilities

Our accrued and other liabilities increased to
$608.2 million as of March 31, 2004 from
$464.5 million as of March 31, 2003, as a result of
the overall increase in our sales and related operational
expenses and profit. The increase was due to increases in income
taxes payable, accrued compensation and benefits, accrued
development, deferred revenue and VAT payable. We anticipate our
accrued and other liabilities balance to decline following our
tax and bonus payments during the three months ended
June 30, 2004.

Financial Condition

We believe the existing cash, cash equivalents,
short-term investments, marketable equity securities and cash
generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our
operating requirements for at least the next twelve months,
including working capital requirements, capital expenditures and
potential future acquisitions or strategic investments. We may
choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our
financial position, facilitate expansion, pursue strategic
investments or to take advantage of business opportunities as
they arise. There can be no guarantee that such additional
capital will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all,
or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our
existing stockholders.

A portion of our cash is generated from
operations domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions (approximately
$554.4 million as of March 31, 2004) that is
designated as indefinitely reinvested in the respective tax
jurisdiction. While we have no plans to repatriate these funds
to the United States in the short-term, if we were required to
do so to fund our operations in the United States, we would
accrue and pay additional taxes in connection with their
repatriation.

On January 8, 2004, we filed an amended
registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. This registration statement, including the
base prospectus contained therein, became effective on
January 15, 2004 and uses a “shelf” registration
process. This shelf registration statement allows us, at any
time, to offer any combination of securities described in the
prospectus in one or more offerings up to a total amount of
$2.0 billion. Unless otherwise specified in a prospectus
supplement accompanying the base prospectus, we will use the net
proceeds from the sale of any securities offered pursuant to the
shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes,
including for working capital, financing capital expenditures,
research and development, marketing and distribution efforts
and, if opportunities arise, for acquisitions or strategic
alliances. Pending such uses, we may invest the net proceeds in
interest-bearing securities. In addition, we may conduct
concurrent or other financings at any time.

Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity
could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including,
but not limited to, those related to customer demand and
acceptance of our titles on new platforms and new



versions of our titles on existing platforms, our
ability to collect our accounts receivable as they become due,
successfully achieving our product release schedules and
attaining our forecasted sales objectives, the impact of
competition, the economic conditions in the domestic and
international markets, seasonality in operating results, risks
of product returns and the other risks described in the
“Risk Factors” section below.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial
Commitments

Letters of Credit

In July 2002, we provided an irrevocable standby
letter of credit to Nintendo of Europe. The standby letter of
credit guarantees performance of our obligations to pay Nintendo
of Europe for trade payables of up to 8.0 million Euros.
The standby letter of credit expires in July 2005. As of
March 31, 2004, we had 0.2 million Euros payable to
Nintendo of Europe covered by this standby letter of credit.

In August 2003, we provided an irrevocable
standby letter of credit to 300 California Associates II,
LLC in replacement of our security deposit for office space. The
standby letter of credit guarantees performance of our
obligations to pay our lease commitment up to $1.1 million.
The standby letter of credit expires in December 2006. As of
March 31, 2004, we did not have a payable balance on this
standby letter of credit.

Development, Celebrity, League and Content
Licenses: Payments and Commitments

The products produced by our studios are designed
and created by our employee designers, artists, software
programmers and by non-employee software developers
(“independent artists” or “third-party
developers”). We typically advance development funds to the
independent artists and third-party developers during
development of our games, usually in installment payments made
upon the completion of specified development milestones. These
payments are considered advances against subsequent royalties
based on the sales of the products. These terms are set forth in
written agreements entered into with the independent artists and
third-party developers. In addition, we have certain celebrity,
league and content license contracts that contain minimum
guarantee payments and marketing commitments that are not
dependent on any deliverables. Celebrities and organizations
with whom we have contracts include: FIFA and UEFA (professional
soccer); NASCAR (stock car racing); John Madden (professional
football); National Basketball Association (professional
basketball); PGA TOUR (professional golf); Tiger Woods
(professional golf); National Hockey League and NHLPA
(professional hockey); Warner Bros. (Harry Potter, Catwoman and
Superman); MGM/ Danjaq (James Bond); New Line Productions (The
Lord of the Rings); National Football League and Players Inc.
(professional football); Collegiate Licensing Company
(collegiate football and basketball); ISC (stock car racing);
Major League Baseball Properties; MLB Players Association
(professional baseball) and Island Def Jam (fighting). These
developer and content license commitments represent the sum of
(i) the cash payments due under non-royalty-bearing
licenses and services agreements, and (ii) the minimum
payments and advances against royalties due under
royalty-bearing licenses and services agreements. These minimum
guarantee payments and marketing commitments are included in the
following table.



The following table summarizes our minimum
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of
March 31, 2004, and the effect we expect them to have on
our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):

See discussion on operating leases in the

“Off-Balance Sheet Commitments”

section herein
    and Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, included in Item 8 hereof, for additional
    information.

The lease commitments disclosed above exclude
commitments included in our restructuring activities for
contractual rental commitments of $31.3 million under real
estate leases for unutilized office space, offset by
$18.4 million of estimated future sub-lease income. These
amounts were expensed in the periods of the related
restructuring and are included in our accrued liabilities
reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31,
2004. Please see Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, included in Item 8 hereof, for
additional information.

Transactions with Related Parties

Transactions with Executive Officers

On June 24, 2002, we agreed to loan Warren
Jenson $4,000,000, to be forgiven over four years based on his
continuing employment. Two million dollars of the note will be
forgiven after two years employment (at which time we will
provide Mr. Jenson the funds required to offset the tax
implications of the forgiveness), and the remainder forgiven
after four years. No additional funds will be provided to offset
the tax implications of the forgiveness of the second two
million dollars. The loan does not bear interest. The entire
balance of the loan was outstanding as of June 1, 2004.

In April 2002, we agreed to pay certain taxes
incurred by Bruce McMillan, Executive Vice President, Group
Studio General Manager, Worldwide Studios, arising from his
temporary employment with us in the United Kingdom.
Mr. McMillan agreed to reimburse us for those payments upon
receipt of his corresponding tax refund from the Canadian taxing
authorities. We subsequently paid approximately $168,704 and
$32,931 in October 2002 and April 2003, respectively, to the UK
Inland Revenue for taxes incurred by Mr. McMillan. In May
2003, Mr. McMillan became an executive officer of
Electronic Arts. As of January 22, 2004, Mr. McMillan
had repaid us the entire amount of the tax payments we made on
his behalf.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS

Lease Commitments

We lease certain of our current facilities and
certain equipment under non-cancelable operating lease
agreements. We are required to pay property taxes, insurance and
normal maintenance costs for certain of our facilities and will
be required to pay any increases over the base year of these
expenses on the remainder of our facilities.

In February 1995, we entered into a build-to-suit
lease with a third party for our headquarters facility in
Redwood City, California, which was refinanced with Keybank
National Association in July 2001 and expires in July 2006. We
accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in
accordance with SFAS No. 13,



“Accounting for
Leases”

, as amended. Existing
campus facilities developed in phase one comprise a total of
350,000 square feet and provide space for sales, marketing,
administration and research and development functions. We have
an option to purchase the property (land and facilities) for a
maximum of $145.0 million or, at the end of the lease, to
arrange for (i) an extension of the lease or (ii) sale
of the property to a third party while we retain an obligation
to the owner for approximately 90 percent of the difference
between the sale price and the guaranteed residual value of up
to $128.9 million if the sales price is less than this
amount, subject to certain provisions of the lease.

In December 2000, we entered into a second
build-to-suit lease with Keybank National Association for a
five-year term beginning December 2000 to expand our Redwood
City, California headquarters facilities and develop adjacent
property adding approximately 310,000 square feet to our
campus. Construction was completed in June 2002. We accounted
for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with
SFAS No. 13, as amended. The facilities provide space
for marketing, sales and research and development. We have an
option to purchase the property for a maximum of
$130.0 million or, at the end of the lease, to arrange for
(i) an extension of the lease, or (ii) sale of the
property to a third party while we retain an obligation to the
owner for approximately 90 percent of the difference
between the sale price and the guaranteed residual value of up
to $118.8 million if the sales price is less than this
amount, subject to certain provisions of the lease.

We believe the estimated fair values of both
properties under these operating leases are in excess of their
respective guaranteed residual values as of March 31, 2004.

For the two lease agreements with Keybank
National Association, as described above, the lease rates are
based upon the Commercial Paper Rate and require us to maintain
certain financial covenants as shown below, all of which we were
in compliance with as of March 31, 2004.

In July 2003, we entered into a lease agreement
with an independent third party (“the Landlord”) for a
studio facility in Los Angeles, California, which commenced in
October 2003 and expires in September 2013 with two five-year
options to extend the lease term. Additionally, we have options
to purchase the property after five and ten years based on the
fair market value of the property at the date of sale, a right
of first offer to purchase the property upon terms offered by
the landlord, and a right to share in the profits from a sale of
the property. We have accounted for this arrangement as an
operating lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, as
amended. Existing campus facilities comprise a total of
243,000 square feet and provide space for research and
development functions. Our rental obligation under this
agreement is $50.2 million over the initial ten-year term
of the lease. We are taking possession of the property over a
period of 18 months as the facilities become available for
use. This commitment is offset by sublease income of
$5.8 million for the sublet to an affiliate of the Landlord
of 18,000 square feet of the Los Angeles facility, which
commenced in October 2003 and expires in September 2013 with
options of early termination by the affiliate after five years
and by EA after four and five years.

INFLATION

We believe the impact of inflation on our results
of operations has not been significant for each of the past
three fiscal years.



RISK FACTORS

Our business is subject to many risks and
uncertainties, which may affect our future financial
performance. The risks and uncertainties discussed below are not
the only ones we face. There may be additional risks and
uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do
not believe are material that may harm our business and
financial performance. If any of the events or circumstances
described below occurs, our business and financial performance
could be harmed, our actual results could differ materially from
our expectations, and the market value of our securities could
decline.

The success of our business is highly
dependent on being able to predict which new videogame platforms
will be successful, and on the market acceptance and timely
release of those platforms.

We derive most of our revenue from the sale of
products for play on videogame platforms manufactured by third
parties, such as Sony’s PlayStation 2. Therefore, the
success of our products is driven in large part by the success
of new videogame hardware systems and our ability to accurately
predict which platforms will be most successful in the
marketplace. We must make product development decisions and
commit significant resources well in advance of the anticipated
introduction of a new platform. A new platform for which we are
developing products may be delayed, may not succeed or may have
a shorter life cycle than anticipated. If the platforms for
which we are developing products are not released when
anticipated or do not attain wide market acceptance, our revenue
growth will suffer, we may be unable to fully recover the
resources we have committed, and our financial performance will
be harmed.

Our platform licensors set the royalty rates
and other fees that we must pay to publish games for their
platforms, and therefore have significant influence on our
costs. If one or more of the platform licensors adopt a
different fee structure for future game consoles or we are
unable to obtain such licenses, our profitability will be
materially impacted.

In the next few years, we expect our platform
licensors to introduce new game machines into the market. In
order to publish products for a new game machine, we must take a
license from the platform licensor which gives the platform
licensor the opportunity to set the fee structure that we must
pay in order to publish games for that platform. Similarly, the
platform licensors have retained the flexibility to change their
fee structures for online gameplay and features for their
consoles. The control that platform licensors have over the fee
structures for their future platforms and online access makes it
difficult for us to predict our costs and profitability in the
medium to long term. It is also possible that platform licensors
will not renew our licenses. Because publishing products for
videogame consoles is the largest portion of our business, any
increase in fee structures or failure to secure a license
relationship would have a significant negative impact on our
business model and profitability.

Our business is both seasonal and cyclical. If
we fail to deliver our products at the right times, our sales
will suffer.

Our business is highly seasonal, with the highest
levels of consumer demand, and a significant percentage of our
revenue, occurring in the December quarter. If we miss this key
selling period, due to product delays or delayed introduction of
a new platform for which we have developed products, our sales
will suffer disproportionately. Our industry is also cyclical.
Videogame platforms have historically had a life cycle of four
to six years. As one group of platforms is reaching the end of
its cycle and new platforms are emerging, consumers often defer
game software purchases until the new platforms are available,
causing sales to decline. This decline may not be offset by
increased sales of products for the new platform. For example,
following the launch of Sony’s PlayStation2 platform, we
experienced a significant decline in revenue from sales of
products for Sony’s older PlayStation game console, which
was not immediately offset by revenue generated from sales of
products for the PlayStation2 platform.



Our business is intensely competitive and
increasingly “hit” driven. If we do not continue to
deliver “hit” products, our success will be
limited.

Competition in our industry is intense, and new
products are regularly introduced. A relatively small number of
“hit” titles accounts for a significant portion of
total sales. For example, during calendar year 2003,
approximately 19 percent of the sales of videogames in
North America consisted of only 20 “hit”
products. If our competitors develop more successful products,
or if we do not continue to develop consistently high-quality
products, our revenue and profitability will decline.

If we are unable to maintain or acquire
licenses to intellectual property, we will publish fewer hit
titles and our revenue, profitability and cash flows will
decline. Competition for these licenses may make them more
expensive and increase our costs.

Many of our products are based on or incorporate
intellectual property owned by others. For example, our EA
SPORTS products include rights licensed from the major sports
leagues and players associations. Similarly, many of our hit EA
GAMES franchises, such as Bond, Harry Potter and Lord of the
Rings, are based on key film and literary licenses. Competition
for these licenses is intense. If we are unable to maintain
these licenses and obtain additional licenses with significant
commercial value, our revenues and profitability will decline
significantly. Competition for these licenses may also drive up
the advances, guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the
licensor, which could significantly increase our costs.

If patent claims continue to be asserted
against us, we may be unable to sustain our current business
models or profits.

Many patents have been issued that may apply to
widely used game technologies. Additionally, infringement claims
under many recently issued patents are now being asserted
against Internet implementations of existing games. Several such
claims have been asserted against us. Such claims can harm our
business. We incur substantial expenses in evaluating and
defending against such claims, regardless of the merits of the
claims. In the event that there is a determination that we have
infringed a third-party patent, we could incur significant
monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the
future.

Other intellectual property claims may
increase our product costs or require us to cease selling
affected products.

Many of our products include extremely realistic
graphical images, and we expect that as technology continues to
advance, images will become even more realistic. Some of the
images and other content are based on real-world examples that
may inadvertently infringe upon the intellectual property rights
of others. Although we believe that we make reasonable efforts
to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual
property rights of others, it is possible that third parties
still may claim infringement. From time to time, we receive
communications from third parties regarding such claims.
Existing or future infringement claims against us, whether valid
or not, may be time consuming and expensive to defend. Such
claims or litigations could require us to stop selling the
affected products, redesign those products to avoid
infringement, or obtain a license, all of which would be costly
and harm our business.

Our business, our products and our
distribution are subject to increasing regulation in key
territories of content, consumer privacy and online delivery. If
we do not successfully respond to these regulations, our
business may suffer.

Legislation is continually being introduced that
may affect both the content of our products and their
distribution. For example, privacy laws in the United States and
Europe impose various restrictions on our web sites. Those rules
vary by territory although the Internet recognizes no
geographical boundaries. Other countries, such as Germany, have
adopted laws regulating content both in packaged goods and those
transmitted over the Internet that are stricter than current
United States laws. In the United States, the federal and
several state governments are considering content restrictions
on products such as ours, as well as restrictions on
distribution of such products. Any one or more of these factors
could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to
offer to our customers and by requiring additional
differentiation between



products for different territories to address
varying regulations. This additional product differentiation
would be costly.

If we do not consistently meet our product
development schedules, we will experience fluctuations in our
operating results.

Our ability to meet product development schedules
is affected by a number of factors, including the creative
processes involved, the coordination of large and sometimes
geographically dispersed development teams required by the
increasing complexity of our products, and the need to refine
and tune our products prior to their release. We have in the
past experienced development delays for several of our products.
Failure to meet anticipated production or “go live”
schedules may cause a shortfall in our revenue and profitability
and cause our operating results to be materially different from
expectations. Delays that prevent release of our products during
peak selling seasons or in conjunction with specific events,
such as the release of a related movie or the beginning of a
sports season or major sporting event, could adversely affect
our financial performance.

Technology changes rapidly in our business,
and if we fail to anticipate new technologies, the quality,
timeliness and competitiveness of our products will
suffer.

Rapid technology changes in our industry require
us to anticipate, sometimes years in advance, which technologies
our products must take advantage of in order to make them
competitive in the market at the time they are released.
Therefore, we usually start our product development with a range
of technical development goals that we hope to be able to
achieve. We may not be able to achieve these goals, or our
competition may be able to achieve them more quickly than we
can. In either case, our products may be technologically
inferior to competitive products, or less appealing to
consumers, or both. If we cannot achieve our technology goals
within the original development schedule of our products, then
we may delay products until these technology goals can be
achieved, which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our
development expenses. Alternatively, we may increase the
resources employed in research and development in an attempt to
accelerate our development of new technologies, either to
preserve our product launch schedule or to keep up with our
competition, which would increase our development expenses.

If we do not continue to attract and retain
key personnel, we will be unable to effectively conduct our
business.

The market for technical, creative, marketing and
other personnel essential to the development and marketing of
our products and management of our businesses is extremely
competitive. Our leading position within the interactive
entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of
executives and key creative talent. If we cannot successfully
recruit and retain the employees we need, or replace key
employees following their departure, our ability to develop and
manage our businesses will be impaired.

Our platform licensors are our chief
competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of and/or
access to our videogame products. If they do not approve our
products, we will be unable to ship to our customers.

Our agreements with hardware licensors (such as
Sony for the PlayStation 2, Microsoft for the Xbox and
Nintendo for the Nintendo GameCube) typically give significant
control to the licensor over the approval and manufacturing of
our products, which could, in certain circumstances, leave us
unable to get our products approved, manufactured and shipped to
customers. These hardware licensors are also our chief
competitors. In most events, control of the approval and
manufacturing process by the platform licensors increases both
our manufacturing lead times and costs as compared to those we
can achieve independently. While we believe that our
relationships with our hardware licensors are currently good,
the potential for these licensors to delay or refuse to approve
or manufacture our products exists. Such occurrences would harm
our business and our financial performance.



We compete directly with Microsoft and Sony for
sales of products with online capabilities. We also require
compatibility code and the consent of each in order to include
online capabilities in our products for their respective
platforms. As online capabilities for videogame platforms become
more significant, Microsoft and Sony could restrict our ability
to provide online capabilities for our console platform
products. If Microsoft or Sony refused to approve our products
with online capabilities or significantly impacted the financial
terms on which these services are offered to our customers, our
business could be harmed.

Our international net revenue is subject to
currency fluctuations.

For the year ended March 31, 2004,
international net revenue comprised 45 percent of total net
revenue. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003,
international net revenue comprised 42 percent of total
consolidated net revenue. We expect foreign sales to continue to
account for a significant and growing portion of our revenue.
Such sales are subject to unexpected regulatory requirements,
tariffs and other barriers. Additionally, foreign sales are
primarily made in local currencies, which may fluctuate against
the dollar. While we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts
to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreign
currency denominated assets and liabilities (primarily certain
intercompany receivables and payables), and foreign currency
option contracts to hedge some foreign currency forecasted
transactions (primarily related to revenue generated by our
operational subsidiaries), our results of operations and
financial condition may, nonetheless, be adversely affected by
foreign currency fluctuations.

Our reported financial results could be
affected if significant changes in current accounting principles
are adopted.

Recent actions and public comments from the SEC
have focused on the integrity of financial reporting generally.
Similarly, Congress has considered a variety of bills that could
affect certain accounting principles. The FASB and other
regulatory accounting agencies have recently introduced several
new or proposed accounting standards, such as accounting for
stock options, some of which represent a significant change from
current practices. For example, changes in our accounting for
stock options could materially increase our reported expenses.

Our stock price has been volatile and may
continue to fluctuate significantly.

As a result of the factors discussed in this
report, general economic conditions, and other factors that may
arise in the future, the market price of our common stock
historically has been, and we expect will continue to be,
subject to significant fluctuations. These fluctuations may be
due to factors specific to us, to changes in analysts’
earnings estimates, to factors affecting the computer, software,
Internet, entertainment, media or electronics businesses, or to
national and international economic conditions.

The majority of our sales are made to a
relatively small number of key customers. If these customers
reduce their purchases of our products or become unable to pay
for them, our business could be harmed.

In the U.S. in fiscal 2004, over 70 percent
of our sales were made to six key customers. In Europe, our top
ten customers accounted for over 35 percent of our sales in
that territory in fiscal 2004. Worldwide, we had direct sales to
one customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., which represented
13 percent of total net revenue in fiscal 2004. Though our
products are available to consumers through a variety of
retailers, the concentration of our sales in one, or a few,
large customers could lead to short-term disruption in our sales
if one or more of these customers significantly reduced their
purchases or ceased to carry our products, and could make us
more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large
customers became unable to pay for our products. Additionally,
our receivables from these large customers increase
significantly in the December quarter as they stock up for the
holiday selling season. Also, having such a large portion of our
total net revenue concentrated in a few customers reduces our
negotiating leverage with these customers.



Acquisitions, investments and other strategic
transactions could result in operating difficulties, dilution to
our investors and other negative consequences.

We have evaluated, and expect to continue to
evaluate, a wide array of potential strategic transactions,
including (1) acquisitions of companies, businesses,
intellectual properties, and other assets, and
(2) investments in new interactive entertainment businesses
(for example, online and mobile games). Any of these strategic
transactions could be material to our financial condition and
results of operations. Although we regularly search for
opportunities to engage in strategic transactions, we may not be
successful in identifying suitable opportunities. We may not be
able to consummate potential acquisitions or investments or an
acquisition or investment may not enhance our business or may
decrease rather than increase our earnings. In addition, the
process of integrating an acquired company or business, or
successfully exploiting acquired intellectual property or other
assets, could divert a significant amount of our
management’s time and focus and may create unforeseen
operating difficulties and expenditures. Additional risks we
face include:

n

The need to implement or remediate controls,
    procedures and policies appropriate for a public company in an
    acquired company that prior to the acquisition lacked these
    controls, procedures and policies,

n

Cultural challenges associated with integrating
    employees from an acquired company or business into our
    organization,

n

Retaining employees from the businesses we
    acquire,

n

The need to integrate an acquired company’s
    accounting, management information, human resource and other
    administrative systems to permit effective management, and

n

To the extent that we engage in strategic
    transactions outside of the United States, we face additional
    risks, including risks related to integration of operations
    across different cultures and languages, currency risks and the
    particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated
    with specific countries.

Future acquisitions and investments could involve
the issuance of our equity securities, potentially diluting our
existing stockholders, the incurrence of debt, contingent
liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill,
any of which could harm our financial condition. Our
stockholders may not have the opportunity to review, vote on or
evaluate future acquisitions or investments.

We have begun the implementation of a common
set of financial information systems throughout our worldwide
organization, which, if not completed in a successful and timely
manner, could impede our ability to accurately process, prepare
and analyze important financial data.

As part of our effort to improve efficiencies
throughout our worldwide organization, we have begun the
implementation of a common set of practices, processes and
financial information systems. The successful conversion from
our current financial information systems to new financial
information systems entails a number of risks due to the
complexity of the conversion and implementation process. Such
risks include verifying the accuracy of the business data and
information prior to conversion, the actual conversion of that
data and information to the new systems and then using that
business data and information in the new systems after the
conversion. In addition, because the implementation is
company-wide, there is a need for substantial and comprehensive
company-wide employee training. While testing of these new
systems and processes and training of employees are done in
advance of implementation, there are inherent limitations in our
ability to simulate a full-scale operating environment in
advance of implementation. Finally, there can be no assurance
that the conversion to, and the implementation of, the new
financial information systems will not impede our ability to
accurately and timely process, prepare and analyze the financial
data we use in making operating decisions and which form the
basis of the financial information we include in the periodic
reports we file with the SEC.



Our products are subject to the threat of
piracy by a variety of organizations and individuals. If we are
not successful in combating and preventing piracy, our sales and
profitability could be harmed significantly.

In many countries around the world, more pirated
copies of our products are sold than legitimate copies. Though
piracy has not had a material impact on our operating results to
date, highly organized pirate operations have been expanding
globally. In addition, the proliferation of technology designed
to circumvent the protection measures we use in our products,
the availability of broadband access to the Internet, the
ability to download pirated copies of our games from various
Internet sites, and the widespread proliferation of Internet
cafes using pirated copies of our products, all have contributed
to ongoing and expanding piracy. Though we take steps to make
the unauthorized copying and distribution of our products more
difficult, as do the manufacturers of consoles on which our
games are played, neither our efforts nor those of the console
manufacturers may be successful in controlling the piracy of our
products. This could have a negative effect on our growth and
profitability in the future.

Item 7A: Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risk

We are exposed to various market risks, including
changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market
rates and prices. Foreign exchange forward and option contracts
used to either mitigate or hedge foreign currency exposures and
short-term investments are subject to market risk. We do not
consider our cash and cash equivalents to be subject to interest
rate risk due to their short maturities. We do not enter into
derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to
mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency
denominated assets and liabilities, primarily certain
intercompany receivables and payables. Our foreign exchange
forward contracts are accounted for as derivatives whereby the
gains and losses on these contracts are reflected in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gains and losses on open
contracts at the end of each accounting period resulting from
changes in the forward rate are recognized in earnings and are
designed to offset gains and losses on the underlying
foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities. As of
March 31, 2004, we had foreign exchange forward contracts,
all with maturities of less than one month, to sell
approximately $189.6 million in foreign currencies,
consisting primarily of British Pounds, Euros, Japanese Yen and
other currencies. Of this amount, $172.3 million represents
contracts to sell foreign currency in exchange for
U.S. dollars and $17.3 million represents contracts to
sell foreign currency in exchange for British Pounds.

From time to time, we hedge some of our foreign
currency risk related to anticipated future sales transactions
by purchasing option contracts that generally have maturities of
15 months or less. If qualified, these transactions are
designated as cash flow hedges. For the year ended
March 31, 2004, we recognized a loss of $1.6 million
in earnings associated with the time value of these option
contracts.

The counterparties to these forward and options
contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks. The
risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these
contracts are not considered to be material. Notwithstanding our
efforts to mitigate some foreign exchange risks, there can be no
assurances that our mitigating activities will adequately
protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency
fluctuations.



The following table provides information about
our foreign currency forward and option contracts as of
March 31, 2004. The information is provided in
U.S. dollar equivalents and presents the notional amount
(forward or option amount), the weighted-average contractual
foreign currency exchange rates and fair value. The fair value
of our forward and option contracts is recorded in other current
assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.



Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in
interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. We
do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment
portfolio. We manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an
investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments of
high credit quality and relatively short average maturities.
Though we maintain sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances
such that we are typically able to hold our investments to
maturity, currently, the majority of our investments are
callable by the issuer. As there can be no assurance as to how
long these investments will be held, we classify these
securities as short-term investments based on call date.

As of March 31, 2004, our cash equivalents
and short-term investments included $2.3 billion of debt
securities, consisting primarily of U.S. agency bonds,
money market funds and municipal securities. Notwithstanding our
efforts to manage interest rate risks, there can be no
assurances that we will be adequately protected against the
risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.

The table below presents the amounts (in
thousands) and related weighted-average interest rates of our
investment portfolio as of March 31, 2004:

(1)

See definition in Note 1 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8
    hereof.

(2)

Maturity dates for short-term investments range
    from 10 months to 28 months with call dates ranging
    from 3 months to 5 months.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF
    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Electronic Arts develops, markets, publishes and
distributes interactive software games that are playable by
consumers on home videogame machines (such as the Sony
PlayStation 2®, Microsoft Xbox®, Nintendo
GameCube

TM

consoles), personal computers, hand-held
game machines (such as the Game Boy® Advance) and online,
over the Internet and other proprietary online networks. Many of
our games are based on content that we license from others
(e.g., Madden NFL Football, Harry Potter and
FIFA Soccer), and many of our games are based on
intellectual property that is wholly-owned by EA (e.g., The
Sims

TM

, Medal of Honor

TM

). Our goal is to
develop titles which appeal to the mass markets and as a result,
we develop, market, publish and distribute our games in over
100 countries, often translating and localizing them for
sale in non-English speaking countries. Our goal is to create
software game “franchises” that allow us to publish
new titles on a recurring basis that are based on the same
property. Examples of this are our annual iterations of our
sports-based franchises (e.g., NCAA Football and
FIFA Soccer), titles based on long-lived movie properties
(e.g., James Bond

TM

) and wholly-owned properties
that can be successfully sequeled
(e.g., SimCity

TM

).

A summary of our significant accounting policies
applied in the preparation of our consolidated financial
statements follows:

(a)

Consolidation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements include the accounts of Electronic Arts Inc. and its
wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

(b)

Fiscal Year

Our fiscal year is reported on a 52/53-week
period that ends on the final Saturday of March in each year.
The results of operations for the fiscal years ended
March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 each contain 52 weeks
and ended on March 27, 2004, March 29, 2003 and
March 30, 2002, respectively. For simplicity of
presentation, all fiscal periods are treated as ending on a
calendar month end.

(c)

Stock Split

On October 20, 2003, our Board of Directors
authorized a two-for-one stock split of our Class A common
stock which was distributed on November 17, 2003 in the
form of a stock dividend for shareholders of record at the close
of business on November 3, 2003. All issued and outstanding
share and per-share amounts related to the Class A common
stock in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and
Notes thereto have been restated to reflect the stock split for
all periods presented.

(d)

Reclassifications

Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified
to conform to the fiscal 2004 presentation.

(e)

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, contingent assets and liabilities, and revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include
provisions for doubtful accounts, sales returns and allowances
and accrued liabilities, and estimates regarding the
recoverability of prepaid royalties, inventories, long-lived
assets and deferred income taxes. These estimates generally
involve complex issues and require us to make judgments, involve
analysis of historical and future trends, can require extended
periods of time to resolve, and are subject to change from
period to period. In all cases, actual results could differ
materially from management’s estimates.

(f)

Cash, Cash Equivalents, Short-Term
    Investments, Marketable Equity Securities and Other
    Investments

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid
investments with insignificant rate risk and with maturities of
three months or less at the date of purchase. Short-term
investments include securities with maturities greater than



three months and less than one year, except for
certain investments with stated maturities greater than one year
that are callable within one year.

We account for investments in marketable equity
and debt securities under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115,

“Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities”

. Our policy is to minimize the principal
risk of our investment portfolio by earning returns based on
current interest rates. Management determines the appropriate
classification of its debt and equity securities at the time of
purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance
sheet date. Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity
when we have the positive intent and ability to hold the
securities to maturity. Securities classified as
held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, which is
adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts
to maturity. Such amortization is included in interest income.
Debt securities, not classified as held-to-maturity, are
classified as available-for-sale and are stated at fair value.
Unrealized gains and losses are included as a separate component
of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
stockholders’ equity, net of any tax related effect.
Realized gains and losses are calculated based on the specific
identification method. See Note 2 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

In accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion (“APB”) No. 18,

“The Equity
Method Of Accounting For Investments In Common Stock”

,
management evaluates equity investments accounted for under the
equity and cost methods of accounting to determine if events or
changes in circumstances indicate an other-than-temporary
impairment in value. We have cost and equity investments in
affiliates. Based on several factors, such as the financial
performance of the affiliate, our decision to no longer acquire
or continue investing in these affiliates, the limited cash flow
from future business arrangements and other information
available during fiscal 2003, we determined that some of our
investments in affiliates contained an other-than-temporary
impairment and recorded a charge in the amount of
$10.6 million to write-down these investments to their
estimated fair market value. This write-down was recorded in
interest and other income, net in the fiscal 2003 Consolidated
Statements of Operations. During fiscal 2004 and 2002, we did
not identify any other-than-temporary impairments on our
investments in affiliates and accordingly, no charge was
recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

(g)

Inventories

Inventories consist of materials and labor and
include manufacturing royalties paid to the console
manufacturers. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out method) or market.

(h)

Property and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment, net are stated at cost.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over
the following useful lives:

Under the provisions of American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position
(“SOP”) 98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal
Use”

, we capitalize costs associated with customized
internal-use software systems that have reached the application
development stage and meet recoverability tests. Such
capitalized costs include external direct costs utilized in
developing or obtaining the applications and payroll and
payroll-related expenses for employees who are directly
associated with the applications. Capitalization of such costs
begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases
at the point in which the project is substantially complete and
ready for its intended purpose. The net book value of
capitalized costs associated with internal-use software amounted
to $29.9 million and $44.3 million as of
March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and are being
depreciated on a straight-line basis over each project’s
estimated useful life that ranges from three to seven years.



(i) Long-Lived Assets

We evaluate long-lived assets and certain
identifiable intangibles for impairment, in accordance with
SFAS No. 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”

, whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is
measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to
future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by
the asset. This may include assumptions about future prospects
for the business that the asset relates to and typically
involves computations of the estimated future cash flows to be
generated by these businesses. Based on these judgments and
assumptions, we determine whether we need to take an impairment
charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet to reflect its actual fair value.
Judgments and assumptions about future values and remaining
useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be
affected by a variety of factors, including but not limited to,
significant negative industry or economic trends, significant
changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the
strategy of our overall business and significant
under-performance relative to expected historical or projected
future operating results. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its
fair value. During fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, we recorded
$0.5 million, $66.3 million and $12.8 million,
respectively, of asset impairment charges in accordance with
SFAS No. 144. See Note 5 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

(j) Concentration of Credit
Risk

We extend credit to various companies in the
retail and mass merchandising industry. Collection of trade
receivables may be affected by changes in economic or other
industry conditions and may, accordingly, impact our overall
credit risk. Although we generally do not require collateral, we
perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and reserves
for potential credit losses are maintained. As of March 31,
2004, we had 17.3 percent and 11.3 percent of our
gross accounts receivable outstanding with Pinnacle, a European
logistics and collections company, and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,
respectively. As of March 31, 2003, there were no customers
with receivable balances greater than 10 percent of total
gross accounts receivables.

Short-term investments are placed with high
credit-quality financial institutions or in short-duration high
quality securities. We limit the amount of credit exposure in
any one financial institution or type of investment instrument.

(k) Revenue Recognition

We evaluate the recognition of revenue based on
the criteria set forth in SOP 97-2,

“Software
Revenue Recognition”

, as amended by SOP 98-9,

“Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions”

and
Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 101,

“Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements”

,
as revised by SAB 104,

“Revenue
Recognition”

. We evaluate revenue recognition using the
following basic criteria:

n

Evidence of an arrangement: We recognize revenue
    when we have evidence of an agreement with the customer
    reflecting the terms and conditions to deliver products.

n

Delivery: Delivery is considered to occur when
    the products are shipped and risk of loss has been transferred
    to the customer. For online games, revenue is recognized as the
    service is provided.

n

Fixed or determinable fee: If a portion of the
    arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable, we recognize that
    amount as revenue when the amount becomes fixed or determinable.

n

Collection is deemed probable: At the time of the
    transaction, we conduct a credit review of each customer
    involved in a significant transaction to determine the
    creditworthiness of the customer. Collection is deemed probable
    if we expect the customer to be able to pay amounts under the
    arrangement as those amounts become due. If we determine that
    collection is not probable, we recognize revenue when collection
    becomes probable (generally upon cash collection).

Product Revenue:

Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors
(“channel partners”), is recognized when the above
criteria are met. We reduce product revenue for estimated
customer returns, price



protection, and other offerings, which may occur
under programs we have with our customers and channel partners.

Shipping and Handling: In accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue
No. 00-10,

“Accounting for Shipping and Handling
Fees and Costs”

, we recognize as revenue amounts billed
to customers for shipping and handling. Additionally, shipping
and handling costs incurred by us are included in cost of goods
sold.

Online Subscription Revenue: Online subscription
revenue is derived principally from subscription revenue
collected from customers for online play related to our
persistent state world and Pogo products. These customers are
contractually obligated to pay on a month-to-month basis.
Prepaid monthly subscription revenue, including revenue
collected from credit card sales as well as sales of

Gametime

subscription cards, are recognized ratably over the period
for which the hosting services are provided.

Software Licenses: we license to manufacturers of
products in related industries (for example, makers of personal
computers or computer accessories) rights to include certain of
our products with the manufacturer’s product, or offer our
products to consumers who have purchased the manufacturer’s
product. We call these combined products “OEM
bundles”. These OEM bundles generally require the customer
to pay us an upfront nonrefundable fee, which represents the
guaranteed minimum royalty amount. Revenue is generally
recognized upon delivery of the product master or the first
copy. Per copy royalties on sales that exceed the minimum
guarantee are recognized as earned.

(l)

Sales Returns and Allowances and Bad Debt
    Reserves

We estimate potential future product returns,
price protection and stock-balancing programs related to current
period product revenue. We analyze historical returns, current
sell-through of distributor and retailer inventory of our
products, current trends in the software games business segment
and the overall economy, changes in customer demand and
acceptance of our products and other related factors when
evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and price
protection allowances. In addition, we monitor and manage the
volume of sales to retailers and distributors and monitor their
inventories as substantial overstocking in the distribution
channel can result in high returns or the requirement for
substantial price protection in subsequent periods.

Similarly, significant judgment is required to
estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting
period. We analyze customer concentrations, customer
credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating
the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.

(m)

Advertising Costs

We generally expense advertising costs as
incurred, except for production costs associated with media
campaigns which are recognized as prepaid assets (to the extent
paid in advance) and expensed at the first run of the
advertisement. Cooperative advertising with distributors and
retailers is accrued when revenue is recognized and such amounts
are included in sales and marketing expense if there is a
separate identifiable benefit for which we can reasonably
estimate the fair value of the benefit identified. Otherwise,
they are recognized as a reduction of net revenue. We then
reimburse the distributor or retailer when qualifying claims are
submitted. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, advertising expenses totaled approximately
$182.8 million, $151.6 million and
$105.7 million, respectively.

(n)

Software Development Costs

Research and development costs, which consist
primarily of software development costs, are expensed as
incurred. SFAS No. 86,

“Accounting for the
Cost of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
Marketed”

, provides for the capitalization of certain
software development costs incurred after technological
feasibility of the software is established or for development
costs that have alternative future uses. Under our current
practice of developing new products, the technological
feasibility of the underlying software is not established until
substantially all product development is complete, which
generally includes the development of a working model. The
software development costs that have been capitalized to date
have been insignificant.



(o)

Stock-based Compensation

We account for stock-based awards to employees
using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB
No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees”

. We have adopted the disclosure-only
provisions of SFAS No. 123,

“Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation”

, as amended.

Had compensation cost for our stock-based
compensation plans been measured based on the estimated fair
value at the grant dates in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 123, we estimate that our reported net income
and net earnings per share would have been the pro forma amounts
indicated below. The fair value of each option grant is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. The following weighted-average assumptions
were used for grants made in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 under
the stock plans:

Our calculations are based on a multiple option
valuation approach and forfeitures are recognized when they
occur.



During the year ended March 31, 2004,
compensation expense for Class B stock option plans, based
on the estimated fair value at the grant dates in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, would not have
had a material impact on reported net income and net earnings
per share. Compensation expense for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002
was $0.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively.
Compensation expense for fiscal 2003 would have increased our
net loss by $0.02 to $(2.79) for both basic and diluted loss per
Class B share. Compensation expense for fiscal 2002 would
have increased our net loss by $0.15 to $(3.92) for both basic
and diluted loss per Class B share.

In March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board, “FASB”, issued an exposure draft on the
Proposed Statement of Financial Accounting Standards,

“Share-Based Payment — an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 123 and 95”

. The proposed statement
addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions
with employees and other third-parties. The proposed standard
would eliminate the ability to account for share-based
compensation transactions using APB No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”

, and
generally would require that such transactions be accounted for
using a fair-value-based method. If the final standard is
approved as currently drafted in the exposure draft, it would
have a material impact on the amount of earnings we report.
Management has not yet determined the impact that the proposed
statement will have on our business.



(p)

Foreign Currency Translation

For each of our foreign operating subsidiaries
the functional currency is its local currency. Assets and
liabilities of foreign operations are translated into
U.S. dollars using month end exchange rates, and revenue
and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars using average
exchange rates. The effects of foreign currency translation
adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are
a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.
Included in interest and other income, net, in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations are foreign currency transaction gains
(losses) of $44.3 million, $21.7 million and
$(2.0) million for the fiscal years ended March 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

(q)

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting
    Standards

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 46 (“FIN 46”),

“Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities”

. This interpretation of
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,

“Consolidated
Financial Statements,”

addresses consolidation by
business enterprises of variable interest entities
(“VIEs”) that either (i) do not have sufficient
equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its
activities without additional subordinated financial support, or
(ii) are owned by equity investors who lack an essential
characteristic of a controlling financial interest. This
interpretation applies immediately to VIEs created after
January 31, 2003. With regard to VIEs already in existence
prior to February 1, 2003, the implementation of
FIN 46 was delayed and currently applies to the first
fiscal year or interim period beginning after December 15,
2003. FIN 46 requires disclosure of VIEs in financial
statements issued after January 31, 2003, if it is
reasonably possible that as of the transition date (i) we
will be the primary beneficiary of an existing VIE that will
require consolidation, or (ii) we will hold a significant
variable interest in, or have significant involvement with, an
existing VIE. We adopted FIN 46 in the quarter ended
December 31, 2003; however, it did not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

In January 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force
reached consensus on Issue No. 00-21
(“EITF 00-21”),

“Revenue Arrangements
with Multiple Deliverables”

. EITF 00-21 provides
guidance on how to determine whether an arrangement involving
multiple deliverables requires that such deliverables be
accounted for separately. EITF 00-21 allows for prospective
adoption for arrangements entered into after June 15, 2003
or adoption via a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle. We adopted EITF 00-21 in the quarter ended
June 30, 2003; however, it did not have a material impact
on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force
ratified the consensus reached on paragraphs 6 through 23
of Issue No. 03-01 (“EITF 03-1”),

“The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
Application to Certain Investments”

. EITF 03-1
requires that certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures
should be required for debt and marketable equity securities
classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity under
SFAS No. 115,

“Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities”

and
SFAS No. 124,

“Accounting for Certain
Investments Held by Not-for-Profit Organizations”

that
are impaired at the balance sheet date but for which an
other-than-temporary impairment has not been recognized. We
adopted EITF 03-1 in the year ended March 31, 2004;
however, it did not have a material impact on the disclosures in
our Consolidated Financial Statements.



(2)

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

(a) Fair Value of Financial
Instruments

Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments,
receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are valued
at their carrying amounts as it approximates their fair value
due to the short maturity of these instruments.

Investments classified as marketable equity
securities are valued at their fair value based on quoted market
prices.

(b) Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term
Investments

(c) Marketable Equity
Securities

We have accounted for investments in marketable
equity securities as “available-for-sale” and have
stated applicable investments at fair value, with any net
unrealized gain (loss) reported as a separate component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
stockholders’ equity. Marketable equity securities had a
fair market value of $1.2 million and $1.1 million as
of March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. As of
March 31, 2004, marketable equity securities included gross
unrealized gains of $0.5 million. As of March 31,
2003, gross unrealized losses included in marketable securities
were not material. The sale of marketable equity securities
resulted in realized gains of $0.3 million and
$2.1 million in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively.
There were no sales of marketable equity securities in fiscal
2002. In addition, during fiscal 2004, we recorded an
other-than-temporary impairment on marketable equity securities
of $1.1 million.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

We account for our derivative and hedging
activities under SFAS No. 133,

“Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”

, as
amended. The assets or liabilities associated with our
derivative instruments and hedging activities are recorded at
fair value in other current assets or liabilities, respectively,
on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As discussed below, gains
and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted
for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is
designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.

We transact business in various foreign
currencies and have significant international sales and purchase
transactions denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we
purchase currency option contracts as cash flow hedges to
reduce, but not eliminate, the volatility of cash flows
primarily related to revenue generated by our operational
subsidiaries. In addition, we utilize foreign exchange forward
contracts to mitigate foreign



currency risk associated with foreign currency
denominated assets and liabilities, primarily certain
intercompany receivables and payables. We do not use option or
forward exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes.

Balance Sheet Activities

For accounting purposes, we do not designate our
foreign currency forward contracts (which are intended to hedge
against changes in the value of assets and liabilities
denominated in currencies other than the entity’s
functional currency) as hedging instruments under SFAS 133.
As a result, we mark to market our foreign currency forward
contracts each period and any gains or losses are recognized in
interest and other income, net, in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations. However, U.S. GAAP also requires us to mark
to market asset and liabilities that are denominated in
currencies other than the entity’s functional currency with
the corresponding gains or losses also being recognized in
interest and other income, net. As a result, the gains or losses
on these assets and liabilities generally offset the gains or
losses recorded on our foreign currency forward contracts.

As of March 31, 2004, we had foreign
exchange contracts, all with maturities of less than three
months, to purchase and sell approximately $189.6 million
in foreign currencies, primarily in British Pounds, European
Currency Units (“Euros”) and Japanese Yen.

As of March 31, 2004, the fair value of
foreign currency forward contracts was $1.7 million and was
recorded in other current assets on our Consolidated Balance
Sheet. The counterparties to these contracts are creditworthy
multinational commercial banks. The risks of counterparty
nonperformance associated with these contracts are not
considered to be material. Notwithstanding our efforts to manage
foreign exchange risk, there can be no assurances that our
mitigating or hedging activities will adequately protect us
against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.

Cash Flow Hedge Activities

Our foreign currency option contracts are
designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. The fair value of
the effective portion of a derivative’s gain or loss is
initially reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified into
net revenue when the forecasted transaction impacts earnings. We
exclude the fair value of the hedge at the date of inception and
the subsequent changes in the value of the hedge due to the
passage of time (amortization) from our assessment of hedge
effectiveness and report these amounts in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations in interest and other income, net. These
currency option contracts generally have maturities of less than
15 months. During fiscal 2004, we recognized a loss of
$1.6 million which was excluded from our assessment of cash
flow hedge effectiveness. We did not enter into any foreign
currency option contracts prior to fiscal 2004. As all
originally forecasted transactions either occurred or continued
to be probable of occurring, we did not discontinue hedge
accounting treatment for any foreign currency option contracts
designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges and accordingly,
have not reclassified any gains or losses to earnings.

(4) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

Square Co., Ltd.

In May 1998, we completed the formation of two
new joint ventures in North America and Japan with Square Co.,
Ltd. (“Square”), a leading developer and publisher of
entertainment software in Japan. In North America, the companies
formed Square Electronic Arts, LLC (“Square EA”),
which had exclusive publishing rights in North America for
future interactive entertainment titles created by Square.
Additionally, we had the exclusive right to distribute in North
America products published by this joint venture. We contributed
$3.0 million and owned a 30 percent minority interest
in this joint venture while Square owned 70 percent. This
joint venture was accounted for under the equity method. The
joint venture agreements with Square expired as of
March 31, 2003. Our distribution of Square products in
North America terminated on June 30, 2003. On May 30,
2003, Square acquired our 30 percent ownership interest in
the joint venture for $8.5 million and the investment was
removed from our Consolidated Balance Sheet.



In Japan, the companies established Electronic
Arts Square K.K. (“EA Square KK”) in 1998, which
localized and published in Japan; a selection of EA’s
properties originally created in North America and Europe, as
well as developed and published original videogames in Japan. We
contributed cash and had a 70 percent majority ownership
interest, while Square contributed cash and owned
30 percent. Accordingly, the assets, liabilities and
results of operations for EA Square KK were included in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of
Operations since June 1, 1998, the date of formation.
Square’s 30 percent interest in EA Square KK was
reflected as “Minority interest in consolidated joint
venture” on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
March 31, 2003, and Consolidated Statements of Operations
for the years ended March 31, 2003 and March 31, 2002.

In May 2003, we acquired Square’s
30 percent ownership interest in EA Square KK for
approximately $2.5 million in cash. As a result of the
acquisition, EA Square KK has become our wholly owned
subsidiary and has been renamed Electronic Arts K.K. The
acquisition was accounted for as a step acquisition purchase and
the excess purchase price over fair value of the net tangible
assets acquired, $1.2 million, was allocated to goodwill.

(5) GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE
ASSETS

Effective April 1, 2002, we adopted the
provisions of SFAS No. 141,

“Business
Combinations”

, which requires business combinations
initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting and acquired intangible assets
meeting certain criteria to be recorded apart from goodwill. We
evaluated our goodwill and intangibles acquired prior to
June 30, 2001 using the criteria of SFAS No. 141,
which resulted in $41.5 million of other intangibles being
recorded separately from goodwill and $4.0 million of
acquired workforce intangibles being subsumed into goodwill at
April 1, 2002. In addition, effective April 1, 2002,
we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”

.
SFAS No. 142 requires that purchased goodwill and
certain indefinite-lived intangibles no longer be amortized;
rather, goodwill will be subject to at least an annual
assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value-based test.
SFAS No. 142 also requires, among other things,
reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized
intangibles and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill
and other indefinite-lived intangibles. Upon adoption, we
evaluated the estimated useful lives of existing recognized
intangibles and determined that the estimated useful lives of
all such assets were appropriate.

Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, we
ceased amortizing goodwill (see goodwill information in table
below). In lieu of amortization, SFAS No. 142 requires
a two-step approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each
reporting unit. The first step tests for impairment by applying
fair value-based tests at the reporting unit level. The second
step (if necessary), measures the amount of impairment by
applying fair value-based tests to individual assets and
liabilities within each reporting unit. We completed the first
step of transitional goodwill impairment testing during the
quarter ended June 30, 2002 and found no indicators of
impairment of our recorded goodwill. As a result, we recognized
no transitional impairment loss in fiscal 2003 in connection
with the adoption of SFAS No. 142. We completed our
annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and
2003 with a measurement date of January 1, 2004 and
January 1, 2003, respectively, and found no indicators of
impairment of our recorded goodwill. There can be no assurance
that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to
earnings and there is a potential for a write down of goodwill
in connection with the annual impairment test in future periods.



The following table presents comparative
information showing the effects that non-amortization of
goodwill would have had on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations for fiscal 2002 (in thousands, except per share
amounts):

During fiscal 2004, we recorded an additional
$1.2 million of goodwill as a result of our acquisition of
Square Co., Ltd.’s 30 percent interest in Electronic
Arts Square K.K. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion on this joint
venture termination. Additionally, we recorded an additional
$3.0 million of goodwill in fiscal 2004 as a result of our
acquisition of Studio 33 (UK) Limited and NuFX, Inc.
Goodwill information is as follows (in thousands):

Finite-lived intangible assets net of accumulated
amortization as of March 31, 2004 and 2003, of
$18.5 million and $21.3 million, respectively, include
costs for obtaining tradenames. Amortization of intangibles for
the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was
$2.7 million, $7.5 million and $12.3 million,
respectively. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using
the straight-line method over the lesser of their estimated
useful lives or the agreement terms, typically from two to
twelve years. As of March 31, 2004 and March 31, 2003,
the weighted-average remaining useful life for finite-lived
intangible assets was approximately 7.5 years and
8.5 years, respectively.

When indicators are present and circumstances
warrant, we perform impairment tests under
SFAS No. 144 to evaluate the recoverability of our
long-lived assets and remaining finite-lived identifiable
intangibles utilized in our business. This test was performed in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 in conjunction with the
overall valuation of the EA.com legal entity and our
Class B common stock and resulted in an impairment of
$12.4 million. Please see Note 6 to Consolidated
Financial Statements.



Finite-lived intangibles consist of the following
(in thousands):

As of March 31, 2004, future amortization of
finite-lived intangibles is estimated as follows (in thousands):

(6) RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT
CHARGES

Fiscal 2004 Studio Restructuring

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we
closed the majority of our leased studio facility in Walnut
Creek, California and our entire owned studio facility in
Austin, Texas. The studio closures were the result of a
strategic decision to consolidate local development efforts in
Redwood City, California. We recorded total pre-tax charges of
$9.2 million, consisting of $7.0 million for
consolidation of facilities, $1.7 million for workforce
reductions and $0.5 million for the write-off of
non-current assets, primarily leasehold improvements. The
facilities charge included contractual rental commitments under
the real estate lease for unutilized office space at our Walnut
Creek location, offset by estimated future sub-lease income. The
exit plans resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately
117 personnel in development and administrative
departments, the majority of whom are expected to be terminated
in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. In addition, we also expect
immaterial charges to be incurred during the first quarter of
fiscal 2005, primarily related to the Texas facility relocation.



Fiscal 2003 Studio Restructuring

During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we
closed our office located in San Francisco, California and
our studio located in Seattle, Washington. The office and studio
closures were the result of a strategic decision to consolidate
local development efforts in Redwood City, California and
Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. We recorded total pre-tax
charges of $9.4 million, consisting of $7.3 million
for consolidation of facilities, $1.5 million for the
write-off of non-current assets, primarily leasehold
improvements, and $0.6 million for workforce reductions.
The facilities charge was net of a reduction in deferred rent of
$0.5 million. The exit plans resulted in a workforce
reduction of approximately 33 personnel in development and
administrative departments. The estimated costs for
consolidation of facilities included contractual rental
commitments under the real estate lease for unutilized office
space, offset by estimated future sub-lease income.

Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2003, we approved a plan to consolidate the Los Angeles,
California, Irvine, California and Las Vegas, Nevada, studios
into one major game studio in Los Angeles. These measures were
taken in order to maximize efficiencies and streamline the
creative development process and operations of our studios. In
connection with these consolidation activities, we recorded a
total pre-tax restructuring charge of $5.1 million,
including $1.6 million for the shutdown of facilities
related to non-cancelable lease payments for permanently vacated
properties and associated costs, $2.0 million for the
write-off of abandoned equipment and leasehold improvements at
facilities that were permanently vacated and $1.5 million
for employee severance expenses related to involuntary
terminations.

Fiscal 2003 Online Restructuring

In March 2003, we consolidated the operations of
EA.com into our core business, and eliminated separate reporting
for its Class B common stock for all future reporting
periods after fiscal 2003. We consider online functionality to
be an integral component of our existing and future products.

During fiscal 2003, we recorded restructuring
charges, including asset impairment, of $67.0 million,
consisting of $1.8 million for workforce reductions,
$2.3 million for consolidation of facilities and other
administrative charges, and $62.9 million for the write-off
of non-current assets. The estimated costs for workforce
reduction included severance charges for terminated employees,
costs for certain outplacement service contracts and costs
associated with the tender offer to retire employee Class B
options. The workforce reduction resulted in the termination of
approximately 50 positions. The consolidation of facilities
resulted in the closure of EA.com’s Chicago and Virginia
facilities and an adjustment for the closure of EA.com’s
San Diego studio in fiscal 2002. The estimated costs for
consolidation of facilities and other administrative charges
included contractual rental commitments under real estate leases
for unutilized office space reduced by estimated future
sub-lease income and costs to close the facilities.

As part of the restructuring efforts, we
performed impairment tests under SFAS No. 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets”

, to evaluate the recoverability of our
long-lived assets and remaining finite-lived identifiable
intangible assets utilized in the EA.com business. This test was
performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 in conjunction
with the overall valuation of the EA.com legal entity and its
Class B common stock. In February 2003, our only outside
holder of Class B common stock, AOL, exercised its right to
exchange its Class B shares for shares of Class A
common stock. In late December 2002, EA.com launched

The Sims
Online,

an online game based on our “The Sims”
line of PC games, which had sold over 20 million units
worldwide at that time.

The Sims Online

was expected to
be EA.com’s flagship online subscription offering. As of
March 31, 2003, the number of units sold and the number of
subscribers for this product along with other EA.com revenue
were significantly below our expectations. We considered these
developments to be a triggering event under
SFAS No. 144, which caused us to cancel most of our
plans to develop similar online products that would have
utilized the long-lived assets associated with the EA.com
business. Impairment charges on long-lived assets amounted to
$62.9 million and included $24.9 million relating to
impaired customized internal-use software systems for the EA.com
infrastructure, $25.6 million for other long-lived assets
and $12.4 million of finite-lived intangibles impairment
charges relating to EA.com’s acquisitions of Kesmai
Corporation and Pogo Corporation (now referred to as
“Kesmai” and “Pogo”, respectively) studios.
As of March 31, 2003, there were no finite-lived intangible
balances remaining related to Kesmai and Pogo studios.



In conjunction with our annual policy to reassess
the remaining useful lives of goodwill and certain
indefinite-lived intangibles and test the recoverability of
these long-lived assets in accordance with
SFAS No. 142, our fair value based tests did not
indicate an impairment of our recorded goodwill and certain
indefinite-lived intangibles at the EA.com reporting unit level
as of January 1, 2003. The remaining portion of Kesmai
goodwill assets as of March 31, 2003 was
$13.8 million. The remaining portion of Pogo goodwill
assets as of March 31, 2003 was $15.9 million. There
are no assurances that future impairment tests will not result
in a charge to earnings and a corresponding write down of
goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangibles.

Fiscal 2002 Online Restructuring

In October 2001, we announced a restructuring
plan for EA.com. The restructuring initiatives involved
strategic decisions to discontinue certain product offerings and
focus only on key online priorities that aligned with our fiscal
2003 operational objectives. A concurrent workforce reduction
resulted in the termination of approximately 270 positions.

During fiscal 2002, we recorded restructuring
charges of $20.3 million, consisting of $4.2 million
for workforce reductions, $3.3 million for consolidation of
facilities and other administrative charges, and
$12.8 million for the write-off of non-current assets and
facilities. The estimated costs for workforce reduction included
severance charges for terminated employees and costs for certain
outplacement service contracts. The consolidation of facilities
resulted in the closure of EA.com’s San Diego studio
and consolidation of its San Francisco and Virginia
facilities. The estimated costs for consolidation of facilities
included contractual rental commitments under real estate leases
for unutilized office space offset by estimated future sub-lease
income, costs to close or consolidate facilities, and costs to
write off a portion of the assets from these facilities.
Impairment charges on long-lived assets amounted to
$12.8 million and included $11.2 million relating to
abandoned technologies consisting of customized internal-use
software systems for the EA.com infrastructure,
$1.0 million of Kesmai intangibles impairment because
associated products and services were discontinued and
$0.6 million of goodwill charges relating to EA.com’s
San Diego studio closure. The remaining portion of Kesmai
assets as of March 31, 2002 was $15.9 million,
consisting of $13.1 million of goodwill and
$2.8 million of intangibles relating to Kesmai’s
developed and core technology and acquired workforce.

All restructuring charges recorded prior to
December 31, 2002 were recorded in accordance with EITF
No. 94-3,

“Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring)

”, EITF No. 95-03,

“Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a
Purchase Business Combination”

, and SAB No. 100,

“Restructuring and Impairment Charges”

. For all
restructuring charges recorded subsequent to December 31,
2002, we recorded them in accordance with
SFAS No. 146,

“Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities”

. Adjustments to the
restructuring reserves will be made in future periods, if
necessary, based upon the then-current events and circumstances.



The following table summarizes the activity in
the accrued restructuring accounts for the fiscal 2004, 2003 and
2002 restructuring plans, (in thousands):

For fiscal 2004, the pre-tax restructuring charge
of $9.2 million consisted of $8.7 million in cash
charges and $0.5 million in non-cash charges related to the
write-off of non-current assets. For fiscal 2003, the pre-tax
restructuring charge of $81.4 million consisted of
$15.1 million in cash charges and $66.3 million in
non-cash charges related to the write-off of non-current assets.
For fiscal 2002, the pre-tax restructuring charge of
$20.3 million consisted of $6.9 million in cash
charges and $13.4 million in non-cash charges related to
the write-offs of non-current assets and facilities.

As of March 31, 2004, an aggregate of
$16.2 million in cash had been paid out under the fiscal
2004, 2003 and 2002 restructuring plans. In addition, there have
been subsequent net adjustments of approximately
$0.5 million and $(0.7) million in fiscal 2004 and
2003, respectively, relating to future cash outlays under the
fiscal 2003 and 2002 restructuring plans. Of the remaining cash
outlay of $14.3 million, $6.4 million is expected to
be utilized in fiscal 2005 while the remaining $7.9 million
is expected to be utilized by January 30, 2009. The
facilities-related commitments disclosed above include
$18.4 million of estimated future sub-lease income. The
restructuring accrual is included in accrued expenses in
Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

AMERICA ONLINE, INC. (“AOL”)
    AGREEMENT

In November 1999, Electronic Arts Inc., EA.com
and AOL entered into a five-year $81.0 million carriage fee
agreement (the “Prior Agreement”) which gave EA.com
the exclusive right to provide online games and interactive
entertainment content on the “Games” channels/areas of
certain AOL online services and gain access to and sell our
products to AOL subscribers and to users of AOL properties. This
agreement provided for carriage fees, advertising commitments,
advertising revenue sharing and other fees.

During the three months ended June 30, 2003,
the Prior Agreement was terminated and we entered into a new
two-year agreement (the “New Agreement”) under which
we will continue to provide current online game content
services, and launch new online game content and services, on
the “Games” channels/ areas of certain AOL online
services in exchange for a programming fee from AOL.



Below is a discussion of the Prior Agreement and
the changes in our relationship with AOL that are reflected in
the New Agreement.

Carriage Fee

The Prior Agreement provided for total payments
of $81.0 million in carriage fees to AOL over the term of
the Prior Agreement. Of this amount, $36.0 million was paid
upon signing the Prior Agreement with the remainder due in four
equal annual installments of $11.25 million beginning with
the first anniversary of the initial payment. We made carriage
payments to AOL of $11.25 million in each of the fiscal
years 2003, 2002 and 2001. Due to the termination of the Prior
Agreement in June 2003, we are no longer required to make the
last $11.25 million carriage payment.

Carriage fee amounts paid under the Prior
Agreement were capitalized as a prepaid asset as payments were
made to AOL. Until April 1, 2003, the total carriage fee of
$81.0 million that was provided for in the Prior Agreement
was being expensed using the straight-line method over the
remaining life of the Prior Agreement subsequent to
EA.com’s site launch in October 2000. As the carriage fee
was expensed, we applied the portion that had been paid against
the prepaid asset and recorded the remaining amount as a
liability. Amortization expense was classified as
“Marketing and sales” expense in our Consolidated
Statements of Operations. The prepaid asset and liability
balances were classified as “Other assets” and
“Accrued and other liabilities”, respectively, on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Under the New Agreement, in July 2003, AOL
refunded $18.0 million in carriage fees that we had
previously paid to AOL under the Prior Agreement. This refund
was applied against the prepaid balance and the remaining asset,
$6.4 million, is being amortized over the term of the New
Agreement as a reduction to revenue. As of March 31, 2004,
$3.6 million of this asset remained to be amortized.

Programming Fee

The New Agreement provides for AOL to make
payments to us of $27.5 million over the two-year term of
the New Agreement as a programming fee. Of the total
$27.5 million, $20.8 million pertains to existing
online games content and services that we currently provide on
the “Games” channels/areas of the AOL properties, and
is being recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the New
Agreement. The remaining $6.7 million pertains to new
online games content and services to be delivered during the
term of the New Agreement. This portion of the programming fee
will be recognized as revenue as the required new content and
services are delivered. During the year ended March 31,
2004, we recognized $10.4 million as programming fee
revenue.

Advertising Commitment

Under the Prior Agreement, we also made a
commitment to spend $15.0 million in offline media
advertisements prior to March 31, 2005. We were free to
purchase this advertising from any television, radio, print or
outdoor media property that we chose, not necessarily from any
AOL-affiliated media property. We did not purchase any
advertisements from AOL, though we purchased some qualifying
advertising from AOL affiliates. Through March 31, 2003, we
expensed the advertising as it was incurred. These costs were
classified as “Marketing and sales” expense in our
Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of March 31,
2003, we had spent approximately $4.3 million against this
commitment.

Upon the termination of the Prior Agreement, this
advertising commitment was extinguished, and there is no similar
commitment provided for in the New Agreement.

Advertising Revenue and Revenue
Sharing

Advertising revenue is derived principally from
the sale of banner and in-game advertisements. Banner and
in-game advertising is typically generated from contracts in
which either we or AOL provide a minimum number of impressions
over the term of the agreed-upon commitment. Revenue is
recognized as the impressions are delivered, provided that no
significant obligations remain and collection of the related
receivable is probable. Under the Prior Agreement, advertising
revenue generated on the AOL Games Channel was recorded net of
the applicable revenue share owed to AOL.



The Prior Agreement required that AOL pay us
50 percent of all revenue collected by AOL from the sale of
advertisements on our online games sites, until advertising
revenue reached $16.0 million in a year (measured from
October 1 through the following September 30).
Thereafter, the Prior Agreement provided that AOL would pay us
70 percent of all advertising revenue collected by AOL from
the sale of advertisements on our game sites. Under the New
Agreement, AOL is entitled to retain all advertising revenue
they collect from the sale of advertisements on our games sites
on the AOL properties, until net advertising revenue reaches
$20.0 million in the twelve months ended March 31,
2004, and until net advertising revenue reaches
$35.0 million for the remainder of the term of the New
Agreement. After advertising revenue exceeds these thresholds,
AOL is required to pay us 50 percent of the additional net
advertising revenue. These thresholds were not met during fiscal
2004 and accordingly, we did not record additional net revenue.

Other Fee Arrangements

Under the Prior Agreement, we were also required
to pay AOL a percentage of our subscription, e-commerce and
anchor tenancy revenue that exceeded certain amounts. These
costs were expensed as incurred and were classified as
“Cost of goods sold” in our Consolidated Statements of
Operations. We do not net these costs against revenue because we
maintain responsibility for providing e-commerce products and
subscription services directly to the consumer and retain the
primary inventory risk for our products and games service.

Under the New Agreement, we are required to pay
AOL a percentage of revenue derived from game service
subscriptions, e-commerce, downloadable games and prize games
that we makes available on the AOL online services. We account
for these amounts in a similar manner as described above.

(8)

ROYALTIES AND LICENSES

Our royalty expenses consist of payments to
(1) co-publishing and/or distribution affiliates,
(2) content licensors, and (3) independent software
developers. Co-publishing and distribution royalties are
payments made to third parties for delivery of product. License
royalties consist of payments made to celebrities, professional
sports organizations, movie studios and other organizations for
our use of their trademark, copyright, personal publicity
rights, content and/or other intellectual property. Royalty
payments to independent software developers are payments for the
development of intellectual property related to our games.

Royalty-based payments made to content licensors
and distribution affiliates that are paid in advance are
generally capitalized as prepaid royalties and expensed to cost
of goods sold at the greater of the contractual or effective
royalty rate based on net product sales. With regard to payments
made to independent software developers and co-publishing
affiliates, we are generally subject to development risk prior
to the general release of the product. Accordingly, payments
that are due prior to completion of the product are generally
expensed as research and development as the services are
incurred. Payments due after completion of the product
(primarily royalty-based in nature) are generally expensed as
cost of goods sold at the higher of the contractual or effective
royalty rate based on net product sales.

Each quarter, we also evaluate the future
realization of any prepaid royalties as well as minimum
commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely
to be realized through product sales. Any impairments determined
before the launch of a product are charged to research and
development expense. Impairments determined post-launch are
charged to cost of goods sold. In either case, we rely on
estimated revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid
royalties. If actual revenue, or revised sales estimates, fall
below the initial sales estimate, then the actual charge taken
may be greater in any given quarter than anticipated.



The current and long-term portions of prepaid
royalties, included in other current assets and other assets,
consisted of (in thousands):

At any given time, depending on the timing of our
payments to our co-publishing and/or distribution affiliates,
content licensors and/or independent software developers, we
have unpaid royalty amounts due to these parties that are
recognized as either accounts payable or accrued liabilities.
Accrued royalties included in accrued liabilities as of
March 31, 2004 and 2003 are $82.6 million and
$77.7 million, respectively.

In addition, at March 31, 2004, we have
approximately $130.3 million that we are obligated to pay
co-publishing and/or distribution affiliates and content
licensors but that are generally contingent upon performance by
the counterparty (i.e., delivery of the product or content). See
Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Lease Commitments and Residual Value
Guarantees

We lease certain of our current facilities and
certain equipment under non-cancelable operating lease
agreements. We are required to pay property taxes, insurance and
normal maintenance costs for certain of our facilities and will
be required to pay any increases over the base year of these
expenses on the remainder of our facilities.

In February 1995, we entered into a build-to-suit
lease with a third party for our headquarters facility in
Redwood City, California, which was refinanced with Keybank
National Association in July 2001 and expires in July 2006. We
accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in
accordance with SFAS No. 13,

“Accounting for
Leases”

, as amended. Existing campus facilities
developed in phase one comprise a total of 350,000 square
feet and provide space for sales, marketing, administration and
research and development functions. We have an option to
purchase the property (land and facilities) for a maximum of
$145.0 million or, at the end of the lease, to arrange for
(i) an extension of the lease or (ii) sale of the
property to a third party while we retain an obligation to the
owner for approximately 90 percent of the difference
between the sale price and the guaranteed residual value of up
to $128.9 million if the sales price is less than this
amount, subject to certain provisions of the lease.

In December 2000, we entered into a second
build-to-suit lease with Keybank National Association for a
five-year term beginning December 2000 to expand our Redwood
City, California headquarters facilities and develop adjacent
property adding approximately 310,000 square feet to our
campus. Construction was completed in June 2002. We accounted
for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with
SFAS No. 13, as amended. The facilities provide space
for marketing, sales and research and development. We have an
option to purchase the property for a maximum of
$130.0 million or, at the end of the lease, to arrange for
(i) an extension of the lease, or (ii) sale of the
property to a third party while we retain an obligation to the
owner for approximately 90 percent of the difference
between the sale price and the guaranteed residual value of up
to $118.8 million if the sales price is less than this
amount, subject to certain provisions of the lease.



We believe the estimated fair values of both
properties under these operating leases are in excess of their
respective guaranteed residual values as of March 31, 2004.

For the two lease agreements with Keybank
National Association, as described above, the lease rates are
based upon the Commercial Paper Rate and require us to maintain
certain financial covenants as shown below, all of which we were
in compliance with as of March 31, 2004.

In July 2003, we entered into a lease agreement
with an independent third party (“the Landlord”) for a
studio facility in Los Angeles, California, which commenced in
October 2003 and expires in September 2013 with two five-year
options to extend the lease term. Additionally, we have options
to purchase the property after five and ten years based on the
fair market value of the property at the date of sale, a right
of first offer to purchase the property upon terms offered by
the landlord, and a right to share in the profits from a sale of
the property. We have accounted for this arrangement as an
operating lease in accordance with SFAS No. 13, as
amended. Existing campus facilities comprise a total of
243,000 square feet and provide space for research and
development functions. Our rental obligation under this
agreement is $50.2 million over the initial ten-year term
of the lease. We are taking possession of the property over a
period of 18 months as the facilities become available for
use. This commitment is offset by sublease income of
$5.8 million for the sublet to an affiliate of the Landlord
of 18,000 square feet of the Los Angeles facility, which
commenced in October 2003 and expires in September 2013 with
options of early termination by the affiliate after five years
and by EA after four and five years.

Letters of Credit

In July 2002, we provided an irrevocable standby
letter of credit to Nintendo of Europe. The standby letter of
credit guarantees performance of our obligations to pay Nintendo
of Europe for trade payables of up to 8.0 million Euros.
The standby letter of credit expires in July 2005. As of
March 31, 2004, we had 0.2 million Euros payable to
Nintendo of Europe covered by this standby letter of credit.

In August 2003, we provided an irrevocable
standby letter of credit to 300 California Associates II,
LLC in replacement of our security deposit for office space. The
standby letter of credit guarantees performance of our
obligations to pay our lease commitment up to $1.1 million.
The standby letter of credit expires in December 2006. As of
March 31, 2004, we did not have a payable balance on this
standby letter of credit.

Development, Celebrity, League and Content
Licenses: Payments and Commitments

The products produced by our studios are designed
and created by our employee designers, artists, software
programmers and by non-employee software developers
(“independent artists” or “third-party
developers”). We typically advance development funds to the
independent artists and third-party developers during
development of our games, usually in installment payments made
upon the completion of specified development milestones. These
payments are considered advances against subsequent royalties
based on the sales of the products. These terms are set forth in
written agreements entered into with the independent artists and
third-party developers. In addition, we have certain celebrity,
league and content license contracts that contain minimum
guarantee payments and marketing commitments that are not
dependent on any deliverables. Celebrities and organizations
with whom we have contracts include: FIFA and UEFA (professional
soccer); NASCAR (stock car racing); John Madden (professional
football); National Basketball Association (professional
basketball); PGA TOUR (professional golf); Tiger Woods
(professional golf); National Hockey League and NHLPA
(professional hockey); Warner Bros. (Harry Potter, Catwoman and
Superman); MGM/Danjaq (James Bond); New Line Productions (The
Lord of the Rings); National



Football League and Players Inc. (professional
football); Collegiate Licensing Company (collegiate football and
basketball); ISC (stock car racing); Major League Baseball
Properties; MLB Players Association (professional baseball) and
Island Def Jam (fighting). These developer and content license
commitments represent the sum of (i) the cash payments due
under non-royalty-bearing licenses and services agreements, and
(ii) the minimum payments and advances against royalties
due under royalty-bearing licenses and services agreements.
These minimum guarantee payments and marketing commitments are
included in the following table.

The following table summarizes our minimum
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of
March 31, 2004 (in thousands), and the effect we expect
them to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods:

Total rent expense for all operating leases was
$27.3 million, $22.3 million and $27.5 million,
for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

The lease commitments disclosed above exclude
commitments included in our restructuring activities for
contractual rental commitments of $31.3 million under real
estate leases for unutilized office space, offset by
$18.4 million of estimated future sub-lease income. These
amounts were expensed in the periods of the related
restructuring and are included in our accrued liabilities
reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31,
2004. Please see Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.

Litigation

We are subject to pending claims and litigation.
Management, after review and consultation with legal counsel,
considers that any liability from the disposition of such
lawsuits would not have a material adverse effect upon our
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Director Indemnity Agreements

We have entered into an indemnification agreement
with the members of our Board of Directors to indemnify our
Directors to the extent permitted by law against any and all
liabilities, costs, expenses, amounts paid in settlement and
damages incurred by the Directors as a result of any lawsuit, or
any judicial, administrative or investigative proceeding in
which the Directors are sued as a result of their service as
members of our Board of Directors.

INCOME TAXES

Our pretax income from operations for the fiscal
years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 consisted of the
following components (in thousands):

Income tax expense (benefit) for the fiscal years
ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 consisted of (in
thousands):



The components of the net deferred tax assets as
of March 31, 2004 and 2003 consist of (in thousands):

As of March 31, 2004, deferred tax assets of
$84.3 million and $40.8 million were classified as
current assets and long-term assets, respectively. In addition,
deferred tax liabilities of $2.0 million were classified as
accrued and other liabilities. As of March 31, 2003,
deferred tax assets of $117.2 million and
$13.5 million were classified as current assets and
long-term assets, respectively.

We have research and experimental tax credit
carryforwards aggregating approximately $29.5 million and
$37.2 million for federal and California purposes,
respectively. The federal credit carryforwards expire from 2022
to 2024. The California credits carry over indefinitely until
utilized. We also have foreign tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $6.2 million, which expire from 2005 to 2008.

The differences between the statutory income tax
rate and our effective tax rate, expressed as a percentage of
income before provision for (benefit from) income taxes, for the
years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows:

Our effective income tax rate reflects the tax
benefits from having significant operations outside the United
States that are taxed at rates lower than the statutory rate of
35 percent.

Undistributed earnings of our foreign
subsidiaries amounted to approximately $738.3 million as of
March 31, 2004. Those earnings are considered to be
indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income
taxes have been provided thereon. Upon distribution of those
earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be
subject to both U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment
for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to
various foreign countries.

As of March 31, 2004, we believe it is more
likely than not that the results of future operations will
generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net deferred
tax assets.



During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003,
we successfully prevailed in Tax Court proceedings with respect
to previously-contested deficiencies issued by the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) in conjunction with its audit
of our U.S. income tax returns for the fiscal years 1993
through 1996. In addition, the IRS examined our U.S. income
tax returns for fiscal years 1997 through 1999 and has proposed
certain adjustments. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004,
we resolved certain of these matters with the Internal Revenue
Service, which lowered our income tax expense by
$19.7 million and resulted in a 2.5 percent rate
reduction. However, we have not resolved certain other issues
identified by the IRS for these tax years and are planning to
contest them. In addition, the IRS has recently commenced an
examination of our U.S. income tax returns for fiscal years
2000 through 2003. While the ultimate resolution of tax audits
involves a degree of uncertainty, we believe that adequate
amounts of tax accruals have been provided for any adjustments
that are expected to result for these years.

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

(a) Preferred Stock

As of March 31, 2004 and 2003, we had
10,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized but
unissued. The rights, preferences, and restrictions of the
preferred stock may be designated by the Board of Directors
without further action by our stockholders.

(b) Tracking Stock

On March 22, 2000, our stockholders
authorized the issuance of a new series of common stock,
designated as Class B common stock (“Tracking
Stock”). The Tracking Stock was intended to reflect the
performance of the EA.com business segment. As a result of the
approval of the Tracking Stock Proposal, our existing common
stock was re-classified as Class A common stock and was
intended to reflect the performance of the EA Core business
segment. With the authorization of the Class B common
stock, we transferred a portion of our consolidated assets,
liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows to EA.com Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Electronic Arts.

In March 2003, we consolidated the operations of
EA.com into our core operations in order to increase efficiency,
simplify our reporting structure and more directly integrate our
online activities into our core console and PC business. As
a result, we eliminated dual class reporting starting in fiscal
2004. The majority of outstanding Class B options and
warrants not directly held by us have been acquired or converted
to Class A shares and warrants.

(13)

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
    PLANS

(a) Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan program,
which commenced in September 1991, whereby eligible employees
may authorize payroll deductions of up to 10 percent of
their compensation to purchase shares at 85 percent of the
lower of the fair market value of the Class A common stock
on the date of commencement of the offering or on the last day
of the six-month purchase period. A new Employee Stock Purchase
Plan program, the “2000 Class A Employee Stock
Purchase Plan” was approved by the Board of Directors in
May 2000 and commenced in August 2000. In addition, we have a
stock purchase plan which was adopted without stockholder
approval, the International Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which
was terminated by the Board of Directors in connection with the
amendment of the stockholder-approved Plan discussed below as of
February 2003.

The International Employee Stock Purchase Plan
was adopted by the Board of Directors in June 1996 and amended
in October 1998, February 1999 and February 2002 and is in all
material respects identical to the 2000 Class A Employee
Stock Purchase Plan approved by the stockholders for
U.S. employees. In February 2003, the Board of Directors
approved an amendment to the 2000 Class A Employee Stock
Purchase Plan to segregate provisions of the Plan for purchases
intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) for
participants residing in the U.S., from those that are not
intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Code for
participants residing outside of the U.S. Accordingly, we
will no longer issue Class A common stock under the
International Employee Stock Purchase Plan.



Information related to stock issuances under
these plans is as follows:

The fair value above was estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model assumptions
described in Note 1(o) of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. As of March 31, 2004, we had
571,389 shares of Class A common stock reserved for
future issuance under the 2000 Class A Employee Stock
Purchase Plan.

(b) Stock Option Plans

Our 2000 Class A Equity Incentive Plan, 1991
Stock Option Plan, 1995 Stock Option Plan, Directors’ Stock
Option Plan and 1993 Directors’ Stock Option Plan
(“Class A Option Plans”) provide options for
employees, officers and directors to purchase the Company’s
Class A common stock. Pursuant to these Class A Option
Plans, our Board of Directors may grant non-qualified and
incentive stock options to employees and officers and
non-qualified options to Directors, at not less than
85 percent of the fair market value on the date of grant,
except for any incentive stock options, which can be granted at
not less than the fair market value on the date of grant. In
addition, the 1995 Stock Option Plan and the 2000 Class A
Equity Incentive Plan allow for grants of restricted stock.

At our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, held on
July 31, 2003, the stockholders approved an amendment to
amend the 2000 Class A Equity Incentive Plan to increase
the number of shares of our Class A common stock reserved
for issuance under the Plan by 11,000,000.

Our 2000 Class B Equity Incentive Plan
(“Class B plan”) allows the award of stock
options or restricted stock for up to an aggregate of
6,000,000 shares of Class B common stock. The
Class B plan included a provision for automatic option
grants to our outside directors. In February 2003, the Board of
Directors amended the Class B plan to eliminate automatic
grants to Directors and to preclude any further awards under the
Class B plan. As of March 31, 2004, there were 200,130
restricted shares issued and no shares available for future
issuance under the Class B plan. See Note 12 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Options under the Class A Option Plans and
the Class B plan generally expire ten years from the date
of grant and are generally exercisable as to 24 percent of
the shares after 12 months, and then the remainder in
monthly increments over 38 months.

In fiscal 2001, our Board of Directors approved
the Key Partner Class B Equity Incentive Program which
allowed for the issuance of warrants to key business partners to
purchase up to 750,000 shares of Class B common stock.
As of March 31, 2002, there were warrants to
purchase 121,000 shares of Class B common stock
outstanding under this program. These warrants expire not later
than five years from issuance. In February 2003, we caused a
“Warrant Holder Exchange” of the warrants to purchase
Class B stock and terminated the program. Accordingly, all
of the Class B warrants were exchanged for warrants to
purchase 30,504 shares of Class A common stock,
and there are no longer any shares of Class B common stock
allocated for issuance under the program. As of March 31,
2004, there were outstanding warrants to
purchase 10,548 shares of Class A common stock.

We have an equity compensation stock plan which
was adopted without stockholder approval, the Celebrity and
Artist Stock Option Plan. The Celebrity and Artist Stock Option
Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in July 1994 and
amended in May 1997, October 1997, September 1998 and July 1999.
The terms under this plan are substantially similar to the terms
of the 2000 Class A Equity Incentive Plan. The Celebrity
and Artist Stock Option Plan expires in July 2004.



The following summarizes the activity under our
Class A stock option plans during the fiscal years ended
March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:

The following summarizes the activity under the
Company’s Class B stock option plan during the fiscal
years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:

(a)

In February 2003, the Board of Directors amended
    the Class B plan to preclude any further awards under the
    Class B plan.



Additional information regarding options
outstanding for Class A as of March 31, 2004 is as
follows:

Potential dilution is computed by dividing the
options in the related range of exercise prices by the shares of
common stock issued and outstanding at March 31, 2004
(301,332,458 shares). The weighted average estimated fair
value of stock options granted during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002
were $16.22, $13.64 and $11.96, respectively. The fair value was
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model assumptions described in Note 1(o) of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The 43.6 million options outstanding have
vested or will vest approximately as follows (in millions):

(c) 401(k) Plan

We have a 401(k) Plan covering substantially all
of our U.S. employees. The 401(k) Plan permits us to make
discretionary contributions to employees’ accounts based on
our financial performance. We contributed $5.1 million,
$5.1 million and $4.8 million to the 401(k) Plan in
fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET

Interest and other income, net for the years
ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 consisted of (in

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

SFAS No. 130,

“Reporting
Comprehensive Income”

, requires classification of other
comprehensive income in a financial statement and display of
other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and
additional paid-in capital. Other comprehensive income includes
primarily foreign currency translation adjustments and
unrealized gains (losses) on investments.

The change in the components of accumulated other
comprehensive income, net of tax, is summarized as follows (in
thousands):

The change in unrealized gains (losses) on
investments, net are shown net of taxes of $0.1 million,
$1.3 million and $(1.6) million in fiscal 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.

The foreign currency translation adjustments are
not adjusted for income taxes as they relate to indefinite
investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries.

(16)

NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE

The following summarizes the computations of
Basic Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) and Diluted EPS.
Basic EPS is computed as net earnings divided by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could
occur from common shares issuable through stock-based
compensation plans including stock options, restricted stock
awards, warrants and other convertible securities using the
treasury stock method.

In fiscal years 2003 and 2002, net income (loss)
per share is computed individually for Class A common stock
and Class B common stock.



Excluded from the above computation of
weighted-average common shares for Class A Diluted EPS for
the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were
options to purchase 3,218,000, 6,303,000 and
3,030,000 shares of common stock, respectively, as the
options’ exercise price was greater than the average market
price of the common shares. For fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, the
weighted-average exercise price of these respective options was
$47.19, $31.16 and $28.83 per share.

Due to our fiscal 2003 restructuring related to
EA.com, (see Note 6), Class B EPS reporting is no
longer required. The Diluted EPS calculation for Class A
common stock, presented above for 2003 and 2002, included the
potential dilution from the conversion of Class B common
stock to Class A common stock in the event that the initial
public offering for Class B common stock did not occur. Net
income used for the calculation of Diluted EPS for Class A
common stock was $317.1 million and $101.5 million for
the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. This net income included the remaining interest in
EA.com (100 percent of EA.com losses) which was directly
attributable to outstanding Class B shares owned by third
parties, which would have been included in the Class A
common stock EPS calculation in the event that an initial public
offering for Class B common stock did not occur.



Due to the net loss attributable for the twelve
months ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 on a diluted basis to
Class B Stockholders, all stock options have been excluded
from the Diluted EPS calculation as their inclusion would have
been antidilutive. Had net income been reported for these
periods, an additional 1,405,000 and 842,000 shares would
have been added to diluted potential common shares for
Class B common stock for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Transactions with Executive Officers

On June 24, 2002, we agreed to loan Warren
Jenson $4,000,000, to be forgiven over four years based on his
continuing employment. Two million dollars of the note will be
forgiven after two years employment (at which time we will
provide Mr. Jenson the funds required to offset the tax
implications of the forgiveness), and the remainder forgiven
after four years. No additional funds will be provided to offset
the tax implications of the forgiveness of the second two
million dollars. The loan does not bear interest. The entire
balance of the loan was outstanding as of March 31, 2004.

In April 2002, we agreed to pay certain taxes
incurred by Bruce McMillan, Executive Vice President, Group
Studio Head of EA Canada, arising from his temporary employment
with us in the United Kingdom. Mr. McMillan agreed to
reimburse us for those payments upon receipt of his
corresponding tax refund from the Canadian taxing authorities.
We subsequently paid approximately $168,704 and $32,931 in
October 2002 and April 2003, respectively, to the UK Inland
Revenue for taxes incurred by Mr. McMillan. In May 2003,
Mr. McMillan became an executive officer of Electronic
Arts. As of January 22, 2004, Mr. McMillan had repaid
us the entire amount of the tax payments we made on his behalf.

In May and June 2000, the following executive
officers entered into secured full recourse promissory notes to
purchase EA’s Class B common stock under Restricted
Stock Purchase Agreements: Mr. John Riccitiello, $449,500;
Mr. Don Mattrick, $224,750; Mr. E. Stanton McKee Jr.,
$134,850; Mr. J. Russell (Rusty) Rueff, Jr., $134,850,
and Mr. David Carbone, $44,950. The terms of the notes were
five years and the interest, set at a market rate as determined
under guidelines set forth in the Internal Revenue Code and
state statutes, was due and payable quarterly. In December 2002
and January 2003, Mr. Riccitiello, Mr. Mattrick,
Mr. McKee, Mr. Rueff and Mr. Carbone paid in full
all principal and accrued interest owed under these notes.

News America Corporation Exchange

On February 7, 2000, we acquired Kesmai from
News America Corporation (“News Corp”) in exchange for
$22.5 million in cash and approximately 412,000 shares
of our existing common stock valued at $8.6 million. Under
the original agreements, we agreed to spend $12.5 million
through the period ended June 1, 2002 in advertising with
News Corp or any of its affiliates. In addition, under these
agreements if certain conditions were met, including that a
qualified public offering of Class B common stock did not
occur within twenty-four months of News Corp’s purchase of
such shares and all of the Class B outstanding shares had
been converted to Class A common stock, then (1) News
Corp would have the right to (i) exchange Class B
common stock for approximately 412,000 shares of
Class A common stock, and (ii) receive cash from us in
the amount of $9.6 million, and (2) we would agree to
spend an additional $11.7 million in advertising with News
Corp and its affiliates.

On August 30, 2002, we entered into a new
agreement with News Corp under which (i) News Corp
exchanged its 2,000,000 shares of Class B common stock
for 412,908 shares of Class A common stock and
(ii) we paid News Corp $1.0 million in cash and
committed to spend an additional $17.0 million in
advertising with News Corp and its affiliates through the period
ended December 31, 2006. All of our other obligations to
News Corp under the original agreements were terminated. As of
March 31, 2004, we had satisfied our advertising commitment
with News Corp in full.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

SFAS No. 131,

“Disclosures
About Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information”

, establishes standards for the reporting
by public business enterprises of information about product
lines, geographic areas and major customers. The method for
determining what information to report is based on the way that
management organizes our operating segments for making
operational decisions and assessments of financial performance.

Our chief operating decision maker is considered
to be our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). The CEO
reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis
accompanied by disaggregated information about revenue by
geographic region and by product lines for purposes of making
operating decisions and assessing financial performance.

In fiscal 2003 and 2002, we operated and reviewed
our business in two business segments:

n

EA Core business segment: creation, marketing and
    distribution of entertainment software.

n

EA.com business segment: creation, marketing and
    distribution of entertainment software which can be played or
    sold online, ongoing management of subscriptions of online games
    and website advertising.

In March 2003, we consolidated the operations of
the EA.com business segment into our core business. We consider
online functionality to be integral to our existing and future
products. Accordingly, beginning April 1, 2003, we no
longer manage our online products and services as a separate
business segment, and have consolidated our reporting related to
online products and services into our reporting for the overall
development and publication of our core products for all
reporting periods ending after that date. We believe that this
better reflects the way in which the CEO reviews and manages our
business and reflects the importance of the online products and
services relative to the rest of our business. Concurrently, we
also eliminated separate reporting for Class B common stock
for all reporting periods ending after April 1, 2003.

Our view and reporting of business segments may
change due to changes in the underlying business facts and
circumstances and the evolution of our reporting to our CEO.

Information about our net revenue by product line
for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Electronic Arts Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Electronic Arts Inc. and subsidiaries (the
Company) as of March 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2004. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Electronic Arts Inc. and
subsidiaries as of March 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended March 31, 2004, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

As discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting for goodwill, effective April 1, 2002.

Item 9: Changes in and Disagreements
with Accountants on Accounting and Financial
Disclosure

None.

Item 9A: Controls and
Procedures

Definition and limitations of disclosure
controls.

Our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”)) are controls and other procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as
this report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to
ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to
our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative
Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Our management evaluates these controls and
procedures on an ongoing basis.

There are inherent limitations to the
effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and
procedures. These limitations include the possibility of human
error, the circumvention or overriding of the controls and
procedures and reasonable resource constraints. In addition,
because we have designed our system of controls based on certain
assumptions, which we believe are reasonable, about the
likelihood of future events, our system of controls may not
achieve its desired purpose under all possible future
conditions. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures
provide reasonable assurance, but not absolute assurance, of
achieving their objectives.

Evaluation of disclosure controls and
procedures.

Our Chief Executive
Officer and Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and
Administrative Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures, believe that as of the
end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective in providing the
requisite reasonable assurance that material information
required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Executive
Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding the required
disclosure.

Changes in internal
controls.

During our last fiscal
quarter, no change occurred in our internal control over
financial reporting that materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. However, in response to the certification
requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and new SEC Regulations,
during fiscal 2003 and 2004 we enhanced our internal controls
and disclosure systems, through various measures including:
detailing certain internal accounting policies; establishing a
disclosure committee for the preparation of all periodic SEC
reports; establishing an internal audit function; and requiring
certifications from various trial balance controllers and other
financial personnel responsible for our financial statements.
