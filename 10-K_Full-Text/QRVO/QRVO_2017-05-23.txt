Market Overview

Our business is diversified primarily across seven strategic end markets: mobile devices, defense and aerospace, customer premises equipment ("CPE") WiFi, cellular base stations, optical, automotive connectivity and smart home.  These markets compose the primary building blocks of the IoT.

Mobile Devices

In our largest market, mobile devices, the most significant trend today is the increasing demand for ubiquitous broadband mobile data.  This is driven primarily by video, with data traffic for video exceeding data traffic for web browsing and voice.  Compounding this, consumers want higher resolution screens and access to streaming media, real-time traffic/navigation, GPS, Bluetooth® connectivity, WiFi and other energy-consuming applications.  In response, leading smartphone providers are adding 4G LTE bands of coverage to their flagship devices to reduce development costs and enable larger, more concentrated marketing budgets in support of fewer models.  They are also adding CA technology to enable simultaneous communication over multiple frequency bands.  This helps network operators optimize spectral efficiency and provides an enhanced user experience for consumers.  Both trends expand RF content and drive higher levels of integration, which can increase performance requirements for RF components and narrow the competitive field.  We see these trends continuing, as consumers increasingly expect always-on, ultra-low latency, broadband connectivity and as smartphone manufacturers and network operators seek to enhance performance and the user experience generation-over-generation.



Defense and Aerospace

The global defense and aerospace industries are sharply focused on balancing cost, performance and power consumption.  The trends toward phased arrays and higher frequencies of operation are expanding the market opportunities for monolithic microwave integrated circuits ("MMICs") and discrete PAs, LNAs, passive devices, die level solutions and multichip modules leveraging multiple semiconductor technologies and advanced packaging techniques.  Additionally, as with all RF communications systems, spectrum is becoming increasingly crowded and requires interference-free connections which are addressed by premium filtering solutions.  These factors continue to drive demand for increased reliability and performance to address current and next generation communications for defense and national security capabilities, both domestic and with international partners.

CPE WiFi

In WiFi markets, consumer and enterprise demand for faster data rates, the growth in connected users and the higher performance requirements of 802.11ac and 802.11ax mandate best-in-class RF solutions.  WiFi is continuing to proliferate within CPE, including routers, access points, set-top boxes and smart televisions, as well as in automobiles.  As spectrum becomes more crowded, the demand for interference-free transmission and reception is expected to drive the demand for high performance filters in RF solutions for WiFi equipment.

Cellular Base Stations

The widespread use of data-intensive applications has driven cellular operators to require more power-efficient designs and solutions that enable increased capacity from cellular networks.  To meet network demand, network equipment manufacturers are using techniques such as CA, moving to new RF frequency bands that have wider channel bandwidths and incorporating cloud radio access networks, which use a virtual radio access technology and remote radio heads.  As demand for data-intensive applications continues to grow, the next generation network, called 5G, is forecasted to begin commercial rollout in 2020.  5G networks will continue the progression of operating at much higher frequencies, likely at 28GHz and 39GHz.  In the meantime, operators will continue to evolve the performance of their LTE networks and run field trials to prove out 5G technologies and solutions.  The future trends in the base station market include implementation of Multiple Input Multiple Output (”MIMO”) and small cells.

Optical

The optical market continues to evolve beyond what was historically a long haul, telecom application or a metro network application.  These applications created networks of fiber optic cable that enabled connections in a transcontinental, regional or city-wide area enabling the high-speed backbone required to address the bandwidth needed for high speed voice or data networks.  Today, the optical market continues to grow rapidly as cloud-based applications create a need for hyperscale data centers that require high speed interconnections to connect geographically distributed data center sites.  The need for high throughput, efficient data centers, often characterized by cost per gigabit of data transferred, requires a blend of technology, power efficiency and integration capabilities to drive down cost.

Automotive Connectivity

The automobile is becoming a more connected device with the addition of multiple RF based connectivity solutions such as satellite radio, in-car infotainment and LTE connectivity solutions.  Looking forward, new standards are expected to be deployed that will connect the car to other vehicles or to highway infrastructure.  All of these applications create opportunities that will drive the need for RF solutions that will enhance passenger comfort, convenience and safety.  Most of these applications require AEC-Q100 qualified solutions, which is the standard in the automobile industry.  Additionally, in this market most of the communications devices will need to share frequency spectrum with either licensed or unlicensed users.

Smart Home

The smart home is a house that contains automated or remotely controlled devices.  These devices include sensors that detect light, motion or temperature, or whether doors are open, closed, locked or unlocked, and actuators to implement a command such as lowering the temperature or opening your garage door.  Typically, these devices can be controlled via the internet, by a computer or phone or through a direct peer-to-peer connection such as a television remote control.  The solutions often utilize industry open standard technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy (“BLE”), ZigBee, and Thread as well as proprietary solutions to link to a central gateway that connects to the internet.



Other Markets

We also participate in a number of smaller or emerging markets including broadband cable, point-to-point radio, Very Small Aperture Terminal ("VSAT"), signal sources, space, smart meters and the emerging cellular machine-to-machine (M2M) market.

We are also engaged with overall ecosystem providers to develop products beyond remote controls to address next generation smart home applications.

Manufacturing

The majority of our products are multi-chip modules utilizing multiple semiconductor process technologies.  These products have varying degrees of complexity and contain semiconductors and other components that are manufactured in-house or outsourced.  We are a leading supplier of RF solutions and a leading manufacturer of GaAs HBT, GaAs pHEMT, GaN, SAW, TC-SAW and BAW products.

We operate wafer fabrication facilities for the production of GaAs, GaN, SAW, TC-SAW and BAW wafers in Richardson, Texas; Apopka, Florida; Greensboro, North Carolina; and Hillsboro, Oregon.  In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we acquired an additional wafer fabrication facility in Farmers Branch, Texas, which we currently plan to use to expand our BAW filter capacity.  We also use multiple silicon-based process technologies, including SOI, SiGe and CMOS.  We outsource all silicon manufacturing to leading silicon foundries located throughout the world. We have a global supply chain and ship millions of units per day.

We have our own flip chip and wafer-level packaging (“WLP”) technologies and also use external suppliers for these and other packaging technologies.  In flip chip packages, the electrical connections are created directly on the surface of the die, which eliminates wirebonds so the die may be attached directly to a substrate or leadframe.  This type of technology provides a higher density interconnection than wirebonded die and enables smaller form factors with improved thermal and electrical performance.  We use WLP technologies for our SAW, TC-SAW and BAW filter products.

Once semiconductor wafers are manufactured, they are singulated, or separated, into individual units called die.  Prior to singulation of wafers into die, we regularly conduct wafer level tests which could include electrical validation, RF testing through the designed frequency bands, as well as visual inspection.  For module products, the next step is assembly.  During assembly, the die and other components are placed on high-density interconnect substrates to provide connectivity between the die and the components.  This populated substrate is formed into a microelectronic package.  Next, the products are tested for RF performance and prepared for shipment through a tape and reel process.  We primarily use internal assembly facilities in the United States, China, Costa Rica and Germany, and we also utilize external suppliers.  We also manufacture large volumes of WLP die and discrete filters that our customers directly assemble into their products.

Manufacturing yields can vary significantly between products, based on a number of factors, including product complexity and the maturity of our manufacturing processes.  To maximize wafer yields and quality, we test products multiple times, maintain continuous reliability monitoring and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the production flow.

Our internal manufacturing facilities require a high level of fixed costs, consisting primarily of occupancy costs, maintenance, repair, equipment depreciation, and fixed labor costs related to manufacturing and process engineering.

ICs and filter products are highly complex and sensitive to contaminants, and semiconductor fabrication requires highly controlled, clean environments.  Wafers can be rejected, or die on a wafer can be found to be nonfunctional as a result of minute impurities, variances in the fabrication process or defects in the masks used to transfer circuits onto the wafers.



Our manufacturing facilities worldwide are certified to the ISO 9001 quality standard and select locations are certified to additional automotive (TS-16949), aerospace (AS-9100) and environmental (ISO 14001) standards.  These stringent standards are audited and certified by third-party auditors in addition to our continuous internal self-audits.  The ISO 9001 standard is based on a number of quality management principles including a strong customer focus, the motivation of top management, the process approach and continual improvement.  ISO/TS-16949 is the highest international quality standard for the global automotive industry and incorporates ISO technical specifications that are more stringent than ISO 9001 quality management systems requirements.  AS-9100 is the standardized quality management system for the aerospace industry.  ISO 14001 is an internationally agreed upon standard for an environmental management system.  We require that all of our key vendors and suppliers be compliant with these standards, as applicable.

Raw Materials

We purchase numerous raw materials, passive components and substrates for our products and manufacturing processes.  For our GaAs and GaN manufacturing operations, we use several raw materials, including GaAs wafers and GaN on silicon carbide wafers.  For our acoustic filter manufacturing operations, we use several raw materials, including wafer starting materials made from quartz, silicon, lithium niobate or lithium tantalite, as well as ceramic or metal packages.  Relatively few companies produce these materials.  We are leading the industry in developing SAW filters using six-inch lithium niobate wafers, and we have qualified more than one source for this wafer starting material.  For all of our SAW operations, we utilize multiple qualified wafer and mask set vendors.  Our most significant suppliers of ceramic surface mount packages are based in Japan.

For our silicon-based integrated circuits, we use third-party foundries.  High demand for SOI wafers for our switch products has led to supply constraints in the past, and we have addressed this by qualifying new silicon foundries and obtaining supply commitments from existing silicon suppliers.

Our manufacturing strategy includes a balance of internal and external sites (primarily for assembly operations), which helps reduce costs, provides flexibility of supply, and minimizes the risk of supply disruption.  We routinely qualify multiple sources of supply and manufacturing sites to reduce the risk of supply interruptions or price increases and closely monitor suppliers’ key performance indicators.  Our suppliers' and our manufacturing sites are geographically diversified (with our largest volume sources distributed throughout Southern and Eastern Asia).  We believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials, passive components and substrates for our products and manufacturing needs.

We compete primarily with the following companies:  Analog Devices, Inc.; Broadcom Limited; M/A-COM Technology Solutions, Inc.; Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd.; Northrop Grumman Corporation; Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.; Skyworks Solutions, Inc.; and Sumitomo Electric Device Innovations.

Many of our current and potential competitors have entrenched market positions and customer relationships, established patents and other intellectual property and substantial technological capabilities.  In some cases, our competitors are also our customers or suppliers.  Additionally, many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do, which may allow them to implement new technologies and develop new products more quickly than we can.

Intellectual Property

We believe our intellectual property, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, is important to our business, and we actively seek opportunities to leverage our intellectual property portfolio to promote our business interests.  We also actively seek to monitor and protect our global intellectual property rights and to deter unauthorized use of our intellectual property and other assets.  Such efforts can be difficult because of the absence of consistent international standards and laws.  Moreover, we respect the intellectual property rights of others and have implemented policies and procedures to mitigate the risk of infringing or misappropriating third party intellectual property.

Patent applications are filed within the U.S. and in other countries where we have a market presence.  On occasion, some applications do not mature into patents for various reasons, including rejections based on prior art.  In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws.  We have more than 1,200 patents that expire from 2017 to 2037.  We also continue to acquire patents through acquisitions or direct prosecution efforts and engage in licensing transactions to secure the right to practice third parties’ patents.  In view of our rapid innovation and product development and the comparative pace of governments’ patenting processes, there is no guarantee that our products will not be obsolete before the related patents expire or are granted.  However, we believe the duration and scope of our most relevant patents are sufficient to support our business, which as a whole is not significantly dependent on any particular patent or other intellectual property right.  As we expand our products and offerings, we also seek to expand our patent prosecution efforts to cover such products.

We periodically register federal trademarks, service marks and trade names that distinguish our product brand names in the market.  We also monitor these marks for their proper and intended use.  Additionally, we rely on non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our interest in confidential and proprietary information that gives us a competitive advantage, including business strategies, unpatented inventions, designs and process technology.  Such information is closely monitored and made available only to those employees whose responsibilities require access to the information.

Backlog

Our sales are the result of standard purchase orders or specific agreements with customers.  We maintain Qorvo-owned finished goods inventory at certain customers’ “hub” locations and do not recognize revenue until our customers draw down the inventory at these hubs.  Our customers’ projections of consumption of hub inventory and quantities on purchase orders, as well as the shipment schedules, are frequently revised within agreed-upon lead times to reflect changes in the customers’ needs.  Because industry practice allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance notice prior to shipment, and with little or no penalty, we believe that backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels.

Employees

On

April 1, 2017

, we had more than

8,600

employees.  We believe that our future prospects will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain skilled employees.  Competition for skilled personnel is intense, and the number of persons with relevant experience, particularly in RF engineering, product design and technical marketing, is limited.  None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union.  A number of our employees in Germany (less than 5% of our global workforce as of

April 1, 2017

) are represented by internal works councils.  We have never experienced any work stoppage, and we believe that our current employee relations are good.

Environmental Matters

By virtue of operating our wafer fabrication facilities, we are subject to a variety of extensive and changing domestic and international federal, state and local governmental laws, regulations and ordinances related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in the manufacturing process.  We provide our own manufacturing waste water treatment and disposal for most of our manufacturing facilities and we have contracted for the disposal of hazardous waste.  State agencies require us to report usage of environmentally hazardous materials, and we have retained appropriate personnel to help ensure compliance with all applicable environmental regulations.  We believe that costs arising from existing environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

We are an ISO 14001 certified manufacturer with a comprehensive Environmental Management System (“EMS”) in place in order to help ensure control of the environmental aspects of the manufacturing process.  Our EMS mandates compliance and establishes appropriate checks and balances to minimize the potential for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

We actively monitor the hazardous materials that are used in the manufacture, assembly and testing of our products, particularly materials that are retained in the final product.  We have developed specific restrictions on the content of certain hazardous materials in our products, as well as those of our suppliers and outsourced manufacturers and subcontractors.  This helps to ensure that our products are compliant with the requirements of the markets into which the products will be sold.  For example, our products are compliant with the European Union RoHS Directive (2011/65/EU on the Restriction of Use of Hazardous Substances), which prohibits the sale in the European Union market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing certain families of substances above a specified threshold.

We do not currently anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in fiscal

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS.

Our operating results fluctuate.

Our revenue, earnings, margins and other operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future.  If demand for our products fluctuates as a result of economic conditions or for other reasons, our revenue and profitability could be impacted.  Our future operating results will depend on many factors, including the following:

•

business, political and macroeconomic changes, including downturns in the semiconductor industry and the overall global economy;

•

changes in consumer confidence caused by many factors, including changes in interest rates, credit markets, expectations for inflation, unemployment levels, and energy or other commodity prices;

•

fluctuations in demand for our customers’ products;

•

our ability to predict customer demand accurately to limit obsolete inventory, which would reduce our margins;

•

the ability of third-party foundries and other third-party suppliers to manufacture, assemble and test our products in a timely and cost-effective manner;

•

our customers’ and distributors’ ability to manage the inventory that they hold and to forecast accurately their demand for our products;

•

our ability to achieve cost savings and improve yields and margins on our new and existing products; and

•

our ability to utilize our capacity efficiently or acquire additional capacity in response to customer demand.

It is likely that our future operating results could be adversely affected by one or more of the factors set forth above or other similar factors.  If our future operating results are below the expectations of stock market analysts or our investors, our stock price may decline.



Our operating results are substantially dependent on development of new products and achieving design wins as our industry’s technology changes rapidly.

Our markets are characterized by the frequent introduction of new products in response to evolving product and process technologies and consumer demand for greater functionality, lower costs, smaller products and better performance.  Historically, the average selling prices of many of our products have decreased over the products’ lives and we have experienced, and expect to experience in the future, some product design obsolescence.  To offset these average selling price decreases and to meet our customers’ demands for reductions in cost and improvements in technology, we must achieve yield improvements and other cost reductions for existing products, and introduce new products that are competitive and can be manufactured at lower costs or that command higher prices based on superior performance.

Our future success is dependent on our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely and cost-effective manner and secure production orders from our customers.  The development of new products is a highly complex process, and we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products at times in the past.  Our successful product development depends on a number of factors, including the following:

•

our ability to predict market requirements and define and design new products that address those requirements;

•

our ability to design products that meet our customers’ cost, size and performance requirements;

•

acceptance of our new product designs;

•

the availability of qualified product design engineers;

•

our timely completion of product designs and ramp up of new products according to our customers’ needs with acceptable manufacturing yields; and

•

market acceptance of our customers’ products and the duration of the life cycle of such products.

We may not be able to design and introduce new products in a timely or cost-efficient manner, and our new products may fail to meet market or customer requirements.  Most major product design opportunities that we pursue involve multiple competitors, and we could lose a new product design opportunity to a competitor that offers a lower cost or equal or superior performing products.  If we are unsuccessful in achieving design wins against our competitors, our revenue and operating results will be adversely affected.  Even when a design win is achieved, our success is not assured.  Design wins may require significant expenditures by us and typically precede volume revenue by six to nine months or more.  Many customers seek a second source for all major components in their devices, which can significantly reduce the revenue obtained from a design win.  The actual value of a design win to us will ultimately depend on the commercial success of our customers’ products.

We depend on a few large customers for a substantial portion of our revenue.

A substantial portion of our MP revenue comes from large purchases by a small number of customers.  Our future operating results depend on both the success of our largest customers and on our success in diversifying our products and customer base.

We typically manufacture custom products on an exclusive basis for individual customers for a negotiated period of time.  Increasingly, the largest cellular handset OEMs are releasing fewer new phone models on an annual basis, which heightens the importance of achieving design wins for these larger opportunities.  While the rewards for a design win are financially greater, competition for these projects is intense.  The concentration of our revenue with a relatively small number of customers makes us particularly dependent on factors affecting those customers.  For example, if demand for their products decreases, they may reduce their purchases of, or stop purchasing, our products and our operating results would suffer.  Most of our customers can cease incorporating our products into their products with little notice to us and with little or no penalty.  The loss of a large customer and failure to add new customers to replace lost revenue would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



We have entered into a supply arrangement with Apple to supply them with a module that combines multiple high-order multiplexers with PAs, switches, and LNAs for their 2018 smartphones, which requires a substantial R&D investment by us and obligates us to supply product to them on specified terms and build and maintain production capacity to meet these requirements.  Meeting the technical and other requirements for this project is not assured.

We have a master supply agreement with Apple under which we provide them with various RF components and modules for their smartphones and other mobile devices.  We periodically enter into statements of work under this agreement under which we agree with Apple on the terms of development and supply of specific RF components and modules.  We have entered into a statement of work with Apple under which we have agreed to supply a module that combines multiple high-order multiplexers with PAs, switches, and LNAs for certain smartphones scheduled to launch in 2018, and to secure, maintain and allocate to them sufficient manufacturing capacity to make this product.  We have also agreed to pricing based on the indicated volume of product that would be purchased by Apple under the arrangement.  In consideration for this agreement, Apple intends, but is not required, to source a specified range of its needs for this module from us, provided that we are able to meet certain development, supply, quality and other commitments. This module is highly integrated and technically complex, the development process is ongoing and meeting Apple’s engineering specifications is not assured.  We have already invested and expect to continue to invest substantial resources and capital to this development project and to build the required BAW filter manufacturing capacity.  If we fail to meet Apple’s technical performance or other requirements, our product will not be selected, and we will not generate any revenue from this project.  Even if our development efforts are successful, we may not generate the amount of revenue or the level of profitability we are forecasting from this arrangement.  Like our work on other major custom-design programs, our ability to realize a profit under this arrangement will be subject to the level of end customer demand for the smartphones into which our product is installed, and to the costs of maintaining facilities and manufacturing capacity and obtaining the materials and services required for us to perform under the arrangement.

We face risks of a loss of revenue if contracts with the U.S. government or defense and aerospace contractors are canceled or delayed or if defense spending is reduced.

We receive a portion of our revenue from the U.S. government and from prime contractors on U.S. government-sponsored programs, principally for defense and aerospace applications.  These programs are subject to delays or cancellation.  Further, spending on defense and aerospace contracts can vary significantly depending on funding from the U.S. government. We believe our government and defense and aerospace contracts have been negatively affected in the past by external factors such as sequestration and political pressure to reduce federal defense spending.  Reductions in defense and aerospace funding or the loss of a significant defense and aerospace program or contract would have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

We depend heavily on third parties.

We purchase numerous component parts, substrates and silicon-based products from external suppliers.  We also utilize third-party suppliers for numerous services, including die processing, wafer bumping, test and tape and reel.  The use of external suppliers involves a number of risks, including the possibility of material disruptions in the supply of key components and the lack of control over delivery schedules, capacity constraints, manufacturing yields, product quality and fabrication costs.

Although our key suppliers commit to us to be compliant with applicable ISO 9001 and/or TS-16949 quality standards, we have experienced quality and reliability issues in the past with certain suppliers.  Quality or reliability issues in our supply chain could negatively affect our products, our reputation and our results of operations.

We face risks related to sales through distributors.

We sell a significant portion of our products through third party distributors.  We depend on these distributors to help us create end customer demand, provide technical support and other value-added services to customers, fill customer orders, and stock our products.  We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue.  Our ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products may be limited because our end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor due to advantages in the incumbent distributors’ technical support and favorable business terms related to payments, discounts and stocking of



acceptable inventory levels.  Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure, concentration, credit risk, and compliance risks.  Other third parties may use one of our distributors to sell products that compete with our products, and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to the distributors to focus them on the sale of our products.  Our distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results.  Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws by our distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business.  Failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.

We face risks associated with the operation of our manufacturing facilities.

We operate wafer fabrication facilities in Texas, Florida, North Carolina and Oregon.  We currently use several international and domestic assembly suppliers, as well as internal assembly facilities in the U.S., China, Costa Rica, the Philippines and Germany to assemble and test our products.  We currently have our own test and tape and reel facilities located in the U.S., China, Costa Rica and the Philippines, and we also utilize contract suppliers and partners in Asia to test our products.

A number of factors will affect the future success of our facilities, including the following:

•

our ability to adjust production capacity in a timely fashion in response to changes in demand for our products;

•

the significant fixed costs of operating the facilities;

•

factory utilization rates;

•

our ability to qualify our facilities for new products and new technologies in a timely manner;

•

the availability of raw materials and the impact of the volatility of commodity pricing on raw materials, including substrates, gold, platinum and high purity source materials such as gallium, aluminum, arsenic, indium, silicon, phosphorous and palladium;

•

our manufacturing cycle times;

•

our manufacturing yields;

•

the political, regulatory and economic risks associated with our international manufacturing operations;

•

potential violations by our

i

nternational employees or third-party agents of international or U.S. laws relevant to foreign operations;

•

our ability to hire, train and manage qualified production personnel;

•

our compliance with applicable environmental and other laws and regulations; and

•

our ability to avoid prolonged periods of down-time in our facilities for any reason.

Business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs.

Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, extreme weather conditions, public health issues, military actions, acts of terrorism, political or regulatory issues and other man-made disasters or catastrophic events.  We carry commercial property damage and business interruption insurance against various risks, with limits we deem adequate for reimbursement for damage to our fixed assets and resulting disruption of our operations.  However, the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses.  Any disruptions from these events could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations and could also have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results to the



extent that losses exceed insurance recoveries and to the extent that such disruptions adversely impact our relationships with our customers.

If we experience poor manufacturing yields, our operating results may suffer.

Our products have unique designs and are fabricated using multiple semiconductor process technologies that are highly complex.  In many cases, our products are assembled in customized packages.  Many of our products consist of multiple components in a single module, and feature enhanced levels of integration and complexity.  Our customers insist that our products be designed to meet their exact specifications for quality, performance and reliability.  Our manufacturing yield is a combination of yields across the entire supply chain, including wafer fabrication, assembly and test yields.  Defects in a single component in an assembled module product can impact the yield for the entire module, which means the adverse economic impacts of an individual defect can be multiplied many times over if we fail to discover the defect before the module is assembled.  Due to the complexity of our products, we periodically experience difficulties in achieving acceptable yields and other quality issues, particularly with respect to new products.

Our customers test our products once they have been assembled into their products.  The number of usable products that result from our production process can fluctuate as a result of many factors, including:

•

design errors;

•

defects in photomasks (which are used to print circuits on a wafer);

•

minute impurities in materials used;

•

contamination of the manufacturing environment;

•

equipment failure or variations in the manufacturing processes;

•

losses from broken wafers or other human error; and

•

defects in packaging.

We constantly seek to improve our manufacturing yields.  Typically, for a given level of sales, when our yields improve, our gross margins improve, and when our yields decrease, our unit costs are higher, our margins are lower, and our operating results are adversely affected.

Costs of product defects and deviations from required specifications could include the following:

•

writing off the value of inventory;

•

disposing of products that cannot be fixed;

•

recalling products that have been shipped;

•

providing product replacements or modifications;

•

direct and indirect costs incurred by our customers in recalling their products due to defects in our products; and

•

defending against litigation.

These costs could be significant and could reduce our gross margins.  Our reputation with customers also could be damaged as a result of product defects and quality issues, and product demand could be reduced, which could harm our business and financial results.



We are subject to increased inventory risks and costs because we build our products based on forecasts provided by customers before receiving purchase orders for the products.

In order to ensure availability of our products for some of our largest customers, we start manufacturing certain products in advance of receiving purchase orders based on forecasts provided by these customers.  However, these forecasts do not represent binding purchase commitments and we do not recognize sales for these products until they are shipped to or consumed by the customer.  As a result, we incur significant inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales.  Because demand for our products may not materialize, manufacturing based on forecasts subjects us to heightened risks of higher inventory carrying costs, increased obsolescence and higher operating costs.  These inventory risks are exacerbated when our customers purchase indirectly through contract manufacturers or hold component inventory levels greater than their consumption rate because this reduces our visibility regarding the customers’ accumulated levels of inventory.  If product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to write-off inventory, which would have a negative impact on our gross margin and other operating results.

We sell certain of our products based on reference designs of platform providers, and our inability to effectively manage or maintain our evolving relationships with these companies may have an adverse effect on our business.

Platform providers are typically large companies that provide system reference designs for OEMs and ODMs that include the platform provider’s baseband and other complementary products.  A platform provider may own or control IP that gives it a strong market position for its baseband products for certain air interface standards, which provides it with significant influence and control over sales of RF products for these standards.  Platform providers historically looked to us and our competitors to provide RF products to their customers as part of the overall system design, and we competed with other RF companies to have our products included in the platform provider’s system reference design.  This market dynamic has evolved in recent years as platform providers have worked to develop more fully integrated solutions that include their own RF technologies and components.

Platform providers may be in a different business from ours or we may be their customer or direct competitor.  Accordingly, we must balance our interest in obtaining new business with competitive and other factors.  Because platform providers control the overall system reference design, if they offer competitive RF technologies or their own RF solutions as a part of their reference design and exclude our products from the design, we are at a distinct competitive disadvantage with OEMs and ODMs that are seeking a turn-key design solution, even if our products offer superior performance.  This requires us to work more closely with OEMs and ODMs to secure the design of our products in their handsets and other devices.

Our relationships with platform providers are complex and evolving, and the inability to effectively manage or maintain these relationships could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to risks from international sales and operations.

We operate globally with sales offices and R&D activities as well as manufacturing, assembly and testing facilities in multiple countries.  As a result, we are subject to regulatory, geopolitical and other risks associated with doing business outside the U.S., including:

•

global and local economic and political conditions;

•

currency controls and fluctuations;

•

tariff, trade (including import/export regulations) and other related restrictions and regulations;

•

labor market conditions and workers’ rights affecting our transportation or manufacturing arrangements or those of our customers or suppliers;

•

disruptions of capital and trading markets;



•

occurrences of geopolitical crises such as terrorist activity, armed conflict, civil or military unrest or political instability, which may disrupt manufacturing, assembly, logistics, security and communications and result in reduced demand for our products;

•

pandemics and similar major health concerns, which could adversely affect our business and our customer order patterns; and

•

restrictions on, and tax consequences associated with, repatriation of foreign earnings.

Sales to customers located outside the U.S. accounted for approximately

85%

of our revenue in fiscal


, of which approximately

62%

and

13%

were attributable to sales to customers located in China and Taiwan, respectively.  We expect that revenue from international sales to China and other markets will continue to be a significant part of our total revenue.  Any weakness in the Chinese economy could result in a decrease in demand for consumer products that contain our products, which could materially and adversely affect our business.

The majority of our foreign sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, which causes our products to become less price-competitive in countries with currencies that are low or are declining in value against the U.S. dollar.  In addition, the majority of our assembly, test and tape and reel vendors are located in Asia, and we do the majority of our business with our foreign assemblers in U.S. dollars.  We cannot be sure that our international customers and manufacturing suppliers will continue to accept orders denominated in U.S. dollars.

Economic regulation in China could adversely impact our business and results of operations.

We have a significant portion of our assembly and testing capacity in China.  In recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and wide fluctuations in the rate of inflation.  In response to these factors, the Chinese government has, from time to time, adopted measures to regulate growth and contain inflation, including measures designed to restrict credit or to control prices.  Such actions in the future, as well as other changes in Chinese laws and regulations, could increase the cost of doing business in China or decrease the demand for our products in China, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

We operate in a very competitive industry and must continue to implement innovative technologies.

We compete with several companies primarily engaged in the business of designing, manufacturing and selling RF solutions, as well as suppliers of discrete integrated circuits and modules.  In addition to our direct competitors, some of our largest customers and leading platform partners also compete with us to some extent by designing and manufacturing their own products.  Increased competition from any source could adversely affect our operating results through lower prices for our products, reduced demand for our products, losses of existing design slots with key customers and a corresponding reduction in our ability to recover development, engineering and manufacturing costs.

Many of our existing and potential competitors have entrenched market positions, historical affiliations with OEMs, considerable internal manufacturing capacity, established IP rights and substantial technological capabilities.  The semiconductor industry has experienced increased industry consolidation over the last several years, a trend we expect to continue.  Many of our existing and potential competitors may have greater financial, technical, manufacturing or marketing resources than we do.  We cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully with our competitors.



Industry overcapacity could cause us to underutilize our manufacturing facilities and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.

It is difficult to predict future demand for our products, which makes it difficult to estimate future requirements for production capacity.  Capacity expansion projects have long lead times and require capital commitments based on forecasted product trends and demand well in advance of production orders from customers.  In recent years, we have made significant capital investments to expand our BAW, SAW and TC-SAW filter capacity to address forecasted future demand patterns.

In the past, capacity additions by us and our competitors sometimes exceeded demand requirements, leading to oversupply situations.  Fluctuations in the growth rate of industry capacity relative to the growth rate in demand for our products lead to overcapacity and contribute to cyclicality in the semiconductor market.

As many of our manufacturing costs are fixed, these costs cannot be reduced in proportion to the reduced revenues experienced during periods in which we underutilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of overcapacity.  If the demand for our products is not consistent with our expectations, underutilization of our manufacturing facilities may have a material adverse effect on average selling prices, our gross margin and other operating results.

We may not be able to borrow funds under our credit facility or secure future financing.

We maintain a five-year senior credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent and a lender, and a syndicate of other lenders (the “Credit Agreement”).  The Credit Agreement includes a

$300.0 million

revolving credit facility, which includes a

$25.0 million

sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a

$10.0 million

sublimit for swing line loans.  We may request, at any time and from time to time, that the revolving credit facility be increased by an amount not to exceed

$150.0 million

.  The revolving credit facility is available to finance working capital, capital expenditures and for other corporate purposes.  This facility contains various conditions, covenants and representations with which we must be in compliance in order to borrow funds.  We cannot assure that we will be in compliance with these conditions, covenants and representations in the future when we may need to borrow funds under this facility.

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt, including our Senior Notes, or to fund capital expenditures and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our debt obligations and financing requirements, which may not be successful or on terms favorable to us.

In November 2015, we issued

$450.0 million

aggregate principal amount of

6.75%

Senior Notes due 2023 (the "2023 Notes") and

$550.0 million

aggregate principal amount of

7.00%

Senior Notes due 2025 (the "2025 Notes" and together with the 2023 Notes, the “Notes”).  In September 2016, we completed an exchange offer, in which all of the 2023 Notes and substantially all of the 2025 Notes were exchanged for new notes that have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").  Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations, including the Notes, and to fund working capital, planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts and any strategic alliances or acquisitions we may make in the future depends on our ability to generate cash in the future and on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control.  We cannot be sure that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our debt, including the Notes.  If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may face liquidity issues and be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt, including the Notes.  These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service and other obligations.  Additionally, the agreements governing our Credit Agreement and the Indenture governing the Notes limit the use of the proceeds from any disposition; as a result, we may not be allowed under these documents to use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy our debt service obligations.  Further, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.



The agreements and instruments governing our debt impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.

The Credit Agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the Indenture governing the Notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to:

•

incur additional debt;

•

pay dividends, make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our capital stock;

•

prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;

•

make loans and investments;

•

sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets;

•

incur or permit to exist certain liens;

•

enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;

•

enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and

•

consolidate, amalgamate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

These covenants could have the effect of limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete.  In addition, the Credit Agreement requires us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants.  Operating results below current levels or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in our being unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in our revolving credit facility.  If we violate covenants under the Credit Agreement and are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders, our debt under our revolving credit facility would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders.  Because of cross-default provisions in the agreements and instruments governing our debt, a default under one agreement or instrument could result in a default under, and the acceleration of, our other debt.  If our debt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it.  Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.  If our debt is in default for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of the notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.

The price of our common stock may be volatile.

The price of our common stock, which is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, has been and may continue to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations.  In addition, the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur.  Some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in the stock price or trading volume of our common stock include:

•

general market and economic and political conditions, including market conditions in the semiconductor industry;

•

actual or expected variations in quarterly operating results;

•

differences between actual operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;

•

changes in recommendations by securities analysts;

•

operations and stock performance of competitors;

•

accounting charges, including charges relating to the impairment of goodwill;



•

significant acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or by our competitors;

•

sales of our common stock, including sales by our directors and officers or significant investors;

•

recruitment or departure of key personnel; and

•

loss of key customers.

We cannot assure you that the price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future.  In addition, the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to our performance.

We may engage in future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders’ ownership and cause us to incur debt and assume contingent liabilities.

As part of our business strategy, we expect to continue to review potential acquisitions that could complement our current product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities, or that may otherwise offer growth or margin improvement opportunities.  In the event of future acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies, we could issue equity securities that would dilute our current stockholders’ ownership, incur substantial debt or other financial obligations or assume contingent liabilities.  Such actions could harm our results of operations or the price of our common stock.  Acquisitions also entail numerous other risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including:

•

unanticipated costs, capital expenditures or working capital requirements;

•

acquisition-related charges and amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles;

•

diversion of management’s attention from our business;

•

dissynergies or other harm to existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;

•

failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses, operations, products, technologies and personnel; and

•

unrealized expected synergies.

In order to compete, we must attract, retain, and motivate key employees, and our failure to do so could harm our business and our results of operations.

In order to compete effectively, we must:

•

hire and retain qualified employees;

•

continue to develop leaders for key business units and functions;

•

expand our presence in international locations and adapt to cultural norms of foreign locations; and

•

train and motivate our employee base.

Our future operating results and success depend on keeping key technical personnel and management and expanding our sales and marketing, R&D and administrative support.  We do not have employment agreements with the vast majority of our employees.  We must also continue to attract qualified personnel.  The competition for qualified personnel is intense, and the number of people with experience, particularly in RF engineering, integrated circuit and filter design, and technical marketing and support, is limited.  In addition, immigration laws may limit the pool of available talent.  We cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain skilled personnel in the future, which could harm our business and our results of operations.



We rely on our intellectual property portfolio and may not be able to successfully protect against the use of our intellectual property by third parties.

We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights.  We cannot be certain that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that patents will be issued in all countries where our products can be sold.  Further, we cannot be certain that any claims allowed from pending applications will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection against our competitors.  Our competitors may also be able to design around our patents.

The laws of some countries in which our products are developed, manufactured or sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws.  This increases the possibility of piracy of our technology and products.  Although we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology.  Additionally, our competitors may be able to independently develop non-infringing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours.

We may need to engage in legal actions to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights.  Generally, intellectual property litigation is both expensive and unpredictable.  Our involvement in intellectual property litigation could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel and have a material, adverse effect on our business.

We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights.

Our operating results may be adversely affected if third parties were to assert claims that our products infringed their patent, copyright or other intellectual property rights.  Such assertions could lead to expensive and unpredictable litigation, diverting the attention of management and technical personnel.  An unsuccessful result in any such litigation could have adverse effects on our business, which may include injunctions, exclusion orders and royalty payments to third parties.  In addition, if one of our customers or another supplier to one of our customers were found to be infringing on third-party intellectual property rights, such finding could adversely affect the demand for our products.

Security breaches and other similar disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.

We rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and other unpatented proprietary information relating to our product development and manufacturing activities.  We try to protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, strategic partners and other parties.  We also restrict access to our proprietary information.

Despite these efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our proprietary information without our authorization.  Additionally, current, departing or former employees or third parties could attempt to improperly use or access our computer systems and networks to misappropriate our proprietary information or otherwise interrupt our business.  Like others, we are also potentially subject to significant system or network disruptions, including new system implementations, computer viruses, facility access issues and energy blackouts.

From time to time, we have experienced attacks on our computer systems by unauthorized outside parties; however, we do not believe that such attacks have resulted in any material damage to our customers or us.  Because the techniques used by computer hackers and others to access or sabotage networks constantly evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate, counter or ameliorate all of these techniques.  As a result, our technologies, processes and customer information may be misappropriated and the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.  Any loss of such information could harm our competitive position, result in a loss of customer confidence in the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures, or cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the damages caused by the incident.  We routinely implement improvements to our network security safeguards and we are devoting increasing resources to the security of our information technology systems.  We cannot, however, assure that such system improvements will be sufficient to prevent or limit the damage from any future cyber-attack or network disruptions.



We also rely on third-party service providers to protect our proprietary information.  Third party service providers include foundries, assembly and test contractors, distributors and other vendors that have access to our sensitive data.  These providers should have safeguards in place to protect our data.  Failure of these parties to properly safeguard our data could also result in security breaches and loss of proprietary information.

The costs related to cyber or other security threats or computer systems disruptions typically would not be fully insured or indemnified by others.  Occurrence of any of the events described above could result in loss of competitive advantages derived from our R&D efforts or our IP.  Moreover, these events may result in the early obsolescence of our products, adversely affect our internal operations and reputation or degrade our financial results and stock price.

We are subject to warranty claims, product recalls and product liability.

From time to time, we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant expense. We may also be exposed to such claims as a result of any acquisition we may undertake in the future.  Although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance, our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims.  Conversely, in some cases, amounts we reserve may ultimately exceed our actual liability for particular claims and may need to be reversed.

Product liability insurance is subject to significant deductibles and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims, or we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. It is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing one of our devices.  In such an event, we may incur significant costs and expenses, including among others, replacement costs, contract damage claims from our customers and reputational harm.  Our customer contracts typically contain warranty and indemnification provisions, and in certain cases may also contain liquidated damages provisions, relating to product quality issues. The potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant, and in some cases, including in agreements with some of our largest customers, are potentially unlimited.  Any such liabilities may greatly exceed any revenue we receive from the relevant products.  Costs, payments or damages incurred or paid by us in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to stringent environmental, health and safety regulations.

We are subject to a broad array of United States and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations include those related to the use, transportation, storage, handling, emission, discharge and recycling or disposal of hazardous materials used in our manufacturing, assembly and testing processes.  Our failure to comply with any of these existing or future laws or regulations could result in:

•

regulatory penalties and fines;

•

legal liabilities, including financial responsibility for remedial measures if our properties are contaminated;

•

expenses to secure required permits and governmental approvals;

•

suspension or curtailment of our manufacturing, assembly and test processes; and

•

increased costs to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment or to modify our equipment, facilities or manufacturing processes to bring them into compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

Existing and future environmental laws and regulations could also impact our product designs and limit or restrict the materials or components that are included in our products.  In addition, many of our largest customers require us to comply with corporate social responsibility, or CSR, policies, which often include employment, health, safety, environmental and other requirements that exceed applicable legal requirements.  Compliance with these policies increases our operating expenses and non-compliance can adversely affect customer relationships and harm our business.



Compliance with regulations regarding the use of “conflict minerals” could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.

Regulations in the United States currently require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products, referred to as conflict minerals, originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries, or were from recycled or scrap sources.  The verification and reporting requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals that are used in the manufacture of our products.  We have incurred costs and expect to incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements.  Additionally, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement.  We may also face challenges with government regulators and our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently make any required determination that the metals used in our products are conflict free.

Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.

Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deterring, preventing or rendering more difficult a change in control of Qorvo that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.  These provisions include:

•

granting to the board of directors sole power to set the number of directors and fill any vacancy on the board of directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise;

•

the ability of the board of directors to designate and issue one or more series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, the terms of which may be determined at the sole discretion of the board of directors;

•

the inability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;

•

establishment of advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to the board of directors at stockholder meetings; and

•

the inability of stockholders to act by written consent.

In addition, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware contains provisions that regulate “business combinations” between corporations and interested stockholders who own 15% or more of the corporation’s voting stock, except under certain circumstances.  These provisions could also discourage potential acquisition proposals and delay or prevent a change in control.

These provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit of any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context, and may also make it more difficult for a third party to replace directors on our board of directors.  Further, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.

Our operating results could vary as a result of the methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies.

The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations (see “

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

” in Part II, Item 7 of this report).  Such methods, estimates and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods, estimates and judgments that could significantly affect our results of operations.

Decisions we make about the scope of our future operations could affect our future financial results.

Changes in the business environment could lead us to decide to change the scope of operations of our business, which could result in restructuring and asset impairment charges.  The amount and timing of such charges can be difficult to predict.  Factors that contribute to the amount and timing of such charges include:



•

the timing and execution of plans and programs that are subject to local labor law requirements, including consultation with appropriate work councils;

•

changes in assumptions related to severance and post-retirement costs;

•

the timing of future divestitures and the amount and type of proceeds realized from such divestitures; and

•

changes in the fair value of certain long-lived assets and goodwill.

Changes in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations.

We are subject to taxation in the U.S., China, Singapore, Germany and numerous other foreign taxing jurisdictions.  Our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuations as it is impacted by a number of factors, including the following:

•

changes in our overall profitability and the amount of profit determined to be earned and taxed in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates;

•

the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities, including those described in Note 12 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report;

•

changes in the valuation of either our gross deferred tax assets or gross deferred tax liabilities;

•

adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;

•

changes in expenses not deductible for tax purposes;

•

changes in available tax credits;

•

changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws, and changes in generally accepted accounting principles;

•

impact of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Base Erosion and Profit Shifting initiative on tax policy and enacted laws in the countries in which we operate; and

•

a future decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.

Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods.

Changes in the favorable tax status of our subsidiaries in Costa Rica and Singapore would have an adverse impact on our operating results.

Our subsidiaries in Costa Rica and Singapore have been granted tax holidays that effectively minimize our tax expense and that are expected to be effective through March 2024 and December 2021, respectively.  In their efforts to deal with budget deficits, governments around the world are focusing on increasing tax revenues through increased audits and, potentially, increased tax rates for corporations.  As part of this effort, governments continue to review their policies on granting tax holidays.  In February 2017, Singapore enacted legislation that will exclude from our existing Development and Expansion Incentive grant the benefit of the reduced tax rate for Intellectual Property income earned after June 30, 2021.  Future changes in the status of either tax holiday could have a negative effect on our net income in future years.

These and other risks and uncertainties, which are described in more detail under Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other reports and statements that we file with the SEC, could cause actual results and developments to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any of these forward-looking statements.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, our audited consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto.

OVERVIEW

Company

On February 22, 2014, RFMD and TriQuint entered into the Merger Agreement, which provided for the combination of RFMD and TriQuint in a merger of equals and resulted in the Business Combination under a new holding company named Qorvo, Inc.  The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were consummated on January 1, 2015, and as a result, TriQuint's results of operations are included in Qorvo's fiscal 2015 Consolidated Statements of Operations for the period of January 1, 2015 through March 28, 2015 (the "Post-Combination Period") and for the full fiscal years of 2017 and 2016.

For financial reporting and accounting purposes, RFMD was the acquirer of TriQuint in the Business Combination.  Unless otherwise noted, “we,” “our” or "us” in this report refers to RFMD and its subsidiaries prior to the closing of the Business Combination and to Qorvo and its subsidiaries after the closing of the Business Combination.

Business Segments

We design, develop, manufacture and market our products to leading U.S. and international OEMs and ODMs in the following operating segments:

•

Mobile Products (MP)

- MP supplies cellular RF and WiFi solutions into a variety of mobile devices, including smartphones, notebook computers, wearables, tablets, and cellular-based applications for the IoT.  Mobile device manufacturers and mobile network operators are adopting new technologies to address the growing demand for data-intensive, increasingly cloud-based, distributed applications and for mobile devices with smaller form factors, improved signal quality, less heat and longer talk and standby times.  New wireless communications standards are being deployed to utilize available spectrum more efficiently.  Carrier aggregation is being implemented, primarily in the downlink, to support wider bandwidths, increase data rates and improve network performance.  These trends increase the complexity of smartphones, require more RF content and place a premium on performance, integration, systems-level expertise, and product and technology portfolio breadth, all of which are MP strengths.  We offer a comprehensive product portfolio of BAW and SAW filters, PAs, LNAs, switches, multimode multi-band PAs and transmit modules, RF power management ICs, diversity receive modules, antenna switch modules, antenna tuning and control solutions, modules incorporating PAs and duplexers and modules incorporating switches, PAs and duplexers.

Management Summary

•

Our revenue increased

16.2%

in fiscal


to

$3,032.6 million

compared to

$2,610.7 million

in fiscal


, primarily due to higher demand for our cellular RF solutions in support of marquee smartphones and customers based in China and higher sales of our wireless infrastructure, defense and aerospace and WiFi products.

•

Our gross margin for fiscal


was

37.4%

compared to

40.2%

for fiscal


.  Gross margin was adversely impacted in fiscal 2017 by an unfavorable change in product mix towards lower margin low-band power amplifier + duplexer ("PAD") modules, product cost reductions lagging normal average selling price erosion, lower factory utilization and unfavorable inventory adjustments primarily due to lower than expected manufacturing and assembly yields on the low-band PAD modules in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.  These adverse factors were partially offset by lower intangible amortization, stock-based compensation and other costs related to the Business Combination.



•

Our operating income was

$88.1 million

in fiscal


compared to

$12.0 million

in fiscal


.  This increase was primarily due to higher gross profit from higher revenue and lower intangible amortization, stock-based compensation and other costs related to the Business Combination in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


.

•

Our net loss per diluted share was

$0.13

for fiscal


as compared to net loss per diluted share of

$0.20

for fiscal


.

•

We generated positive cash flow from operations of

$776.8 million

for fiscal


as compared to

$687.9 million

for fiscal


.  This year-over-year increase was due primarily to improvement in working capital, partially offset by lower adjustments for non-cash items.

•

Capital expenditures totaled

$552.7 million

in fiscal


, as compared to

$315.6 million

in fiscal


, with the increase primarily related to projects for increasing premium filter capacity and manufacturing cost savings initiatives.

•

During fiscal


, we recorded interest expense of

$69.9 million

(which was offset by

$13.6 million

of capitalized interest) on the $1.0 billion of senior notes that were issued in the third quarter of fiscal


.  Interest paid on these notes in fiscal


was

$71.2 million

.

•

During fiscal


, we repurchased approximately

3.7 million

shares of our common stock for approximately

$209.4 million

, as compared to

24.3 million

shares of our common stock for approximately

$1,300.0 million

during fiscal


.

•

During fiscal


and fiscal


, we recorded integration and restructuring expenses related to the Business Combination of

$18.9 million

and

$36.6 million

, respectively.  We expect these costs will continue to decline in future years.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated

The following table presents a summary of our results of operations for fiscal years


,


and


:

Revenue

Our overall revenue increased

$421.8 million

, or

16.2%

, in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


, primarily due to higher demand for our cellular RF solutions in support of marquee smartphones and customers based in China and higher sales of our wireless infrastructure, defense and aerospace and WiFi products.

Our overall revenue increased

$899.8 million

, or

52.6%

, in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


, primarily because fiscal


included only three months of TriQuint revenue.



We provided our products to our largest end customer, Apple, through sales to multiple contract manufacturers, which in the aggregate accounted for

34%

,

37%

and

32%

of total revenue in fiscal years


,


and


, respectively.  Huawei accounted for approximately

11%

,

12%

and

7%

of our total revenue in fiscal years


,


and


, respectively.  Samsung, accounted for approximately

7%

,

7%

and

14%

of our total revenue in fiscal years


,


and


, respectively.  These customers primarily purchase cellular RF and WiFi solutions offered by our MP segment for a variety of mobile devices, including smartphones, notebook computers, wearables, tablets and cellular-based applications for the IoT.  In fiscal


, Huawei was the largest customer for our IDP segment, primarily purchasing solutions for base stations, telecom transport and WiFi-enabled customer premise equipment applications.

International shipments amounted to

$2,565.5 million

in fiscal


(approximately

85%

of revenue) compared to

$2,304.4 million

in fiscal


(approximately

88%

of revenue) and

$1,395.2 million

in fiscal


(approximately

82%

of revenue).  Shipments to Asia totaled

$2,441.1 million

in fiscal


(approximately

81%

of revenue) compared to

$2,162.1 million

in fiscal


(approximately

83%

of revenue) and

$1,282.2 million

in fiscal


(approximately

75%

of revenue).  We expect our international and Asia shipments will remain relatively stable at these historical levels.

Gross Margin

Our overall gross margin for fiscal


was

37.4%

as compared to

40.2%

in fiscal


.  Gross margin was adversely impacted in fiscal


by an unfavorable change in product mix towards lower margin low-band PAD modules, product cost reductions lagging normal average selling price erosion, lower factory utilization and unfavorable inventory adjustments primarily due to lower than expected manufacturing and assembly yields on the low-band PAD modules in the second quarter of fiscal


.  The lower yield was associated with the device packaging, not device functionality; however the impact was significant because the issue was identified late in the production process.  These adverse factors were partially offset by lower intangible amortization, stock-based compensation and other costs related to the Business Combination in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


.

Our overall gross margin for fiscal


was

40.2%

as compared to

40.3%

in fiscal


.  This slight decrease was primarily due to higher cash and non-cash expenses related to the Business Combination (including intangible amortization and stock-based compensation) and average selling price erosion.  This decrease was offset by increased revenue and profitability resulting from the addition of TriQuint's operations as well as the synergies created from the Business Combination, a favorable change in product mix towards higher margin products and manufacturing and sourcing-related cost reductions.

Operating Expenses

Research and Development

In fiscal


, R&D spending increased

$22.1 million

, or

4.9%

, as compared to fiscal


, primarily driven by costs associated with the design and development of high-performance filter based products and GaN-based technologies and products.  The increased R&D expense was partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense.

In fiscal


, R&D spending increased

$191.3 million

, or

74.3%

, as compared to fiscal


, primarily due to the inclusion of TriQuint R&D expense for a full fiscal year (fiscal 2015 included only three months of TriQuint expenses) and increases in headcount and product development costs related to new mobile products.

Selling, General and Administrative

In fiscal


, selling, general and administrative expense increased

$11.5 million

, or

2.2%

, as compared to fiscal


, primarily due to higher personnel related costs, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense.

In fiscal


, selling, general, and administrative expense increased

$284.2 million

, or

113.7%

, as compared to fiscal


, primarily due to marketing-related intangible asset amortization resulting from the Business Combination and the addition of TriQuint selling, general and administrative expense for a full fiscal year (fiscal 2015 included only three months of TriQuint expenses).



Other Operating Expense

In fiscal


, other operating expense was

$31.0 million

, compared to

$54.7 million

for fiscal


.  In fiscal


, we recorded integration costs of

$16.9 million

and restructuring costs of

$2.0 million

associated with the Business Combination, as well as

$9.7 million

of start-up costs related to new processes and operations in both existing and new facilities.  In fiscal


, we recorded integration costs of

$26.5 million

, and restructuring costs of

$10.1 million

(including stock-based compensation) associated with the Business Combination, as well as

$14.1 million

of start-up costs related to new processes and operations in both existing and new facilities.

In fiscal


, other operating expense was

$59.5 million

, including acquisition costs of

$12.2 million

, integration costs of

$31.3 million

and restructuring costs of

$10.9 million

associated with the Business Combination.

Operating Income

Our overall operating income was

$88.1 million

for fiscal


as compared to

$12.0 million

for fiscal


.  This increase was primarily due to higher gross profit from higher revenue and lower intangible amortization, stock-based compensation and other costs related to the Business Combination, partially offset by lower gross margin.  Gross margin was adversely impacted primarily due to an unfavorable change in product mix towards lower margin low-band PAD modules, product cost reductions lagging normal average selling price erosion, lower factory utilization and unfavorable inventory adjustments primarily due to lower than expected manufacturing and assembly yields on the low-band PAD modules in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.

Our overall operating income was

$12.0 million

for fiscal


as compared to

$122.5 million

for fiscal


.  This decrease was primarily due to higher intangible amortization, stock-based compensation and other costs related to the Business Combination and average selling price erosion, partially offset by increased revenue and profitability resulting from the addition of TriQuint's operations as well as the synergies created from the Business Combination, a favorable change in product mix towards higher margin products and manufacturing- and sourcing-related cost reductions.

Segment Product Revenue, Operating Income and Operating Income as a Percentage of Revenue

Mobile Products

MP revenue increased

$300.7 million

, or

14.4%

, in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


primarily due to higher demand for our cellular RF solutions in support of marquee smartphones and customers based in China.

The decrease in MP operating income as a percentage of revenue in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


was primarily due to lower gross margin.  Gross margin was adversely impacted in fiscal


by an unfavorable change in product mix towards lower margin low-band PAD modules, product cost reductions lagging normal average selling price erosion, lower factory utilization, and unfavorable inventory adjustments primarily due to lower than expected manufacturing assembly yields on the low-band PAD modules in the second quarter of fiscal


.  The lower yield was associated with the device packaging, not device functionality; however the impact was significant because the issue was identified late in the production process.

MP revenue increased

$688.3 million

, or

49.3%

, in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


(primarily because fiscal 2015 included only three months of TriQuint revenue).

The decrease in MP operating income as a percentage of revenue in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


was primarily due to increased expenses related to the development of new mobile products, partially offset by higher



gross margins (resulting from a favorable change in product mix towards higher margin products and manufacturing and sourcing-related cost reductions, which were partially offset by average selling price erosion).

Infrastructure and Defense Products

IDP revenue increased

$121.1 million

, or

23.1%

, in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


primarily due to higher sales of our wireless infrastructure, defense and aerospace and WiFi products.

IDP operating income increased

$44.2 million

, or

40.8%

, in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


driven by higher gross profit from increased revenue, favorable factory utilization and lower unfavorable inventory adjustments.  This increase in gross profit was partially offset by higher personnel-related expenses.

IDP revenue increased

$210.2 million

, or

67.1%

, in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


, primarily because fiscal 2015 included only three months of TriQuint revenue.

The decrease in IDP operating income as a percentage of revenue in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


was primarily due to lower gross margins resulting from decreased demand for wireless infrastructure products during the first half of fiscal 2016.  The demand for wireless infrastructure products began to show signs of recovery in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and continued to improve in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.

See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a reconciliation of segment operating income to the consolidated operating income for fiscal years


,


and


.

OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME AND INCOME TAXES

Interest expense

We recognized

$69.9 million

and

$25.8 million

of interest expense in fiscal years


and


, respectively, related to the

$1.0 billion

of senior notes that were issued in the third quarter of fiscal 2016.  Interest expense in the preceding table for fiscal years


and


is net of capitalized interest of

$13.6 million

and

$5.2 million

, respectively.

Other (expense) income

Other expense in fiscal


of approximately

$3.1 million

was related primarily to a net loss from foreign currency.  The foreign currency loss was driven primarily by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi as well as by the changes in the local currency denominated balance sheet accounts.  In fiscal 2016 we recognized net income primarily due to a gain from the sale of equity securities.

Income tax (expense) benefit

Income tax expense for fiscal


was

$43.9 million

, which was primarily comprised of tax expense related to domestic and international operations generating pre-tax book income and an increase in gross unrecognized tax



benefits offset by tax benefits related to international operations generating pre-tax book losses and tax credits generated.  For fiscal


, this resulted in an annual effective tax rate of

160.6%

.

Income tax expense for fiscal


was

$26.0 million

, which was primarily comprised of tax expense related to international operations, an increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits and a

$25.1 million

increase in the valuation allowance against domestic state tax net operating loss and credit deferred tax assets and foreign net operating loss deferred tax assets, offset by tax benefits arising from domestic operations and tax credits generated.  For fiscal


, this resulted in an annual effective tax rate of

(908.0)%

.

Income tax benefit for fiscal


was

$75.1 million

, which was primarily comprised of tax expense related to domestic and international operations offset by tax benefits from tax credits generated and

$135.8 million

related to a decrease in the valuation allowance against domestic deferred tax assets.  For fiscal


, this resulted in an annual effective tax rate of

(61.9)%

.

A valuation allowance has been established against deferred tax assets in the taxing jurisdictions where, based upon the positive and negative evidence available, it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Realization is dependent upon generating future income in the taxing jurisdictions in which the operating loss carryovers, credit carryovers, depreciable tax basis, and other tax deferred assets exist.  Management reevaluates the ability to realize the benefit of these deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.  As of the end of fiscal years


,


and


, the valuation allowance against domestic and foreign deferred tax assets was

$33.1 million

,

$34.7 million

, and

$13.8 million

, respectively.

The valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets

decreased

by

$1.6 million

in fiscal


.  The

decrease

was comprised of a

$5.2 million

decrease in the valuation allowance for foreign deferred tax assets primarily resulting from the removal of the valuation allowance at a China subsidiary as management has determined it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized.  This was partially offset by a

$2.8 million

increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for federal foreign tax credits, state net operating losses and state tax credits, and a

$0.8 million

increase for other foreign net operating loss deferred tax assets.  At the end of fiscal 2017, a

$0.8 million

valuation allowance remained against net deferred tax assets at other foreign subsidiaries and a

$32.3 million

valuation allowance remained against domestic deferred tax assets as management has determined it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized, effectively increasing the domestic net deferred tax liabilities.

During fiscal 2017, the China subsidiary which operates as a cost plus manufacturer for another Qorvo subsidiary, exited its start-up operational phase and generated sufficient income to substantially offset the losses earned in prior years, with the balance expected to be offset by income in the first half of fiscal 2018 as production at the assembly and test facility continues to increase.

The valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets increased by

$20.9 million

in fiscal


.  The increase was comprised of a

$20.2 million

increase in the valuation allowance for state deferred tax assets for net operating losses and tax credits, a

$5.0 million

increase in the valuation allowance for foreign net operating loss deferred tax assets, and a

$4.3 million

decrease in the valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset recorded in the initial purchase price accounting for the Business Combination.  The Business Combination adjustment related to a deferred tax asset that was recorded during fiscal 2015 in the initial purchase price accounting with a full valuation allowance, but which deferred tax asset was determined in fiscal 2016 to not exist as of the acquisition date.  Accordingly, in fiscal 2016, that deferred tax asset was removed along with the offsetting deferred tax asset valuation allowance.  At the end of fiscal 2016, a

$5.2 million

valuation allowance remained against foreign net deferred tax assets and a

$29.5 million

valuation allowance remained against domestic deferred tax assets as management has determined it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized, effectively increasing the domestic net deferred tax liabilities.

During fiscal 2016, North Carolina enacted legislation to reduce the corporate income tax rate from

5%

to

4%

and phase-in over a three-year period a single sales factor apportionment methodology.  In addition, the Company underwent operational changes to leverage existing resources and capabilities of its Singapore subsidiary and consolidate operations and responsibilities associated with its foreign manufacturing operations and foreign customers in that Singapore subsidiary.  Together these changes resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of future taxable income expected to be allocated to North Carolina and other states in which the Company's net operating loss and credit carryovers exist.  As a result, it was no longer more likely than not that the deferred tax assets related to those state net operating loss and credit carryovers for which a valuation



allowance is being provided will be realized before they expire.  The foreign net operating losses relate to the China subsidiary that owns an assembly and test facility that became operational during fiscal 2016, and which has incurred start-up losses since inception.

The valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets

decreased

in fiscal


by

$129.5 million

.  The decrease was comprised of

$135.7 million

for domestic deferred tax assets for which realization was determined to be more likely than not with the increase in domestic deferred tax liabilities related to domestic amortizable intangible assets arising in connection with the Business Combination and other changes in the net deferred tax assets for foreign subsidiaries during the fiscal year, offset by an increase of

$6.2 million

related to deferred tax assets acquired in the Business Combination which are not more likely than not of being realized.  At the end of fiscal


, a

$0.2 million

valuation allowance remained against foreign net deferred tax assets and a

$13.6 million

valuation allowance remained against domestic deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized, effectively increasing the domestic net deferred tax liabilities.

As of

April 1, 2017

, we had federal loss carryovers of approximately

$202.6 million

that expire in fiscal years 2020 to 2036 if unused and state losses of approximately

$209.3 million

that expire in fiscal years 2018 to 2036 if unused.  Federal research credits of

$104.8 million

, federal foreign tax credits of

$5.0 million

, and state credits of

$57.4 million

may expire in fiscal years 2018 to 2037, 2018 to 2027, and 2018 to 2032, respectively.  Federal alternative minimum tax credits of

$3.2 million

carry forward indefinitely.  Foreign losses in China of approximately $3.3 million and in the Netherlands of approximately $55.4 million expire in fiscal year 2021 and fiscal years 2018 to 2026, respectively.  Included in the amounts above are certain net operating losses and other tax attribute assets acquired in conjunction with the GreenPeak acquisition during the current fiscal year and acquisitions of Sirenza Microdevices, Inc.; Silicon Wave, Inc.; Amalfi Semiconductor Inc.; and the Business Combination in prior years.  The utilization of these acquired domestic tax assets is subject to certain annual limitations as required under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and similar state income tax provisions.

Our gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled

$90.6 million

as of

April 1, 2017

,

$69.1 million

as of

April 2, 2016

, and

$59.4 million

as of

March 28, 2015

.  Of these amounts,

$84.4 million

(net of federal benefit of state taxes),

$64.2 million

(net of federal benefit of state taxes), and

$55.0 million

(net of federal benefit of state taxes) as of

April 1, 2017

,

April 2, 2016

, and

March 28, 2015

, respectively, represent the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate in each of the fiscal years.

It is our policy to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.  During fiscal years


,


and


, we recognized

$2.1 million

,

$1.6 million

and

$1.2 million

, respectively, of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.  Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits totaled

$7.1 million

,

$5.0 million

and

$3.4 million

as of

April 1, 2017

,

April 2, 2016

and

March 28, 2015

, respectively.  Within the next 12 months, we believe it is reasonably possible that only a minimal amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits will be reduced as a result of reductions for tax positions taken in prior years where the only uncertainty was related to the timing of the tax deduction.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") ASC 718,

“Compensation – Stock Compensation,”

stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award using an option pricing model for stock options (Black-Scholes) and market price for restricted stock units, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period.

As of

April 1, 2017

, total remaining unearned compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units and options was

$70.5 million

, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period of approximately

1.2 years

.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity.  As of

April 1, 2017

, we had working capital of approximately

$1,042.8 million

, including

$545.5 million

in cash and cash equivalents, compared to working capital of

$1,135.4 million

, including

$425.9 million

in cash and cash equivalents, as of

April 2, 2016

.

Our

$545.5 million

of total cash and cash equivalents as of

April 1, 2017

includes approximately

$318.7 million

held by our foreign subsidiaries.  If the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are needed in the U.S., we may be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate.  Our current plans are to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.

Stock Repurchase

On February 5, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to

$200.0 million

of our outstanding common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  On August 11, 2015, we announced completion of this program.

On August 11, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to

$400.0 million

of our outstanding common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  On September 10, 2015, we announced the completion of this program.

On November 5, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to

$1.0 billion

of our outstanding common stock through November 4, 2016.  On February 16, 2016, as part of the

$1.0 billion

share repurchase program, we entered into variable maturity accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") agreements (a $250.0 million collared agreement and a $250.0 million uncollared agreement) with Bank of America, N.A.  For the upfront payment of $500.0 million, in fiscal 2016, we received an aggregate of

10.0 million

shares of our common stock under the ASR agreements.  Final settlements of the ASR agreements were completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with

0.4 million

shares received resulting in a total of

10.4 million

shares of our common stock repurchased under the ASR agreements.

On November 3, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to

$500.0 million

of our outstanding stock.  Under this program, share repurchases will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  The extent to which we repurchase our shares, the number of shares and the timing of any repurchases will depend on general market conditions, regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other considerations.  The program does not require us to repurchase a minimum number of shares and does not have a fixed term, and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice.  This new program includes approximately

$150.0 million

authorized on the

$1.0 billion

repurchase program that expired November 4, 2016.

We repurchased

4.1 million

shares (inclusive of the

0.4 million

shares received in final settlement of the ASR agreement),

24.3 million

shares (inclusive of the

10.0 million

shares received under the ASR agreement) and

0.8 million

shares of our common stock during fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, at an aggregate cost of

$209.4 million

,

$1,300.0 million

and

$50.9 million

, respectively, in accordance with the share repurchase programs described above.  As of April 1, 2017,

$382.0 million

remains available for future repurchases under our current share repurchase program.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Operating activities in fiscal


provided cash of

$776.8 million

, compared to

$687.9 million

in fiscal


.  This year-over-year increase was due primarily to improvement in working capital, partially offset by lower adjustments for non-cash items.  The adjustments for non-cash items were lower due primarily to stock-based compensation expense and deferred taxes, partially offset by higher depreciation.

Operating activities in fiscal


provided cash of

$687.9 million

, compared to

$305.6 million

in fiscal


.  This year-over-year increase was due primarily to improved profitability from the addition of TriQuint's operations exclusive of non-cash Business Combination expenses.



Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal


was

$490.5 million

, compared to

$278.7 million

in fiscal


.  This increase was primarily due to higher capital expenditures related to projects for increasing premium filter capacity and manufacturing cost savings initiatives and the acquisition of GreenPeak, partially offset by higher net proceeds from available-for-sale securities.

Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal


was

$278.7 million

, compared to

$63.9 million

in fiscal


. This increase was primarily due to the Business Combination in fiscal


that accounted for an increase in cash provided by investing activities of approximately

$224.3 million

.  Additionally, there were higher capital expenditures in fiscal


compared to fiscal


, primarily related to projects for increasing premium filter capacity and manufacturing cost savings initiatives, partially offset by increased proceeds from higher net proceeds from available-for-sale securities.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal


was

$165.6 million

, compared to

$282.9 million

in fiscal


.  This decrease was primarily due to lower share repurchase activity, partially offset by lower net proceeds from borrowings.

Net cash used in financing activities in


was

$282.9 million

, compared to

$112.9 million

in fiscal


.  This increase was primarily due to the repurchase of

24.3 million

shares of our common stock for approximately

$1,300.0 million

, partially offset by the net proceeds from the issuance of our Notes of approximately

$987.8 million

.  During fiscal 2015, the remaining

$87.5 million

principal balance of our

1.00%

Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2014 was paid with cash on hand.

Our future capital requirements may differ materially from those currently anticipated and will depend on many factors, including market acceptance of and demand for our products, acquisition opportunities, technological advances and our relationships with suppliers and customers.  Based on current and projected levels of cash flow from operations, coupled with our existing cash and cash equivalents and our revolving credit facility, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet both our short-term and long-term cash requirements.  However, if there is a significant decrease in demand for our products, or in the event that growth is faster than we had anticipated, operating cash flows may be insufficient to meet our needs.  If existing resources and cash from operations are not sufficient to meet our future requirements or if we perceive conditions to be favorable, we may seek additional debt or equity financing.  We cannot be sure that any additional equity or debt financing will not be dilutive to holders of our common stock.  Further, we cannot be sure that additional equity or debt financing, if required, will be available on favorable terms, if at all.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

We do not believe that the effects of inflation had a significant impact on our revenue or operating income during fiscal years


,


and


.  Our financial results in fiscal 2018 could be adversely affected by wage and commodity price inflation (including precious metals).

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

As of

April 1, 2017

, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.



CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments (in thousands) as of

April 1, 2017

, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.

Capital Commitments

On

April 1, 2017

, we had capital commitments of approximately

$97.7 million

, primarily related to projects to increase our premium filter capacity, constructing a new office and design center, projects for manufacturing cost savings initiatives, equipment replacements and general corporate purposes.  We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 will be lower than capital expenditures in fiscal 2017.

Long-Term Debt Obligations

On November 19, 2015, we completed the offering of the Notes, which were sold in the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.  The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of November 19, 2015 (the “Indenture”), by and among the Company, our domestic subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our revolving credit facility, as guarantors (the “Guarantors”), and MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as trustee.  Interest is payable on the 2023 Notes at a rate of

6.75%

per annum and on the 2025 Notes at a rate of

7.00%

per annum.  Interest on both series of Notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, and commenced on June 1, 2016.

At any time prior to December 1, 2018, we may redeem all or part of the 2023 Notes, at a redemption price equal to their principal amount, plus a “make whole” premium as of the redemption date, and accrued and unpaid interest.  In addition, at any time prior to December 1, 2018, we may redeem up to

35%

of the original aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes with the proceeds of one or more equity offerings, at a redemption price equal to

106.75%

, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  Furthermore, at any time on or after December 1, 2018, we may redeem the 2023 Notes, in whole or in part, at once or over time, at the specified redemption prices set forth in the Indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date (subject to the rights of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

At any time prior to December 1, 2020, we may redeem all or part of the 2025 Notes, at a redemption price equal to their principal amount, plus a “make whole” premium as of the redemption date, and accrued and unpaid interest.  In addition, at any time prior to December 1, 2018, we may redeem up to

35%

of the original aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes with the proceeds of one or more equity offerings, at a redemption price equal to

107.00%

, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  Furthermore, at any time on or after December 1, 2020, we may redeem the 2025 Notes, in whole or in part, at once or over time, at the specified redemption prices set forth in the Indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date (subject to the rights of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

The Indenture contains customary events of default, including payment default, failure to provide certain notices thereunder and certain provisions related to bankruptcy events.  The Indenture also contains customary negative covenants.



In connection with the offering of the Notes, we agreed to provide the holders of the Notes with an opportunity to exchange the Notes for registered notes having terms substantially identical to the Notes. On September 19, 2016, we completed an exchange offer, in which all of the 2023 Notes and substantially all of the 2025 Notes were exchanged for new notes that have been registered under the Securities Act.

Operating Leases

We lease certain of our corporate, wafer fabrication and other facilities from multiple third-party real estate developers.  The remaining terms of these operating leases range from less than

one year

to

11 years

.  Several of these leases have renewal options of up to

two

,

ten

-year periods and several also include standard inflation escalation terms.  Several of these leases also include rent escalation, rent holidays and leasehold improvement incentives, which are recognized to expense on a straight-line basis.  The amortization period of leasehold improvements made either at the inception of the lease or during the lease term is amortized over the lesser of the remaining life of the lease term (including renewals that are reasonably assured) or the useful life of the asset.  We also lease various machinery and equipment and office equipment under non-cancelable operating leases.  The remaining terms of these operating leases range from less than

one

year to approximately

three

years.

Purchase Obligations

Our purchase obligations, totaling approximately

$215.8 million

, are primarily for the purchase of raw materials and manufacturing services that are not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet because we had not received the related goods or services as of

April 1, 2017

.

Cross-Licensing Liability

The cross-licensing liability represents payables under a cross-licensing agreement and are included in "Accrued liabilities" and "Other long-term liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

April 1, 2017

.

Deferred Compensation

Commitments for deferred compensation represents the liability under our Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the "NDCP").  The NDCP provides eligible employees and members of the Board of Directors with the opportunity to defer a specified percentage of their cash compensation.  The deferred earnings are invested at the discretion of each participating employee or director and the deferred compensation we are obligated to deliver is adjusted for increases or decreases in the deferred amount due to such investment.  The current portion and non-current portion of the deferred compensation obligation is included in "Accrued liabilities" and "Other long-term liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Other Contractual Obligations

As of

April 1, 2017

, in addition to the amounts shown in the Contractual Obligations table above, we had

$97.7 million

of unrecognized income tax benefits and accrued interest, of which

$16.6 million

had been recorded as a liability.  We are uncertain as to if, or when, such amounts may be settled.

As discussed in Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, we have two pension plans in Germany with a combined benefit obligation of approximately

$11.4 million

as of

April 1, 2017

.  Pension benefit payments are not included in the schedule above as they are not available for all periods presented.  Pension benefit payments were less than

$0.2 million

in fiscal


and are expected to be similar in fiscal


.

Credit Agreement

On April 7, 2015, we and our Guarantors entered into a five-year unsecured senior credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (in such capacity, the “Administrative Agent”), swing line lender, and



L/C issuer, and a syndicate of lenders (the “Credit Agreement”).  The Credit Agreement includes a

$300.0 million

revolving credit facility, which includes a

$25.0 million

sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a

$10.0 million

sublimit for swing line loans.  We may request, at any time and from time to time, that the revolving credit facility be increased by an amount not to exceed

$150.0 million

.  The revolving credit facility is available to finance working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes.  Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed by the Guarantors.  As of

April 1, 2017

, we have no outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement.

At our option, loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at (i) the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or (ii) the Applicable Rate plus a rate equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus

0.50%

, (b) the prime rate of the Administrative Agent, or (c) the Eurodollar Base Rate plus

1.0%

(the “Base Rate”).  All swing line loans will bear interest at a rate equal to the Applicable Rate plus the Base Rate.  The Eurodollar Base Rate is the rate per annum equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate, as published by Bloomberg, for dollar deposits for interest periods of one, two, three or six months, as selected by us.  The Applicable Rate for Eurodollar Rate loans ranges from

1.50%

per annum to

2.00%

per annum.  The Applicable Rate for Base Rate loans ranges from

0.50%

per annum to

1.00%

per annum.  Interest for Eurodollar Rate loans will be payable at the end of each applicable interest period or at three-month intervals, if such interest period exceeds three months.  Interest for Base Rate loans will be payable quarterly in arrears.  We will pay a letter of credit fee equal to the Applicable Rate multiplied by the daily amount available to be drawn under any letter of credit, a fronting fee, and any customary documentary and processing charges for any letter of credit issued under the Credit Agreement.

The Credit Agreement contains various conditions, covenants and representations with which we must be in compliance in order to borrow funds and to avoid an event of default, including financial covenants that we must maintain.  On November 12, 2015, the Credit Agreement was amended to increase the size of certain of the negative covenant baskets and the threshold for certain negative covenant incurrence-based permissions and to raise the consolidated leverage ratio test from

2.50

to

1.00

to

3.00

to

1.00

as of the end of any fiscal quarter.  We must also maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than

3.00

to

1.00

as of the end of any fiscal quarter.  As of

April 1, 2017

, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.

The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, and the occurrence of an event of default will increase the applicable rate of interest by

2.00%

and could result in the termination of commitments under the revolving credit facility, the declaration that all outstanding loans are due and payable in whole or in part and the requirement of cash collateral deposits in respect of outstanding letters of credit.  Outstanding amounts are due in full on the maturity date of April 7, 2020 (with amounts borrowed under the swing line option due in full no later than ten business days after such loan is made).

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to use judgment and estimates.  The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  The accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management.  Our critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies; however, these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective (see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report).

Inventory Reserves.

The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory.  The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons, generally 12 to 24 months.  The estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory reserves are the same as those used in our revenue forecasts and are also consistent with the estimates used in our manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions.  Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base, market conditions, and customer acceptance of our products and technologies, as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost.



Historically, inventory reserves have fluctuated as new technologies have been introduced and customers’ demand has shifted.  Inventory reserves had an impact on margins of

less than 2%

in fiscal years


,


and


.

Revenue Recognition.

Net revenue is generated principally from sales of semiconductor products.  We recognize revenue from product sales when the fundamental criteria are met, such as the time at which the title and risk and rewards of product ownership are transferred to the customer, price and terms are fixed or determinable, no significant vendor obligation exists and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.

Sales of products are generally made through either our sales force, manufacturers' representatives or through a distribution network.  Revenue from the majority of our products is recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer from a Company-owned or third-party location.  Some revenue is recognized upon receipt of the shipment by the customer.  We have limited rebate programs offering price protection to certain distributors.  These rebates represent approximately

7%

of net revenue in fiscal


and can be reasonably estimated based on specific criteria included in the rebate agreements and other known factors at the time.  We reduce revenue and record reserves for product returns and allowances for price protection, stock rotation, and scrap allowance based on historical experience or specific identification depending on the contractual terms of the arrangement.

We also recognize a portion of our net revenue through other agreements such as non-recurring engineering fees, contracts for R&D work, royalty income, intellectual property ("IP") revenue, and service revenue.  These agreements are collectively less than

1%

of consolidated revenue on an annual basis.  Revenue from these agreements is recognized when the service is completed or upon certain milestones, as provided for in the agreements.

Revenue from certain contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the costs incurred to date and the total contract amount, plus the contractual fee.  If these contracts experience cost overruns, the percentage of completion method is used to determine revenue recognition.  Revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized when the required deliverable is satisfied.

Royalty income is recognized based on a percentage of sales of the relevant product reported by licensees during the period.

In addition, we license or sell our rights to use portions of our IP portfolio, which includes certain patent rights useful in the manufacture and sales of certain products.  IP revenue recognition is dependent on the terms of each agreement.  We will recognize IP revenue (i) upon delivery of the IP and (ii) if we have no substantive future obligation to perform under the arrangement.  We will defer recognition of IP revenue where future performance obligations are required to earn the revenue or the revenue is not guaranteed.  Revenue from services is recognized during the period that the service is performed.

Accounts receivable are recorded for all revenue items listed above and do not bear interest.  We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.  In cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations subsequent to the original sale, we will record an allowance against amounts due, and thereby reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected.  For all other customers, we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due, industry and geographic concentrations, the current business environment and our historical experience.

Our terms and conditions do not give our customers a right of return associated with the original sale of our products.  However, we will authorize sales returns under certain circumstances, which include perceived quality problems, courtesy returns and like-kind exchanges.  We evaluate our estimate of returns by analyzing all types of returns and the timing of such returns in relation to the original sale.  Reserves are adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated returns versus the original sale of product.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for a business exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified

tangible and intangible assets acquired.  Intangibles are recorded when such assets are acquired by purchase or license.  The value of our intangibles, including goodwill, could be impacted by future adverse changes such as: (i) any future declines in our



operating results; (ii) a decline in the value of technology company stocks, including the value of our common stock; (iii) a prolonged or more significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the semiconductor industry; or (iv) failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results.

We account for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with the FASB's guidance, which requires annual testing for impairment or whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred.  We perform our annual impairment tests on the first day of the fourth quarter in each fiscal year.  Our i

ndefinite-lived intangible assets consist of in-process research and development ("IPRD").

We have the option to perform a qualitative assessment (commonly referred to as "step zero") to determine whether further quantitative analysis for impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets is necessary.  In performing step zero for our impairment test, we are required to make assumptions and judgments including the following:  the evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as related to our business; industry and market trends; and the overall future financial performance of our reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which they operate.  We also consider recent fair value calculations of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and reporting units as well as cost factors such as changes in raw materials, labor or other costs.  If the step zero analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived asset is less than its respective carrying value including goodwill, then we would perform an additional quantitative analysis.  For goodwill, this involves a two-step process. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit, including its goodwill, to its carrying value.  If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the second step of the process is performed to determine the amount of impairment.  The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill.  An impairment charge is recognized for the amount the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.

For indefinite-lived intangible assets, the quantitative analysis compares the carrying value of the asset to its fair value and an impairment charge is recognized for the amount its carrying value exceeds its fair value.  Determining the fair value of reporting units, indefinite-lived intangible assets and implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill is reliant upon estimated future revenues, profitability and cash flows and consideration of market factors.  Assumptions, judgments and estimates are complex, subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts.  Although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our results of operations.

Goodwill

Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the expected benefit from the synergies of the business combinations generating the underlying goodwill.  For fis

cal


, we performed a qualitative assessment of the fair value of our reporting units and as a result of our analysis, we determined that there were no indicators of impairment and no further quantitative impairment test was deemed necessary.

For fiscal


, although there were no indicators of impairment, we opted to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded to perform fair value assessments of our reporting units (the first step of the quantitative impairment analysis) as the fair value of the reporting units had changed (due to the Business Combination) since the last time we performed a quantitative analysis.  The quantitative assessments performed reaffirmed that there were no indicators of impairment for fiscal


.

In performing these quantitative assessments, consistent with our historical approach, we used both the income and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.  The income approach involves discounting future estimated cash flows.  The sum of the reporting unit cash flow projections was compared to our market capitalization in a discounted cash flow framework to calculate an overall implied internal rate of return (or discount rate) for the Company.  Our market capitalization was adjusted to a control basis assuming a reasonable control premium, which resulted in an implied



discount rate.  This implied discount rate serves as a baseline for estimating the specific discount rate for each reporting unit.

The discount rate used is the value-weighted average of our estimated cost of equity and debt (“cost of capital”) derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics.  Our weighted average cost of capital is adjusted for each reporting unit to reflect a risk factor, if necessary, for each reporting unit.  We perform sensitivity tests with respect to growth rates and discount rates used in the income approach.  We believe the income approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the respective reporting unit’s expected long-term operations and cash flow performance.

We considered historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and growth rates used in our analysis.  For fiscal


, the material assumptions used for the income approach were

eight

years of projected net cash flows and a long-term growth rate of

3%

for both the MP and IDP reporting units.  A discount rate of

15%

and

16%

was used for the MP and IDP reporting units, respectively.

In applying the market approach, valuation multiples are derived from historical and projected operating data of selected guideline companies, which are evaluated and adjusted, if necessary, based on the strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit relative to the selected guideline companies.  The valuation multiples are then applied to the appropriate historical and/or projected operating data of the reporting unit to arrive at an indication of fair value.  We believe the market approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value using multiples from companies with operations and economic characteristics similar to its reporting units. We weighted the results of the income approach and the results of the market approach at 50% each and for the MP and IDP reporting units, concluded that the fair value of the reporting units was determined to be substantially in excess of the carrying value, and as such, no further analysis was warranted.

Under the income approach, the following indicates the sensitivity of key assumptions utilized in the assessment.  A one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the fair value of the MP and IDP reporting units by approximately

$660.0 million

and

$140.0 million

, respectively, while a one percentage point increase in the discount rate would have decreased the fair value of the MP and IDP reporting units by approximately

$560.0 million

and

$110.0 million

, respectively.  A one percentage point decrease in the long-term growth rate would have decreased the fair value of the MP and IDP reporting units by approximately

$290.0 million

and

$50.0 million

, respectively, while a one percentage point increase in the long-term growth rate would have increased the fair value of the MP and IDP reporting units by approximately

$340.0 million

and

$70.0 million

, respectively.

In fiscal year 2015, we performed a qualitative assessment of our reporting units and as a result of our analysis, we determined that there were no indicators of impairment and no further quantitative impairment test was deemed necessary.

Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives

In fiscal 2015, as a result of the Business Combination, we recorded IPRD of

$470.0 million

.  IPRD was recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until t

he completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts or impairment.  The fair value of the acquired IPRD was determined based on an income approach using the "excess earnings method," which

estimated the value of the intangible assets by discounting the future projected earnings of the asset to present value as of the valuation date.  Upon completion of development, acquired IPRD assets are transferred to finite-lived intangible assets and amortized over their useful lives.  During fiscal years


and


, we completed and transferred into developed technology approximately

$220.0 million

and

$203.0 million

, respectively, of IPRD.  We performed a qualitative assessment of the remaining IPRD during fiscal


and concluded that IPRD was not impaired.



Intangible Assets

with Definite Lives

Intangible assets are recorded when such assets are acquired by purchase or license.

Finite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of technology licenses, customer relationships, developed technology, a wafer supply agreement, trade names and backlog resulting from business combinations and are subject to amortization.

Technology licenses are recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the technology or the term of the license agreement, ranging from approximately

five

to

eight

years.

The fair value of customer relationships acquired during fiscal years 2013, 2015 and 2017 was determined based on an income approach using the “with and without method," in which the value of the asset is determined by the difference in discounted cash flows of the profitability of the Company "with" the asset and the profitability of the Company "without" the asset.  Customer relationships are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, ranging from

three

to

ten

years.

The fair value of developed technology acquired during fiscal years 2013, 2015 and 2017 was determined based on an income approach using the "excess earnings method," which estimated the value of the intangible assets by discounting the future projected earnings of the asset to present value as of the valuation date.  Developed technology is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, ranging from

three

to

six

years.

The fair value of a wafer supply agreement acquired in fiscal 2013 was determined using the incremental income method, which is a discounted cash flow method within the income approach.  Under this method, the fair value was estimated by discounting to present value the additional savings from expense reductions in operations at a discount rate to reflect the risk inherent in the wafer supply agreement as well as any tax benefits.  The wafer supply agreement was amortized on a units of use activity method over its useful life of approximately

four

years and was fully amortized as of April 2, 2016.

The fair value of trade names acquired in fiscal years 2015 and 2017 was determined based on an income approach using the "relief from royalty method," in which the value of the asset is determined by discounting the future projected cash flows generated from the trade name's estimated royalties.  Trade names are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of

two

to

three

years.

The fair value of backlog acquired in fiscal 2015 was determined based on an income approach using the "excess earnings method" and was fully amortized as of April 2, 2016.

The fair value of the non-compete agreements acquired in fiscal 2017 was determined based on an income approach using the "incremental income method" over the useful life of

two

years.

We regularly review identified intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life has changed from the original estimate or that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.  If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts.  Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which the impairment determination was made.

Income Taxes.

In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense, the resultant tax liabilities, and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.

As part of our financial process, we assess on a tax jurisdictional basis the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered.  If recovery is not likely (a likelihood of less than 50 percent), the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to ultimately be recoverable.  In this process, certain relevant criteria



are evaluated including: the amount of income or loss in prior years, the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks, future expected taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.  Changes in taxable income, market conditions, U.S. or international tax laws, and other factors may change our judgment regarding whether we will be able to realize the deferred tax assets.  These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to the net deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in income tax expense which will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period when such determinations are made.  See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding changes in the valuation allowance and net deferred tax assets.

As part of our financial process, we also assess the likelihood that our tax reporting positions will ultimately be sustained.  To the extent it is determined it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all of a tax reporting position will ultimately not be recognized and sustained, a provision for unrecognized tax benefit is provided by either reducing the applicable deferred tax asset or accruing an income tax liability.  Our judgment regarding the sustainability of our tax reporting positions may change in the future due to changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors.  These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to the related deferred tax assets or accrued income tax liabilities and an accompanying reduction or increase in income tax expense which will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period when such determinations are made.  See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions and the amount of unrecognized tax benefits.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective

In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2017-04,

"Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350):  Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment."

The new guidance simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating the second step from the quantitative goodwill impairment test.  We will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary.  The new standard will become effective for us beginning in fiscal 2021 with early adoption permitted.  We do not believe it will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01,

"Business Combinations (Topic 805):  Clarifying the Definition of a Business."

The new guidance clarifies the definition of a business and provides further guidance for evaluating whether a transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of an asset or a business.  The new standard will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with early adoption permitted.  The update should be applied prospectively.  We do not believe it will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18,

"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):  Restricted Cash (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)."

The new guidance requires the inclusion of restricted cash along with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.  The new standard will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with early adoption permitted.  We do not believe it will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,

"Income Taxes (Topic 740), Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory

," which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs.  The new standard will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with early adoption permitted.  We are currently evaluating the effects this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,

"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the FASB’s Emerging Issues Task Force)."

The new guidance addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in



practice.  The new standard will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with early adoption permitted.  We do not believe it will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,

"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments."

The new guidance requires entities to use a current lifetime expected credit loss methodology to measure impairments of certain financial instruments.  It also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination.  The new standard will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 with early adoption permitted.  We do not believe it will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,

"Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."

The new guidance will simplify certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, forfeitures, classification of awards on the balance sheet and presentation on the statement of cash flows.  The new standard will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.  Upon adoption, we expect to recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to reduce our accumulated deficit and we plan to continue our existing practice of estimating expected forfeitures in determining compensation cost.  We do not believe adoption will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

"Leases (Topic 842)."

The new guidance requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term longer than 12 months, including those previously described as operating leases.  Consistent with current U.S. GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee will primarily depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease.  The new guidance will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.  We expect the valuation of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, for leases previously described as operating leases, to be the present value of our forecasted future lease commitments.  We are continuing to assess the overall impacts of the new standard, including the discount rate to be applied in these valuations.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,

"Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities."

The new standard will affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities measured under the fair value option and presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments.  In addition, the FASB clarified guidance related to the assessment of valuation allowances when recognizing deferred tax assets related to unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities.  The new standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.  We do not believe it will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,

"Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory."

The new guidance changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value.  ASU 2015-11 defines net realizable value as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs to completion, transportation, or disposal.  We will adopt the provisions of this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and we do not believe adoption will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "

Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)

," with several amendments subsequently issued.  This new standard provides an updated framework for revenue recognition, resulting in a single revenue model to be applied by reporting companies under U.S. GAAP.  Under the new model, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  Additional disclosures will be required regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows.  The new guidance will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and permits the use of either a retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach, whereby the cumulative effect of adoption is recognized at the date of initial application.  We have established a cross-functional team to assess the potential impact of the new revenue standard and our assessment will be completed during fiscal 2018.  Our assessment process consists of reviewing our current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that may result from applying the requirements of the new standard to our revenue contracts and identifying appropriate changes to our business processes, systems and controls to support revenue recognition



and disclosure requirements under the new standard.  We currently anticipate adopting the standard using the modified retrospective approach.

Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05

, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement

" which provides additional guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.  Under this guidance, if a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license, customers should account for the license element of the arrangement in a manner consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses.  If the arrangement does not contain a software license, customers should account for the arrangement as a service contract.  We adopted the provisions of this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and there was no impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,

"Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments."

This standard requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  The effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects, as a result of the change in provisional amounts, are to be included in the same period’s financial statements, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  The amendments in this update became effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and will be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur in the future.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

Financial Risk Management

We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices.  The overall objective of our financial risk management program is to seek a reduction in the potential negative earnings effects from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices arising from our business activities.  We manage these financial exposures through operational means and by using various financial instruments.  These practices may change as economic conditions change.

Interest Rates

The Credit Agreement includes a

$300.0 million

revolving credit facility, which includes a

$25.0 million

sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a

$10.0 million

sublimit for swing line loans.  We may request, at any time and from time to time, that the revolving credit facility be increased by an amount not to exceed

$150.0 million

.  The interest rates on this facility are variable; however, since we have no outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement, there is no interest rate risk related to this facility as of

April 1, 2017

.

Currency Exchange Rates

As a global company, our results are affected by movements in currency exchange rates.  Our exposure may increase or decrease over time as our foreign business levels fluctuate in the countries where we have operations, and these changes could have a material impact on our financial results.  The functional currency for most of our international operations is the U.S. dollar.  We have foreign operations in Asia, Europe and Costa Rica, and a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales to customers outside the U.S.  Our international revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.  Operating expenses and certain working capital items related to our foreign-based operations are, in some instances, denominated in the local foreign currencies and therefore are affected by changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate in relation to foreign currencies, such as the Renminbi, Euro, Pound Sterling, Costa Rican Colon, and Yen.  If the U.S. dollar weakens compared to the Renminbi, Euro, Pound Sterling, Costa Rican Colon, Yen and other currencies, our operating expenses for foreign operations will be higher when remeasured back into U.S. dollars.  We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means.

For fiscal


, we incurred a foreign currency loss of

$3.2 million

as compared to a loss of

$0.7 million

in fiscal


, which is recorded in “Other (expense) income.”



Our financial instrument holdings, including foreign receivables, cash and payables at

April 1, 2017

, were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes.  In this sensitivity analysis, we assumed that the change in one currency's rate relative to the U.S. dollar would not have an effect on other currencies' rates relative to the U.S. dollar.  All other factors were held constant.  If the U.S. dollar declined in value 10% in relation to the re-measured foreign currency instruments, our net income would have

increased

by approximately

$1.9 million

.  If the U.S. dollar increased in value 10% in relation to the re-measured foreign currency instruments, our net income would have

decreased

by approximately

$1.6 million

.

Commodity Prices

We routinely use precious metals in the manufacture of our products.  Supplies for such commodities may from time to time become restricted, or general market factors and conditions may affect the pricing of such commodities.  We also have an active reclamation process to capture any unused gold.  While we continue to attempt to mitigate the risk of similar increases in commodities-related costs, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully safeguard against potential short-term and long-term commodity price fluctuations.

THE COMPANY AND ITS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

On February 22, 2014, RF Micro Devices, Inc. ("RFMD" and referred to herein as the "Company" prior to January 1, 2015) and TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc. ("TriQuint") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (as subsequently amended on July 15, 2014, the "Merger Agreement") providing for the business combination of RFMD and TriQuint (the "Business Combination") under a new holding company named Qorvo, Inc. (formerly named Rocky Holding, Inc.) ("Qorvo" and referred to herein as the "Company" as of and following January 1, 2015).  The stockholders of both RFMD and TriQuint approved the Merger Agreement at each company's special meeting of stockholders on September 5, 2014.  During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, all necessary regulatory approvals were received to complete the Business Combination.  The Business Combination closed on January 1, 2015 (fourth quarter of fiscal 2015).  For financial reporting and accounting purposes, RFMD was the acquirer of TriQuint.  The results presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect those of RFMD prior to the completion of the Business Combination on January 1, 2015 and those of Qorvo subsequent to the completion of the Business Combination.

The Company is a product and technology leader at the forefront of the growing global demand for always-on broadband connectivity.  The Company combines a broad portfolio of radio frequency (“RF”) solutions, highly differentiated semiconductor technologies, deep systems-level expertise and scale manufacturing to supply a diverse group of customers in expanding markets, including smartphones and other mobile devices, defense and aerospace, WiFi customer premises equipment, cellular base stations, optical networks, automotive connectivity, and smart home applications.  Within these markets, the Company's products enable a broad range of leading-edge applications - from very-high-power wired and wireless infrastructure solutions to ultra-low-power smart home solutions.  The Company's products and technologies help transform how people around the world access their data, transact commerce, and interact with their communities.

The Company’s design and manufacturing expertise covers many semiconductor process technologies, which it sources both internally and through external suppliers.  The Company’s primary wafer fabrication facilities are located in Texas, Florida, North Carolina and Oregon and its primary assembly and test facilities are located in China, Costa Rica, Germany and Texas.  The Company operates design, sales and manufacturing facilities throughout Asia, Europe and North America.

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Certain items in the fiscal 2016 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2017 presentation.

The results of operations, assets and liabilities associated with the Business Combination have been included in the Company's financial statements from the acquisition date of January 1, 2015 (see Note 6).

Accounting Periods

The Company uses a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to March 31 of each year.  The most recent three fiscal years ended on

April 1, 2017

,

April 2, 2016

, and

March 28, 2015

.  Fiscal years 2017 and 2015 were 52-week years and fiscal year 2016 was a 53-week year.



Qorvo, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  The actual results that the Company experiences may differ materially from its estimates.  The Company makes estimates for the returns reserve, rebates, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation including reserves, warranty reserves, income tax valuation, current and deferred income taxes, uncertain tax positions, non-marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary impairments of investments, goodwill, long-lived assets and other financial statement amounts on a regular basis and makes adjustments based on historical experiences and expected future conditions.  Accounting estimates require difficult and subjective judgments and actual results may differ from the Company’s estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposit accounts, money market funds, and other temporary, highly-liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased.

Investments

Investments available-for-sale at

April 1, 2017

consisted of auction rate securities ("ARS").  Investments available-for-sale at

April 2, 2016

consisted of U.S. government/agency securities, corporate debt and ARS.  Available-for-sale investments with an original maturity date greater than approximately

three months

and less than

one year

are classified as current investments.  Available-for-sale investments with an original maturity date exceeding

one year

are classified as long-term.

Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in “Other comprehensive (loss) income.”  The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method and any realized gain or loss is included in “Other (expense) income.”  The cost of available-for-sale securities is adjusted for premiums and discounts, with the amortization or accretion of such amounts included as a portion of interest.

The Company assesses individual investments for impairment quarterly.  Investments are impaired when the fair value is less than the amortized cost.  If an investment is impaired, the Company evaluates whether the impairment is other-than-temporary.  A debt investment impairment is considered other-than-temporary if (i) the Company intends to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security (a credit loss).  Other-than-temporary declines in the Company's debt securities are recognized as a loss in the statement of operations if due to credit loss; all other losses on debt securities are recorded in "Other comprehensive (loss) income."  The previous amortized cost basis less the other-than-temporary impairment becomes the new cost basis and is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market based on standard costs, which approximate actual average costs.  The Company’s business is subject to the risk of technological and design changes.  The Company evaluates inventory levels quarterly against sales forecasts on a product family basis to evaluate its overall inventory risk.  Reserves are adjusted to reflect inventory values in excess of forecasted sales and management's analysis and assessment of overall inventory risk.  In the event the Company sells inventory that had been covered by a specific inventory reserve, the sale is recorded at the actual selling price and the related cost of goods sold is recorded at the full inventory cost, net of the reserve.  Abnormal production levels are charged to the income statement in the period incurred rather than as a portion of inventory cost.



Qorvo, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Product Warranty

The Company generally sells products with a limited warranty on product quality.  The Company accrues for known warranty issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and accrues for estimated incurred but unidentified issues based on historical activity.  The accrual and the related expense for known product warranty issues were not significant during the periods presented.  Due to product testing and the short time typically between product shipment and the detection and correction of product failures and the historical rate of losses, the accrual and related expense for estimated incurred but unidentified issues was not significant during the periods presented.

Other Receivables

The Company records miscellaneous non-product receivables that are collectible within 12 months in “Other receivables,” such as value-added tax receivables (

$55.4 million

as of

April 1, 2017

and

$37.3 million

as of

April 2, 2016

, which are reported on a net basis), precious metal reclaims submitted for payment and other miscellaneous items.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from

one year

to

thirty-nine years

.  The Company’s assets acquired under capital leases and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset life or lease term (which is reasonably assured) and included in depreciation.

The Company performs a review if facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable or that useful lives have changed from the original estimate.  The Company assesses the recoverability of the assets held for use by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts.  Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets.  If the Company determines that the useful lives have changed from the original estimate, the net book value of the assets is depreciated over the remaining period of the new useful lives.  The Company identifies property and equipment as “held for sale” based on the current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed.  Once assets are classified to the held for sale category, depreciation ceases and the assets are recorded at the lesser of their carrying value or their fair market value less costs to sell.

The Company capitalizes the portion of the interest expense related to certain assets that are not ready for their intended use and this amount is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the qualified assets.  The Company additionally records capital-related government grants earned as a reduction to property and equipment and depreciates such grants over the estimated useful lives of the associated assets.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for a business exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified

tangible and intangible assets acquired.  Intangibles are recorded when such assets are acquired by purchase or license.  The value of the Company's intangibles, including goodwill, could be impacted by future adverse changes such as: (i) any future declines in the Company's operating results; (ii) a decline in the value of technology company stocks, including the value of the Company's common stock; (iii) a prolonged or more significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the semiconductor industry; or (iv) failure to meet the performance projections included in the Company's forecasts of future operating results.

The Company accounts for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") guidance, which requires annual testing for impairment or whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred.  The Company performs its annual impairment tests on the first day of the fourth quarter in each fiscal year.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of in-process research and development ("IPRD").



Qorvo, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment (commonly referred to as "step zero") to determine whether further quantitative analysis for impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets is necessary.  In performing step zero for its impairment test, the Company is required to make assumptions and judgments, including the following:  the evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as related to the Company's business; industry and market trends; and the overall future financial performance of the Company's reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which they operate.  The Company also considers recent fair value calculations of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and reporting units as well as cost factors such as changes in raw materials, labor or other costs.  If the step zero analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived asset is less than its respective carrying value including goodwill, then the Company would perform an additional quantitative analysis.  For goodwill, this involves a two-step process.  The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit, including its goodwill, to its carrying value.  If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the second step of the process is performed to determine the amount of impairment.  The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill.  An impairment charge is recognized for the amount the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.

For indefinite-lived intangible assets, the quantitative analysis compares the carrying value of the asset to its fair value and an impairment charge is recognized for the amount its carrying value exceeds its fair value.  Determining the fair value of reporting units, indefinite-lived intangible assets and implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill is reliant upon estimated future revenues, profitability and cash flows and consideration of market factors.  Assumptions, judgments and estimates are complex, subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in the Company's business strategy or its internal forecasts.  Although the Company believes the assumptions, judgments and estimates  it has made have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect its results of operations.

Goodwill

Goodwill is allocated to the Company's reporting units based on the expected benefit from the synergies of the business combinations generating the underlying goodwill.  As of

April 1, 2017

, the Company's goodwill balance of

$2,173.9 million

is allocated between its Mobile Products ("MP") and Infrastructure and Defense Products ("IDP") reporting units.

In fiscal


, the Company completed a qualitative assessment of the fair value of its reporting units and concluded that goodwill was not impaired.

For fiscal


, although there were no indicators of impairment, the Company opted to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded to perform fair value assessments of its reporting units (the first step of the quantitative impairment analysis) as the fair value of the reporting units had changed (due to the Business Combination) since the last time the Company performed a quantitative analysis.  The quantitative assessments performed reaffirmed that there were no indicators of impairment for fiscal 2016.

In performing these quantitative assessments, consistent with its historical approach, the Company used both the income and market approaches to estimate the fair value of its reporting units.  The income approach involves discounting future estimated cash flows.  The sum of the reporting unit cash flow projections was compared to the Company's market capitalization in a discounted cash flow framework to calculate an overall implied internal rate of return (or discount rate) for the Company.  The Company's market capitalization was adjusted to a control basis assuming a reasonable control premium, which resulted in an implied discount rate.  This implied discount rate serves as a baseline for estimating the specific discount rate for each reporting unit.

The discount rate used is the value-weighted average of the Company's estimated cost of equity and debt (“cost of capital”) derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics.  The Company's weighted average cost of capital is adjusted for each reporting unit to reflect a risk factor, if necessary, for each reporting unit.  The Company performs sensitivity tests with respect to growth rates and discount rates used in the income approach.  The Company believes the income approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the respective reporting unit’s expected long-term operations and cash flow performance.



Qorvo, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

The Company considered historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and growth rates used in its analysis.  For fiscal


, the material assumptions used for the income approach were

eight

years of projected net cash flows and a long-term growth rate of

3%

for both the MP and IDP reporting units.  A discount rate of

15%

and

16%

was used for the MP and IDP reporting units, respectively.

In applying the market approach, valuation multiples are derived from historical and projected operating data of selected guideline companies, which are evaluated and adjusted, if necessary, based on the strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit relative to the selected guideline companies.  The valuation multiples are then applied to the appropriate historical and/or projected operating data of the reporting unit to arrive at an indication of fair value.  The Company believes the market approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value using multiples from companies with operations and economic characteristics similar to its reporting units.  The Company weighted the results of the income approach and the results of the market approach at 50% each and for the MP and IDP reporting units, concluded that the fair value of the reporting units was determined to be substantially in excess of the carrying value, and as such, no further analysis was warranted.

Under the income approach described above, the following indicates the sensitivity of key assumptions utilized in the assessment.  A one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the fair value of the MP and IDP reporting units by approximately

$660.0 million

and

$140.0 million

, respectively, while a one percentage point increase in the discount rate would have decreased the fair value of the MP and IDP reporting units by approximately

$560.0 million

and

$110.0 million

, respectively.  A one percentage point decrease in the long-term growth rate would have decreased the fair value of the MP and IDP reporting units by approximately

$290.0 million

and

$50.0 million

, respectively, while a one percentage point increase in the long-term growth rate would have increased the fair value of the MP and IDP reporting units by approximately

$340.0 million

and

$70.0 million

, respectively.

In fiscal year 2015, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of its reporting units and as a result of this analysis, determined that there were no indicators of impairment and no further quantitative impairment test was deemed necessary.

Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives

In fiscal 2015, as a result of the Business Combination, the Company recorded IPRD of

$470.0 million

.  IPRD was recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until t

he completion or abandonment of the associated research and development ("R&D") efforts or impairment.  The fair value of the acquired IPRD was determined based on an income approach using the "excess earnings method," which

estimated the value of the intangible assets by discounting the future projected earnings of the asset to present value as of the valuation date.  Upon completion of development, acquired IPRD assets are transferred to finite-lived intangible assets and amortized over their useful lives.  During fiscal years


and


, the Company completed and transferred into developed technology approximately

$220.0 million

and

$203.0 million

, respectively, of IPRD.  The Company performed a qualitative assessment of the remaining IPRD during fiscal


and concluded that IPRD was not impaired.

Intangible Assets

with Definite Lives

Intangible assets are recorded when such assets are acquired by purchase or license.

Finite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of technology licenses, customer relationships, developed technology, a wafer supply agreement, trade names and backlog resulting from business combinations and are subject to amortization.

Technology licenses are recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the technology or the term of the license agreement, ranging from approximately

five

to

eight

years.

The fair value of customer relationships acquired during fiscal years 2013, 2015 and 2017 was determined based on an income approach using the “with and without method," in which the value of the asset is determined by the difference in discounted cash flows of the profitability of the Company "with" the asset and the profitability of the Company "without" the asset.  Customer relationships are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, ranging from

three

to

ten

years.



Qorvo, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

The fair value of developed technology acquired during fiscal years 2013, 2015 and 2017 was determined based on an income approach using the "excess earnings method," which estimated the value of the intangible assets by discounting the future projected earnings of the asset to present value as of the valuation date.  Developed technology is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, ranging from

three

to

six

years.

The fair value of the wafer supply agreement was determined using the incremental income method, which is a discounted cash flow method within the income approach.  Under this method, the fair value was estimated by discounting to present value the additional savings from expense reductions in operations at a discount rate to reflect the risk inherent in the wafer supply agreement as well as any tax benefits.  The wafer supply agreement was amortized on a units of use activity method over its useful life of approximately

four

years and was fully amortized as of April 2, 2016.

The fair value of trade names acquired in fiscal years 2015 and 2017 was determined based on an income approach using the "relief from royalty method," in which the value of the asset is determined by discounting the future projected cash flows generated from the trade name's estimated royalties.  Trade names are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of

two

to

three

years.

The fair value of backlog acquired in fiscal 2015 was determined based on an income approach using the "excess earnings method" and was fully amortized as of April 2, 2016.

The Company regularly reviews identified intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances indicate that the useful lives have changed from the original estimate or that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.  If such facts and circumstances exist, the Company assesses the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts.  Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which the impairment determination was made.

Accrued Liabilities

The "Accrued liabilities" balance as of

April 1, 2017

and

April 2, 2016

includes accrued compensation and benefits of

$98.7 million

and

$76.3 million

, respectively, and interest payable of

$23.2 million

and

$25.5 million

, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

The Company's net revenue is generated principally from sales of semiconductor products.  The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the fundamental criteria are met, such as the time at which the title and risk and rewards of product ownership are transferred to the customer, price and terms are fixed or determinable, no significant vendor obligation exists and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.

Sales of products are generally made through either the Company's sales force, manufacturers' representatives or through a distribution network.  Revenue from the majority of the Company's products is recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer from a Company-owned or third-party location.  Some revenue is recognized upon receipt of the shipment by the customer.  The Company has limited rebate programs offering price protection to certain distributors.  These rebates represent less than

7%

of net revenue and can be reasonably estimated based on specific criteria included in the rebate agreements and other known factors at the time.  The Company reduces revenue and records reserves for product returns and allowances for price protection, stock rotation, and scrap allowance based on historical experience or specific identification depending on the contractual terms of the arrangement.

The Company also recognizes a portion of its net revenue through other agreements such as non-recurring engineering fees, contracts for R&D work, royalty income, intellectual property ("IP") revenue, and service revenue.  These agreements are collectively less than

1%

of consolidated revenue on an annual basis.  Revenue from these



Qorvo, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

agreements is recognized when the service is completed or upon certain milestones, as provided for in the agreements.

Revenue from certain contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the costs incurred to date and the total contract amount, plus the contractual fee.  If these contracts experience cost overruns, the percentage of completion method is used to determine revenue recognition.  Revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized when the required deliverable is satisfied.

Royalty income is recognized based on a percentage of sales of the relevant product reported by licensees during the period.

The Company additionally licenses or sells its rights to use portions of its IP portfolio, which includes certain patent rights useful in the manufacture and sales of certain products.  IP revenue recognition is dependent on the terms of each agreement.  The Company will recognize IP revenue (i) upon delivery of the IP and (ii) if the Company has no substantive future obligation to perform under the arrangement.  The Company will defer recognition of IP revenue where future performance obligations are required to earn the revenue or the revenue is not guaranteed.  Revenue from services is recognized during the period that the service is performed.

Accounts receivable are recorded for all revenue items listed above and do not bear interest.  The Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.  In cases where the Company is aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations subsequent to the original sale, the Company will record an allowance against amounts due, and thereby reduce the receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes will be collected.  For all other customers, the Company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due, industry and geographic concentrations, the current business environment and the Company’s historical experience.

The Company's terms and conditions do not give its customers a right of return associated with the original sale of its products.  However, the Company will authorize sales returns under certain circumstances, which include perceived quality problems, courtesy returns and like-kind exchanges.  The Company evaluates its estimate of returns by analyzing all types of returns and the timing of such returns in relation to the original sale.  Reserves are adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated returns versus the original sale of product.

Shipping and Handling Cost

The Company recognizes amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction related to shipping and handling as revenue.  The costs incurred by the Company for shipping and handling are classified as cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Research and Development

The Company charges all R&D costs to expense as incurred.

Precious Metals Reclaim

The Company uses historical experience to estimate the amount of reclaim on precious metals used in manufacturing at the end of each period and states the reclaim value at the lower of average cost or market.  The estimated value to be received from precious metal reclaim is included in "Other current assets" and reclaims submitted for payment are included in "Other receivables" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for tax carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities for each tax jurisdiction are measured using the enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.  A valuation

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

allowance is provided against deferred tax assets to the extent the Company determines it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than

50 percent

) that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized.

A minimum recognition threshold is required to be met before the Company recognizes the benefit of an income tax position in its financial statements.  The Company’s policy is to recognize accrued interest and penalties, if incurred, on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

It is the Company’s current intent and policy to invest the earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside the U.S.  Accordingly, the Company does not record a deferred tax liability for U.S. income taxes on unremitted foreign earnings.

Stock-Based Compensation

Under FASB ASC 718,

“Compensation – Stock Compensation,"

stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award using an option pricing model for stock options (Black-Scholes) and market price for restricted stock units, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period.

As of

April 1, 2017

, total remaining unearned compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units and options was

$70.5 million

, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period of approximately

1.2 years

.

Foreign Currency Translation

The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries have been translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with FASB ASC 830, “

Foreign Currency Matters.

”  The functional currency for most of the Company’s international operations is the U.S. dollar.  The functional currency for the remainder of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the local currency.  Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rates on the balance sheet dates.  Revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates throughout the year.  Translation adjustments are shown separately as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within “Stockholders’ equity” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Foreign currency transaction gains or losses (transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency) are reported in “Other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective

In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2017-04,

"Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350):  Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment."

The new guidance simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating the second step from the quantitative goodwill impairment test.  The Company will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary.  The new standard will become effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2021 with early adoption permitted.  The Company does not believe it will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01,

"Business Combinations (Topic 805):  Clarifying the Definition of a Business."

The new guidance clarifies the definition of a business and provides further guidance for evaluating whether a transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of an asset or a business.  The new standard will become effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with early adoption permitted.  The update should be applied prospectively.  The Company does not believe it will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18,

"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):  Restricted Cash (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)."

The new guidance requires the inclusion of restricted cash along with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

shown on the statement of cash flows.  The new standard will become effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with early adoption permitted.  The Company does not believe it will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,

"Income Taxes (Topic 740), Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory

," which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs.  The new standard will become effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the effects this new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,

"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the FASB’s Emerging Issues Task Force)."

The new guidance addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.  The new standard will become effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with early adoption permitted.  The Company does not believe it will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,

"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments."

The new guidance requires entities to use a current lifetime expected credit loss methodology to measure impairments of certain financial instruments.  It also modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination.  The new standard will become effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 with early adoption permitted.  The Company does not believe it will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,

"Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."

The new guidance will simplify certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, forfeitures, classification of awards on the balance sheet and presentation on the statement of cash flows.  The new standard will become effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.  Upon adoption, the Company expects to recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to reduce the Company's accumulated deficit and plans to continue its existing practice of estimating expected forfeitures in determining compensation cost.  The Company does not believe adoption will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

"Leases (Topic 842)."

The new guidance requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term longer than 12 months, including those previously described as operating leases.  Consistent with current U.S. GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee will primarily depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease.  The new guidance will become effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.  The Company expects the valuation of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, for leases previously described as operating leases, to be the present value of its forecasted future lease commitments.  The Company is continuing to assess the overall impacts of the new standard, including the discount rate to be applied in these valuations.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,

"Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities."

This new standard will affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities measured under the fair value option and presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments.  In addition, the FASB clarified guidance related to the assessment of valuation allowances when recognizing deferred tax assets related to unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities.  The new standard is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.  The Company does not believe it will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,

"Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory."

The new guidance changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value.  ASU 2015-11 defines net realizable value as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs to completion, transportation, or disposal.  The Company will

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

adopt the provisions of this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and does not believe adoption will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "

Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)

," with several amendments subsequently issued.  This new standard provides an updated framework for revenue recognition, resulting in a single revenue model to be applied by reporting companies under U.S. GAAP.  Under the new model, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  Additional disclosures will be required regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows.  The new guidance will become effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and permits the use of either a retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach, whereby the cumulative effect of adoption is recognized at the date of initial application.  The Company has established a cross-functional team to assess the potential impact of the new revenue standard and its assessment will be completed during fiscal 2018.  The Company's assessment process consists of reviewing its current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that may result from applying the requirements of the new standard to its revenue contracts and identifying appropriate changes to its business processes, systems and controls to support revenue recognition and disclosure requirements under the new standard.  The Company currently anticipates adopting the standard using the modified retrospective approach.

Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05

, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement

" which provides additional guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.  Under this guidance, if a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license, customers should account for the license element of the arrangement in a manner consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses.  If the arrangement does not contain a software license, customers should account for the arrangement as a service contract.  The Company adopted the provisions of this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and there was no impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,

"Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments."

This standard requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  The effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects, as a result of the change in provisional amounts, are to be included in the same period’s financial statements, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  The amendments in this update became effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and will be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur in the future.

2.    CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

The Company’s principal financial instrument subject to potential concentration of credit risk is accounts receivable, which is unsecured.  The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to estimated losses expected to be incurred in the collection of accounts receivable.  The Company has adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk and it believes that credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of its major customers, conservative payment terms and the Company’s strict credit policies.

Revenue from significant customers, those representing 10% or more of total revenue for the respective periods, are summarized as follows:

The acquisition expanded the Company's offerings to include integrated RF solutions and systems-on-a-chip ("SoCs") for the connected home.  The Company acquired 100% of the outstanding equity securities of GreenPeak for a purchase price of

$118.1 million

, net of cash acquired of

$0.7 million

.  The total purchase price was allocated to GreenPeak's assets and liabilities based upon fair values as determined by the Company and resulted in goodwill of

$38.2 million

.  The measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date pursuant to ASC Topic 805

"Business Combinations"

) will conclude during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Business Combination between RFMD and TriQuint

Effective January 1, 2015, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, RFMD and TriQuint completed a strategic combination of their respective businesses through the “merger of equals” Business Combination.

Based on an evaluation of the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 805, “

Business Combinations

,” RFMD was determined to be the acquirer for accounting purposes.  Under FASB ASC Topic 805, RFMD was treated as having acquired TriQuint in an all-stock transaction for an estimated total purchase price of approximately

$5,254.4 million

.  The calculation of the total purchase price was based on the outstanding shares of TriQuint common stock as of the acquisition date multiplied by the exchange ratio of

1.6749

, and the resulting shares were then adjusted by the

one-for-four

reverse stock split and multiplied by the Qorvo split-adjusted share price of

$66.36

on the date of acquisition.  The purchase price also included the fair value of replacement equity awards attributable to service prior to the closing of the Business Combination, which was estimated based on the ratio of the service period rendered as of the acquisition date to the total service period.

The initial allocation to goodwill of

$2,036.7 million

represented the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which amount was allocated to the Company's MP operating segment (

$1,745.5 million

) and IDP operating segment (

$291.2 million

).  During the measurement period (which was concluded during the third quarter of fiscal 2016), adjustments of

$3.8 million

and

$1.1 million

were made to reduce goodwill and increase property and equipment and deferred taxes, respectively.  Goodwill recognized from the Business Combination is not deductible for income tax purposes.

TriQuint's results of operations (revenue of

$259.5 million

and a net loss of

$132.5 million

) were included in the Company’s fiscal 2015 Consolidated Statements of Operations for the period of January 1, 2015 through March 28, 2015.  The net loss includes adjustments for amortization expense of the acquired intangible assets, inventory step-up, stock-based compensation related to the Business Combination and restructuring expenses.

During fiscal years


,


and 2015, the Company incurred integration costs of approximately

$16.9 million

$10.1 million

, and

$10.9 million

, respectively, associated with the Business Combination.  In addition, during fiscal 2015, the Company incurred acquisition costs of

$12.2 million

associated with the Business Combination.

The acquisition, integration and restructuring costs are being expensed as incurred and are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as "Other operating expense."  See Note 11 for further information on the restructuring.

Goodwill is allocated to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combinations generating the underlying goodwill.

The following summarizes information regarding the gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization of intangibles assets (in thousands):

The GreenPeak acquisition resulted in an increase in intangible assets of

$82.1 million

.  The more significant intangible assets acquired were developed technology of

$74.2 million

(which is being amortized over


years) and customer relationships of

$5.6 million

(which is being amortized over


years).

As a result of the Business Combination, intangible assets increased by

$2,394.0 million

.  The following summarizes the related amortization expense recognized and its geography in the Consolidated Statements of Operations (in thousands):

The IPRD acquired in the Business Combination of

$470.0 million

relates to the MP operating segment (

$350.0 million

) and the IDP operating segment (

$120.0 million

), and encompasses a broad technology portfolio of product innovations in RF applications for MP and IDP products.  These technologies include a variety of semiconductor processes in GaAs and GaN for power and switching applications and surface acoustic wave ("SAW") and bulk acoustic wave ("BAW") structures for filter applications.  Included in IPRD are continuous improvements in the process for design and

During fiscal


,

$220.0 million

of IPRD assets were completed, transferred to finite-lived intangible assets, and are being amortized over their useful lives of


years.  As of

April 1, 2017

, the IPRD remaining for the MP operating segment totaled approximately

$37.0 million

, all of which was completed and transferred to finite-lived intangible assets in April 2017.  As of

April 1, 2017

, the IPRD remaining for the IDP operating segment totaled approximately

$10.0 million

and is expected to be completed during fiscal 2019 with remaining costs to complete of approximately

$2.0 million

to

$3.0 million

.

The remaining IPRD asset is classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset that is not currently subject to amortization but is reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable.  The IPRD asset will be subject to amortization upon completion of its respective research and at the start of commercialization.  The fair value assigned to the IPRD asset was determined using the income approach based on estimates and judgments regarding risks inherent in the development process, including the likelihood of achieving technological success and market acceptance.  If the IPRD is abandoned, the acquired technology attributable to the efforts will be expensed in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Total intangible assets amortization expense was

The 2023 Notes and the 2025 Notes are traded over the counter and their fair values as of

April 1, 2017

of

$489.4 million

and

$607.8 million

, respectively (compared to carrying values of

$450.0 million

and

$550.0 million

, respectively) were estimated based upon the values of their last trade at the end of the period.  The fair values of the 2023 Notes and the 2025 Notes were

$465.8 million

and

$581.6 million

, respectively, as of

Credit Agreement

On April 7, 2015, the Company and the Guarantors entered into a five-year unsecured senior credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (in such capacity, the “Administrative Agent”), swing line lender, and L/C issuer, and a syndicate of lenders (the “Credit Agreement”).  The Credit Agreement includes a

$300.0 million

revolving credit facility, which includes a

$25.0 million

sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a

$10.0 million

sublimit for swing line loans.  The Company may request, at any time and from time to time, that the revolving credit facility be increased by an amount not to exceed

$150.0 million

.  The revolving credit facility is available to finance working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes.  The Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed by the Guarantors.  During

fiscal 2017

,



Qorvo, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility.  The Company had no outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement as of

April 1, 2017

and

April 2, 2016

.

At the Company's option, loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at (i) the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or (ii) the Applicable Rate plus a rate equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus

0.50%

, (b) the prime rate of the Administrative Agent, or (c) the Eurodollar Base Rate plus

1.0%

(the “Base Rate”).  All swing line loans will bear interest at a rate equal to the Applicable Rate plus the Base Rate.  The Eurodollar Base Rate is the rate per annum equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate, as published by Bloomberg, for dollar deposits for interest periods of one, two, three or six months, as selected by the Company.  The Applicable Rate for Eurodollar Rate loans ranges from

1.50%

per annum to

2.00%

per annum.  The Applicable Rate for Base Rate loans ranges from

0.50%

per annum to

1.00%

per annum.  Interest for Eurodollar Rate loans will be payable at the end of each applicable interest period or at three-month intervals, if such interest period exceeds three months.  Interest for Base Rate loans will be payable quarterly in arrears.  The Company will pay a letter of credit fee equal to the Applicable Rate multiplied by the daily amount available to be drawn under any letter of credit, a fronting fee, and any customary documentary and processing charges for any letter of credit issued under the Credit Agreement.

The Credit Agreement contains various conditions, covenants and representations with which the Company must be in compliance in order to borrow funds and to avoid an event of default, including financial covenants that the Company must maintain.  On November 12, 2015, the Credit Agreement was amended to increase the size of certain of the negative covenant baskets and the threshold for certain negative covenant incurrence-based permissions and to raise the consolidated leverage ratio test from

2.50

to

1.00

to

3.00

to

1.00

as of the end of any fiscal quarter.  The Company must also maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than

3.00

to

1.00

as of the end of any fiscal quarter.  As of

April 1, 2017

, the Company was in compliance with all of these covenants.

The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, and the occurrence of an event of default will increase the applicable rate of interest by

2.00%

and could result in the termination of commitments under the revolving credit facility, the declaration that all outstanding loans are due and payable in whole or in part and the requirement of cash collateral deposits in respect of outstanding letters of credit.  Outstanding amounts are due in full on the maturity date of April 7, 2020 (with amounts borrowed under the swing line option due in full no later than ten business days after such loan is made).

9.     RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company offers tax-beneficial retirement contribution plans to eligible employees in the U.S and certain other countries.  Eligible employees in certain countries outside of the U.S. are eligible to participate in stakeholder or national pension plans with differing eligibility and contributory requirements based on local and national regulations.  U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the Company's fully qualified 401(k) plan immediately upon hire.  An employee may invest pretax earnings in the 401(k) plan up to the maximum legal limits (as defined by Federal regulations).  Employer contributions to the 401(k) plan are made at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors.  Employees are immediately vested in their own contributions as well as employer matching contributions.

In total, the Company contributed

$11.5 million

,

$11.7 million

and

$6.5 million

to its domestic and foreign defined contribution plans during fiscal years


,


and


, respectively.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

As a result of the Business Combination, the Company maintains

two

qualified defined benefit pension plans for its subsidiaries located in Germany.

One

of the plans is funded through a self-paid reinsurance program with

$3.3 million

and

$3.4 million

of assets valued as of

April 1, 2017

and

April 2, 2016

, respectively.  Assets of the funded plan are included in "Other non-current assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The net periodic benefit obligations of both plans was

$11.4 million

and

$11.3 million

as of

April 1, 2017

and

April 2, 2016

, respectively, which is included in “Accrued liabilities” and “Other long-term liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The assumptions used in calculating the benefit obligations for the plans are dependent on the local economic conditions



Qorvo, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

and were measured as of

April 1, 2017

and

April 2, 2016

.  The net periodic benefit costs were approximately

$0.6 million

,

$0.8 million

and

$0.4 million

for fiscal years


,


and


, respectively.

Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan

Certain employees and members of the Board of Directors are eligible to participate in the Company's Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the "NDCP"), which was assumed, amended and restated by Qorvo on January 1, 2015 as a result of the Business Combination.  The NDCP provides eligible participants the opportunity to defer and invest a specified percentage of their cash compensation.  The NDCP is a non-qualified plan that is maintained in a rabbi trust.  The amount of compensation to be deferred by each participant is based on their own elections and is adjusted for any investment changes that the participant directs.  The deferred compensation obligation and the fair value of the investments held in the rabbi trust were

$10.2 million

and

$6.5 million

as of

April 1, 2017

and

April 2, 2016

, respectively.  The current portion of the deferred compensation obligation and fair value of the assets held in the rabbi trust were

$0.7 million

and

$0.5 million

as of

April 1, 2017

and

April 2, 2016

, respectively, and are included in "Other current assets" and "Accrued liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The non-current portion of the deferred compensation obligation and fair value of the assets held in the rabbi trust were

$9.5 million

and

$6.0 million

as of

April 1, 2017

and

April 2, 2016

, respectively, and are included in "Other non-current assets" and "Other long-term liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

10.    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

The Company leases certain of its corporate, wafer fabrication and other facilities from multiple third-party real estate developers.  The remaining terms of these operating leases range from less than

one

year to

11 years

.  Several of these leases have renewal options of up to

two

,

ten

-year periods and several also include standard inflation escalation terms.  Several of these leases also include rent escalation, rent holidays, and leasehold improvement incentives which are recognized to expense on a straight-line basis.  The amortization period of leasehold improvements made either at the inception of the lease or during the lease term is amortized over the lesser of the remaining life of the lease term (including renewals that are reasonably assured) or the useful life of the asset.  The Company also leases various machinery and equipment and office equipment under non-cancelable operating leases.  The remaining terms of these operating leases range from less than

one

year to approximately

three

years.  As of

April 1, 2017

, the total future minimum lease payments related to facility and equipment operating leases is approximately

$63.5 million

.

Minimum future lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of

April 1, 2017

, are as follows (in thousands):

Rent expense under operating leases, including facilities and equipment, was approximately

$14.8 million

,

$14.2 million

, and

$12.1 million

for fiscal years


,


and


, respectively.

Legal Matters

The Company accrues a liability for legal contingencies when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss.  The Company reviews these accruals and adjusts them to reflect ongoing negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other relevant information.  To the extent new information is obtained and the Company's views on the probable outcomes of claims, suits, assessments, investigations or legal proceedings change, changes in the Company's accrued liabilities would be recorded in the period in which such determination is made.



Qorvo, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

The Company is involved in various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of its business that have not been fully adjudicated. These actions, when finally concluded and determined, will not, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

11.    RESTRUCTURING

During fiscal years


,


and


, the Company recorded restructuring expenses (including employee termination benefits, stock-based compensation and ongoing expenses related to exited leased facilities) in "Other operating expense" of approximately

$2.1 million

,

$10.2 million

and

$12.4 million

respectively, primarily as a result of the Business Combination (see Note 6).  As of

April 1, 2017

and

April 2, 2016

, restructuring obligations relating to employee termination benefits totaled

$1.6 million

and are included in “Accrued liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  As of

April 1, 2017

and

April 2, 2016

, restructuring obligations relating to lease obligations totaled

$2.1 million

and

$2.5 million

, respectively, and are included in "Other long-term liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

12.    INCOME TAXES

Income (loss) before income taxes consists of the following components (in thousands):

The components of the income tax provision are as follows (in thousands):

(1) In fiscal


, the state deferred tax expense included a

$31.0 million

income tax expense related to an increase in the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset related to state net operating losses and tax credits.



Qorvo, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

A reconciliation of the (provision for) or benefit from income taxes to income tax (expense) or benefit computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income (loss) for fiscal years


,


and


is as follows (dollars in thousands):

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis used for income tax purposes.  The deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured in each taxing jurisdiction using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.



Qorvo, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Significant components of the Company’s net deferred income taxes are as follows (in thousands):

The Company has recorded a

$33.1 million

and a

$34.7 million

valuation allowance against the U.S. deferred tax assets and deferred tax assets at foreign subsidiaries as of

April 1, 2017

and

April 2, 2016

, respectively.  These valuation allowances were established based upon management's opinion that it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the benefit of these deferred tax assets may not be realized.  Realization is dependent upon generating future income in the taxing jurisdictions in which the operating loss carryovers, credit carryovers, depreciable tax basis and other tax deferred assets exist.  Management reevaluates the ability to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets of the Company on a quarterly basis.

The valuation allowance against deferred tax assets

decreased

by

$1.6 million

in fiscal


.  The

decrease

was comprised of a

$5.2 million

decrease in the valuation allowance for foreign deferred tax assets primarily resulting from the removal of the valuation allowance at a China manufacturing subsidiary as management has determined it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized.  This decrease was offset by a

$2.8 million

increase in the valuation allowance for federal deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits and state deferred tax assets for net operating losses and tax credits and a

$0.8 million

increase for deferred tax assets for net operating losses at other foreign subsidiaries.  At the end of fiscal 2017, a

$0.8 million

valuation allowance remained against deferred tax assets at other foreign subsidiaries and a

$32.3 million

valuation allowance remained against domestic deferred tax assets as management has determined it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized.

During fiscal 2017 the China manufacturing subsidiary, which operates as a cost plus manufacturer for another Qorvo subsidiary, exited its start-up operational phase and generated sufficient income to substantially offset the losses earned in prior years.  The balance of the cumulative pre-tax book loss is expected to be offset by income in the first half of fiscal 2018 as production at the assembly and test facility continues to increase as the Company continues to reduce its dependence on outside assembly and test subcontractors.  After evaluating the positive and negative evidence, management determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets of this China



Qorvo, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

manufacturing subsidiary would be realized and a valuation allowance would not be provided as of the end of fiscal 2017.

The valuation allowance against deferred tax assets increased by

$20.9 million

in fiscal


.  The increase was comprised of a

$20.2 million

increase in the valuation allowance for state deferred tax assets for net operating losses and tax credits, a

$5.0 million

increase in the valuation allowance for foreign net operating loss deferred tax assets, and a

$4.3 million

decrease in the valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset recorded in the initial purchase price accounting for the Business Combination.  The Business Combination adjustment related to a deferred tax asset which was recorded during fiscal 2015 in the initial purchase price accounting with a full valuation allowance, but which deferred tax asset was determined in fiscal 2016 to not exist as of the acquisition date.  Accordingly, in fiscal 2016, that deferred tax asset was removed along with the offsetting deferred tax asset valuation allowance.  At the end of fiscal 2016, a

$5.2 million

valuation allowance remained against foreign deferred tax assets and a

$29.5 million

valuation allowance remained against domestic deferred tax assets as management has determined it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will not be realized, effectively increasing the domestic net deferred tax liabilities.

During fiscal 2016, North Carolina enacted legislation to reduce the corporate income tax rate from

5%

to

4%

and phase-in over a three-year period a move to a single sales factor apportionment methodology.  In addition, the Company underwent operational changes to leverage existing resources and capabilities of its Singapore subsidiary and consolidate operations and responsibilities associated with its foreign back-end manufacturing operations and foreign customers in that Singapore subsidiary.  Together these changes result in a significant decrease in the amount of future taxable income expected to be allocated to North Carolina and other states in which the net operating loss and tax credit carryovers existed.  As a result, it was no longer more likely than not that the deferred tax assets related to those state net operating loss and tax credit carryovers for which a valuation allowance was being provided will be used before they expire.  The deferred tax asset for foreign net operating losses primarily relates to the China subsidiary which owns the internal assembly and test facility that became operational during fiscal 2016 and had incurred losses since inception.

The valuation allowance against deferred tax assets decreased by

$129.5 million

in fiscal


.  The decrease was comprised of

$135.7 million

related to domestic deferred tax assets for which realization became more likely than not with the increase in domestic deferred tax liabilities related to domestic amortizable intangible assets arising in connection with the Business Combination and other changes in the net deferred tax assets for foreign subsidiaries during the fiscal year, offset by an increase of

$6.2 million

related to deferred tax assets acquired in the Business Combination that were not more likely than not of being realized.  As of the end of fiscal 2015, a

$0.2 million

valuation allowance remained against foreign deferred tax assets and a

$13.6 million

valuation allowance remained against domestic deferred tax assets as it was more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets would not be realized, effectively increasing the domestic net deferred tax liabilities.

As of

April 1, 2017

, the Company had federal loss carryovers of approximately

$202.6 million

that expire in fiscal years 2020 to 2036 if unused and state losses of approximately

$209.3 million

that expire in fiscal years 2018 to 2036 if unused.  Federal research credits of

$104.8 million

, federal foreign tax credits of

$5.0 million

, and state credits of

$57.4 million

may expire in fiscal years


to


,


to


, and


to


, respectively.  Federal alternative minimum tax credits of

$3.2 million

will carry forward indefinitely.  Foreign losses in China of approximately

$3.3 million

and in the Netherlands of approximately

$55.4 million

expire in fiscal


and fiscal years


to


, respectively.  Included in the amounts above are certain net operating losses and other tax attribute assets acquired in conjunction with acquisitions in the current and prior years.  The utilization of acquired domestic assets is subject to certain annual limitations as required under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and similar state income tax provisions.

The Company has continued to expand its operations and increase its investments in numerous international jurisdictions.  These activities expose the Company to taxation in multiple foreign jurisdictions.  It is management's opinion that current and future undistributed foreign earnings will be permanently reinvested.  Accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes has been made thereon.  It is not practical to estimate the additional tax that would be incurred, if any, if the permanently reinvested earnings were repatriated.  At

April 1, 2017

, the Company has not provided U.S. taxes on approximately

$993.0 million

of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have been indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.



Qorvo, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

In the Business Combination, the Company acquired foreign subsidiaries with tax holiday agreements in Costa Rica and Singapore.  These tax holiday agreements have varying rates and expire in March 2024 and December 2021, respectively.  In February 2017, Singapore enacted legislation that will exclude from the Company's existing Development and Expansion Incentive grant the benefit of the reduced tax rate for intellectual property income earned after June 30, 2021.  Incentives from these countries are subject to the Company meeting certain employment and investment requirements.  Income tax expense decreased by

$2.7 million

(approximately

$0.02

per basic and diluted share impact) in fiscal


and

$8.3 million

(approximately

$0.06

per basic and diluted share impact) in fiscal


as a result of these agreements.

The Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled

$90.6 million

as of

April 1, 2017

,

$69.1 million

as of

April 2, 2016

, and

$59.4 million

as of

March 28, 2015

.  Of these amounts,

$84.4 million

(net of federal benefit of state taxes),

$64.2 million

(net of federal benefit of state taxes), and

$55.0 million

(net of federal benefit of state taxes) as of

April 1, 2017

,

April 2, 2016

, and

March 28, 2015

, respectively, represent the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate in each of the fiscal years.

A reconciliation of fiscal


through fiscal


beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):

Of the fiscal 2015 additions to tax positions in prior years,

$17.1 million

was assumed by the Company in the Business Combination and relates to positions taken on tax returns for pre-acquisition periods.

It is the Company’s policy to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.  During fiscal years


,


and


, the Company recognized

$2.1 million

,

$1.6 million

, and

$1.2 million

, respectively, of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.  Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits totaled

$7.1 million

,

$5.0 million

, and

$3.4 million

as of

April 1, 2017

,

April 2, 2016

and

March 28, 2015

, respectively.

The unrecognized tax benefits of

$90.6 million

and accrued interest and penalties of

$7.1 million

at the end of fiscal


are recorded on the balance sheet as a

$16.6 million

long-term liability, with the balance reducing the carrying value of the gross deferred tax assets.

Within the next

12 months

, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that only a minimal amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits will be reduced as a result of reductions for tax positions taken in prior years where the only uncertainty was related to the timing of the tax deduction.

Income taxes payable of

$31.7 million

and

$29.9 million

as of

April 1, 2017

and

April 2, 2016

, respectively, are included in "Other current liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

RFMD's and TriQuint's federal, North Carolina, and California tax returns for fiscal 2014 and calendar 2013, respectively, and subsequent tax years remain open for examination.  The federal tax return for the short period ended January 1, 2015 for RFMD is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service and the Singapore tax return for calendar year 2012 is currently under examination by the Singapore tax authorities.  The Company's China subsidiary in Beijing received notice in April 2017 for an audit of its calendar year 2013 through 2015 tax returns.  An examination by the German taxing authorities of the returns for calendar years 2013 through 2015 was completed during fiscal 2017 with minimal adjustments and returns for subsequent fiscal tax years remain open for examination.  The other material jurisdiction that is subject to examination by tax authorities is the U.K. (fiscal 2016

13.    NET (LOSS) INCOME PER SHARE

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, effective January 1, 2015, the Company effected a one-for-four reverse stock split of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock.  In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 4.C, all share and per share information contained in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation (included in Item 7 of this report) have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split for all periods presented.  See Note 6 for a further discussion of the Business Combination.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net (loss) income per share (in thousands, except per share data):

In the computation of diluted net loss per share for fiscal years

5.0 million

shares, respectively, were excluded because the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.  In the computation of diluted net income per share for fiscal


, less than

0.1 million

shares were excluded because the exercise price of the options was greater than the average market price of the underlying common stock and the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

The TriQuint 2013 Incentive Plan replaces the TriQuint 2012 Incentive Plan and provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights and other stock or cash awards to employees, officers, directors, consultants, agents, advisors and independent contractors of TriQuint and its subsidiaries and affiliates who were such prior to the Business Combination or who become employed by the Company or its affiliates after the closing of the Business Combination.  Former employees, officers and directors of RFMD are not eligible for awards under the TriQuint 2013 Incentive Plan.  The options granted thereunder must have an exercise price per share no less than

100%

of the fair market value per share on the date of grant.  The terms of each grant under the TriQuint 2013 Incentive Plan may not exceed

ten years

.  As of

April 1, 2017

,

2.9 million

shares were available for issuance under the TriQuint 2013 Incentive Plan.

2015 Inducement Stock Plan - Qorvo, Inc.

The 2015 Inducement Stock Plan (the "2015 Inducement Plan") provides for the grant of equity awards to persons as a material inducement to become employees of the Company or its affiliates.  The plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights and other stock-based awards.  The maximum number of shares issuable under the 2015 Inducement Plan may not exceed the sum of (a)

0.3 million

shares, plus (b) any shares of common stock (i) remaining available for issuance as of the effective date of the 2015 Inducement Stock Plan under the TriQuint 2008 Inducement Award Plan and (ii) subject to an award granted under the TriQuint 2008 Inducement Award Plan, which awards are forfeited, canceled, terminated, expire or lapse for any reason.

No

awards were made under the 2015 Inducement Plan in fiscal years 2017, 2016 or 2015.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan - Qorvo, Inc.

Effective upon closing of the Business Combination, the Company assumed the TriQuint Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"), which is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.  All regular full-time employees of the Company (including officers) and all other employees who meet the eligibility requirements of the plan may participate in the ESPP.  The ESPP provides eligible employees an opportunity to acquire the Company’s common stock at

85.0%

of the lower of the closing price per share of the Company’s common stock on the first or last day of each

six

-month purchase period.  At

April 1, 2017

,

5.1 million

shares were available for future issuance under this plan.  The Company makes no cash contributions to the ESPP, but bears the expenses of its administration.  The Company issued

0.7 million

,

0.4 million

and

0.1 million

shares under the ESPP in fiscal years


,


and


, respectively.

For fiscal years


,


and


, the primary stock-based awards and their general terms and conditions are as follows:

Stock options are granted to employees with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at the date of grant, generally vest over a

four

-year period from the grant date, and generally expire

10 years

from the grant date.  Restricted stock units granted by the Company in fiscal years


,


and


are either service-based, performance and service-based, or based on total stockholder return.  Service-based restricted stock units generally vest over a

four

-year period from the grant date.  Performance and service-based restricted stock units are earned based on Company performance of stated metrics generally during the fiscal year and, if earned, vest one-half when earned and the balance over

two

years.  Restricted stock units based on total stockholder return are earned based upon total stockholder return of the Company in comparison to the total stockholder return of a benchmark index and can be earned over

one

-,

two

- and

three

-year performance periods.  Under the 2012 Plan for fiscal 2015, stock options granted to non-employee directors (other than initial options, as described below) had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company’s stock at the date of grant, vested immediately upon grant and expire

10 years

from the grant date.  In fiscal 2017, each non-employee director was eligible to receive an annual grant of restricted stock units.

The options and restricted stock units granted to certain officers of the Company generally will, in the event of the officer's termination other than for cause and subject to the officer executing certain agreements in favor of the Company, continue to vest pursuant to the same vesting schedule as if the officer had remained an employee of the



Qorvo, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Company and as a result, these awards are expensed at grant date.  In fiscal


, stock-based compensation of

$21.0 million

was recognized upon the grant of

0.4 million

restricted share units to certain officers of the Company.

Stock-Based Compensation

Under ASC 718, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award using an option pricing model for stock options (Black-Scholes) and market price for restricted stock units, and is recognized as expense over the employee's requisite service period.

ASC 718 covers a wide range of stock-based compensation arrangements including stock options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee stock purchase plans.

Total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations was

$88.8 million

for fiscal


, net of expense capitalized into inventory.  For fiscal years


and


, the total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense recognized was

$139.5 million

and

$64.9 million

, respectively, net of expense capitalized into inventory.

A summary of activity of the Company’s director and employee stock option plans follows:

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value, based upon the Company’s closing stock price of

$68.56

as of March 31, 2017 (the last business day prior to the fiscal year end on

April 1, 2017

), that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders with in-the-money options exercised their options as of that date.  As of

April 1, 2017

, total remaining unearned compensation cost related to unvested option awards was

$3.2 million

, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period of approximately

0.8

years.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the assumptions noted in the following tables:

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal


, was

$81.0 million

.  For fiscal years


and


, the total intrinsic value of options exercised was

$74.9 million

and

$83.7 million

, respectively.



Qorvo, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Cash received from the exercise of stock options and from participation in the employee stock purchase plan (excluding accrued unremitted employee funds) was approximately

$58.0 million

for fiscal


and is reflected in cash flows from financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  The Company settles employee stock options with newly issued shares of the Company's common stock.

The Company used the implied volatility of market-traded options on the Company’s common stock for the expected volatility assumption input to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, consistent with the guidance in ASC 718.  The selection of implied volatility data to estimate expected volatility was based upon the availability of actively-traded options on the Company’s common stock and the Company’s assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future common stock price trends than historical volatility.

The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company’s history and expectation of future dividend payouts and may be subject to change in the future.  The Company has never paid a dividend.

The expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period that the stock options are expected to remain outstanding.  The Company’s method of calculating the expected term of an option is based on the assumption that all outstanding options will be exercised at the midpoint of the current date and full contractual term, combined with the average life of all options that have been exercised or canceled.  The Company believes that this method provides a better estimate of the future expected life based on analysis of historical exercise behavioral data.

The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of the Company’s employee stock options.

ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  Based upon historical pre-vesting forfeiture experience, the Company assumed an annualized forfeiture rate of

1.6%

for both stock options and restricted stock units.

The following activity has occurred with respect to restricted stock unit awards:

As of

April 1, 2017

, total remaining unearned compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units was

$67.3 million

, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period of approximately

1.3 years

.

The total fair value of restricted stock units that vested during fiscal


was

$46.1 million

, based upon the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the vesting date.  For fiscal years


and


, the total fair value of restricted stock units that vested was

$60.2 million

and

$93.5 million

, respectively.

15.    STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Stock Repurchase

On February 5, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to

$200.0 million

of the Company's outstanding common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  On August 11, 2015, the Company announced completion of this program.



Qorvo, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

On August 11, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to

$400.0 million

of the Company's outstanding common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  On September 10, 2015, the Company announced the completion of this program.

On November 5, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to

$1.0 billion

of the Company's outstanding common stock through November 4, 2016.  On February 16, 2016, as part of the

$1.0 billion

share repurchase program, the Company entered into variable maturity accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") agreements (a

$250.0 million

collared agreement and a

$250.0 million

uncollared agreement) with Bank of America, N.A.  For the upfront payment of

$500.0 million

, the Company received

3.1 million

shares of its common stock under the collared agreement (representing

50%

of the shares the Company would have repurchased assuming an average share price of

$40.78

) and

4.9 million

shares of the Company's common stock under the uncollared agreement (representing

80%

of the shares the Company would have repurchased assuming an average share price of

$40.78

).  On March 10, 2016, the Company received an additional

2.0 million

shares of its common stock under the collared agreement.  Final settlements of the ASR agreements were completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with

0.4 million

shares received resulting in a total of

10.4 million

shares of the Company's common stock repurchased under the ASR agreements.  The shares were retired in the periods they were delivered, and the upfront payment was accounted for as a reduction to stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the period the payment was made.  The Company reflected each ASR as a repurchase of common stock in the period delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share.

On November 3, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to

$500.0 million

of the Company's outstanding stock.  Under this program, share repurchases will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  The extent to which the Company repurchases its shares, the number of shares and the timing of any repurchases will depend on general market conditions, regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other considerations.  The program does not require the Company to repurchase a minimum number of shares and does not have a fixed term, and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice.  This new program includes approximately

$150.0 million

authorized on the

$1.0 billion

repurchase program that expired November 4, 2016.

The Company repurchased

4.1 million

shares (inclusive of the

0.4 million

shares received under the ASR agreement),

24.3 million

shares (inclusive of

10.0 million

shares received under the ASR agreement) and

shares of its common stock during fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, at an aggregate cost of

$209.4 million

,

$1,300.0 million

and

$50.9 million

, respectively, in accordance with the share repurchase programs described above.  As of

April 1, 2017

,

$382.0 million

remains available for future repurchases under our current share repurchase program.

of a share of Qorvo common stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, and each share of TriQuint common stock was converted into the right to receive

0.4187

of a share of Qorvo common stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares.  Approximately

16.    OPERATING SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

The Company's operating segments as of

April 1, 2017

are MP and IDP based on the organizational structure and information reviewed by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), and these segments are managed separately based on the end markets and applications they support.  The CODM allocates resources and assesses the performance of each operating segment primarily based on non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP operating income (loss) as a percentage of revenue.

MP supplies cellular RF and WiFi solutions into a variety of mobile devices, including smartphones, notebook computers, wearables, tablets, and cellular-based applications for the IoT.  Mobile device manufacturers and mobile network operators are adopting new technologies to address the growing demand for data-intensive, increasingly cloud-based, distributed applications and for mobile devices with smaller form factors, improved signal quality, less heat and longer talk and standby times.  New wireless communications standards are being deployed to utilize available spectrum more efficiently.  Carrier aggregation is being implemented, primarily in the downlink, to support wider bandwidths, increase data rates and improve network performance.  These trends increase the complexity of smartphones, require more RF content and place a premium on performance, integration, systems-level expertise, and product and technology portfolio breadth, all of which are MP strengths.  MP offers a comprehensive product portfolio of BAW and SAW filters, power amplifiers ("PAs"), low noise amplifiers ("LNAs"), switches, multimode multi-band PAs and transmit modules, RF power management integrated circuits, diversity receive modules, antenna switch modules, antenna tuning and control solutions, modules incorporating PAs and duplexers and modules incorporating switches, PAs and duplexers.

IDP is a leading global supplier of RF solutions with a diverse portfolio of solutions that "connect and protect," spanning communications, network infrastructure and defense applications.  These applications include high performance defense systems such as radar, electronic warfare and communication systems, WiFi customer premises equipment for home and work, high speed connectivity in Long-Term Evolution and 5G base stations, cloud connectivity via data center communications and telecom transport, automotive connectivity and smart home solutions.  IDP products include high power GaAs and GaN PAs, LNAs, switches, CMOS SoC solutions, premium BAW and SAW filter solutions and various multi-chip and hybrid assemblies.

The “All other” category includes operating expenses such as stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration related costs, acquired inventory step-up and revaluation, intellectual property rights ("IPR") litigation settlement (costs), restructuring and disposal costs, start-up costs, gain (loss) on assets and other miscellaneous corporate overhead expenses that the Company does not allocate to its reportable segments because these expenses are not included in the segment operating performance measures evaluated by the Company’s CODM.  The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information.  The Company’s operating segments do not record intercompany revenue.  The Company does not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, or taxes to operating segments.  Except as discussed above regarding the “All other” category, the Company’s accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for the Company as a whole.

April 1, 2017

and

April 2, 2016

, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

April 1, 2017

.   These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Qorvo, Inc. and subsidiaries as of

April 1, 2017

and

April 2, 2016

, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Qorvo, Inc.:

We have audited Qorvo, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of

April 1, 2017

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control ‑ Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Qorvo, Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Qorvo, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

April 1, 2017

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Qorvo, Inc. and subsidiaries as of

April 1, 2017

and

April 2, 2016

, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

April 1, 2017

and our report dated

May 23, 2017

expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding our required disclosure.  In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.

As of the end of the period covered by this annual report, the Company’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures in accordance with Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act.  Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of such date, to enable the Company to record, process, summarize and report in a timely manner the information that the Company is required to disclose in its Exchange Act reports.  The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer also concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Remediation of material weakness

As of

April 1, 2017

, management assessed and concluded that the previously reported material weakness related to accounting for income taxes has been remediated.

During fiscal 2017, we implemented a plan to remediate the material weakness that existed in accounting for income taxes as of April 2, 2016.  Our remediation plan was subject to ongoing senior management review, as well as Audit Committee oversight.  As part of such plan, we undertook the following actions:

•

We hired additional experienced tax personnel with specific tax and tax accounting expertise to fill the open positions in our tax organization.

•

With the assistance of a qualified outside party, we completed a comprehensive review and assessment of our internal controls over accounting for income taxes and the tax provision process.  Based on that review and assessment, we redesigned and enhanced our controls and procedures to improve the effectiveness of the internal controls related to accounting for income taxes.

•

We implemented a single tax provision model in connection with the implementation of a single integrated ERP system.

The Company believes that the remediation steps completed during fiscal 2017 significantly improved our internal control over the accounting for income taxes and the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of April 2, 2016 has been fully remediated as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(c)

Management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.  Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed


by and under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

April 1, 2017

.  Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO").

Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

April 1, 2017

, based on the criteria in the

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Item 8.

(d)

Changes in internal control over financial reporting

Except for the remediation of the material weakness described above, no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended

April 1, 2017

that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
