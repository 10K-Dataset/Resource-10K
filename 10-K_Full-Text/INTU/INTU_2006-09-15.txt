BUSINESS

CORPORATE BACKGROUND

General

Intuit Inc. is a leading provider of business, financial management and tax solutions for small
businesses, consumers and accountants. Our flagship products and services, including QuickBooks,
TurboTax, Lacerte, ProSeries and Quicken, simplify small business management, tax preparation and

in offices across the United States and internationally in Canada and several other locations.

Intuit was incorporated in California in March 1984. In March 1993, we reincorporated in Delaware

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Intuit’s Mission

Intuit’s mission is to revolutionize people’s lives by solving important problems. Our goal is to
create solutions so profound and simple that customers wouldn’t dream of going back to their old
ways of keeping their books, managing their businesses, preparing their or their clients’ taxes, or
organizing their personal finances.

We have five business segments: QuickBooks, Payroll and Payments, Consumer Tax, Professional Tax
and Other Businesses. Our Small Business division consists of two segments, our QuickBooks segment
and our Payroll and Payments segment. Our segments are described below. In the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2006 we revised our reportable segments to reflect the way we currently manage and view our
business. See

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations”

in Item 7 and Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 for more information
regarding the changes in our reportable segments.



Company Growth Strategy

Our strategy is to be in growth businesses, high profit businesses and attractive new markets with
large unmet or underserved needs which we can solve well. Our core competency is customer-driven
innovation that solves customer problems simply. We apply this approach to existing solutions by
focusing on continuous improvement to delight customers during their entire experience with Intuit
products and services. Our approach to new opportunities is to develop products and services
designed to attract customers who do not use software products (non-consumption) and offer
solutions that have better value compared with higher priced alternatives (disruption). This
strategy allows us to build large user bases with durable competitive advantage which translates
into sustained profit and revenue growth.

We are focused on serving small business and tax customers as well as accountants, who are both
customers and recommenders of our products and services. We divide customers into three groups:

•

“Self-Directed” Customers: These are customers who are comfortable using software and
doing the work themselves. These customers are likely to use products such as
Do-It-Yourself Payroll and TurboTax.

•

“Self-Directed with Assistance” Customers: These customers are comfortable doing much
of the work themselves, but want more assistance and assurance that they have done it
right. We are increasing our focus on serving these customers – particularly in our
consumer tax and payroll businesses. We believe that this customer segment offers
significant potential for Intuit as many of these customers are served today either by
fully self-directed solutions or by more expensive and complicated solutions than they
need.

•

“Can’t Be Bothered” Customers: These customers want lots of human assistance and are
likely to use full-service providers. We do not focus on these customers.

Four key fundamentals support our growth strategy:

•

We carefully choose the businesses we are in, focusing primarily on small businesses,
consumers and accountants. We choose to be in businesses with large, underserved market
opportunities where we believe we have the strategic and durable advantage to produce
long-term profitable growth. We have made a number of acquisitions and divestitures in the
past several years to adjust our business portfolio so that it remains consistent with this
focus.

•

We actively look for significant new customer problems and apply our core competency of
customer-driven innovation to solve those problems with simple, easy-to-use solutions.

•

At the same time, we solicit and act on feedback from our customers so that we can
continually improve our existing products and services. Our goal is customers who are so
happy with our products and services that they actively recommend them to others. We call
these customers promoters, who create positive word of mouth and brand preference.

•

We use operational rigor and process excellence methodology, tools and resources to
execute more effectively on a daily basis. Our goal is better customer experiences at lower
cost.

Right for Me Initiatives

Our focus on customer needs is embodied in Right for Me initiatives in all our business segments.
Rather than approach our targeted markets with a “one size fits all” mentality, we dig deeper to
understand the many different needs of various customer segments. We then use this knowledge to
develop products and services to meet those different needs. Over the past several years, for
example, we have gone from offering just two versions of QuickBooks – QuickBooks Basic and
QuickBooks Pro – to offering many QuickBooks solutions. These solutions range from QuickBooks
Simple Start for very small businesses with simple accounting needs to QuickBooks



Enterprise Solutions for small businesses with more complex accounting needs and versions of
QuickBooks designed to meet the needs of specific industries. We are also pursuing multi-year Right
for Me initiatives in our Payroll and Payments, Consumer Tax, Professional Tax and Other Businesses
segments. See

“Products and Services”

below for more information on these business-specific
initiatives.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

Intuit offers products and services in five business segments: QuickBooks, Payroll and Payments,
Consumer Tax, Professional Tax and Other Businesses. Our primary products and services are sold
mainly in the United States and are described below. International total net revenue was less than
5% of consolidated total net revenue for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004. For a discussion of financial
information about these segments, see

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations”

in Item 7 and Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8.

Classes of similar products or services that accounted for 10% or more of total net revenue in
fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004 were as follows:

QuickBooks

QuickBooks Software

. Our QuickBooks product line brings bookkeeping capabilities and business
management tools to small business users in an easy-to-use design that does not require them to be
familiar with debit/credit accounting. As part of our Right for Me strategy, we offer a range of
products to suit the needs of different types of small businesses. Our products include QuickBooks
Simple Start, which provides accounting functionality suitable for very small, less complex
businesses; QuickBooks Pro, which provides accounting functionality suitable for slightly larger
businesses, including those with payroll needs; QuickBooks Pro for Mac; QuickBooks Premier, which
provides small businesses with advanced accounting functionality and business planning tools; and
QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions, designed for larger mid-market businesses. Our Premier and
Enterprise products also come in a range of industry-specific editions, including Accountant,
Manufacturing and Wholesale, Retail, Non-Profit, Contractor, and Professional Services. In
addition, we offer a web-based version of QuickBooks called QuickBooks Online Edition that is
suitable for multiple users working in various locations.

QuickBooks Technical Support

. We currently offer a minimum of 30 days of free technical support
for all of our QuickBooks offerings. We also offer several additional technical support options to
our customers. These include support plans that are sold separately and priced based on the level
of personal assistance and response time the customer requires; a free self-help information
section on our QuickBooks.com web site; and free access to the online QuickBooks Community at

www.QuickBooksgroup.com.

Financial Supplies

. We offer a range of financial supplies designed for small businesses and
individuals for use with QuickBooks. These include paper checks, envelopes, invoices and deposit
slips. We also offer tax forms, tax return presentation folders and other supplies for professional
tax preparers. Our customers can personalize many products to incorporate their logos and use a
variety of color, font and design options.

QuickBooks Point of Sale Solutions

. Our QuickBooks Point of Sale offering helps retailers manage
customer transactions and inventories. The Basic version is suitable for single stores that want to
process sales using barcodes and track inventory and customer purchases while the Pro version
offers more advanced functionality such as serial number tracking and the ability to process
layaways and special orders. The Pro Multi-Store version allows the transfer of information between
stores. We sell this software with or without the accompanying hardware.



Intuit Developer Network

. The Intuit Developer Network is an initiative that encourages
third-party software developers to build applications that exchange data with QuickBooks and other
Intuit products by giving them access to certain application programming interfaces. Developers who
register with the Intuit Developer Network have access to the latest QuickBooks software
development kit, QuickBooks software downloads and member benefits such as QuickBooks marketing
tools, development kit forums and one-on-one engineering support. At the end of fiscal 2006,
approximately 450 third-party applications were available for QuickBooks and other Intuit products
at

www.marketplace.intuit.com.

Payroll and Payments

Small Business Payroll.

QuickBooks Payroll is a family of products sold on a subscription basis to
small businesses that prepare their own payrolls. These include QuickBooks Standard Payroll, which
provides payroll tax tables and federal forms; QuickBooks Enhanced Payroll, which in addition to
the Standard features also provides state forms and workers’ compensation tracking; and QuickBooks
Online Payroll, for use with QuickBooks Online Edition. Direct deposit and electronic tax payment
and filing services are available with some of these offerings for additional fees. We also offer
QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service, which provides the back-end aspects of payroll processing,
including tax payments and filings, for customers who process their payrolls using QuickBooks.
Finally, we offer full service payroll processing, direct deposit, check delivery and tax payment
services through our Complete Payroll and Premier Payroll Service.

Merchant Services.

Our Innovative Merchant Solutions (IMS) business offers a full range of merchant
services to small businesses. These include credit card, debit card, electronic benefits, check
guarantee and gift card processing services as well as web-based transaction processing services
for online merchants. In addition to processing services, IMS provides a full range of support for
its merchants that includes customer service, charge-back retrieval and support, and fraud and loss
prevention screening.

Consumer Tax

Our Consumer Tax business offers a number of tax return preparation products and services that
appeal to customers whose returns have varying levels of complexity, consistent with our Right For
Me strategy. Our current solutions include:

Consumer Tax Return Preparation Offerings

. Our TurboTax products and services are designed to
enable individuals and small business owners to prepare their own federal and state personal and
small business income tax returns easily, quickly and accurately. They are designed to be easy to
use, yet sophisticated enough for complex tax returns. We offer a range of desktop software
products as well as TurboTax Online, an interactive tax preparation service that enables individual
taxpayers to prepare and electronically file their federal and state income tax returns entirely
online. In addition, our innovative Instant Data Entry feature enables taxpayers to import data
directly into their tax returns from Form W-2 (wages), Form 1098 (mortgage interest) and Form 1099
(interest, dividends and stock transactions) from participating financial institutions and payroll
service companies. This feature saves TurboTax users time and increases accuracy.

Electronic Filing and Other Services

. Through our electronic filing center, our desktop and
web-based tax preparation customers can electronically file their federal income tax returns, as
well as state returns in all states that support electronic filing. For the 2005 tax year our
online tax services were offered through the web sites of approximately 1,900 financial
institutions, electronic retailers and other merchants and on Yahoo!

®

Finance Tax Center. We also
offer services that enable taxpayers to pay for their tax products and services with their
anticipated refund and we offer incorporation services to small businesses.

Intuit Tax Freedom Project

. Under the Intuit Tax Freedom Project, a philanthropic public service
initiative of the Intuit Financial Freedom Foundation, we provide online federal and state income
tax return preparation and electronic filing services at no charge to eligible taxpayers. In fiscal
2006 we provided approximately 1.4 million free federal returns under this initiative. We are a
member of the Free File Alliance, a consortium of private sector companies that entered into an
agreement with the federal government in October 2002 that was renewed for four years in October
2005. Under this agreement, a number of private sector companies have been providing web-based
federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to eligible taxpayers. See also

“Competition
– Consumer Tax”

later in this Item 1.



Professional Tax

Our Professional Tax segment provides a variety of software and services for accountants and tax
preparers in public practice who serve multiple clients. We design, create, sell and support
offerings that help professional accountants and tax preparers provide accounting, tax planning and
tax compliance services to their individual and business clients and that help them manage their
own practices more effectively. Our current tax software product lines include Lacerte and
ProSeries. Lacerte software is designed for full-service accounting firms that prepare the most
complex returns. We offer three versions of our ProSeries software: ProSeries Professional Edition,
designed for year-round tax practices that prepare moderately complex tax returns; ProSeries
Express Edition, designed for tax practices that focus on helping taxpayers obtain their tax
refunds quickly; and ProSeries Basic Edition, designed for the needs of smaller and seasonal tax
practices. Customers can elect to license professional tax products for a flat fee for unlimited
annual use, or use them on a “pay-per-return” basis. Lacerte and ProSeries customers can file their
clients’ tax returns using our electronic filing services. We also offer EasyACCT Professional
Accounting Series, which allows accountants to create financial statements and prepare tax forms
such as Form W-2 and Form 940 for their clients, as well as several other software products that
help accountants provide a broader spectrum of services to their clients.

Other Businesses

Quicken Software

. Our Quicken line of desktop software products helps users organize, understand
and manage their personal finances. Quicken allows customers to reconcile bank accounts, record
credit card and other transactions, write checks, and track investments, mortgages and other assets
and liabilities. Quicken also allows customers to flag their tax-related financial transactions and
download that information into our TurboTax consumer tax return preparation software. We offer
basic and deluxe versions of the product as well as Quicken Premier, which offers more robust
investment and tax planning tools; Quicken Premier Home and Business, which allows customers to
manage both personal and small business finances in one application; and Quicken for Mac.

Quicken.com and Other Online Services.

Our Quicken.com personal finance web site gives Quicken
customers access to web-based financial tools, resources and information about a variety of
personal finance topics and allows Quicken personal finance software users to monitor their
investments online. We offer other online services that we sell separately, including
Quicken-branded bill payment. We also offer access to online banking and investment tracking
services from various financial institutions that pay us to offer this access.

Other Consumer Solutions

. Our other consumer solutions currently include Quicken Medical Expense
Manager, which helps users track and manage health care costs, and Quicken Rental Property Manager,
which helps users track and manage rental property-related income, expenses and tenant information.

Intuit Real Estate Solutions

. Our Intuit Real Estate Solutions business offers software and
related technical support, consulting and training services for residential, commercial and
corporate property managers. In addition to its domestic operations, this business has operations
in five international locations.

Intuit Distribution Management Solutions

. Our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions business
offers software and related technical support, consulting and training services for distributors in
the wholesale durable goods industry.

Canada.

In Canada, we offer versions of QuickBooks that we have “localized,” that is, customized
to meet the unique needs of customers in that specific international location. These include
QuickBooks software offerings, payroll offerings and service plans. We also offer QuickTax and
TaxWiz consumer tax return preparation software; ProFile Financial Application Suite professional
tax preparation products and ProFile Advisor memberships for accountants; and localized versions of
Quicken in Canada.

The United Kingdom and Other Locations

. In the United Kingdom, we offer localized versions of
QuickBooks and QuickBooks Payroll, including products and services sold in partnership with banks.
We license localized versions
of QuickBooks and Quicken products in Germany, Australia and New Zealand through local distributors
and agents. In addition, we offer QuickBooks and Quicken in South Africa through a distributor and
in partnership with banks.



PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

Since the personal computer and software industries are characterized by rapid technological
change, shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements, a
continuous high level of investment is required for the enhancement of existing products and the
development of new products. We develop the majority of our products internally. We may also
supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring strategically important products and
technology from third parties, or establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or
expand our offerings more rapidly. We have a number of United States patents and pending
applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. While we believe that
our patents have value, no single patent is essential to any of our business segments.

Our core desktop software products – QuickBooks, TurboTax, Lacerte, ProSeries and Quicken – tend to
have fairly predictable, structured development cycles of about a year, with annual product
releases. These businesses also develop new products whose development cycles are less predictable.
Developing consumer and professional tax software presents unique challenges because of the
demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate tax law and tax form changes within
a rigid timetable. The development timing for our other small business offerings varies with
business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on the
scope and complexity of each particular project.

We continue to make substantial investments in research and development. Our future research and
development efforts will be focused on developing new products and services to address customer
needs in existing and new markets as well as adding complementary products and services to drive
revenue from our core products. We anticipate that the products we develop in the future will offer
increased ease of use, be customized for specific customer categories, be web-integrated or
web-based, and feature improved integration with other Intuit and third party products and services
and with our internal information systems. We also expect to continue to focus significant research
and development efforts on multi-year projects to modernize the technology platforms for many of
our products. Our research and development expenses were $399.0 million or 17% of total net revenue
in fiscal 2006, $305.2 million or 15% of total net revenue in fiscal 2005 and $276.0 million or 15%
of total net revenue in fiscal 2004. We expect that our fiscal 2007 research and development
expenses as a percentage of total net revenue will be higher than they were in fiscal 2006.

SEASONALITY

Our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Professional Tax businesses are highly seasonal. Some of our other
offerings are also seasonal, but to a lesser extent. Revenue from many of our small business
software products, including QuickBooks, tends to be concentrated around calendar year end. Sales
of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from
November through April. As a result, our total net revenue is usually highest during our second
quarter ending January 31 and third quarter ending April 30. We typically report losses in our
first quarter ending October 31 and fourth quarter ending July 31, when revenue from our tax
businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels.

MARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION

Markets

Our primary target markets are small businesses, consumers and accountants. Many of the markets in
which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and
frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors. Market and industry changes can
quickly render existing products and services obsolete, so our success depends on our ability to
respond rapidly to these changes with new business models, updated competitive strategies, new or
enhanced products and services, alternative distribution methods and other changes in the way we do
business.



Marketing Programs

We use a variety of marketing programs to generate software orders, stimulate demand and generally
maintain and increase customer awareness of our products and services. These programs include
direct-response mail and email campaigns; web marketing, including purchasing key words from major
search engine companies; telephone solicitations; newspaper and magazine advertising; and
television and radio advertising. We also use workflow-integrated in-product messaging in some of
our software products to market other related products and services, including third-party products
and services. Customers who respond to direct marketing campaigns and in-product messaging can
purchase products and services from us by telephone, through our web sites or through our retail
partners.

Sales and Distribution Channels

Direct Sales Channel

. We sell many of our products and services directly to our customers through
our web sites and call centers.

Retail Distribution Channel

. We market our QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken desktop software at
retail in the United States by selling directly and through distributors to office supply
superstores, warehouse clubs, consumer electronics retailers, general mass merchandisers,
e-commerce companies and catalogers. In Canada and other international markets, we also rely on
distributors and other third parties, who sell products into the retail channel.

We continue to benefit from strong relationships with a number of major North American retailers,
which allows us to minimize our dependence on any specific retailer. We deliver products to larger
retailers through a combination of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central warehouse
locations. We also sell and ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through
distributors. See

“Manufacturing and Distribution”

later in this Item 1. We continue to
aggressively manage our inventory to optimize in-stock presence and ensure good product placement
within retail stores. In response to current retail trends, we are also placing a greater
proportion of inventory with retailers on a consignment basis.

As we continue to execute on the Right for Me strategy in each of our businesses, we are, in some
product areas, offering software products that are more complex and have higher prices than our
traditional retail software products. Our recent tailoring of some of these software products to
specific customer needs, including industry-specific versions of QuickBooks, is also resulting in a
greater number of Intuit products. We produce and place in-store displays and other retail
merchandising aids that educate customers about product functionality and benefits.

OEM Channel

. Through our relationships with selected personal computer “original equipment
manufacturers,” or OEMs, we sell software to customers purchasing new OEM systems and we sell
products offered by OEMs to their customers after the point of sale. Although aggregate revenue
from our OEM channel is much less significant than revenue from our other distribution channels,
OEM relationships help us to attract new customers and generate sales of our core desktop software
products.

Third-Party “Value-Added” Distribution Arrangements

. We supplement our direct sales capabilities
and our retail and OEM distribution relationships with selected third-party distribution
arrangements. We believe these relationships will enhance the growth opportunities for certain
product and service offerings by allowing us to benefit from the value-added marketing and sales
expertise of these third parties. For example, our Innovative Merchant Solutions merchant services
business participates in a limited liability company that acquires merchant customers for IMS. See
Note 1 to the financial statements. During fiscal 2007 and beyond, we expect to continue to
optimize, expand and support our network of third-party relationships.

COMPETITION

Overview

We face intense competition in all of our businesses, both domestically and internationally.
Competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve, particularly small business and
consumer tax, has grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue. Some
of our existing competitors have significantly greater



financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. As we implement our customer-driven
strategies, we face increased competitive threats from larger companies than we have historically
faced. In addition, the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in
which we compete.

Our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology solutions similar to
ours. However, for many of our products and services, other important competitive alternatives for
customers are manual tools and processes, or general-purpose software. Many of our new customers
have used pencil and paper or software such as word processors and spreadsheets, rather than
competitors’ software and services, to perform financial tasks. For example, many taxpayers
prepared their tax returns manually before using TurboTax; a large number of small businesses used
spreadsheets to keep their books and they processed their payroll using spreadsheets and
manually-written checks before purchasing QuickBooks; and most of our personal finance customers
tracked their finances with spreadsheets, manually or not at all before using Quicken.

Competition Specific to Business Segments

Small Business.

QuickBooks is the leading product in the retail sales channel for its category. We
face significant competitive challenges in our QuickBooks and Payroll and Payments businesses from
Microsoft Corporation, which in September 2005 launched accounting software and associated services
that directly target small business customers. Increasingly, our small business products and
services also face competition from free online banking and payment services offered by financial
institutions and others. In our merchant services business, we also compete directly with a number
of independent sales organizations, none of which dominates the market.

Consumer Tax

. In the private sector we face intense competition primarily from H&R Block, the
makers of TaxCut software, and increasingly from web-based offerings such as 2nd Story Software’s
TaxACT, where we are subject to significant and increasing price pressure. We also compete for
customers with low-cost assisted tax preparation businesses, such as H&R Block.

We also face potential competitive challenges in our Consumer Tax business from publicly funded
government entities that offer electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to
individual taxpayers. We are a member of the Free File Alliance, a consortium of private sector
companies that signed an agreement with the federal government in October 2002 that was renewed for
four years in October 2005. Under this agreement, a number of private sector companies, rather than
the federal government, have been providing web-based federal tax preparation and filing services
at no cost to eligible federal taxpayers through initiatives such as our Intuit Tax Freedom
Project. Twenty-one states have also adopted Free File Alliance public-private agreements. Twenty
other states offer some form of direct government tax preparation and filing services free to
qualified taxpayers. We continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to
advance the goals of the Free File Alliance policy initiative and to support successful
public-private partnerships. However, future administrative, regulatory or legislative activity in
this area could have a material adverse effect on our Consumer Tax business.

Competitive Factors

Competitive factors for desktop software

. We believe the most important competitive factors for
our core desktop software products – QuickBooks, TurboTax, Lacerte, ProSeries and Quicken – are
ease of use, product features, size of the installed customer base, brand name recognition, value,
and product and support quality. Access to distribution channels is also important for our
QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken products. In addition, the ability for customers to upgrade within
product families as their businesses grow is a significant competitive factor for our QuickBooks
products. Productivity is also an important competitive factor for the full-service accounting
firms to which we market our Lacerte products. We believe we compete effectively on these factors
as QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken products are the leading products in the retail sales channel
for their respective categories.

Competitive factors for products and services other than desktop software

. We believe the most
important competitive factors for products and services other than desktop software are features
and ease of use, the integration of these products and services with related desktop software,
brand name recognition, speed in getting new products and services to market, effective
distribution and quality of implementation and support. We believe we compete effectively on these
factors. For our service offerings such as small business payroll and merchant services, service
reliability and scalability of operations are also important factors. Due to the size of our
principal competitors in these service businesses, we will need to scale our businesses to compete
effectively over the long term. Significant competitive factors for our financial supplies business
include ordering convenience, product quality, speed of delivery and price. We believe that our
convenient access to our large QuickBooks and Quicken customer bases is a significant competitive
advantage for our financial supplies business.



CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT

We provide customer service and technical support by telephone, online chat, fax, e-mail and our
customer service and technical support web sites. We have full-time and outsourced customer service
and technical support staffs, which we supplement with seasonal employees and additional
outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes, such as during the tax return filing season or
following a major product launch. We outsource to several firms domestically and internationally.
Most of our internationally outsourced consumer and small business customer service and technical
support personnel are located in India and the Philippines.

We offer free self-help information through our technical support web sites for QuickBooks,
TurboTax and Quicken. For example, customers can use our web sites to find answers to commonly
asked questions and check on the status of orders. Under certain support plans, customers can also
use our web sites to receive product updates electronically. Support alternatives and fees vary by
product. We also sponsor online user communities where customers can share product advice with each
other.

MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION

Desktop Software and Supplies

The major steps involved in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing CDs, printing boxes
and related materials, and assembling and shipping the final products. We have a manufacturing
agreement with ModusLink Corp. under which ModusLink provides substantially all outsourced
manufacturing related to our retail launches of QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken, as well as for
day-to-day retail order fulfillment after product launches. Although ModusLink has operations in
multiple locations that can provide redundancy if necessary, we have centralized the manufacturing
for our retail products in one of their facilities which is co-located with our primary retail
fulfillment vendor, Ingram Micro Logistics (IML), a division of Ingram Micro Inc. We also outsource
the product manufacturing and distribution for most of our direct sales orders to Arvato Services,
Inc., a division of Bertelsmann AG. We use John H. Harland Company exclusively to fulfill orders
for all of our printed checks and most other products for our financial supplies business.

Our retail product launches are operationally complex. Our model for product delivery for retail
launches and replenishment is a hybrid of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central
warehouse locations. This allows improved inventory management by our retailers. We also ship
products for many of our smaller retail customers through distributors. We have an agreement with
IML under which IML handles all logistics, fulfillment and similar functions for our retail sales.

We have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has historically not been a
significant problem for us. Prior to major product releases for our core desktop software products
we tend to have significant levels of backlog, but at other times backlog is minimal and we
typically ship products within a few days of receiving an order. Because of this fluctuation in
backlog, we believe that backlog is not a reliable predictor of our future core desktop software
sales.

Internet-Based Products and Services

Intuit’s data centers house most of the systems, networks and databases required to operate and
deliver our Internet-based products and services. These include QuickBooks Online Edition,
QuickBooks Online Payroll, QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service, Complete web-based Payroll,
TurboTax Online, consumer and professional electronic tax filing services, Quicken.com and
QuickBase. Through our data centers, we connect customers to products and services and we store the
vast amount of data that represents the content on our web sites. As our businesses continue to
move toward delivering more web-based products and services, this infrastructure will become even
more critical in the future. Our data centers consist of numerous servers and databases located in
several sites across the United States. In order to prevent interruptions to the availability of
our Internet-based products and services, we have implemented practices for creating a
fault-tolerant environment. However, we do not have complete redundancy for all of our systems. We
have back-up processing capabilities that are designed to protect us against site-related disasters
for many of our mission-critical applications. Despite our efforts to maintain continuous and
reliable server operations, we occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties.



PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION

We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations and financial
institution requirements relating to the privacy and security of customer and employee personal
information. We are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to telemarketing and email
activities. Additional laws in both areas are likely to be passed in the future, which could result
in significant limitations on the ways in which we can communicate with our customers and
significantly increase our compliance costs. If our business expands to new industry segments that
are regulated for privacy and security, or to countries outside the United States that have strict
data protections laws, our compliance requirements and costs will increase.

We comply with United States federal and other country guidelines and practices to help ensure that
customers are aware of, and can control, how we use information about them. Our primary web sites,
such as QuickBooks.com, TurboTax.com and Quicken.com, have been certified by TRUSTe, an
independent, non-profit organization that operates a web site privacy certification program
representing industry standard practices to address users’ and regulators’ concerns about online
privacy. We also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices, as
well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal
information.

To address security concerns, we use security safeguards to help protect the information customers
give to us from loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration. Whenever customers transmit sensitive
information, such as a credit card number or tax return data, to us through one of our web sites,
that information is stored on secure servers that allow encryption of the information as it is
transmitted to us. We work to protect personally identifiable information stored on the web site’s
servers from unauthorized internal or external access using commercially available computer
security products, such as firewalls, as well as internally developed security procedures and
practices.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

We offer certain products and services, such as small business payroll, which are subject to
special regulatory requirements. As we expand our small business products and services, we may
become subject to additional government regulation, particularly in the areas of retirement
planning and other employer services. New laws or regulations may be adopted in these areas that
could impose significant limitations on our business and increase our cost of compliance. We
continually analyze new business opportunities, and new businesses that we pursue may require
additional costs for regulatory compliance.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We regard our products as proprietary. We attempt to protect our product technology by relying on a
combination of copyright, patent, trade secret and trademark laws, restrictions on disclosure and
other methods. In particular, we have a substantial number of registered trademarks including
Intuit, QuickBooks, TurboTax, Lacerte, ProSeries and Quicken. We have registered these and other
trademarks and service marks in the United States and, depending on the relevance of each brand to
other markets, in many foreign countries. The initial duration of trademark registrations varies
from country to country and is 10 years in the United States. Most registrations can be renewed
perpetually at 10-year intervals. We also currently hold a small but growing patent portfolio. We
regularly file applications for patents and trademarks and service marks in order to protect
proprietary intellectual property that we believe is important to our business. We also license
some intellectual property from third parties for use in our products.

We face a number of risks relating to our intellectual property, including unauthorized use and
unauthorized copying, or piracy, of our products. Litigation may be necessary to protect our
intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of
others. Patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be
enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction. Furthermore, other parties have
asserted and may, in the future, assert infringement claims against us. These claims and any
litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement
against us along



with an assessment of damages. Litigation, even if not meritorious, could result in substantial
costs and diversion of resources and management attention. In addition, third party licenses may
not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.

EMPLOYEES

As of August 31, 2006 we had approximately 7,500 employees located in the United States and
internationally in Canada and several other locations. We believe our future success and growth
will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business.
We do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and we believe
employee relations are generally good. Although we have employment-related agreements with a number
of key employees, these agreements do not guarantee continued service. We believe we offer
competitive compensation and a good working environment. We were named one of

Fortune

magazine’s
“100 Best Companies to Work For” in each of the last five years. However, we face intense
competition for qualified employees, and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and
retention.

ITEM 1A

RISK FACTORS

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. All statements in this report,
other than statements that are purely historical, are forward-looking statements. Words such as
“expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “forecasts,” “estimates,” “seeks,” and
similar expressions also identify forward-looking statements. In this report, forward-looking
statements include, without limitation, the following:

We caution investors that forward-looking statements are only predictions based on our current
expectations about future events and are not guarantees of future performance. We encourage you to
read carefully all information provided in this report and in our other filings with the SEC before
deciding to invest in our stock or to maintain or change your investment. These forward-looking
statements are based on information as of the filing date of this Annual Report, and we undertake
no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statement for any reason.



Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors
that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking
statements. These factors include the following:

We face intense competitive pressures in all of our businesses that may negatively impact our
revenue, profitability and market position.

We have formidable competitors, and we expect competition to remain intense during fiscal 2007 and
beyond. The number, resources and sophistication of the companies with whom we compete have
increased as we continue to expand our product and service offerings. Our competitors may
introduce new and improved products and services, bundle new offerings with market-leading
products, reduce prices, gain better access to distribution channels, advertise aggressively or
beat us to market with new products and services. We also face growing competition from providers
of free online accounting, bookkeeping, tax and other business-related services. Any of these
competitive actions taken over any prolonged period could diminish our revenue and profitability
and could affect our ability to keep existing customers and acquire new customers. Some additional
competitive factors that may impact our businesses are discussed below.

QuickBooks and Payroll and Payments.

Losing existing or potential QuickBooks customers to
competitors causes us to lose potential software revenue and also limits our opportunities to sell
related products and services such as our financial supplies, small business payroll and merchant
services offerings. Many competitors provide accounting and business management products and
services to small businesses. For example, Microsoft Corporation currently offers Microsoft Office
Small Business Accounting and offers, in partnership with third parties, several other competitive
products and services, including a payroll solution for small businesses, credit and debit card
processing services, and business checks, forms envelopes and related printed products. We expect
that competition from Microsoft as well as new or currently unidentified competitors will intensify
over time with these and future offerings that directly compete with QuickBooks and our other
offerings. Although we have successfully competed with Microsoft in the past, Microsoft’s small
business product and service offerings may still have a significant negative impact on our future
revenue and profitability.

Our principal competitors in the small business payroll services business benefit from greater
economies of scale due to their substantial size, which may result in pricing pressure for our
offerings. The growth of electronic banking and other electronic payment systems is decreasing the
demand for checks and consequently causing pricing pressure for our financial supplies business as
competitors aggressively compete for share of this shrinking market.

Several of our products also compete with web-based electronic banking, finance tracking and
management tools that are becoming increasingly available at no cost to consumers. If we are
unable to provide products with features and services that compete effectively with these free
offerings, our revenue and profitability may suffer.

Consumer Tax

. Our consumer tax business faces significant competition from both the public and
private sector. In the public sector we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities
developing or contracting to provide software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation
and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers.

•

Federal Government

. Agencies of the U.S. government have made several attempts during
the two most recent presidential administrations to initiate a program to offer taxpayers
free online tax preparation and filing services. However, in October 2002 the Internal
Revenue Service agreed not to provide its own competing tax software product or service so
long as participants in a consortium of tax preparation software companies, including
Intuit, agreed to provide web-based federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost
to qualified taxpayers under an arrangement called the Free File Alliance. In October 2005
the IRS and the Free File Alliance signed a new four-year agreement that continues to
restrict the IRS from entering the tax preparation business. This agreement specifies the
category of taxpayers eligible to receive free services and places limits on the ability of
participating companies to target their free offering to more than 50% of all U.S.
taxpayers. The Free File Alliance has kept the federal government from being a direct
competitor to our tax offerings in the past. However, it has also fostered additional
web-based competition and could cause us to lose significant revenue opportunities from our
Consumer Tax customer base. Companies have used the Free File Alliance and its position on
the IRS web site as a marketing tool by giving away free services at the federal level and
attempting to make money by selling state filing and other services, which has intensified
competition. In addition, persons who formerly have paid for our



products may elect to use our or our competitors’ unpaid federal offering instead. The IRS
has the right to terminate the agreement with the Free File Alliance upon 24 months written
notice. If the IRS were to terminate the agreement and elect to provide government software
and electronic filing services to taxpayers at no charge, or if other governmental bodies
were to significantly alter the Free File Alliance or require the provision of government
tax filing services directly to taxpayers, our revenue and profits could suffer. See the
discussion on the Free File Alliance in Item 1,

“Business – Competition.”

•

State Governments

. State taxing authorities have also actively pursued various
strategies to provide free online tax return preparation and electronic filing services for
state taxpayers. As of July 31, 2006, 21 states had entered into agreements with the
private sector based on the federal Free File Alliance agreement and had agreed to
discontinue or otherwise not provide direct government tax preparation services. However,
20 other states, including California, directly offered their own online tax preparation
and filing services to taxpayers. For the 2004 and 2005 tax years, California tested a
limited pilot program under which a state-operated electronic system automatically prepared
and filed approximately 10,000 state income tax returns with no individual transaction
charge to those taxpayers. Although the California legislature has not renewed this program
for the 2006 tax year, this program or similar programs could be introduced or expanded in
the future. It is also possible that other governmental entities could elect to provide
similar competitive offerings in the future. These publicly sponsored programs could cause
us to lose customers to free offerings and enable competitors to gain market share at our
expense by using participation in the free alliances as an effective tool to attract
customers to ancillary paid offerings. Given the efficiencies that electronic tax filing
provides to taxing authorities, we anticipate that governmental competition will present a
continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future.

•

Private Sector

. In the private sector we face intense competition primarily from H&R
Block, the makers of TaxCut software, and increasingly from web-based offerings such as 2nd
Story Software’s TaxACT, where we are subject to significant and increasing price pressure.
We also compete for customers with low-cost assisted tax preparation businesses, such as
H&R Block. In addition, companies that provide free online tax preparation services,
whether through the Free File Alliance or otherwise, may reduce demand for our paid
offerings which would harm our business and results of operations.

Professional Tax.

Our ProSeries professional tax offerings face pricing pressure from competitors
seeking to obtain our customers through deep product discounts and loss of customers to competitors
offering no-frills offerings at low prices, such as CCH’s ATX product line. Our Lacerte
professional tax offerings face competition from competitively-priced tax and accounting solutions
that include integration with non-tax functionality.

Other Businesses.

Our Quicken products compete both with Microsoft Money, which is aggressively
promoted and priced, and with web-based electronic banking and personal finance tracking and
management tools that are becoming increasingly available at no cost to consumers. These
competitive pressures may result in reduced revenue and lower profitability for our Quicken product
line and related bill payment service offering.

Future revenue growth for our core products depends upon our successful introduction of new and
enhanced products and services.

A number of our businesses derive a significant amount of their revenue through one-time upfront
license fees and rely on customer upgrades and service offerings to generate a significant portion
of their revenues. In addition, our consumer tax business depends significantly on revenue from
customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services.
As our existing products mature, encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more
challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful
incremental value. If we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of upgraded
products to our customers, our upgrade and service revenues will be harmed. Similarly, our
business will be harmed if we are not successful in our efforts to develop and introduce new
products and services to retain our existing customers, expand our customer base and increase
revenues per customer.

In some cases, we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on products
or services that do not ultimately succeed in their markets. We have encountered difficulty in
launching new products and services in the past. For example, at the end of fiscal 2005 we
discontinued our SnapTax consumer tax offering and in fiscal 2004 we discontinued our QuickBooks
Premier Healthcare offering due to lack of customer demand. If we misjudge customer needs, our new
products and services will not succeed and our revenues and earnings will be harmed. As we expand
our offerings to new customer categories we run the risk of customers shifting from higher



priced and higher margin products to newly introduced lower priced offerings. For instance, our
QuickBooks Simple Start offering and our ProSeries Basic and ProSeries Express offerings may
attract users that would otherwise have purchased our higher priced, more full featured offerings.

If we fail to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our electronic tax offerings, or
if the IRS or other governmental agencies experience difficulties in receiving customer
submissions, we could lose customers and our revenue and earnings could decrease.

Our web-based tax preparation services and electronic filing services are an important and growing
part of our tax businesses and must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during the
peak tax season from January to April. We face significant risks and challenges in maintaining
these services and maintaining adequate service levels, particularly during peak volume service
times. Similarly, governmental entities receiving electronic tax filings must also handle large
volumes of data and may experience difficulties with their systems preventing the receipt of
electronic filings. If customers are unable to file their returns electronically they may elect to
make paper filings. This would result in reduced electronic tax return preparation and filing
revenues and would harm our reputation and ability to attract and retain customers. We have
experienced relatively brief unscheduled interruptions in our electronic filing and/or tax
preparation services during past tax years. For example, on April 17, 2006 we chose to refresh our
systems during the day in preparation for anticipated heavy evening volume and this resulted in
electronic filing services being unavailable to our customers for about twenty minutes. Any
prolonged interruptions in our web-based tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time
during the tax season could result in lost customers, negative publicity and increased operating
costs, any of which could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

The nature of our products necessitates timely product launches and if we experience significant
product quality problems or delays, it will harm our revenue, earnings and reputation.

All of our tax products and many of our non-tax products have rigid development timetables that
increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays. Our tax preparation
software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate
unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels
of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by April 15th.
Due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate,
our products sometimes contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the
software. When we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code, distribute patches to
customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory
in our distribution channels. If we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our
products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product launch date. Any major
defects or launch delays could lead to loss of customers and revenue, negative publicity, customer
and employee dissatisfaction, reduced retailer shelf space and promotions, and increased operating
expenses, such as inventory replacement costs, legal fees or payments resulting from our commitment
to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our
consumer tax preparation products.

Possession and use of personal customer information by our businesses presents risks and expenses
that could harm our business.

A number of our businesses collect, use and retain large amounts of personal customer information,
including credit card numbers, tax return information, bank account numbers and passwords, personal
and business financial data, social security numbers and other payroll information. We also
collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business.
Some of this personal customer and employee information is held and managed by third parties. We
and our vendors use commercially available encryption technology to transmit personal information
when taking orders. We use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal
information. However, a third party may be able to circumvent these security and business
measures, and errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in a
breach of customer or employee privacy. We employ contractors, temporary and seasonal employees
who may have access to the personal information of customers and employees. While we conduct
necessary and appropriate background checks of these individuals and limit access to personal
information, it is possible one of these individuals could circumvent these controls which would
result in a breach of customer or employee privacy. Possession and use of personal information in
conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could require
notification of data



breach, restrict our use of personal information and hinder our ability to acquire new customers or
market to existing customers. We have incurred – and will continue to incur – significant expenses
to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation,
industry standards or contractual obligations.

In the past we have experienced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues and we
could face similar suits in the future. A major breach of customer privacy or security by us or
the third parties that hold and manage personal information could have serious negative
consequences for our businesses, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced customer
demand for our services, harm to our reputation and brands, further regulation and oversight by
federal or state agencies, and loss of our ability to accept and process customer credit card
orders or tax returns. Although we have sophisticated network and application security, internal
control measures, and physical security procedures to safeguard customer and employee information,
there can be no assurance that a personal information breach, loss or theft will not occur, which
could harm our business, customer reputation and results of operations. If our business expands to
new industry segments that are regulated for privacy and security, or to countries outside the
United States that have more strict data protection laws, our compliance requirements and costs
will increase.

Our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and our quarterly results fluctuate significantly.

Several of our businesses are highly seasonal causing significant quarterly fluctuations in our
financial results. Revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and third
fiscal quarters ending January 31 and April 30 due to our tax businesses contributing most of their
revenue during those quarters and the timing of the release of our small business software products
and upgrades. We experience lower revenues, and significant operating losses, in the first and
fourth quarters ending October 31 and July 31. For example, in the second and third quarters of
fiscal 2005 and 2006 we had total net revenue of between $648.2 million and $952.6 million while in
the first and fourth  quarters of fiscal 2005 and 2006 we had total net revenue of between
$252.8 million and $342.9 million. Our financial results can also fluctuate from quarter to
quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors, including changes in product sales mix that
affect average selling prices; product release dates; the timing of our discontinuance of support
for older product offerings; our methods for distributing our products, including the shift to a
consignment model for some of our desktop products sold through retail distribution channels; the
inclusion of upgrades with certain offerings and the timing of our delivery of state tax forms
(both of which can impact the pattern of revenue recognition), and the timing of acquisitions,
divestitures, and goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charges.

The growth of our business depends on our ability to adapt to rapid technological change.

The software industry in which we operate is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving
industry standards and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. Our Right for Me
marketing approach increases the importance for us of developing additional versions of our
products to meet specific customer needs. Our ability to succeed in this rapidly changing
environment requires that we continuously invest resources to enhance our software architecture and
developer tools. We must make this investment in order to continue to enhance our current products
and develop new products to meet changing customer needs and to attract and retain talented
software developers. We are currently in the process of modernizing the software platforms for a
number of our product lines, including our QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken products. Completing
these upgrades and adapting to other technological developments may require considerable time and
expense. If we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in upgrading our software
architecture, our ability to develop new products and enhancements to our current products would
suffer.

Failure to maintain the availability and security of the systems, networks, databases and software
required to operate and deliver our Internet-based products and services could adversely affect our
operating results.

Our ecommerce web sites and our Internet-based product and service offerings, including QuickBooks
Online Edition, QuickBooks Online Payroll, QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service, Complete web-based
Payroll, Turbo Tax Online, consumer and professional electronic tax filing services, Quicken.com
and QuickBase, rely on a variety of systems, networks and databases, many of which are maintained
by us at our data centers. In order to prevent interruptions to the availability of our ecommerce
web sites and Internet-based products and services, we have implemented practices for creating a
fault-tolerant environment. However, we do not have complete redundancy for all of our systems.
We may also need to grow, reconfigure or relocate our data centers in response to changing



business needs, which may be costly and lead to unplanned disruptions of service. We do not
maintain real-time back-up of our data, and in the event of significant system disruption,
particularly during peak tax filing season, we could experience loss of data or tax return
processing capabilities, which could cause us to lose customers and could materially harm our
operating results. We maintain back-up processing capabilities that are designed to protect us
against site-related disasters for many of our mission-critical applications. Notwithstanding our
efforts to protect against “down time” for our ecommerce web sites and Internet-based products and
services, we do occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties. In order to
provide our Internet-based products and services, we must protect the security of our systems,
networks, databases and software.

Like all companies that deliver products and services via the Internet, we are subject to attack by
computer hackers who develop and deploy software that is designed to penetrate the security of our
systems and networks. If hackers were able to penetrate our security systems, they could
misappropriate or damage our proprietary information or cause disruptions in the delivery of our
products and services. We believe that we have taken steps to protect against such attacks.
However, there can be no assurance that our security measures will not be penetrated by hackers.
In the event that the systems, networks, databases and software required to deliver our
Internet-based products and services become unavailable or suffer technical difficulties or a
breach in security, we may be required to expend significant resources to alleviate these problems,
and our operating results could suffer. In addition, any such interruption or breach of security
could damage our reputation and lead to the loss of customers.

Our reliance on a limited number of manufacturing and distribution suppliers could harm our
business.

We have chosen to outsource the manufacturing and distribution of many of our desktop software
products to a small number of third party providers and we use a single vendor to produce and
distribute our check and business forms supplies products. Although our reliance on a small number
of suppliers, or a single supplier, provides us with efficiencies and enhanced bargaining power,
poor performance by or lack of effective communication with these parties can significantly harm
our business. This risk is amplified by the fact that we carry very little inventory and rely on
just-in-time manufacturing processes. In particular, the loss of our principal manufacturing
partner for retail would be disruptive to our business and could cause delay in a product launch.
We seek to mitigate this risk by managing our second tier vendors and maintaining contingency
plans. During fiscal 2004 one of our suppliers was unable to fulfill orders for some of our
software products for a number of days due to operational difficulties and communication errors.
Although together we were able to mitigate the impact of that delay with minimal disruption to our
business, if we experience longer delays, delays during a peak demand period or significant quality
issues our business could be significantly harmed.

Overall capacity for the manufacture of optical media compact discs in the U.S. has decreased due
to a market shift to the DVD format. This decrease in CD production capacity could require us to
identify, review and engage new manufacturing sources within or outside the U.S. or change to DVD
format, which would be more expensive than CD media. This could affect our ability to timely
manufacture and deliver our products at retail, which could harm our financial condition and
results of operations.

As our product and service offerings become more complex our revenue streams may become less
predictable

.

Our expanding range of products and services generates more varied revenue streams than our
traditional desktop software businesses. The accounting policies that apply to these revenue
streams are more complex than those that apply to our traditional products and services. We expect
this trend to continue as we expand our offerings. For example, as we begin to offer additional
features and options as part of multiple-element revenue arrangements, we could be required to
defer a higher percentage of our product revenue at the time of sale than we do for traditional
products. This would decrease recognized revenue at the time products are shipped, but result in
increased recognized revenue in fiscal periods after shipment.

We face a number of risks in our merchant card processing business that could result in a reduction
in our revenue and earnings.

Our merchant card processing service business is subject to several risks, including the following:

•

if merchants for whom we process credit card transactions are unable to pay refunds due
to their customers in connection with disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions we may
be required to pay those amounts
and our payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves we have established to make
such payments;



Should any of these risks be realized our business could be harmed and our financial results could
suffer.

Our dependence on a small number of larger retailers and distributors could harm our results of
operations.

We sell most of our desktop software products through our retail distribution channel and a
relatively small number of larger retailers and distributors generate a significant portion of our
sales volume. Our principal retailers have significant bargaining leverage due to their size and
available resources. Any change in principal business terms, termination or major disruption of
our relationship with these resellers could result in a potentially significant decline in our
revenues and earnings. For example, the sourcing decisions, product display locations and
promotional activities that retailers undertake can greatly impact the sales of our products. The
fact that we also sell our products directly could cause retailers or distributors to reduce their
efforts to promote our products or stop selling our products altogether. If any of our retailers or
distributors run into financial difficulties we may be unable to collect amounts that we are owed.
At January 31, 2006, in the midst of the 2005 consumer tax season, amounts due from our 10 largest
retailers and distributors represented approximately 51% of total gross accounts receivable.

Failure of our information technology systems or those of our service providers could adversely
affect our future operating results.

We rely on a variety of internal technology systems and technology systems maintained by our
outside manufacturing and distribution suppliers to take and fulfill customer orders, handle
customer service requests, host our web-based activities, support internal operations, and store
customer and company data. These systems could be damaged or interrupted, preventing us or our
service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or otherwise interrupting our
business. In addition, these systems could suffer security breaches, causing company and customer
data to be unintentionally disclosed. Any of these occurrences could adversely impact our
operations. We have experienced system slowdowns and interruptions in the past that have caused
loss of productivity and added expense. We also experience computer server failures from time to
time. To prevent interruptions we must continue to upgrade our information systems to further
improve performance and help ensure that we have adequate recoverability. The expansion and
upgrade of our systems could be costly, and problems with the design or implementation of system
enhancements could harm our ability to take customer orders, ship products, support and invoice our
customers, and otherwise run our business. While we and our outside service partners have backup
systems for certain aspects of our operations, not all of these systems are fully redundant and
disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.

Increased government regulation of tax preparation services could harm our business.

The tax preparation industry has received increased attention from legislative and regulatory
bodies in recent years, both because of the continuing focus on free tax preparation and because of
the nature of certain services used to process and transfer refunds to taxpayers. If legislative
or regulatory bodies increase their regulation or oversight of the tax preparation industry, this
could increase our cost of doing business by imposing new regulations, and could limit our revenue
opportunities by restricting the types of products and services we can offer.



We are required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully
operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services. Changes in state-imposed requirements
by one or more of the states, including the required use of specific technologies or technology
standards, could significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and
could prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner.

If we do not respond promptly and effectively to customer service and technical support inquiries
we will lose customers and our revenue and earnings will decline.

The effectiveness of our customer service and technical support operations are critical to customer
satisfaction and our financial success. If we do not respond effectively to service and technical
support requests we will lose customers and miss revenue opportunities, such as paid service,
product renewals and new product sales. We occasionally experience customer service and technical
support problems, including longer than expected waiting times for customers when our staffing and
systems are inadequate to handle a higher-than-anticipated volume of requests. Training and
retaining qualified customer service and technical support personnel is particularly challenging
due to the expansion of our product offerings and the seasonality of our tax business. For
example, in fiscal 2006 the number of our consumer tax service representatives ranged from about 50
during off-season months to about 1,050 at the peak of the tax season. If we do not adequately
train our support representatives our customers will not receive an appropriate level of support,
we will lose customers and our financial results will suffer.

If we encounter problems with our third-party customer service and technical support providers our
business will be harmed and our margins will decline.

We outsource a substantial portion of our customer service and technical support activities to
domestic and international third-party service providers, including service providers in India and
the Philippines. We rely heavily on third-party customer service representatives working on our
behalf and we expect to continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future. This strategy
provides us with lower operating costs and greater flexibility, but also presents risks to our
business, including the following:

We are exposed to risks associated with credit card and payment fraud and with credit card
processing.

Many of our customers use credit cards or automated payment systems to pay for our products and
services. We have suffered losses, and may continue to suffer losses, as a result of orders placed
with fraudulent credit card or other payment data. For example, under current credit card
practices, we may be liable for fraudulent credit card transactions if we do not obtain a
cardholder’s signature, a frequent practice in Internet sales. We employ technology solutions to
help us detect fraudulent transactions. However, the failure to detect or control payment fraud
could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

We are subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, as in
effect from time to time. Failure to comply with these rules or requirements may subject us to
fines and higher transaction fees or cause us to lose our ability to accept credit card payments
from our customers, resulting in harm to our business and results of operations.



If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may exploit our
innovations, which could weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue and earnings.

Our success depends upon our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of copyright, trade
secret, trademark, patent, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and
protect our proprietary rights. As part of our confidentiality procedures, we generally enter into
non-disclosure agreements with our employees, contractors, distributors and corporate partners and
into license agreements with respect to our software, documentation and other proprietary
information. The creation and protection of our proprietary rights are expensive and may require
us to engage in costly and distracting litigation. Despite these precautions, third parties could
copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization. Because we
outsource significant aspects of our product development, manufacturing and distribution we are at
risk that confidential portions of our intellectual property could become public by lapses in
security by our contractors. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future,
certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These
licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our
reputation. It is also possible that other companies could successfully challenge the validity or
scope of our patents and that our patent portfolio, which is relatively small, may not provide us
with adequate protection. Ultimately, our attempts to secure legal protection for our proprietary
rights may not be adequate and our competitors could independently develop similar technologies,
duplicate our products, or design around patents and other intellectual property rights. If our
intellectual property protection proves inadequate we could lose our competitive advantage and our
financial results will suffer.

Third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur
significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products.

From time to time, we have received claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights
of others. As the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of
these products further overlap, and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, we
believe that we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims, including patent,
copyright, and trademark infringement claims. We expect that software products in general will
increasingly be subject to these claims as the number of products and competitors increase, the
functionality of products overlap and as the patenting of software functionality continues to grow.
We have, from time to time, received allegations of patent infringement claims in the past and may
receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our products infringe upon patents held
by third parties. Future claims could present an exposure of uncertain magnitude. We believe that
we would be able to obtain any necessary licenses or other rights to disputed intellectual property
rights on commercially reasonable terms. However, the ultimate outcome of any allegation is
uncertain and, regardless of outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, could be time
consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management’s time and attention from our
business, require us to stop selling, to delay shipping or to redesign our products, or require us
to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing arrangements, or to satisfy indemnification
obligations that we have with some of our customers. Our failure to obtain necessary license or
other rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our
business.

In addition, we license and use software from third parties in our business. These third party
software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms. Also, these third
parties may from time to time receive claims that they have infringed the intellectual property
rights of others, including patent and copyright infringement claims, which may affect our ability
to continue licensing their software. Our inability to use any of this third party software could
result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business, which could materially and
adversely affect our operating results.

We expect copying and misuse of our intellectual property to be a persistent problem causing lost
revenue and increased expenses.

Our intellectual property rights are among our most valuable assets. Policing unauthorized use and
copying of our products is difficult, expensive, and time consuming. Current U.S. laws that
prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of
many other countries provide very little protection. We may not be able to prevent
misappropriation of our technology. For example, we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of
our software being sold through online auction sites and other online marketplaces. In addition,
efforts to



protect our intellectual property may be misunderstood and perceived negatively by our customers.
Although we continue to evaluate and put in place technology solutions to attempt to lessen the
impact of piracy, and we continue to increase our civil and criminal enforcement efforts, we expect
piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses.

Although we are unable to quantify the extent of piracy of our software products, software piracy
may depress our net revenues. We engage in efforts to educate consumers on the benefits of
licensing genuine products and to educate lawmakers on the advantages of a business climate where
intellectual property rights are protected, and we cooperate with the Software & Information
Industry Association in their efforts to combat piracy. However, these efforts may not
fully combat the effect of piracy of our products.

We do not own all of the software, other technologies and content used in our products and
services.

Many of our products are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. We
believe we have all of the necessary licenses from third parties to use and distribute third party
technology and content that we do not own that is used in our current products and services. From
time to time we may be required to renegotiate with these third parties – or negotiate with new
third parties – to include their technology or content in our existing products, in new versions of
our existing products or in wholly new products. We may not be able to negotiate or renegotiate
licenses on reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use or
continue to use third-party technology or content in our products and services, we may not be able
to sell the affected products, which would in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and
operating results.

Our acquisition activity could disrupt our ongoing business and may present risks not contemplated
at the time of the transactions.

We have acquired and may continue to acquire companies, products and technologies that complement
our strategic direction. These acquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties,
including:

Acquisitions are inherently risky. We can not be certain that our previous or future acquisitions
will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the conduct, operating results or
financial condition of our business. We have generally paid cash for our recent acquisitions.
Future transactions may involve further use of our cash resources, the issuance of equity or debt
securities, the incurrence of other forms of debt or the amortization of expenses related to
intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations. If
we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition, current shareholders’ percentage
ownership and earnings per share may be diluted.

If actual product returns exceed returns reserves our financial results would be harmed.

We ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to
sell, in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers will run out of products. This is
particularly true for our Consumer Tax products, which have a short selling season and for which
returns occur primarily in our fiscal third and fourth quarters. Like many software companies that
sell their products through distributors and retailers, we have historically accepted significant
product returns. We establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial
statements based on estimated returns and we closely monitor product sales and inventory in the
retail channel in an effort to maintain adequate reserves. In the past, returns have not differed
significantly from these reserves. However, if we experience actual returns that significantly
exceed reserves, it would result in lower net revenue. For example, if we had increased our fiscal
2006 returns reserves by 1% of non-consignment sales to retailers for QuickBooks, TurboTax and
Quicken, our fiscal 2006 total net revenue would have been approximately $3.5 million lower. In
addition, our policy of recognizing revenue from distributors and retailers upon delivery of



product for non-consignment sales is predicated upon our ability to reasonably estimate returns. If
we do not continue to demonstrate our ability to estimate returns then our revenue recognition
policy for these types of sales may no longer be appropriate.

Acquisition-related costs and impairment charges can cause significant fluctuation in our net
income.

Our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses, including amortization of purchased
intangible assets (which is reflected in cost of revenue), charges for in-process research and
development, impairment of goodwill, amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets and
charges for deferred compensation (which are reflected in operating expenses). Total
acquisition-related costs in the categories identified above were $23.2 million in fiscal 2006,
$26.8 million in fiscal 2005 and $33.6 million in fiscal 2004. Although under current accounting
rules goodwill is no longer amortized, we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill
already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions. We test the impairment of
goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment
arise. The timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in
our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods. For
example, at the end of fiscal 2004 we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of $18.7 million
related to our Intuit Public Sector Solutions business, which was subsequently sold. At July 31,
2006, we had goodwill of $505.0 million and unamortized purchased intangible assets of $59.5
million on our balance sheet, both of which could be subject to impairment charges in the future.
New acquisitions, and any impairment of the value of purchased assets, could have a significant
negative impact on our future operating results.

If we fail to operate our payroll business effectively our revenue and earnings will be harmed.

Our payroll business handles a significant amount of dollar and transaction volume. Due to the
size and volume of transactions that we handle, effective processing systems and controls are
essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately. Despite our efforts, it is
possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated. In addition to any direct
damages and fines that any such problems would create, which could be substantial, the loss of
customer confidence in our accuracy and controls would seriously harm our business. Our payroll
business has grown largely through acquisitions and our systems are comprised of multiple
technology platforms that are difficult to scale. We must constantly continue to upgrade our
systems and processes to ensure that we process customer data in an accurate, reliable and timely
manner. These upgrades must also meet the various regulatory requirements and deadlines associated
with employer-related payroll activities. Any failure of our systems or processes in critical
switch-over times, such as in January when many businesses elect to change payroll service
providers, would be detrimental to our business. If we failed to timely deliver any of our payroll
products, it could cause our current and prospective customers to choose a competitor’s product for
that year’s payroll and not to purchase Intuit products in the future. If these efforts are not
successful our revenue growth and profitability will decline.

Interest income attributable to payroll customer deposits may fluctuate or be eliminated, causing
our revenue and earnings to decline.

We currently record revenue from interest earned on customer deposits that we hold pending payment
of funds to taxing authorities or to customers’ employees. If interest rates decline, or there are
regulatory changes that diminish the amount of time that we are required or permitted to hold such
funds, our interest revenue will decline.

We may be unable to attract and retain key personnel.

Much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel,
including members of our executive team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions.
Experienced personnel in the software and services industries are in high demand and competition
for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley and San Diego, California, where the
majority of our employees are located. Although we strive to be an employer of choice, we may not
be able to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel which would cause our business
to suffer.



We are frequently a party to litigation that is costly to defend and consumes the time of our
management.

Due to our financial position and the large number of customers that we serve we are often forced
to defend litigation. See Item 3,

“Legal Proceedings,”

for information regarding specific pending
litigation. Defending litigation consumes the time of our management and is expensive for Intuit.
Even though we often seek insurance coverage for litigation defense costs, there is no assurance
that our defense costs, which can be substantial, will be covered in all cases. In addition, by
its nature, litigation is unpredictable and we may not prevail even in cases where we strongly
believe a plaintiff’s case has no valid claims. If we do not prevail in litigation we may be
required to pay substantial monetary damages or alter our business operations. Regardless of the
outcome, litigation is expensive and consumes the time of our management and may ultimately reduce
our income.

Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future financial results.

Our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes
in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their
interpretation. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax
returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the
likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our
provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous
examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.

If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to detect fraud
or report our financial results accurately, which could harm our business and the trading price of
our common stock.

We periodically assess our system of internal controls, and the internal controls of service
providers upon which we rely, to review their effectiveness and identify potential areas of
improvement. In addition, from time to time we acquire businesses, many of which have limited
infrastructure and systems of internal controls. Performing assessments of internal controls,
implementing necessary changes, and maintaining an effective controls environment is expensive and
requires considerable management attention. Internal control systems are designed in part upon
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and all such systems, however well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
system are met. Because of the inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
If we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls or prevent fraud, we
could suffer losses, could be subject to costly litigation, investors could lose confidence in our
reported financial information and our brand and operating results could be harmed.

We and our independent registered public accounting firm must certify the adequacy of our internal
controls over financial reporting annually. Identification of material weaknesses in internal
controls over financial reporting could harm our competitive position in our business, especially
our payroll business.

Business interruptions could adversely affect our future operating results.

Several of our major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake, fire, power
shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, and other events beyond our control. The
majority of our research and development activities, our corporate headquarters, our principal
information technology systems, and other critical business operations are located near major
seismic faults. We do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses. While we
maintain disaster recovery facilities for key data centers that support the information systems,
networks and databases that are necessary to operate our business, we are still in the process of
establishing disaster recovery facilities for some of our data centers. Our operating results and
financial condition could be materially harmed in the event of a major earthquake or other natural
or man-made disaster.

The leases for our existing San Diego, California office space expire in 2007. In fiscal 2005
and fiscal 2006 we entered into agreements under which we will lease approximately 466,000 square
feet of office space in four buildings to be constructed by the landlord in San Diego. The lease
term will begin upon the date we first occupy the buildings, which we expect to occur in the summer
of 2007. The lease term will end on the later of August 31, 2017 or ten years after the date we
first occupy the buildings.

We also lease or own facilities in a number of other domestic locations and internationally in the
United Kingdom and several other locations. We believe our facilities are adequate for our current
and near-term needs, and that we will be able to locate additional facilities as needed. See Note
10 to the financial statements for more information about our lease commitments.



ITEM 3

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Stock Option-Related Matters

In light
of media reports alleging improper stock option granting practices by
public companies, including a report
from the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, in May 2006 we began a voluntary review of our
historical stock option grant activities and related accounting treatment. Our Board of Directors
formed a special committee of independent directors to conduct this review with the assistance of
independent legal counsel and independent forensic accounting support. The primary scope of this
review covered the period from August 1, 1997 to the present. Subsequent to our initiation of this
review, we received an informal inquiry from the Securities and Exchange Commission and a subpoena
from the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California requesting documents
relating to our historical stock option granting practices. We have fully cooperated with both of
these inquiries and will continue to do so. On August 16, 2006 we announced the completion of our
independent review, which uncovered no evidence of fraud or intentional wrongdoing in our
historical stock option granting practices. We have reported this conclusion to the SEC and the
United States Attorney.

Muriel Siebert & Co., Inc. v. Intuit Inc., Index No. 03-602942, Supreme Court of the State of New
York, County of New York.

On September 17, 2003 Muriel Siebert & Co., Inc. filed a complaint against Intuit alleging various
claims for breach of contract, breach of express and implied covenants of good faith and fair
dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, misrepresentation and/or fraud, and promissory estoppel. The
allegations relate to Quicken Brokerage powered by Siebert, a strategic alliance between the two
companies. The complaint seeks compensatory damages of up to $11.1 million, punitive damages of up
to $33.0 million and other damages. Intuit unsuccessfully sought to compel the matter to
arbitration. On February 7, 2005 Intuit filed a motion to dismiss all but one of the plaintiff’s
claims in New York state court. On September 6, 2005 the court dismissed Siebert’s fraud and
punitive damages claims. The case is now stayed pending appellate review by the Appellate Division
of the New York Supreme Court of certain procedural issues in the case. Intuit believes this
lawsuit is without merit and will vigorously defend the litigation.

Other Litigation Matters

Intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened
litigation, that arise in the normal course of our business, including assertions that we may be
infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others. We currently believe that the
ultimate amount of liability, if any, for any pending claims of any type (either alone or combined)
will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We also
believe that we would be able to obtain any necessary licenses or other rights to disputed
intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms. However, the ultimate outcome of any
litigation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on Intuit
because of defense costs, negative publicity, diversion of management resources and other factors.
Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual
property claims could adversely affect our business.

Intuit has never paid any cash dividends on its common stock. From time to time we consider the
advisability of paying a cash dividend. We currently anticipate that we will retain all future
earnings for use in our business and for repurchases under our stock repurchase programs. We do not
anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

Our Board of Directors authorized a two-for-one stock split which was effected in the form of a
100% stock dividend on July 6, 2006 to stockholders of record on June 21, 2006.

ITEM 6

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following tables show Intuit’s selected financial information for the past five fiscal years.
The comparability of the information is affected by a variety of factors, including acquisitions
and divestitures of businesses, share-based compensation expense, amortization and impairment of
goodwill and purchased intangible assets, gains and losses related to marketable equity securities
and other investments, and repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs.

Our Board of Directors authorized a two-for-one stock split which was effected in the form of a
100% stock dividend on July 6, 2006 to stockholders of record on June 21, 2006. All share and per
share figures in the selected financial data below retroactively reflect this stock split.

We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment,”

on
August 1, 2005 using the modified prospective transition method. Operating income from continuing
operations for fiscal 2006 included $66.0 million in pre-tax share-based compensation expense for
stock options and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan that we recorded as a result of adopting SFAS
123(R). Because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method, results for prior
periods have not been restated to include share-based compensation expense for stock options or our
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. We adopted SFAS 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”

on
August 1, 2002 and stopped amortizing goodwill on that date. Fiscal 2002 operating income from
continuing operations included $122.6 million in goodwill amortization.

We sold our Intuit Information Technology Solutions business in fiscal 2006, our Intuit Public
Sector Solutions business in fiscal 2005, our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, in
fiscal 2003 and our Quicken Loans mortgage business in fiscal 2002. We accounted for these
businesses as discontinued operations and, accordingly, we have reclassified the selected financial
data for all periods prior to the sales to reflect them as such. To better understand the
information in the tables, investors should read

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations”

in Item 7, and the financial statements and related notes in
Item 8.

ITEM 7

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A)
includes the following sections:

•

Executive Overview that discusses at a high level our operating results and some of the
trends that affect our business.

•

Critical Accounting Policies that we believe are important to understanding the
assumptions and judgments underlying our financial statements.

•

Results of Operations that begins with an overview followed by a more detailed
discussion of our revenue and expenses.

•

Liquidity and Capital Resources which discusses key aspects of our statements of cash
flows, changes in our balance sheets and our financial commitments.

You should note that this MD&A discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks
and uncertainties. Please see the section entitled

“Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors”

at
the beginning of Item 1A for important information to consider when evaluating such statements.

You should read this MD&A in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in Item 8.
As discussed below, we sold our Intuit Information Technology Solutions business in fiscal 2006 and
our Intuit Public Sector Solutions business in fiscal 2005. We accounted for these businesses as
discontinued operations and have accordingly reclassified our financial statements for all periods
prior to the sales to reflect them as discontinued operations. Unless otherwise noted, the
following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations.

Our Board of Directors authorized a two-for-one stock split which was effected in the form of a
100% stock dividend on July 6, 2006 to stockholders of record on June 21, 2006. All share and per
share figures in this Item 7 and in the statements of operations and notes to the financial
statements in Item 8 retroactively reflect this stock split.

Executive Overview

This overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that
affect our business. We believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to
understand our financial results for fiscal 2006 as well as our future prospects. This summary is
not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion
and analysis provided elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Overview of Financial Results

Total net revenue for fiscal 2006 was $2.3 billion, up 15% compared with fiscal 2005. Three
quarters of the fiscal 2006 revenue increase was due to growth in our Consumer Tax and Payroll and
Payments segments. Consumer Tax revenue was 25% higher in fiscal 2006, driven by a 57% increase in
federal TurboTax Online units sold and to a lesser extent by growth in revenue from attach services
such as electronic filing. We believe that the continuing trend among individual taxpayers toward
the use of both online and desktop software, rather than manual methods, to prepare their own
income tax returns will continue to be important to the growth of our Consumer Tax business.
Payroll and Payments revenue was 24% higher in fiscal 2006, with combined payroll offerings
accounting for slightly more than half of the increase and merchant services representing slightly
less than half of the increase. See

“Total Net Revenue”

below for additional information.

We recorded operating income from continuing operations of $559.5 million for fiscal 2006 compared
with $524.1 million for fiscal 2005. Operating income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006
was reduced by $66.0 million in pre-tax share-based compensation expense for stock options and our
Employee Stock Purchase Plan that we recorded as a result of our adoption of SFAS 123(R) on August
1, 2005. The revenue growth that we experienced in fiscal 2006 was partially offset by these
share-based compensation expenses and by higher spending for new product development, marketing and
customer support.

Our net income from continuing operations of $377.4 million for fiscal 2006 was flat compared with
$375.0 million for fiscal 2005. Our net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 would
have been approximately $80 million lower if it had included pro forma share-based compensation
expense and excluded certain discrete tax benefits. Diluted net income per share from continuing
operations of $1.05 for fiscal 2006 increased 6% compared with $0.99 for fiscal 2005 due to the net
reduction in average shares outstanding. Average shares outstanding declined as a result of
repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs, partially offset by the issuance
of shares in connection with the exercise of stock options and purchases under our Employee Stock
Purchase Plan.

In December 2005 we sold our Intuit Information Technology Solutions (ITS) business for
approximately $200 million in cash. The decision to sell ITS was a result of our desire to focus
resources on our core products and services. We recorded total net income from ITS discontinued
operations of $39.5 million or $0.11 per diluted share for fiscal 2006, including $34.3 million or
$0.10 per share for the net gain on disposal of that business.

In May 2006 we sold our Master Builder construction management software and solutions business,
which was part of Intuit Construction Business Solutions in our Other Businesses segment. The
Master Builder business had quarterly revenue of approximately $5 million. We recorded a $7.7
million net loss on disposal of the business, including income tax expense of $10.1 million. In
accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-lived Assets,”

we have not accounted for this transaction as a discontinued operation.

We ended fiscal 2006 with cash and investments totaling $1.2 billion. In fiscal 2006 we generated
cash from continuing operations, from the sale of our ITS business and from the issuance of common
stock under employee stock plans. In this period we used $784.2 million in cash for repurchases of
common stock under our stock repurchase programs. At July 31, 2006, authorized funds of $506.6
million remained available for stock repurchases.

Seasonality

Our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Professional Tax businesses are highly seasonal. Some of our other
offerings are also seasonal, but to a lesser extent. Revenue from many of our small business
software products, including QuickBooks, tends to be concentrated around calendar year end. Sales
of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from
November through April. As a result, our total net revenue is



usually highest during our second quarter ending January 31 and third quarter ending April 30. We
typically report losses in our first quarter ending October 31 and fourth quarter ending July 31,
when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively
consistent levels.

Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a
significant impact on our net revenue, operating income or loss and net income or loss, as well as
on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. We believe that the estimates,
assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest
potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting
policies. Senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting
policies and their disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Audit Committee of our
Board of Directors.

Net Revenue — Revenue Recognition

We derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products, license fees, software
subscriptions, product support, professional services, payroll services, merchant services,
transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items.
We follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue. For additional
information, see

“Net Revenue”

in Note 1 to the financial statements. We generally recognize
revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or
performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. However,
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions
and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. For
example, for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to
allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver, to determine whether
undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services, to
determine whether vendor-specific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to
determine whether and when each element has been delivered. If we were to change any of these
assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue
that we report in a particular period. Amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to
arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred
revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied.

In connection with the sale of certain products, we provide a limited amount of free technical
support assistance to customers. We do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with
sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant.
The technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is
recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent.

Net Revenue — Return and Rebate Reserves

As part of our revenue recognition policy, we estimate future product returns and rebate payments
and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates. Our return
policy allows distributors and retailers, subject to contractual limitations, to return purchased
products. Product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of excess
and obsolete products. In determining our product returns reserves, we consider the volume and
price mix of products in the retail channel, historical return rates for prior releases of the
product, trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our
products (including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products). We
fully reserve for excess and obsolete products in the distribution channels.

Our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and end-user rebates.
Our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors’
and retailers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs, which we
typically establish annually. Our reserves for end-user rebates are estimated based on the terms
and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program, actual sales during the promotion and
historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program.

In the past, actual returns and rebates have not differed significantly from the reserves that we
have established. However, actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently
uncertain. If we were to change our assumptions and estimates, our revenue reserves would change,
which would impact the net revenue we report. If



actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established, the
actual results would decrease our future reported revenue. Conversely, if actual returns and
rebates are significantly less than our reserves, this would increase our future reported revenue.
For example, if we had increased our fiscal 2006 returns reserves by 1% of non-consignment sales to
retailers for QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken, our fiscal 2006 total net revenue would have been
$3.5 million lower.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. The accounts
receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid. In
determining the amount of the reserve, we consider our historical level of credit losses. We also
make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit
evaluations, and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in
the future. Our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses. However,
since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we
cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. If actual credit losses are
significantly greater than the reserve we have established, that would increase our general and
administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income. Conversely, if actual credit losses are
significantly less than our reserve, this would eventually decrease our general and administrative
expenses and increase our reported net income.

Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets – Impairment Assessments

We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other long-lived
assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary impairment
in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist. We test the
impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of
impairment arise. The timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of
operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior
periods. In order to estimate the fair value of long-lived assets, we typically make various
assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to, consider market
factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business.
We evaluate cash flows at the lowest operating level and the number of reporting units that we have
identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting
units and integrated operations following acquisitions. Based on these assumptions and estimates,
we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated
on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future
values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a
variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal
factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe
the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate,
different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. More
conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in
impairment charges, which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance
sheet. Conversely, less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges,
higher net income and higher asset values. In fiscal 2004 we recorded an impairment charge of $18.7
million on goodwill associated with our Intuit Public Sector Solutions business, which was
subsequently sold. At July 31, 2006 we had $505.0 million in goodwill and $59.5 million in net
purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet.

Accounting for Share-Based Compensation Plans

Prior to August 1, 2005, we accounted for our share-based employee compensation plans under the
measurement and recognition provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,”

and related Interpretations, as permitted by Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.”

We recorded no share-based employee compensation expense
for options granted under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan or its predecessor plans prior to August
1, 2005 as all options granted under those plans had exercise prices equal to the fair market value
of our common stock on the date of grant. We also recorded no compensation expense in connection
with our Employee Stock Purchase Plan as the purchase price of the stock was not less than 85% of
the lower of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning of each offering period or
at the end of each purchase period. In accordance with SFAS 123 and SFAS 148,

“Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation –



Transition and Disclosure,”

we disclosed our net income or loss and net income or loss per share as
if we had applied the fair value-based method in measuring compensation expense for our share-based
incentive programs.

Effective August 1, 2005, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment,”

using the modified prospective transition method. Under that transition
method, compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date includes: (a) period
compensation expense for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of,
August 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
provisions of SFAS 123, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, and (b) period compensation expense for
all share-based payments granted on or after August 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). Because we elected to use the modified
prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. At July 31, 2006,
there was $103.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based
compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to
expense in the future. Total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in
estimated forfeitures. We expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of
2.2 years.

We estimate the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and
the assumptions shown in Note 12 to the financial statements. Beginning in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2006, we estimated the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns
using a binomial model. Prior to that, we estimated the expected term of options granted based on
historical exercise patterns. We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant
based on the implied volatility of publicly traded one-year and two-year options on our common
stock, consistent with SFAS 123(R) and Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 107. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded
options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of
future stock price trends than historical volatility. We base the risk-free interest rate that we
use in the Black-Scholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of
option grant on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms. We have never
paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in
the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the
Black-Scholes option valuation model. SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate forfeitures at the time
of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based
compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. For options granted before
August 1, 2005, we amortize the fair value on an accelerated basis. This is the same basis on which
we amortized options granted before August 1, 2005 for our pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123.
For options granted on or after August 1, 2005, we amortize the fair value on a straight-line
basis. All options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are
generally the vesting periods. We may elect to use different assumptions under the Black-Scholes
option valuation model in the future, which could materially affect our net income or loss and net
income or loss per share.

In May 2006 we began a voluntary review of our historical stock option granting activities and
related accounting treatment. Our Board of Directors formed a special committee of independent
directors to conduct this review with the assistance of independent legal counsel and independent
forensic accounting support. The primary scope of this review covered the period from August 1,
1997 to the present. On August 16, 2006 we announced the completion of our independent review,
which uncovered no evidence of fraud or intentional wrongdoing in our historical stock option
granting practices. See Item 3,

“Legal Proceedings,”

and Note 15 to the financial statements.

Legal Contingencies

We are subject to certain legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation
that arise in the normal course of our business. We review the status of each significant matter
quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or
legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a
liability and an expense for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the
determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable.
Our accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information
becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation
and may revise our estimates. Potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of
potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial
position.



Income Taxes – Estimates of Effective Tax Rates, Deferred Taxes and Valuation Allowance

When we prepare our financial statements, we estimate our income taxes based on the various
jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our
worldwide income tax provision. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the
United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to
which, additional taxes will be due. We record an additional amount in our provision for income
taxes in the period in which we determine that our recorded tax liability is less than we expect
the ultimate tax assessment to be. If in a later period we determine that payment of this
additional amount is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit in that
later period. As a result, our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the audit issues and
related tax positions require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective tax
rate and materially affect our operating results. This also requires us to estimate our current tax
exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items
for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities,
which we show on our balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets
will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation
allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting
period, we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations.

Our net deferred tax asset at July 31, 2006 was $191.9 million, net of the valuation allowance of
$4.4 million. We recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be
able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets (consisting primarily of certain state capital loss
and net operating loss carryforwards) before they expire. The valuation allowance is based on our
estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our
deferred tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing
the need for the valuation allowance, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance to
take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in
the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax
provision and net income in the period in which we make the increase.

Total net revenue increased 15% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005, driven by strong
growth in our Consumer Tax and Payroll and Payments segments. Consumer Tax revenue was 25% higher
in fiscal 2006, driven by a 57%
increase in federal TurboTax Online units sold and to a lesser extent by growth in revenue from
attach services such as electronic filing. Payroll and Payments revenue increased 24% in fiscal
2006. See

“Total Net Revenue”

below for additional information.

Effective August 1, 2005, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment,”

using the modified prospective transition method. Under that transition
method, compensation expense that we recognized for the twelve months ended July 31, 2006 included:
(a) period compensation expense for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested
as of, August 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
provisions of SFAS 123, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, and (b) period compensation expense for
all share-based payments granted on or after August 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). In fiscal 2006 we recorded pre-tax
share-based compensation expense for stock options and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan totaling
$66.0 million or $0.12 per diluted share as a result of our adoption of SFAS 123(R). Because we
elected to use the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been
restated.

At July 31, 2006, there was $103.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which
we will amortize to expense in the future. Total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted
for future changes in estimated forfeitures. We expect to recognize that cost over a weighted
average vesting period of 2.2 years.

Excluding the share-based compensation expense for stock options and our Employee Stock Purchase
Plan that we recorded in accordance with SFAS 123(R), higher revenue in fiscal 2006 was partially
offset by higher expenses of approximately $75 million for new product development and
approximately $60 million for additional advertising and other marketing programs and improved
customer support service levels. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was approximately 38%,
compared with approximately 33% for fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2005 our effective tax rate benefited
from the reversal of approximately $25.7 million in reserves related to potential income tax
exposures that were resolved. If we had excluded these and other discrete tax benefits from our
fiscal 2005 effective tax rate, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 would have been
approximately five percentage points higher and our net income from continuing operations for that
period would have been approximately $30 million lower. Our diluted net income per share from
continuing operations increased more rapidly than our net income from continuing operations in
fiscal 2006 due to the net reduction of average shares outstanding. Average shares outstanding
declined as a result of repurchases of 31.0 million shares under our stock repurchase programs,
partially offset by the issuance of 16.6 million shares in connection with the exercise of stock
options and purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

In December 2005 we sold our Intuit Information Technology Solutions (ITS) business for
approximately $200 million in cash. The buyer deposited approximately $20 million of the total
purchase price in a third-party escrow account to be held through December 2006 to cover breaches
of representations and warranties set forth in the purchase agreement, should they arise. The full
escrow amount is included in other current assets on our balance sheet at July 31, 2006. We
recorded total net income from ITS discontinued operations of $39.5 million or $0.11 per diluted
share in fiscal 2006, including $34.3 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the net gain on
disposal of that business.

In May 2006 we sold our Master Builder construction management software and solutions business,
which was part of Intuit Construction Business Solutions in our Other Businesses segment. The
Master Builder business had quarterly revenue of approximately $5 million. We recorded a $7.7
million net loss on disposal of the business, including income tax expense of $10.1 million. In
accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-lived Assets,”

we have not accounted for this transaction as a discontinued operation.

At July 31, 2006, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of
$202.9 million from July 31, 2005. In fiscal 2006 we generated $595.5 million in cash from
continuing operations, approximately $200 million in cash from the sale of our ITS business and
$279.3 million in cash from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. During the
same period, we repurchased 31.0 million shares of our common stock under our repurchase programs
at an average price of $25.28 for a total price of $784.2 million. At July 31, 2006, authorized
funds of $506.6 million remained available for stock repurchases.



Total Net Revenue

The table below and the discussion of total net revenue that follows it are organized in accordance
with our five reportable business segments. See Note 8 to the financial statements for descriptions
of product, service and other revenue for each segment.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we revised our reportable segments to reflect the way we
currently manage and view our business. We transferred our QuickBooks Payroll and merchant services
businesses from our fiscal 2005 QuickBooks-Related segment to a new segment called Payroll and
Payments and renamed our QuickBooks-Related segment QuickBooks. We also transferred our outsourced
payroll business from our fiscal 2005 Intuit-Branded Small Business segment to the new Payroll and
Payments segment. Finally, we transferred the remaining businesses in our fiscal 2005
Intuit-Branded Small Business segment to our Other Businesses segment. We made no changes to our
Consumer Tax and Professional Tax segments. We have reclassified previously reported fiscal 2005
and 2004 segment results to be consistent with the fiscal 2006 presentation.

Total Net Revenue by Business Segment

QuickBooks

Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005

. QuickBooks total net revenue increased $31.6 million or 6%
in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Total QuickBooks software unit sales were up 14% in
fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. This higher unit volume more than offset lower average
selling prices for QuickBooks software due to price reductions for new users and the elimination of
upgrade rebates. We believe that the higher unit volume was a result of product improvements,
successful execution of our QuickBooks 2006 product launch and growth in the category that was
driven by publicity surrounding a significant new market entrant.

Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004.

QuickBooks total net revenue increased $29.7 million or 6%
in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 on 18% higher unit volume resulting from an increase in
new customers and on proportionately more sales of our higher priced products (favorable product
mix).

Payroll and Payments

Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005

. Payroll and Payments total net revenue increased $90.2
million or 24% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Our combined payroll offerings accounted
for slightly more than half of the fiscal 2006 revenue increase while our merchant services
represented slightly less than half of the revenue increase. QuickBooks Payroll revenue was 23%
higher in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 because of a combination of favorable product mix,
7% growth in the customer base and the residual effects of a price increase that we implemented in
fiscal 2005. Revenue from our other payroll offerings increased 11% in fiscal 2006, driven by 17%
growth in the number of QuickBooks Assisted Payroll and Complete Payroll customers processing
payrolls, price increases and increased interest income on funds held for payroll customers,
partially offset by attrition in the Premier Payroll Service customer base. Merchant services
revenue increased 47% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 due to 32% growth in the customer
base and 18% higher transaction volume per customer in fiscal 2006.

Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004.

Payroll and Payments total net revenue increased $80.5
million or 28% in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. Our merchant services accounted for
slightly more than half of the fiscal 2005 revenue increase while our combined payroll offerings
represented slightly less than half of the revenue increase. The 99% increase in merchant services
revenue was due to growth in the customer base, higher transaction volume per customer and our
discontinuation of the outsourcing of certain merchant processing services beginning in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2005 we completed the transition to recognizing the full revenue
from processing merchant transactions that were formerly processed through two major banks rather
than the smaller profit-sharing fees we would have received under our prior arrangement with those
banks. We recorded fees for outsourced merchant processing services as Other revenue while we
recorded fees for merchant processing services we perform ourselves as Service revenue. QuickBooks
Payroll revenue was 20% higher in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 because of growth in the
customer base, price increases and the successful launch of our higher-priced Enhanced Payroll
offering, including its bundling with unspecified Quickbooks software upgrades. Revenue from our
other payroll businesses increased 10% in fiscal 2005, driven by growth in the number of QuickBooks
Assisted Payroll and Complete Payroll customers processing payrolls, price increases and higher
interest income on funds held for payroll customers, partially offset by attrition in the Premier
Payroll Service customer base.

Consumer Tax

Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005.

Consumer Tax total net revenue increased $139.8 million or
25% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Paid federal TurboTax unit sales were up 20% in
fiscal 2006, driven by a 57% increase in federal TurboTax Online units sold which accounted for the
majority of the revenue increase for that period. To a lesser extent, higher fiscal 2006 revenue
was due to growth in revenue from attach services such as electronic filing. We believe that the
continuing trend among individual taxpayers toward the use of both online and desktop software,
rather than manual methods, to prepare their own income tax returns will continue to be important
to the growth of our Consumer Tax business. We also believe that fiscal 2006 Consumer Tax revenue
growth was positively affected by changes in our offering and pricing strategies that included
eliminating rebates and bundling federal and state consumer tax products. These changes were
designed to simplify our offerings in response to customer feedback.



Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004

. Consumer Tax total net revenue increased $80.7 million or
16% in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 due to 20% higher federal TurboTax Online units and to
volume and price increases in electronic filing and other attach services.

Professional Tax

Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005.

Professional Tax total net revenue increased $7.9 million
or 3% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 due to overall growth in the Professional Tax
customer base that was partially offset by a shift in product mix toward our lower priced
offerings.

Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004

. Professional Tax total net revenue increased $13.1 million
or 5% in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 due to an increase in Lacerte product revenue driven
by improved customer retention rates and to bank product transmission services volume from our new
ProSeries Express product.

Other Businesses

Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005.

Other Businesses total net revenue increased $35.1 million
or 11% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Quicken revenue was 3% lower in fiscal 2006.
Canadian revenue increased 23% in fiscal 2006 due to strong growth in sales of QuickBooks products
and to a lesser extent to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004

. Other Businesses total net revenue increased $31.5 million
or 11% in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. Quicken revenue was 3% higher in fiscal 2005 due
to growth in our bill payment customer base. Canadian revenue increased 17% in fiscal 2005 due to
market share gains for QuickBooks software and higher subscription revenue for payroll services
that was driven by improvements in service levels.

Our cost of revenue has four components: (1) cost of product revenue, which includes the
direct costs of manufacturing and shipping our software products; (2) cost of service revenue,
which reflects direct costs associated with providing services, including data center costs related
to delivering Internet-based services; (3) cost of other revenue, which includes costs associated
with revenue sharing and online transactions revenue; and (4) amortization of purchased intangible
assets, which represents the cost of amortizing over their useful lives developed technologies that
we obtained through acquisitions.

Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005.

Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue
was the same in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Growth in TurboTax units came
disproportionately through our web TurboTax offer, which has lower costs per unit than our desktop
offerings. This was offset by higher cost of product revenue in our QuickBooks segment, which
resulted from 14% QuickBooks unit growth. Cost of service revenue as a percentage of service
revenue was the same in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Growth in our Consumer Tax
electronic filing revenue, Assisted Payroll revenue and merchant services revenue, all of which had
lower relative cost increases associated with their related revenue increases, was offset by higher
costs in our QuickBooks segment, which resulted from improvements in service levels for technical
support plan customers.



Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004

. Cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue
decreased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 due to growth in our Consumer Tax electronic
filing revenue and merchant services revenue, both of which had minimal cost increases associated
with the related revenue increases, and to customer service efficiencies in our small business
payroll business.

Individually and in the aggregate, operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue
were generally consistent in the periods presented. Total operating expenses in dollars increased
$216.1 million in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Share-based compensation expense for stock
options and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan that we recorded as a result of our adoption of SFAS
123(R) on August 1, 2005 accounted for $63.0 million of that increase. In fiscal 2006 total
operating expenses also increased by approximately $75 million for new product development and
approximately $60 million for additional advertising and other marketing programs and improved
customer support service levels, particularly in our QuickBooks and Consumer Tax segments.
Excluding the impact of share-based compensation expense, sales and marketing expense as a
percentage of revenue declined due to lower direct selling costs associated with our fiscal 2006
focus on the retail channel. We continue to invest in research and development and expect that our
fiscal 2007 research and development expenses as a percentage of total net revenue will be higher
than they were in fiscal 2006. Total operating expenses in dollars increased $111.1 million in
fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 due to spending for infrastructure, implementation of our new
information systems, new product development and promotion, and Sarbanes-Oxley compliance.

Segment Operating Income (Loss)

Segment operating income or loss is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating
expenses. Segment expenses do not include certain costs, such as corporate general and
administrative expenses and share-based compensation expenses, which are not allocated to specific
segments. These unallocated costs totaled $466.3 million in fiscal 2006, $383.0 million in fiscal
2005 and $344.7 million in fiscal 2004. Share-based compensation expenses for stock options and our
Employee Stock Purchase Plan that we began recording in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 accounted
for $66.0 million of the increase in unallocated costs for fiscal 2006. See Note 1 and Note 12 to
the financial statements. Segment expenses also do not include amortization of purchased intangible
assets, acquisition-related charges, and impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets. In
addition, segment expenses do not include interest and other income and realized net gains or
losses on marketable equity securities
and other investments. See Note 8 to the financial statements for reconciliations of total segment
operating income to income from continuing operations for each fiscal year presented.

QuickBooks

Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005.

QuickBooks segment operating income and segment operating
income as a percentage of related revenue decreased in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005.
Higher fiscal 2006 QuickBooks revenue resulted from higher unit volume that more than offset the
impact of lower average selling prices. However, lower average selling prices yielded lower profit
per unit. Higher unit volume in fiscal 2006 resulted in higher customer support costs. We also
spent more on QuickBooks product development and on improvements to technical support service
levels in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005.

Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004

. QuickBooks segment operating income as a percentage of
related revenue was the same in fiscal 2005 and 2004. The fiscal 2005 revenue increase of 6% was
offset by increased spending for QuickBooks product development, technical support and marketing.

Payroll and Payments

Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005.

Payroll and Payments segment operating income as a
percentage of related revenue increased in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. More of the
revenue growth in that segment came from products and services with lower costs of revenue, such as
QuickBooks Payroll and merchant services.

Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004.

Payroll and Payments segment operating income as a
percentage of related revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. More of the
revenue growth in that segment came from products and services with lower costs of revenue, such as
QuickBooks Payroll and merchant services. Outsourced payroll revenue growth combined with customer
service efficiencies, the consolidation of regional sales facilities and a reorganization of the
sales force that resulted in lower spending in that business also contributed to the improvement in
segment operating income in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004.

Consumer Tax

Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005.

Consumer Tax segment operating income as a percentage of
related revenue was nearly the same in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Higher revenue and
lower rebate processing fees were partially offset by higher expenses for television and web
advertising and to a lesser extent for product development and customer support in fiscal 2006.

Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004.

Consumer Tax segment operating income as a percentage of
related revenue was slightly higher in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. Higher revenue from
TurboTax federal units and volume and price increases in electronic filing and refund transfer
services was offset by higher expenses for advertising, product development, customer support and
retail merchandising.



Professional Tax

Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005.

Professional Tax segment operating income as a percentage
of related revenue was the same in fiscal 2006 and 2005. Revenue and operating expenses were
similar in the two periods.

Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004.

Professional Tax segment operating income as a percentage
of related revenue decreased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. A 5% revenue increase was
more than offset by higher spending for overall customer support and for product development and
marketing related to our new ProSeries Basic and ProSeries Express products in fiscal 2005.

Other Businesses

Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005.

Other Businesses segment operating income as a percentage of
related revenue was the same in fiscal 2006 and 2005. Quicken revenue was slightly lower while
expenses to develop and market new offerings increased in fiscal 2006. Higher revenue combined with
relatively stable spending produced better operating margins in Canada.

Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004.

Other Businesses segment operating income as a percentage
of related revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. Quicken revenue was higher
while Quicken cost of revenue was relatively flat in fiscal 2005 due to savings resulting from the
outsourcing of our Quicken.com web site. Higher revenue and relatively stable spending resulted in
an increase in segment operating income in Canada.

license and distribution agreements that we entered into when we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage
business in July 2002.

Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate was approximately 38% for fiscal 2006, approximately 33% for fiscal 2005 and
approximately 28% for fiscal 2004. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 differed from the federal
statutory rate due to state income taxes and the taxable gain on the sale of our Master Builder
business, which were partially offset by the benefit we received from tax exempt interest income,
federal and state research and experimental credits and the domestic production activities
deduction. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 differed from the federal statutory rate due to
the net effect of the reversal of $25.7 million in reserves related to potential income tax
exposures that were resolved, the federal research and experimental credit and to the benefit
received from tax-exempt interest income offset by state taxes. Our effective tax rate for fiscal
2004 differed from the federal statutory rate due to the net effect of the reversal of $35.7
million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved, the federal
research and experimental credit and to the benefit received from tax-exempt interest income offset
by state taxes and acquisition-related charges. See Note 11 to the financial statements.



At July 31, 2006 we had net deferred tax assets of $191.9 million, which included a valuation
allowance of $4.4 million for certain state capital loss and net operating loss carryforwards. The
allowance reflects management’s assessment that we may not receive the benefit of certain loss
carryforwards in certain state jurisdictions. While we believe our current valuation allowance is
sufficient, it may be necessary to increase this amount if it becomes more likely that we will not
realize a greater portion of the net deferred tax assets. We assess the need for an adjustment to
the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. See Note 11 to the financial statements.

Dispositions and Discontinued Operations

Sale of Master Builder Business

In May 2006 we sold our Master Builder construction management software and solutions business,
which was part of Intuit Construction Business Solutions in our Other Businesses segment. The
Master Builder business had quarterly revenue of approximately $5 million. We recorded a $7.7
million net loss on disposal of the business, including income tax expense of $10.1 million. In
accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-lived Assets,”

we have not accounted for this transaction as a discontinued operation. See
Note 7 to the financial statements.

Intuit Information Technology Solutions Discontinued Operations

In May 2005 our Board of Directors formally approved a plan to sell our Intuit Information
Technology Solutions (ITS) business. In December 2005 we sold ITS for approximately $200 million in
cash. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, we have segregated the operating results of
ITS from continuing operations in our statements of operations for all periods prior to the sale.
We recorded a $34.3 million net gain on disposal of ITS which is included in net income from
discontinued operations in our fiscal 2006 statement of operations. See Note 7 to the financial
statements.

Intuit Public Sector Solutions Discontinued Operations

In December 2004 we sold our Intuit Public Sector Solutions (IPSS) business for approximately $11
million in cash and accounted for the sale as a discontinued operation. In accordance with SFAS
144, we have segregated the operating results of IPSS from continuing operations in our statements
of operations for all periods prior to the sale. In fiscal 2005 we recorded a $4.8 million net loss
on disposal of IPSS that included an income tax provision of $4.3 million for the estimated tax
payable in connection with the expected tax gain on the transaction. These amounts are included in
net income from discontinued operations in our fiscal 2005 statement of operations. The fiscal 2004
net loss from Intuit Public Sector Solutions discontinued operations included a goodwill impairment
charge of $18.7 million. See Note 7 to the financial statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Statements of Cash Flows

At July 31, 2006 our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of
$202.9 million from July 31, 2005. We generated $595.5 million in cash from continuing operations
during fiscal 2006. We also generated cash from the sale of our ITS business for approximately $200
million in cash. We used cash for financing activities during fiscal 2006, primarily for the
repurchase of $784.2 million in common stock under our stock repurchase programs. See Item 5,

“Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers,” “Stock Repurchase
Programs”

below and Note 12 to the financial statements. This was partially offset by proceeds of
$279.3 million that we received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise
of stock options and purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.



The following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal
2006, 2005 and 2004. See the financial statements in Item 8 for complete statements of cash flows

We generated cash from our operating activities during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, primarily
from net income from continuing operations in each of those years. We used cash for investing
activities during fiscal 2006 and 2004, including acquisitions of businesses, net purchases of
available-for-sale debt securities, purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of
internal use software. Purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal use
software offset net sales of available-for-sale securities in fiscal 2005. We used cash for
financing activities in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, primarily for the repurchase of common stock
under our stock repurchase programs. See

“Stock Repurchase Programs”

below and Note 12 to the
financial statements. This was partially offset by proceeds that we received from the issuance of
common stock under employee stock plans in each of these fiscal years.

Stock Split

Our Board of Directors authorized a two-for-one stock split which was effected in the form of a
100% stock dividend on July 6, 2006 to stockholders of record on June 21, 2006. All share and per
share figures in this Item 7 and in the statements of operations and notes to the financial
statements in Item 8 retroactively reflect this stock split.

Stock Repurchase Programs

Our Board of Directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of
common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. During fiscal 2006 we
repurchased 31.0 million shares of our common stock for $784.2 million under our repurchase
programs. At July 31, 2006, authorized funds of $506.6 million remained available for stock
repurchases.



The following table summarizes the historical activity under our stock repurchase programs as of
July 31, 2006. These figures retroactively reflect our July 2006 stock split. See Note 1 and Note

Loans to Executive Officers and Other Employees

Outstanding loans to executive officers and other employees totaled $8.9 million at July 31, 2006
and $9.2 million at July 31, 2005. Loans to executive officers and other employees at July 31, 2006
excluded a $5.0 million secured loan to one executive officer who ceased to be an Intuit employee
in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. We transferred this loan to other long-term assets on our
balance sheet in that quarter.

Loans to executive officers and other employees at July 31, 2006 were relocation loans secured by
real property with original terms of 10 years. Of the total loans at July 31, 2006, $4.4 million
accrue no interest for the term of the note. The remaining loans at that date accrue interest at
rates equal to applicable federal rates in effect at the time the loans were made. At July 31, 2006
no loans were in default and all interest payments were current in accordance with the terms of the
loan agreements. All of the loans were approved by the Compensation and Organizational Development
Committee of our Board of Directors, which consists solely of independent directors. Consistent
with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, no loans to executive officers have been
made or modified since July 30, 2002 and we do not intend to make or modify loans to executive
officers in the future. See Note 16 to the financial statements.

Repurchases of Vested Restricted Stock

In the third quarters of fiscal 2005 and 2004, we entered into share repurchase agreements with
Stephen M. Bennett, our chief executive officer, pursuant to which we repurchased shares of our
common stock from Mr. Bennett at the closing price quoted on The Nasdaq Stock Market on the dates
of repurchase. We repurchased 31,890 shares of our common stock at $20.91 per share from Mr.
Bennett in fiscal 2005 and 34,314 shares at $22.32 per share in fiscal 2004. All of the proceeds
from these repurchases were remitted to federal and state taxing authorities to satisfy Mr.
Bennett’s federal, state and Medicare tax withholding obligations resulting from the vesting of
75,000 shares of our common stock in each of those two quarters under his January 2000 new-hire
restricted stock awards. These repurchases were approved by the Compensation and Organizational
Development Committee of our Board of Directors, which consists solely of independent directors.
See Note 16 to the financial statements.

Other

We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing
strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. We may decide to use cash and cash
equivalents to fund such activities in the future.

We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet anticipated
seasonal working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

At July 31, 2006, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in
Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.

Innovative Merchant Solutions Loan and Buyout Commitments

In April 2005 our wholly owned subsidiary, Innovative Merchant Solutions (IMS), became a member of
Superior Bankcard Services, LLC (SBS), a newly formed entity that acquires merchant accounts for
IMS. Our consolidated financial statements include the financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of SBS, after elimination of all significant intercompany balances and transactions.
See Note 1 to the financial statements. In connection with the formation of this entity IMS agreed
to provide to SBS revolving loans in an amount of up to $24.5 million under the terms of a credit
agreement. In June 2006 IMS entered into an amendment to the credit agreement to increase the
amount of funds IMS may loan under that agreement to $40.0 million. The credit agreement expires in
July 2013, although certain events, such as a sale of SBS, can trigger earlier termination. Amounts
outstanding under the agreement at July 31, 2006 and July 31, 2005 totaled $11.9 million and $3.3
million at interest rates ranging from 6.75% to 9.25%. There are no scheduled repayments on the
outstanding loan balance. All unpaid principal amounts and the related accrued interest are due and
payable in full at the loan expiration date.

The operating agreement of SBS requires that, no later than July 2009, either IMS agree to purchase
the minority members’ interests in SBS at a price to be set by negotiation or arbitration, or IMS
and the minority members pursue a sale of their interests in SBS to a third party.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS 154,

“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections”

In June 2005 the FASB issued SFAS 154,

“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,”

which replaces
APB 20,

“Accounting Changes,”

and SFAS 3,

“Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
Statements.”

SFAS 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle, and changes the
requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154
requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial



statements of a voluntary change in
accounting principle unless it is impracticable. APB 20 previously required that
most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the
period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. SFAS 154 is
effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2005. Earlier application is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of
errors made in fiscal years beginning after June 1, 2005. We will adopt SFAS 154 on August 1, 2006
and we do not expect our adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

SFAS 155

, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments”

In February 2006 the FASB issued SFAS 155,

“Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments,”

which
amends SFAS 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,”

and SFAS 140,

“Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.”

SFAS 155 allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole
(eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host) if the holder elects to account
for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. SFAS 155 also clarifies and amends certain other
provisions of SFAS 133 and SFAS 140. This statement is effective for all financial instruments
acquired or issued in fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. We do not expect our
adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

FIN 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”

In June 2006 the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. (FIN) 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes.”

FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109, “

Accounting for Income Taxes.”

FIN
48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It
also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The requirements of FIN 48 are effective for our
fiscal year beginning August 1, 2007. We are in the process of evaluating this guidance and
therefore have not yet determined the impact that FIN 48 will have on our financial position or
results of operations upon adoption.

ITEM 7A

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Investment Portfolio

We do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments and funds held for
payroll customers. Our investments and funds held for payroll customers consist of instruments that
meet quality standards consistent with our investment policy. This policy specifies that, except
for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United
States government, and money market or cash management funds, we diversify our holdings by limiting
our investments and funds held for payroll customers with any individual issuer.

The following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments as of July 31, 2006
by stated maturity. The table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security
and includes cash equivalents and investments that are part of funds held for payroll customers on
our balance sheet. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds. Approximately 93% of
our available-for-sale debt securities have an interest reset date, put date or mandatory call date
within one year. At July 31, 2006, the weighted average interest rate earned on our money market
accounts was 5.17% and the weighted average interest rate earned on our investments was 6.32%.

Interest Rate Risk

Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of investments and funds held for payroll customers are
subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate movements affect the
interest income we earn on cash equivalents, investments and funds held for payroll customers and
the value of those investments. Should the Federal Reserve Target Rate increase by 10% or about 53
basis points from the level of July 31, 2006, the value of our investments and funds held for
payroll customers would decline by approximately $1.4 million. Should interest rates increase by
100 basis points from the level of July 31, 2006, the value of our investments and funds held for
payroll customers would decline by approximately $2.6 million.

Impact of Foreign Currency Rate Changes

The functional currency of our international operating subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets
and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate on the balance
sheet date. Revenue, costs and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange in effect
during the period. We report translation gains and losses as a separate component of stockholders’
equity. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in our
statements of operations.

Since we translate foreign currencies (primarily Canadian dollars and British pounds) into U.S
dollars for financial reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial
results. The historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial. We believe
that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our
global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in
their local currencies. Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has
generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency
fluctuations will not be significant in the future, there can be no guarantee that the impact of
currency fluctuations will not be material in the future. As of July 31, 2006 we did not engage in
foreign currency hedging activities.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2006 based on the guidelines established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of this evaluation, our management has concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July 31, 2006 to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. We reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the Audit Committee
of Intuit’s Board of Directors.

Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited management’s
assessment and independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of July 31, 2006. Ernst & Young has issued an attestation report concurring with
management’s assessment, which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP,

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intuit Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intuit Inc. as of July 31, 2006 and
2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2006. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of Intuit’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Intuit Inc. at July 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended July 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set
forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of Intuit Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting
as of July 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
September 13, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

As discussed in Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, under the heading
Share-Based Compensation Plans, in fiscal 2006 Intuit Inc. changed its method of accounting for
stock-based compensation.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP,

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intuit Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Intuit Inc. maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of July 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control –
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the COSO criteria). Intuit Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment
and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Intuit Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of July 31, 2006 is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the
COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Intuit Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the 2006 consolidated financial statements of Intuit Inc. and our report
dated September 13, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

INTUIT INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

Intuit Inc. provides business, financial management and tax solutions for small businesses,
consumers and accountants. Our flagship software products include QuickBooks, TurboTax, Lacerte,
ProSeries and Quicken. Founded in 1983 and headquartered in Mountain View, California, we sell our
products and services primarily in the United States. We have approximately 7,500 employees in the
United States and internationally in Canada and several other locations.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Intuit and its wholly
owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated all significant intercompany balances and transactions in
consolidation. We have reclassified certain amounts previously reported in our financial statements
to conform to the current presentation, including amounts related to discontinued operations and
reportable segments.

The consolidated financial statements also include the financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of Superior Bankcard Services, LLC (SBS), an entity formed in April 2005 that
acquires merchant accounts for our Innovative Merchant Solutions (IMS) business. IMS provides
merchant services to small businesses that include credit card, debit card and other payment
processing services. At July 31, 2006, SBS had total assets of $14.3 million and for fiscal 2006
SBS had total revenue of $7.1 million. We are allocated 51% of the earnings and losses of this
entity and 100% of the losses in excess of the minority interest capital balances. We therefore
eliminate the portion of the SBS financial results that pertain to the minority interests on a
separate line in our statements of operations and balance sheets. The operating agreement of SBS
requires that, no later than July 2009, either IMS agree to purchase the minority members’
interests in SBS at a price to be set by negotiation or arbitration, or IMS and the minority
members pursue a sale of their interests in SBS to a third party.

Our Board of Directors authorized a two-for-one stock split which was effected in the form of a
100% stock dividend on July 6, 2006 to stockholders of record on June 21, 2006. All share and per
share figures in the statements of operations and the notes to the financial statements
retroactively reflect this stock split.

As discussed in Note 7, in December 2005 we sold our Intuit Information Technology Solutions (ITS)
business and in December 2004 we sold our Intuit Public Sector Solutions (IPSS) business.
Accordingly, we have reclassified our financial statements for all periods prior to the sales to
reflect ITS and IPSS as discontinued operations. Unless noted otherwise, discussions in these notes
pertain to our continuing operations.

As discussed later in this Note 1, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment,”

on August 1, 2005 using the modified prospective transition
method. Accordingly, our operating income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended
July 31, 2006 includes approximately $66.0 million in share-based employee compensation expense for
stock options and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan that we recorded as a result of adopting SFAS
123(R). Because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method, results for prior
periods have not been restated.

Use of Estimates

We make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
the disclosures made in the accompanying notes. For example, we use estimates in determining the
appropriate levels of reserves for product returns and rebates, the collectibility of accounts
receivable, the appropriate levels of various accruals, the amount of our worldwide tax provision
and the realizability of deferred tax assets. We also use estimates in determining the remaining
economic lives and carrying values of purchased intangible assets (including goodwill), property
and equipment and other long-lived assets. In addition, we use assumptions to estimate the fair
value of share-based compensation. Despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and use
reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ from our estimates.



Net Revenue

We derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products, license fees, software
subscriptions, product support, professional services, payroll services, merchant services,
transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items.
We recognize revenue for software products and related services in accordance with the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, “

Software Revenue
Recognition

,” as modified by SOP 98-9. For other offerings, we follow Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
104,

“Revenue Recognition

.” We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and
collectibility is probable.

In some situations, we receive advance payments from our customers. We also offer multiple element
arrangements to our customers. We defer revenue associated with these advance payments and the
relative fair value of undelivered elements under multiple element arrangements until we ship the
products or perform the services. Deferred revenue consisted of the following at the dates
indicated:

July 31,

(In thousands)



Product and product-related services

$269,867

$254,131

Customer support

23,246

25,251

Total deferred revenue

$293,113

$279,382

In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (FASB’s) Emerging Issues Task
Force Issue No. 01-9, “

Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller
of the Vendor’s Product

,” we account for cash consideration (such as sales incentives) that we give
to our customers or resellers as a reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless
we receive a benefit that we can identify and for which we can reasonably estimate the fair value.

Product Revenue

We recognize revenue from the sale of our packaged software products and supplies when legal title
transfers, which is generally when we ship the products or, in the case of certain agreements, when
products are delivered to retailers. We sell some of our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Quicken
products on consignment to certain retailers. We recognize revenue for these consignment
transactions only when the end-user sale has occurred. For products that are sold on a subscription
basis and include periodic updates, we recognize revenue ratably over the contractual time period.
We record revenue net of our sales tax obligations.

We recognize product revenue in accordance with SFAS 48,

“Revenue Recognition When Right of Return
Exists.”

We reduce product revenue from distributors and retailers for estimated returns that are
based on historical returns experience and other factors, such as the volume and price mix of
products in the retail channel, return rates for prior releases of the product, trends in retailer
inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products (including the
competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our product). We also reduce product
revenue for the estimated redemption of rebates on certain current product sales. Our estimated
reserves for distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and
retailers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs, which we
typically establish annually. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms
and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program, actual sales during the promotion and
historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program.

Service Revenue

We recognize revenue from payroll processing and payroll tax filing services as the services are
performed, provided we have no other remaining obligations to these customers. We generally require
customers to remit payroll tax funds to us in advance of the applicable payroll due date via
electronic funds transfer. We include in total net revenue the interest earned on invested balances
resulting from timing differences between when we collect these funds from customers and when we
remit the funds to outside parties.



We offer several technical support plans and recognize support revenue over the life of the plans.
Service revenue also includes Web services such as TurboTax Online and electronic tax filing
services in both our Consumer Tax and Professional Tax segments. Service revenue for electronic
payment processing services that we provide to merchants is recorded net of interchange fees
charged by credit card associations because we do not control these fees. Finally, service revenue
includes revenue from consulting and training services, primarily in our Intuit-Branded Small
Business segment. We generally recognize revenue as these services are performed, provided that we
have no other remaining obligations to these customers and that the services performed are not
essential to the functionality of delivered products and services.

Other Revenue

Other revenue consists primarily of revenue from revenue-sharing arrangements with third-party
service providers. We recognize transaction fees from revenue-sharing arrangements as end-user
sales are reported to us by these partners.

Multiple Element Arrangements

We enter into certain revenue arrangements for which we are obligated to deliver multiple products
and/or services (multiple elements). For these arrangements, which generally include software
products, we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered elements based on their vendor-specific
objective evidence of fair value (VSOE). VSOE is generally the price charged when that element is
sold separately.

In situations where VSOE exists for all elements (delivered and undelivered), we allocate the total
revenue to be earned under the arrangement among the various elements, based on their relative fair
value. For transactions where VSOE exists only for the undelivered elements, we defer the full fair
value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee
and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. If VSOE does not exist for an
undelivered service element, we recognize the revenue from the arrangement as the services are
delivered. If VSOE does not exist for undelivered elements that are specified products or features,
we defer revenue until the earlier of the delivery of all elements or the point at which we
determine VSOE for these undelivered elements.

We recognize revenue related to the delivered products or services only if: (1) the above revenue
recognition criteria are met; (2) any undelivered products or services are not essential to the
functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) payment for the delivered products or
services is not contingent upon delivery of the remaining products or services; and (4) we have an
enforceable claim to receive the amount due in the event that we do not deliver the undelivered
products or services.

For arrangements where undelivered services are essential to the functionality of delivered
software, we recognize both the product license revenues and service revenues under the percentage
of completion contract method in accordance with the provisions of SOP 81-1, “

Accounting for
Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts

.” To date, product license
and service revenues recognized pursuant to SOP 81-1 have not been significant.

Shipping and Handling

We record the amounts we charge our customers for the shipping and handling of our software
products as product revenue and we record the related costs as cost of product revenue in our
statements of operations. Product revenue from shipping and handling is not significant.

Customer Service and Technical Support

We include the costs of providing customer service under paid technical support contracts on the
cost of service revenue line in our statements of operations. We include customer service and free
technical support costs on the sales and marketing expense line on our statements of operations.
Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order
processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through web sites, e-mail and other
electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance to customers. In connection with
the sale of certain products, we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to
customers. We do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products,
since the cost of



providing this free technical support is insignificant. The technical support is generally provided
within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are
minimal and infrequent. We accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product
shipment.

Software Development Costs

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 86, “

Accounting for Costs of Computer Software
to be Sold, Leased, or otherwise Marketed

,” requires companies to expense software development
costs as they incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those
costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. To date, our
software has been available for general release concurrent with the establishment of technological
feasibility and, accordingly, we have not capitalized any development costs. SFAS 2, “

Accounting
for Research and Development Costs

,” establishes accounting and reporting standards for research
and development. In accordance with SFAS 2, costs we incur to enhance our existing products or
after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are
incurred and included in research and development costs in our statements of operations.

Internal Use Software

We capitalize costs related to computer software developed or obtained for internal use in
accordance with SOP 98-1, “

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use

.” Software obtained for internal use has generally been enterprise-level business and
finance software that we customize to meet our specific operational needs. Costs incurred in the
application development phase are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives, generally
three to five years. We have not sold, leased or licensed software developed for internal use to
our customers and we have no intention of doing so in the future.

Advertising

We expense advertising costs as we incur them. We recorded advertising expense of approximately
$64.9 million in fiscal 2006, $45.2 million in fiscal 2005 and $43.2 million in fiscal 2004.

Leases

We review all leases for capital or operating classification at their inception under the guidance
of SFAS 13,

“Accounting for Leases,”

as amended. We use our incremental borrowing rate in the
assessment of lease classification and define the initial lease term to include the construction
build-out period but to exclude lease extension periods. We conduct our operations primarily under
operating leases. For leases that contain rent escalations, we record the total rent payable during
the lease term, as defined above, on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. We record
the difference between the rents paid and the straight-line rent in a deferred rent account in
other current liabilities or long-term obligations, as appropriate, on our balance sheets.

In
accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin (FTB) No. 88-1,

“Issues Relating to Accounting for Leases,”

we
record landlord allowances as deferred rent liabilities in other current liabilities or long-term
obligations, as appropriate, on our balance sheets. We record landlord cash incentives as operating
activity on our statements of cash flows. We record other landlord allowances as non-cash investing
and financing activities on our statements of cash flows. Also in accordance with FTB 88-1, we
classify the amortization of landlord allowances as a reduction of occupancy expense on our
statements of operations.

Foreign Currency

The functional currency of all our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets and
liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet
date. Revenue, costs and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange in effect during the
year. We report translation gains and losses as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. We
include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in our statements of
operations.



Income Taxes

When we prepare our financial statements, we estimate our income taxes based on the various
jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our
worldwide income tax provision. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the
United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to
which, additional taxes will be due. We record an additional amount in our provision for income
taxes in the period in which we determine that our recorded tax liability is less than we expect
the ultimate tax assessment to be. If in a later period we determine that payment of this
additional amount is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit in that
later period. As a result, our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the audit issues and
related tax positions require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective tax
rate and materially affect our operating results. This also requires us to estimate our current tax
exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items
for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities,
which we show on our balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets
will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation
allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting
period, we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations.

We record a valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize
some of our deferred tax assets (consisting primarily of certain state capital loss and net
operating loss carryforwards) before they expire. The valuation allowance is based on our estimates
of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred
tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need
for the valuation allowance, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into
account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the
valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax
provision and net income in the period in which we make the increase.

Per Share Computations

We compute basic income or loss per share using the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. We compute diluted income or loss per share using the weighted
average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period.
Common equivalent shares consist of the shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options under
the treasury stock method and vested restricted stock awards. We adopted SFAS 123(R) on August 1,
2005. In accordance with that standard, for fiscal 2006 we excluded stock options with combined
exercise prices and unamortized fair values that were greater than the average market price for our
common stock from the calculation of diluted net income per share because their effect was
anti-dilutive. For fiscal 2005 and 2004, we excluded stock options with exercise prices that were
greater than the average market price for our common stock from the calculation of diluted net
income per share because their effect was anti-dilutive. In loss periods, basic and diluted loss
per share are identical since the effect of common equivalent shares is anti-dilutive and therefore
excluded.

net income per share for the periods indicated.

Cash Equivalents and Investments

We consider highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of
purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds in all
periods presented. Investments consist of available-for-sale debt securities that we carry at fair
value. We use the specific identification method to compute gains and losses on investments. We
include unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of tax, in stockholders’ equity.
Available-for-sale debt securities are classified as current assets based upon our intent and
ability to use any and all of these securities as necessary to satisfy the significant short-term
liquidity requirements that may arise from the highly seasonal and cyclical nature of our
businesses. Because of our significant business seasonality, stock repurchase programs and
acquisition opportunities, cash flow requirements may fluctuate dramatically from quarter to
quarter and require us to use a significant amount of the investments held as available-for-sale
securities. See Note 2.



Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are not interest bearing. We maintain
an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. We review
our accounts receivable by aging category to identify significant customers or invoices with known
disputes or collectibility issues. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, we provide
reserves based on the age of the receivable. In determining the amount of the reserve, we make
judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations.
We also consider our historical level of credit losses and current economic trends that might
impact the level of future credit losses.

Funds Held for Payroll Customers and Payroll Customer Fund Deposits

Funds held for payroll customers represent cash held on behalf of our payroll customers that is
invested in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Payroll customer fund deposits consist
primarily of direct deposit funds and payroll taxes we owe on behalf of our payroll customers.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. We calculate
depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which
range from three to 30 years. We amortize leasehold improvements using the straight-line method
over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or remaining lease terms. We include the
amortization of assets that are recorded under capital leases in depreciation expense.

Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

We record goodwill when the purchase price of net tangible and intangible assets we acquire exceeds
their fair value. We amortize the cost of identified intangible assets on a straight-line basis
over periods ranging from three to seven years.

We regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values of our long-lived assets are
impaired. In accordance with SFAS 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”

we review goodwill
and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually in
our fourth fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for
impairment. In accordance with SFAS 144, “

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets

,” we review intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other long-lived assets when
an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. In our reviews, we look for facts or
circumstances, either internal or external, indicating that we may not recover the carrying value
of the asset. We measure impairment losses related to long-lived assets based on the amount by
which the carrying amounts of these assets exceed their fair values. Our measurement of fair value
under SFAS 142 is generally based on a blend of an analysis of the present value of estimated
future discounted cash flows and a comparison of revenue and operating income multiples for
companies of similar industry and/or size. Our measurement of fair value under SFAS 144 is
generally based on the present value of estimated future discounted cash flows. Our analysis is
based on available information and on assumptions and projections that we consider to be reasonable
and supportable. The discounted cash flow analysis considers the likelihood of possible outcomes
and is based on our best estimate of projected future cash flows. If necessary, we perform
subsequent calculations to measure the amount of the impairment loss based on the excess of the
carrying value over the fair value of the impaired assets.

Share-Based Compensation Plans

Our share-based employee compensation plans are described in Note 12. Prior to August 1, 2005, we
accounted for these share-based employee compensation plans under the measurement and recognition
provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,”

and related Interpretations, as permitted by SFAS 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.”

Accordingly, we recorded no share-based employee compensation expense for options
granted under the 2005 Plan or its predecessor plans during the twelve months ended July 31, 2005
and 2004 as all options granted under those plans had exercise prices equal to the fair market
value of our common stock on the date of grant. We also recorded no compensation expense in those
periods in connection with our Employee Stock Purchase Plan as the purchase price of the stock was
not less than 85% of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning of
each offering period or at the end of each



purchase period. In accordance with APB 25, we recorded compensation expense for restricted stock.
In accordance with SFAS 123 and SFAS 148,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and
Disclosure,”

we provided pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per share disclosures
for each period prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) as if we had applied the fair value-based
method in measuring compensation expense for our share-based compensation plans.

Effective August 1, 2005, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment,”

using the modified prospective transition method. Under that transition
method, compensation expense that we recognized for the twelve months ended July 31, 2006 included:
(a) period compensation expense for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested
as of, August 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
provisions of SFAS 123, adjusted for forfeitures, and (b) period compensation expense for all
share-based payments granted on or after August 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). For options granted before August 1,
2005, we amortize the fair value on an accelerated basis. This is the same basis on which we
amortized options granted before August 1, 2005 for our pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123. For
options granted on or after August 1, 2005, we amortize the fair value on a straight-line basis.
All options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the
vesting periods. Because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method, results for
prior periods have not been restated. In March 2005 the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, which provides supplemental implementation guidance for
SFAS 123(R). We have applied the provisions of SAB 107 in our adoption of SFAS 123(R). See Note 12
for information on the impact of our adoption of SFAS 123(R) and the assumptions we use to
calculate the fair value of share-based employee compensation.

In May 2006 we began a voluntary review of our historical stock option granting activities and
related accounting treatment. Our Board of Directors formed a special committee of independent
directors to conduct this review with the assistance of independent legal counsel and independent
forensic accounting support. The primary scope of this review covered the period from August 1,
1997 to the present. On August 16, 2006 we announced the completion of our independent review,
which uncovered no evidence of fraud or intentional wrongdoing in our historical stock option
granting practices. See Note 15.

Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers and Suppliers

We operate in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Significant technological
changes, shifting customer requirements, the emergence of competitive products or services with new
capabilities and other factors could negatively impact our operating results.

We are also subject to risks related to changes in the values of our significant balance of
investments and funds held for payroll customers. Our portfolio of investments consists of
investment-grade securities and our funds held for payroll customers consist of cash, cash
equivalents and investment-grade securities. Except for direct obligations of the United States
government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market or cash
management funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer.

We sell a significant portion of our products through third-party retailers and distributors. As a
result, we face risks related to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. For example, at
January 31, 2006, in the midst of the 2005 consumer tax season, amounts due from our 10 largest
retailers and distributors represented approximately 51% of total gross accounts receivable. To
appropriately manage this risk, we perform ongoing evaluations of customer credit and limit the
amount of credit extended as we deem appropriate but generally do not require collateral. We
maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have historically been within our
expectations. However, since we cannot necessarily predict future changes in the financial
stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. No
customer accounted for 10% or more of total net revenue in fiscal 2006, 2005 or 2004, nor did any
customer account for 10% or more of accounts receivable at July 31, 2006 or July 31, 2005. Amounts
due from Rock Acquisition Corporation, the purchaser of our Quicken Loans mortgage business, under
certain licensing and distribution agreements comprised approximately 10% of accounts receivable at
July 31, 2006 and approximately 11% of accounts receivable at July 31, 2005.



We rely on three third-party vendors to perform the manufacturing and distribution functions for
our primary retail desktop software products. We also have a key single-source vendor that prints
and fulfills orders for all of our checks and most other products for our financial supplies
business. While we believe that relying heavily on key vendors improves the efficiency and
reliability of our business operations, relying on any one vendor for a significant aspect of our
business can have a significant negative impact on our revenue and profitability if that vendor
fails to perform at acceptable service levels for any reason, including financial difficulties of
the vendor.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS 154,

“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections”

In June 2005 the FASB issued SFAS 154,

“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,”

which replaces
APB 20,

“Accounting Changes,”

and SFAS 3,

“Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
Statements.”

SFAS 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle, and changes the
requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154
requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of a voluntary change in
accounting principle unless it is impracticable. APB 20 previously required that most voluntary
changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the
change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for
accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2005. Earlier application is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in
fiscal years beginning after June 1, 2005. We will adopt SFAS 154 on August 1, 2006 and we do not
expect our adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

SFAS 155,

“Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments”

In February 2006 the FASB issued SFAS 155,

“Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments,”

which
amends SFAS 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,”

and SFAS 140,

“Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.”

SFAS 155 allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole
(eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host) if the holder elects to account
for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. SFAS 155 also clarifies and amends certain other
provisions of SFAS 133 and SFAS 140. This statement is effective for all financial instruments
acquired or issued in fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. We do not expect our
adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

FIN 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”

In June 2006 the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. (FIN) 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes.”

FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109, “

Accounting for Income Taxes.”

FIN
48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It
also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The requirements of FIN 48 are effective for our
fiscal year beginning August 1, 2007. We are in the process of evaluating this guidance and
therefore have not yet determined the impact that FIN 48 will have on our financial position or
results of operations upon adoption.

2. Investments and Funds Held for Payroll Customers

As discussed in Note 1, “

Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers and Suppliers

,” our
portfolio of investments consists of investment-grade securities and our funds held for payroll
customers consist of cash, cash equivalents and investment-grade securities. Except for direct
obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States
government, and money market or cash management funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our
holdings with any individual issuer.

We periodically review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is
other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation
concerns. We believe that the investments that we held at
July 31, 2006 were not other-than-temporarily impaired. While certain available-for-sale debt
securities have fair values that are below cost, we believe that if the securities were held to
maturity it is probable that principal and interest would be collected in accordance with
contractual terms, and that the decline in market value is due to changes in interest rates and not
due to increased credit risk.

We include realized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities in interest and
other income in our statements of operations. Gross realized gains and losses on our
available-for-sale debt securities were as follows for the periods indicated:

Capital in progress consists primarily of costs related to internal use software projects. As
discussed in Note 1, “

Software Development Costs

,” we capitalize costs related to the development
of computer software for internal use in accordance with SOP 98-1. We capitalized internal use
software costs totaling $37.6 million in fiscal 2006, $31.4



million in fiscal 2005 and $65.8 million in fiscal 2004. These amounts included capitalized labor
costs of $13.7 million in fiscal 2006, $17.9 million in fiscal 2005 and $21.7 million in fiscal
2004. Costs related to internal use software projects are included in the capital in progress
category of property and equipment until project completion, at which time they are transferred to
the computer software category and amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives,
generally three to five years.

4. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

As discussed in Note 1, “

Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

,” under
current accounting rules goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests.
Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment during fiscal 2006 were as shown in
the following table. Our reportable segments are described in Note 8. The increase in goodwill in
our Consumer Tax segment during fiscal 2006 was due to the purchase of My Corporation Business
Services, Inc. See Note 6. The decrease in goodwill in our Other Businesses segment during fiscal
2006 was related to the sale of our Master Builder business, which was part of Intuit Construction
Business Solutions. See Note 7.

At July 31, 2006, we expected future amortization of our purchased intangible assets by fiscal
year to be as shown in the following table. Amortization of purchased intangible assets is charged
primarily to cost of service revenue and amortization of purchased intangible assets in cost of
revenue and to acquisition-related charges in operating expenses in our statements of operations.
Future acquisitions could cause these amounts to increase. In addition, if impairment events occur
they could accelerate the timing of purchased intangible asset charges.

As discussed in Note 1, we regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values of
our goodwill and purchased intangible assets may be impaired. We look for the existence of facts
and circumstances, either internal or external, which indicate that the carrying value of the asset
may not be recovered. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, events and circumstances indicated
impairment of goodwill that we recorded in connection with our acquisition of Intuit Public Sector
Solutions (IPSS) in May 2002. IPSS was part of our Other Businesses segment. The primary indicator
of impairment was the fact that actual sales levels did not meet initial projections.

We measured the impairment loss based on the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill
exceeded the fair value based on lower projected profits and decreases in cash flow. Our
measurement of fair value was based on a blend of an analysis of the future discounted cash flows
and a comparison of revenue and operating income multiples for companies of similar industry and/or
size as discussed in Note 1. Based on our analysis, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we
recorded a charge of $18.7 million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to $10.9 million.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2005 our Board of Directors formally approved a plan to sell IPSS
and it became a long-lived asset held for sale and a discontinued operation in that quarter. The
impairment charge is therefore included in the fiscal 2004 net loss from IPSS discontinued
operations. We sold IPSS for approximately $11 million in cash in December 2004. See Note 7.

5. Comprehensive Net Income (Loss)

SFAS 130, “

Reporting Comprehensive Income

,” establishes standards for reporting and displaying
comprehensive net income (loss) and its components in stockholders’ equity. SFAS 130 requires that
the components of other comprehensive income (loss), such as changes in the fair value of
available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustments, be added to our net
income (loss) to arrive at comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) items
have no impact on our net income (loss) as presented in our statements of operations.



The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes, were as
follows for the periods indicated:

6. Acquisitions

On August 29, 2006 we acquired StepUp Commerce, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of
approximately $60.0 million in cash. StepUp provides services that allow small businesses to
present their product information and images to online shoppers. StepUp became part of our
QuickBooks segment.

In November 2005 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of My Corporation Business Services, Inc.
for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $20.9 million in cash. We recorded the excess
purchase price of $19.6 million as goodwill, all of which was deductible for income tax purposes.
Doing business as MyCorporation.com,

the company offers online incorporation services to
small businesses. MyCorporation.com became part of our Consumer Tax segment.

In October 2003 we acquired all of the membership interests of Innovative Merchant Solutions LLC
and a related entity doing business as Innovative Gateway Solutions (together, IMS) for an
aggregate purchase price of approximately $116.7 million in cash. IMS offers a full range of
merchant services to small businesses, including credit and debit card processing services. We
acquired IMS as part of our Right for Me philosophy to offer a wider range of business solutions
for small businesses. IMS is part of our Payroll and Payments segment. We allocate the difference
between the purchase price and the net book value of acquired tangible assets between identified
intangible assets and goodwill. We allocated approximately $17.3 million of the IMS purchase price
to identified



intangible assets and recorded the excess purchase price of $98.4 million as goodwill. Of the
goodwill acquired, $98.2 million was deductible for income tax purposes. The identified intangible
assets are being amortized over terms ranging from two to four years. In accordance with purchase
accounting rules, we have included IMS’s results of operations in our consolidated results of
operations from the date of acquisition. IMS’s results of operations for periods prior to the date
of acquisition were not material when compared with our consolidated results.

7. Dispositions and Discontinued Operations

Sale of Master Builder Business

In May 2006 we sold our Master Builder construction management software and solutions business,
which was part of Intuit Construction Business Solutions in our Other Businesses segment. The
Master Builder business had quarterly revenue of approximately $5 million. We recorded a $7.7
million net loss on disposal of the business, including income tax expense of $10.1 million. In
accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-lived Assets,”

we have not accounted for this transaction as a discontinued operation as the
operations and cash flows of the Master Builder business could not be clearly distinguished,
operationally or for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the entity.

Intuit Information Technology Solutions Discontinued Operations

In December 2005 we sold our Intuit Information Technology Solutions (ITS) business for
approximately $200 million in cash. The buyer deposited approximately $20 million of the total
purchase price in a third-party escrow account to be held through December 2006 to cover breaches
of representations and warranties set forth in the purchase agreement, should they arise. The full
escrow amount is included in other current assets on our balance sheet at July 31, 2006. The
decision to sell ITS was a result of our desire to focus resources on our core products and
services. ITS was part of our Other Businesses segment.

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-lived Assets,”

we accounted for the sale of ITS as discontinued operations. We have therefore
segregated the net assets, operating results and cash flows of ITS from continuing operations on
our balance sheet at July 31, 2005 and from our statements of operations and statements of cash
flows for all periods prior to the sale. We recorded a $34.3 million net gain on disposal of ITS
which is included in net income from discontinued operations in our statement of operations for the
twelve months ended July 31, 2006. See the table later in this Note 7 for the components of net
income from discontinued operations.

Intuit Public Sector Solutions Discontinued Operations

In December 2004 we sold our Intuit Public Sector Solutions (IPSS) business for approximately $11
million in cash. The decision to sell IPSS was a result of our desire to focus resources on our
core products and services. IPSS was part of our Other Businesses segment. In accordance with SFAS
144, we accounted for the sale as discontinued operations. We have therefore segregated the
operating results and cash flows of IPSS from continuing operations on our statements of operations
and statements of cash flows for all periods prior to the sale. We recorded a $4.8 million net loss
on disposal of IPSS in fiscal 2005 that included a $4.3 million income tax provision for the
estimated tax payable in connection with the expected tax gain on the sale of IPSS.



Components of Net Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations

The components of net income (loss) from discontinued operations on our statements of operations as
well as net revenue from discontinued operations and income or loss from discontinued operations

estimated tax payable in connection with the taxable gain on the sale of IPSS. The fiscal 2004 net
loss from Intuit Public Sector Solutions operations included a goodwill impairment charge of $18.7
million. See Note 4.

8. Industry Segment and Geographic Information

SFAS 131, “

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

,” establishes
standards for the way in which public companies disclose certain information about operating
segments in their financial reports. Consistent with SFAS 131, we have defined five reportable
segments, described below, based on factors such as



how we manage our operations and how our chief operating decision maker views results. We define
the chief operating decision maker as our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer.
We have aggregated two operating segments to form our Payroll and Payments reportable segment.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we revised our reportable segments to reflect the way we
currently manage and view our business. We transferred our QuickBooks Payroll and merchant services
businesses from our fiscal 2005 QuickBooks-Related segment to a new segment called Payroll and
Payments and renamed our QuickBooks-Related segment QuickBooks. We also transferred our outsourced
payroll business from our fiscal 2005 Intuit-Branded Small Business segment to the new Payroll and
Payments segment. Finally, we transferred the remaining businesses in our fiscal 2005
Intuit-Branded Small Business segment to our Other Businesses segment. We made no changes to our
Consumer Tax and Professional Tax segments. We have reclassified previously reported fiscal 2005
and 2004 segment results to be consistent with the fiscal 2006 presentation.

QuickBooks product revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks desktop software products and
financial supplies such as paper checks, envelopes and invoices. QuickBooks service revenue is
derived primarily from QuickBooks Online Edition and QuickBooks support plans. Other revenue for
this segment consists primarily of royalties from small business online services.

Payroll and Payments product revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks Payroll, a family of
products sold on a subscription basis offering payroll tax tables, forms and electronic tax payment
and filing to small businesses that prepare their own payrolls. Payroll and Payments service
revenue is derived from small business payroll services as well as from merchant services provided
by our Innovative Merchant Solutions business. Service revenue for this segment also includes
interest earned on funds held for payroll customers.

Consumer Tax product revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax federal and state consumer and
small business desktop tax return preparation software. Consumer Tax service revenue is derived
primarily from TurboTax Online tax return preparation services and electronic filing and refund
transfer services.

Professional Tax product revenue is derived primarily from Lacerte and ProSeries professional tax
preparation software products. Professional Tax service revenue is derived primarily from
electronic filing, bank product transmission and training services.

Other Businesses consist primarily of Quicken and Canada. Quicken product revenue is derived
primarily from Quicken desktop software products. Quicken other revenue consists primarily of fees
from consumer online transactions and from Quicken-branded credit card and bill payment offerings
that we provide through our partners. In Canada, product revenue is derived primarily from
localized versions of QuickBooks and Quicken as well as QuickTax and TaxWiz consumer desktop tax
return preparation software and ProFile professional tax preparation products. Service revenue in
Canada consists primarily of revenue from payroll services and QuickBooks support plans.

Our QuickBooks, Payroll and Payments, Consumer Tax and Professional Tax segments operate primarily
in the United States. All of our segments sell primarily to customers located in the United States.
International total net revenue was less than 5% of consolidated total net revenue for all periods
presented.

We include costs such as corporate general and administrative expenses and share-based compensation
expenses that are not allocated to specific segments in a category we call Corporate. The Corporate
category also includes amortization of purchased intangible assets, acquisition-related charges,
impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets, interest and other income, and realized net
gains or losses on marketable equity securities and other investments.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary
of significant accounting policies in Note 1. Except for goodwill and purchased intangible assets,
we do not generally track assets by reportable segment and, consequently, we do not disclose total
assets by reportable segment. See Note 4 for goodwill by reportable segment.

Innovative Merchant Solutions Loan and Buyout Commitments

In April 2005 our wholly owned subsidiary, Innovative Merchant Solutions (IMS), became a member of
Superior Bankcard Services, LLC (SBS), a newly formed entity that acquires merchant accounts for
IMS. Our consolidated financial statements include the financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of SBS, after elimination of all significant intercompany balances and transactions.
See Note 1. In connection with the formation of this entity IMS agreed to provide to SBS revolving
loans in an amount of up to $24.5 million under the terms of a credit agreement. In June 2006 IMS
entered into an amendment to the credit agreement to increase the amount of funds IMS may loan
under that agreement to $40.0 million. The credit agreement expires in July 2013, although certain
events, such as a sale of SBS, can trigger earlier termination. Amounts outstanding under this
agreement at July 31, 2006 and July 31, 2005 totaled $11.9 million and $3.3 million at interest
rates ranging from 6.75% to 9.25%. There are no scheduled repayments on the outstanding loan
balance. All unpaid principal amounts and the related accrued interest are due and payable in full
at the loan expiration date.

The operating agreement of SBS requires that, no later than July 2009, either IMS agree to purchase
the minority members’ interests in SBS at a price to be set by negotiation or arbitration, or IMS
and the minority members pursue a sale of their interests in SBS to a third party.

Operating Leases

We lease office facilities and equipment under various operating lease agreements. Our facilities
leases generally provide for periodic rent increases and many contain escalation clauses and
renewal options. Certain leases require us to pay property taxes, insurance and routine
maintenance. Annual minimum commitments under all of these leases are shown in the table below.

Reversals of reserves for all periods presented related to potential income tax exposures that
were resolved.

In accordance with SFAS 123(R), which we adopted on August 1, 2005, tax savings from expected
future deductions based on the expense attributable to our various stock option plans are reflected
in the federal and state tax provisions for fiscal 2006. They were not reflected in those
provisions for fiscal 2005 and 2004. The reduction of income taxes payable resulting from the
exercise of employee stock options and other employee stock programs that were credited to
stockholders’ equity were approximately $58.0 million in fiscal 2006, $26.4 million in fiscal 2005
and $27.1 million in fiscal 2004.

Beginning in fiscal 2006 we qualify for the annual domestic manufacturer tax deduction under the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act). SFAS 109 provides that this deduction should be
accounted for as a special deduction and not as a tax rate reduction. The Act also provided for a
special one-time tax deduction for foreign earnings that were repatriated by the end of our fiscal
year ended July 31, 2006. We did not receive any benefit from this portion of the Act.

Under current legislation, the federal research and experimental credit does not apply to expenses
incurred after December 31, 2005. Although the credit may be extended, in accordance with SFAS 109
we did not assume tax benefits for any federal research and experimental credit after this
expiration date.

allowance of $2.8 million. These net operating losses will expire starting in fiscal 2022. At July
31, 2006, we had state capital loss carryovers of $29.2 million for which we have recorded a gross
deferred tax asset of $2.2 million and a valuation allowance of $1.6 million. The majority of these
state capital losses will expire in fiscal 2008. Utilization of the net operating losses and state
capital losses may be subject to substantial annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in
the expiration of net operating losses and capital losses before utilization.



12. Stockholders’ Equity

Stock Split

Our Board of Directors authorized a two-for-one stock split which was effected in the form of a
100% stock dividend on July 6, 2006 to stockholders of record on June 21, 2006. All share and per
share figures in the statements of operations and notes to the financial statements retroactively
reflect this stock split. This stock split was an equity restructuring that is considered a
modification under SFAS 123(R), but it did not result in a change in fair value of any equity
awards.

Stock Repurchase Programs

Intuit’s Board of Directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of
common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. Under these programs, we
repurchased 31.0 million shares of our common stock for $784.2 million in fiscal 2006, 32.4 million
shares of our common stock for $709.2 million in fiscal 2005 and 27.0 million shares of our common
stock for $609.4 million in fiscal 2004. Authorized funds of $506.6 million remained under our
stock repurchase programs at July 31, 2006.

Repurchased shares of our common stock are held as treasury shares until they are reissued or
retired. When we reissue treasury stock, if the proceeds from the sale are more than the average
price we paid to acquire the shares we record an increase in additional paid-in capital.
Conversely, if the proceeds from the sale are less than the average price we paid to acquire the
shares, we record a decrease in additional paid-in capital to the extent of increases previously
recorded for similar transactions and a decrease in retained earnings for any remaining amount.

Description of Stock Option Plans

Our stockholders approved our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan at our annual meeting on December 9, 2004.
The 2005 Plan replaces our 2002 Equity Incentive Plan, 1996 Directors Stock Option Plan and 1998
Option Plan for Mergers and Acquisitions. Beginning December 9, 2004 no further awards could be
granted under the 2002 Plan, Directors Plan or 1998 Plan. However, all outstanding equity awards
under these plans remain in effect in accordance with their terms. There were 3,861,820 shares
available for grant under the 2002 Plan, 13,750 shares available for grant under the Directors Plan
and 4,570,588 shares available for grant under the 1998 Plan on the date of their termination for a
total of 8,446,158 shares. These shares ceased to be available for grant under any of our equity
compensation plans upon adoption of the 2005 Plan.

Under the 2005 Plan, we are permitted to grant incentive and non-qualified stock options,
restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights and stock bonus awards
to our employees, non-employee directors and consultants. The 2005 Plan provides for the automatic
grant of stock options to non-employee directors according to a formula in the plan document. For
other awards, the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors
or its delegates determine who will receive grants, when those grants will be exercisable, their
exercise price and other terms. There are a total of 26,000,000 shares authorized under the 2005
Plan. Up to 50% of equity awards granted each year can be at less than full fair market value. All
options granted under the 2005 Plan through July 31, 2006 have exercise prices equal to the fair
market value of our stock on the date of grant. Our option grants typically have a seven year term
and vest over three years based on continued service.

During fiscal 2003 we introduced a mandatory share ownership program. Under this program all senior
vice presidents and Board members, other than our chief executive officer, are required to hold a
minimum of 3,000 shares by the later of May 2006 or three years from the date the individual
becomes subject to the share ownership program. Our chief executive officer is required to hold
100,000 shares. To provide an incentive to our senior vice presidents, we implemented a matching
unit award component to the share ownership program. Under this matching unit program, for each two
shares one of these officers purchases during his or her three-year compliance period, we grant a
matching unit award for one share, up to a maximum of 1,500 matching unit awards. Beginning
December 9, 2004 these matching unit awards are granted as restricted stock unit awards under the
2005 Plan. They were granted as stock bonus awards under the 2002 Plan prior to that date. These
matching units vest as to 100 percent of the shares subject to the award four years after grant, or
earlier on the officer’s retirement, death or disability. We value



these matching units based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant and recognize
compensation expense ratably over the vesting period. We awarded a total of 11,916 matching units
in fiscal 2006, 4,710 matching units in fiscal 2005 and 6,848 matching units in fiscal 2004.

On July 29, 2005 we granted 100,000 performance-based restricted stock units to Stephen M. Bennett,
our chief executive officer, under the 2005 Plan. The fiscal 2006 performance goals established by
the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors were achieved,
therefore the restricted stock units will vest on July 29, 2008. On two occasions we granted
restricted stock units to Mr. Bennett as stock bonus awards under the 2002 Plan. On July 30, 2003
we granted an award for 850,000 shares and on July 31, 2004 we granted an award for 50,000 shares.
The 2003 award vested as to 510,000 shares on July 31, 2006 and will vest as to an additional
170,000 shares on each of July 31, 2007 and July 31, 2008; however, the shares will not be issued
to Mr. Bennett until a later date. The 2004 award vests as to 50,000 shares on July 31, 2007. We
value these awards based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant and recognize
compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.

Outstanding awards that were originally granted under the 2002, Directors, 1998 and 1993 Plans
remain in effect in accordance with their terms. The following paragraphs describe the general
terms of the 2002, Directors and 1998 Plans, all of which terminated upon adoption of the 2005
Plan, as well as the 1993 Equity Incentive Plan, which terminated upon adoption of the 2002 Plan.

Under the 2002 Plan, we were permitted to grant stock options, restricted stock and stock bonus
awards to our and our subsidiaries’ employees, directors, consultants and independent contractors.
The Compensation Committee determined who received grants, when the grants became exercisable, the
exercise price and other terms of the awards. The option exercise price was generally the fair
market value on the date of grant. During fiscal 2002, we changed our standard option vesting
schedule so that future options granted under the 2002 Plan generally became exercisable over a
three-year period based on continued service and expire no later than seven years from the date of
grant. Prior to that change, our standard option vesting schedule provided that options generally
became exercisable over a four-year period based on continued service and expired no later than ten
years from the date of grant.

Our Directors Plan provided for the grant of non-qualified stock options for a specified number of
shares to be granted to each non-employee director of Intuit. As of December 2002, Board members
who served on the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee
received additional annual grants. The option exercise price was the fair market value on the date
of grant. Most options are subject to vesting over time based on continued service, with vesting
periods ranging from one to four years. All options expire after ten years.

Our 1998 Plan provided for the grant of non-qualified stock options to individuals whom we hired as
a result of our acquisitions of or mergers with other companies for a period of 18 months following
the completion of the acquisitions or mergers. The 1998 Plan was designed to meet the “broadly
based plans” exemption from the stockholder approval requirement for stock option plans under the
Nasdaq Stock Market listing requirements at the time the plan was adopted and, accordingly, was not
submitted to Intuit stockholders for approval. Options could not be granted under the 1998 Plan
with an exercise price that was less than the fair market value of Intuit’s common stock on the
date of grant.

Our 1993 Plan terminated on January 18, 2002 when our stockholders approved our 2002 Plan to
replace the 1993 Plan. When the 1993 Plan terminated, all outstanding options under the 1993 Plan
remained in effect in accordance with their terms. Under the 1993 Plan, we were permitted to grant
incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, stock bonuses and performance
awards to employees, directors, consultants, and independent contractors of and advisors to Intuit
and our subsidiaries. The Compensation Committee or its delegates determined who would receive
grants, when those grants would be exercisable, their exercise price and other terms. The option
exercise price was generally the fair market value at the date of grant. The outstanding options
generally vest over four years based on continued service and expire after ten years.



Description of Employee Stock Purchase Plan

On November 26, 1996 our stockholders adopted our Employee Stock Purchase Plan under Section 423 of
the Internal Revenue Code. The ESPP permits our eligible employees to make payroll deductions to
purchase our stock on regularly scheduled purchase dates at a discount. The ESPP has been amended several times since
its adoption. We amended it most recently on July 27, 2005 to extend its term to July 27, 2015 and
on January 25, 2005 to reduce the length of the offering periods from twelve months to three months
effective with the June 2005 offering period. The purchase price for shares purchased under the
ESPP is 85% of the lower of the closing price for Intuit common stock on the first day or the last
day of the offering period in which the employee is participating.

Under the ESPP, employees purchased 1,050,198 shares of Intuit common stock in fiscal 2006,
1,215,922 shares of Intuit common stock in fiscal 2005 and 1,129,836 shares in fiscal 2004. At July
31, 2006 there were 1,374,094 shares available for issuance under this plan.

Impact of the Adoption of SFAS 123(R)

See Note 1 for a description of our adoption of SFAS 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment,”

on August 1,
2005. The following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense for stock options and our
Employee Stock Purchase Plan that we recorded for continuing operations in accordance with SFAS
123(R) for the twelve months ended July 31, 2006. The impact of our adoption of SFAS 123(R) on
discontinued operations was nominal for this period.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), we presented deferred compensation as a separate
component of stockholders’ equity. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R), on August 1,
2005 we reclassified the balance in deferred compensation to additional paid-in capital on our
balance sheet.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), we presented all tax benefits for deductions resulting from
the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares under our ESPP plan as operating cash
flows on our statement of cash flows. SFAS 123(R) requires the cash flows resulting from the tax
benefits for tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recorded for those options and
ESPP shares (excess tax benefits) to be classified as financing cash flows. Accordingly, we
classified the $27.0 million in excess tax benefits for the twelve months ended July 31, 2006 as
financing cash inflows rather than as operating cash inflows on our statement of cash flows for
that fiscal year.



Determining Fair Value

Valuation and Amortization Method.

We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the
Black-Scholes option valuation model and a multiple option award approach. For options granted
before August 1, 2005, we amortize the fair value on an accelerated basis. This is the same basis
on which we amortized options granted before August 1, 2005 for our pro forma disclosures under
SFAS 123. For options granted on or after August 1, 2005, we amortize the fair value on a
straight-line basis. All options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards,
which are generally the vesting periods.

Expected Term

. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that they are
expected to be outstanding. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we estimated the
expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model. For the
first three quarters of fiscal 2006 and for fiscal 2005 and 2004, we estimated the expected term of
options granted based on historical exercise patterns. We have examined our historical pattern of
option exercises in an effort to determine if there were any discernable patterns of activity based
on certain demographic characteristics. Demographic characteristics tested included age, salary
level, job level and geographic location. We have determined that there were no meaningful
differences in option exercise activity based on the demographic characteristics tested.

Expected Volatility

. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we estimate the volatility of
our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of one-year and two-year
publicly traded options on our common stock, consistent with SFAS 123(R) and SAB 107. Our decision
to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common
stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price
trends than historical volatility. Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we estimated the
volatility of our common stock at the date of grant using the historical volatility of our stock
over periods that were approximately equal to the average expected term of our options or the
length of the offering periods under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Risk-Free Interest Rate.

We base the risk-free interest rate that we use in the Black-Scholes
option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on U.S. Treasury
zero-coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms.

Dividends.

We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate
paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend
yield of zero in the Black-Scholes option valuation model.

Forfeitures.

SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those
estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use
historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation
expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. For purposes of calculating pro forma
information under SFAS 123 for periods prior to fiscal 2006, we accounted for forfeitures as they
occurred.

We define in-the-money options at July 31, 2006 as options that had exercise prices that were lower
than the $30.87 market price of our common stock at that date. The aggregate intrinsic value of
options outstanding at July 31, 2006 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of
the underlying options and the market price of our common stock for the 47.9 million shares that
were in-the-money at that date. There were 35.0 million in-the-money options exercisable at July
31, 2006. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the twelve months ended July 31,
2006 was $158.1 million, determined as of the date of exercise.

We recorded $66.0 million in share-based compensation expense for stock options and our
Employee Stock Purchase Plan and $5.3 million in share-based compensation expense for restricted
stock awards in continuing operations for the twelve months ended July 31, 2006. The total tax
benefit related to this share-based compensation was $25.7 million. At July 31, 2006, there was
$103.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based
compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to
expense in the future. Total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in
estimated forfeitures. We expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of
2.2 years.



We received $257.6 million in cash from option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements
for the twelve months ended July 31, 2006. The actual tax benefits that we realized related to tax
deductions for non-qualified option exercises and disqualifying dispositions under all share-based
payment arrangements totaled $62.0 million for that period.

Due to our ongoing program of repurchasing our common stock on the open market, at July 31, 2006 we
had 85.1 million treasury shares. We satisfy option exercises from this pool of treasury shares.

Comparable Disclosures

As discussed in Note 1, we accounted for share-based employee compensation under SFAS 123(R)’s fair
value method during the twelve months ended July 31, 2006. Prior to August 1, 2005 we accounted for
share-based employee compensation under the provisions of APB 25. Accordingly, we recorded no
share-based compensation expense for stock options or our Employee Stock Purchase Plan for the
twelve months ended July 31, 2005 and 2004. The following table illustrates the effect on our net
income and net income per share for the twelve months ended July 31, 2005 and 2004 if we had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to share-based compensation using the
Black-Scholes valuation model.

13. Benefit Plans

Executive Deferred Compensation Plan

In December 2004 we adopted a new 2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan that was effective
January 1, 2005. We adopted the 2005 Plan to meet the requirements of the new restrictions on
deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The 2005 Plan was designed
to track the provisions of our original Executive Deferred Compensation Plan that became effective
March 15, 2002. All deferrals for compensation that would otherwise be payable on or after January
1, 2005 and employer contributions made on or after January 1, 2005 are credited to participants
under the new 2005 Plan. No new deferrals or contributions will be made to the original plan. Both
plans provide that executives who meet minimum compensation requirements are eligible to defer up
to 50% of their salaries and up to 100% of their bonuses and commissions. We have agreed to credit
the participants’ contributions with earnings that reflect the performance of certain independent
investment funds. We may also make discretionary employer contributions to participant accounts in
certain circumstances. The timing, amounts and vesting schedules of employer contributions are at
the sole discretion of the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of
Directors or its delegate. The benefits under this plan are unsecured and are general assets of
Intuit. Participants are generally eligible to receive payment of their vested benefit at the end
of their elected deferral period or after termination of their employment with Intuit for any
reason or at a later date to comply with the restrictions of Section 409A. Discretionary company
contributions and the related earnings vest completely upon the participant’s disability, death or
a change of control of Intuit.

We made employer contributions to the plan of $0.5 million in fiscal 2006, $1.3 million in fiscal
2005 and $0.8 million in fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2004 and 2003, we also entered into several
agreements in which we committed to make employer contributions on behalf of certain executives
provided that they remain employed at Intuit on certain future dates. All contributions were fully
vested at the time of contribution. We held assets of $26.5 million and liabilities of $27.8
million related to this plan at July 31, 2006 and assets of $19.3 million and liabilities of $19.9



million related to this plan at July 31, 2005. Assets related to this plan are in other long-term
assets and liabilities related to this plan are in other current liabilities on our balance sheets. The plan liabilities
include accrued employer contributions not yet funded to the plan.

401(k) Plan

Employees who participate in the Intuit Inc. 401(k) Plan may contribute up to 20% of pre-tax salary
to the plan, subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The plan allows Intuit to
make matching contributions. During fiscal 2006 we matched employee contributions to the greater of
(a) $0.75 per dollar of salary contributed by the employee, up to a maximum matching contribution
of $3,000; or (b) 75 percent of the first six percent of salary contributed by the employee,
subject to IRS limitations. Fifty percent of matching contributions vest after two years of service
by the employee and 100 percent of matching contributions vest after three years of service.
Matching contributions were $23.6 million in fiscal 2006, $13.4 million in fiscal 2005 and $10.1
million in fiscal 2004. Participating employees who are age 50 or older may also make catch-up
contributions. These contributions are not matched.

14. Stockholder Rights Plan

On April 29, 1998 our Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan designed to protect the
long-term value of Intuit for its stockholders during any future unsolicited acquisition attempt.
In connection with the plan, the Board declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right
for each share of Intuit’s common stock outstanding on May 11, 1998 (the Record Date) and further
directed the issuance of one such right with respect to each share of Intuit’s common stock that is
issued after the Record Date, except in certain circumstances. If a person or a group (an Acquiring
Person) acquires 20% or more of Intuit’s common stock, or announces an intention to make a tender
offer for Intuit’s common stock, the consummation of which would result in a person or group
becoming an Acquiring Person, then the rights will be distributed (the Distribution Date). After
the Distribution Date, each right may be exercised for 1/6000

th

of a share of a newly
designated Series B Junior Participating Preferred stock at an exercise price of $300.00. The
rights will expire on May 1, 2008. In July 2002 we adopted a policy that requires an independent
committee of our Board of Directors to review the rights plan at least once every three years to
consider whether maintaining the rights plan continues to be in the best interests of Intuit and
its stockholders. In April 2005 the Nominating and Governance Committee of our Board of Directors,
which is composed solely of independent directors, reviewed the rights plan and determined that it
continues to be in the best interests of Intuit and its stockholders.

15. Litigation

Stock Option-Related Matters

In light
of media reports alleging improper stock option granting practices by
public companies, including a report
from the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, in May 2006 we began a voluntary review of our
historical stock option grant activities and related accounting treatment. Our Board of Directors
formed a special committee of independent directors to conduct this review with the assistance of
independent legal counsel and independent forensic accounting support. The primary scope of this
review covered the period from August 1, 1997 to the present. Subsequent to our initiation of this
review, we received an informal inquiry from the Securities and Exchange Commission and a subpoena
from the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California requesting documents
relating to our historical stock option granting practices. We have fully cooperated with both of
these inquiries and will continue to do so. On August 16, 2006 we announced the completion of our
independent review, which uncovered no evidence of fraud or intentional wrongdoing in our
historical stock option granting practices. We have reported this conclusion to the SEC and the
United States Attorney.



Muriel Siebert & Co., Inc. v. Intuit Inc., Index No. 03-602942, Supreme Court of the State of New
York, County of New York.

On September 17, 2003 Muriel Siebert & Co., Inc. filed a complaint against Intuit alleging various
claims for breach of contract, breach of express and implied covenants of good faith and fair
dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, misrepresentation and/or fraud, and promissory estoppel. The
allegations relate to Quicken Brokerage powered by Siebert, a strategic alliance between the two
companies. The complaint seeks compensatory damages of up to $11.1 million, punitive damages of up
to $33.0 million and other damages. Intuit unsuccessfully sought to compel the matter to
arbitration. On February 7, 2005 Intuit filed a motion to dismiss all but one of the plaintiff’s
claims in New York state court. On September 6, 2005 the court dismissed Siebert’s fraud and
punitive damages claims. The case is now stayed pending appellate review by the Appellate Division
of the New York Supreme Court of certain procedural issues in the case. Intuit believes this
lawsuit is without merit and will vigorously defend the litigation.

Other Litigation Matters

Intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened
litigation, that arise in the normal course of our business, including assertions that we may be
infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others. We currently believe that the
ultimate amount of liability, if any, for any pending claims of any type (either alone or combined)
will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We also
believe that we would be able to obtain any necessary licenses or other rights to disputed
intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms. However, the ultimate outcome of any
litigation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on Intuit
because of defense costs, negative publicity, diversion of management resources and other factors.
Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual
property claims could adversely affect our business.

16. Related Party Transactions

Loans to Executive Officers and Other Employees

Prior to July 30, 2002, loans to executive officers were made generally in connection with their
relocation and purchase of a residence near their new place of work. The loans were all approved by
the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors, which consists
solely of independent directors. Consistent with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation
enacted on July 30, 2002, we have not made or modified any loans to executive officers since that
date and we do not intend to make or modify any loans to executive officers in the future. At July
31, 2006 no loans were in default and all interest payments were current in accordance with the
terms of the loan agreements.

At July 31, 2006 and July 31, 2005, loans to executive officers in the principal amount of $5.7
million and $6.0 million were outstanding and loans to other employees in the principal amount of
$3.2 million were outstanding. These amounts were classified as long-term assets on our balance
sheets in accordance with the terms of the loan agreements. Loans to executive officers and other
employees at July 31, 2006 excluded a $5.0 million secured loan to one executive officer who ceased
to be an Intuit employee in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. We transferred this loan to other
long-term assets on our balance sheet during that quarter.

Of the total loans to executive officers and other employees at July 31, 2006, $4.4 million accrue
no interest for the term of the note. The remaining loans to executive officers and other employees
at July 31, 2006 accrue interest at rates equal to the applicable federal rates in effect at the
time the loans were made. All of the loans to executive officers and other employees at July 31,
2006 were secured by real property and had original terms of 10 years.

Repurchases of Vested Restricted Stock

In the third quarters of fiscal 2005 and 2004 we entered into share repurchase agreements with
Stephen M. Bennett, our chief executive officer, pursuant to which we repurchased shares of our
common stock from Mr. Bennett at the closing price quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market on the dates
of repurchase. We repurchased 31,890 shares of our common stock at $20.91 per share from Mr.
Bennett in fiscal 2005 and 34,314 shares at $22.32 per share in fiscal



2004. All of the proceeds from these repurchases were remitted to federal and state taxing
authorities to satisfy Mr. Bennett’s federal, state and Medicare tax withholding obligations
resulting from the vesting of 75,000 shares of our common stock in each of those two quarters under
his January 2000 new-hire restricted stock awards. These repurchases were approved by the
Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors, which consists
solely of independent directors.

17. Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

The following tables contain selected quarterly financial data for fiscal years 2006 and 2005. We
accounted for our Intuit Public Sector Solutions and Intuit Information Technology Solutions
businesses as discontinued operations and as a result the operating results of these businesses
have been segregated from continuing operations in our financial statements and in these tables.
