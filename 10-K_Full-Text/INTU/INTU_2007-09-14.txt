ITEM 1

BUSINESS

CORPORATE BACKGROUND

General

Intuit Inc. is a leading provider of business and financial management solutions for small and
medium sized businesses; financial institutions, including banks and credit unions; consumers; and
accounting professionals. Our flagship products and services, including QuickBooks, Quicken and
TurboTax software, simplify small business management and payroll processing, personal finance, and
tax preparation and filing. ProSeries and Lacerte are Intuit’s leading tax preparation software
suites for professional accountants. Our financial institutions division, anchored by Digital
Insight Corporation, provides on-demand banking services to help banks and credit unions serve
businesses and consumers with innovative solutions. Founded in 1983 and based in Mountain View,
California, we had revenue of $2.7 billion in our fiscal year ended July 31, 2007. We had
approximately 8,200 employees in major offices in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and
other locations as of July 31, 2007.

Intuit was incorporated in California in March 1984. In March 1993 we reincorporated in Delaware
and completed our initial public offering. Our principal executive offices are located at 2700
Coast Avenue, Mountain View, California, 94043, and our telephone number at that location is
650-944-6000. We maintain our corporate Web site at

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Intuit’s Mission

Intuit’s mission is to revolutionize people’s lives by solving important problems. Our goal is to
create solutions so profound and simple that customers wouldn’t dream of going back to their old
ways of keeping their books, managing their businesses, preparing their or their clients’ taxes, or
organizing their finances.

We have three principal businesses – Small Business, Tax and Financial Institutions – and report
our financial results in six segments. Small Business includes our QuickBooks segment and our
Payroll and Payments segment.



Tax includes our Consumer Tax and Professional Tax segments. Financial Institutions is its own
segment, and our sixth segment is Other Businesses. Following is a more detailed description of
each segment:

Company Growth Strategy

Our strategy is to be in growth businesses, high-profit businesses and attractive new markets with
large unmet or underserved needs that we can solve well. Our core competency is customer-driven
innovation applied to solve important customer problems simply. We seek to continuously improve our
existing solutions to delight customers by creating product and service experiences that are
dramatically better than the alternatives. We approach new opportunities by developing products and
services designed to attract customers who do not use software products (non-consumption) and by
offering solutions that have better value compared with higher-priced alternatives (disruption).
This strategy helps us to build large user bases and create durable competitive advantage.

Our offerings serve consumers, small business and tax customers, and accounting professionals, who
are both customers and recommenders of our products and services. We divide potential customers
into three groups:

•

“Self-Directed” Customers: These customers are comfortable using software and doing the
work themselves. They are likely to use products such as QuickBooks, QuickBooks Standard
Payroll, TurboTax and online banking applications that we provide through financial
institutions.

•

“Self-Directed with Assistance” Customers: These customers are comfortable doing much
of the work themselves, but want some assistance and assurance that they have done it
right. They are likely to use services such as QuickBooks support and QuickBooks Assisted
Payroll. We are increasing our focus on serving these customers – particularly in our
consumer tax and payroll businesses. We believe that this customer segment offers
significant potential for Intuit as many of these customers are served today either by
fully self-directed solutions or by full-service solutions that are more expensive and
complicated than they need.

•

“Can’t Be Bothered” Customers: These customers want lots of human assistance and are
likely to use full-service providers. We do not focus on these customers.

Four fundamentals support our growth strategy:

•

We carefully choose the businesses we are in, focusing on businesses with large unmet or
underserved market opportunities where we believe we can build a strategic and durable
advantage.

•

We actively look for significant new customer problems and apply our core competency of
customer-driven innovation to solve those problems with simple, easy-to-use solutions.

•

We solicit and act on feedback from our customers so that we can continually improve our
existing products and services. Our goal is customers who are so happy with our products
and services that they actively recommend them to others. We call these customers
promoters, who create positive word-of-mouth and brand preference.

•

We apply operational rigor and process excellence principles to execute more effectively
on a daily basis. Our goal is to provide better customer experiences at lower cost.

Right for Me Initiatives

Our focus on customer needs is embodied in Right for Me initiatives. Rather than approach our
targeted markets with a “one size fits all” mentality, we dig deeper to understand the many
different needs of various customer segments. We then use this knowledge to develop products and
services to meet those different needs. Over the past



several years, for example, we have gone from offering just two versions of QuickBooks to offering
many QuickBooks solutions that address different needs. See

“Products and Services”

below for more
information.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

Intuit offers its products and services in six business segments: QuickBooks, Payroll and Payments,
Consumer Tax, Professional Tax, Financial Institutions and Other Businesses. For financial
information about these segments, see

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations”

in Item 7 and Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8.

fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005.

QuickBooks

QuickBooks Software

. Our QuickBooks product line brings bookkeeping capabilities and business
management tools to small business users in an easy-to-use design that does not require them to be
familiar with debit and credit accounting. As part of our Right for Me strategy, we offer a range
of products to suit the needs of different types of small businesses. Our products include
QuickBooks Simple Start, which provides accounting functionality suitable for very small, less
complex businesses; QuickBooks Pro, which provides accounting functionality suitable for slightly
larger businesses, including those with payroll needs; QuickBooks Pro for Mac; QuickBooks Premier,
which provides small businesses with advanced accounting functionality and business planning tools;
and QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions, designed for larger mid-market businesses. Our Premier and
Enterprise products also come in a range of industry-specific editions, including Accountant,
Manufacturing and Wholesale, Retail, Non-Profit, Contractor, and Professional Services. In
addition, we offer a Web-based version of QuickBooks called QuickBooks Online Edition that is
suitable for multiple users working in various locations.

QuickBooks Technical Support

. We currently offer a minimum of 30 days of free technical support
for all of our QuickBooks offerings. We also offer several additional technical support options to
our customers. These include support plans that are sold separately and priced based on the level
of personal assistance and response time the customer requires; a free self-help information
section on our QuickBooks.com Web site; and free access to the online QuickBooks Community at

www.QuickBooksgroup.com.

Financial Supplies

. We offer a range of financial supplies designed for small businesses and
individuals for use with QuickBooks. These include paper checks, envelopes, invoices and deposit
slips. We also offer tax forms, tax return presentation folders and other supplies for professional
tax preparers. Our customers can personalize many products to incorporate their logos and use a
variety of color, font and design options.

QuickBooks Point of Sale Solutions

. Our QuickBooks Point of Sale offering helps retailers manage
customer transactions and inventories. The Basic version is suitable for single stores that want to
process sales using barcodes and track inventory and customer purchases while the Pro version
offers more advanced functionality such as serial number tracking and the ability to process
layaways and special orders. The Pro Multi-Store version allows the transfer of information between
stores. We sell this software with or without the accompanying hardware.



Intuit Developer Network

. The Intuit Developer Network is an initiative that encourages
third-party software developers to build applications that exchange data with QuickBooks and other
Intuit products by giving them access to certain application programming interfaces. Developers who
register with the Intuit Developer Network have access to the latest QuickBooks software
development kit, QuickBooks software downloads and member benefits such as QuickBooks marketing
tools, development kit forums and one-on-one engineering support. At the end of fiscal 2007,
approximately 350 third-party applications were available for QuickBooks and other Intuit products
at

www.marketplace.intuit.com.

Payroll and Payments

Small Business Payroll.

QuickBooks Payroll is a family of products sold on a subscription basis to
small businesses that prepare their own payroll or want some assistance with preparing their
payroll. It is also sold to accountants who use QuickBooks and help their clients manage their
payrolls. The product family includes QuickBooks Basic Payroll, which provides payroll tax tables
for customers with up to three employees; QuickBooks Standard Payroll, which provides payroll tax
tables and federal forms for customers of any size; QuickBooks Enhanced Payroll, which in addition
to the Standard Payroll features also provides state forms, workers’ compensation tracking and
eFile & Pay for federal and state payroll taxes; QuickBooks Enhanced Payroll for Accountants, which
has several accountant-specific features in addition to the features in QuickBooks Enhanced
Payroll; and QuickBooks Online Payroll, for use with QuickBooks Online Edition. We also offer
QuickBooks Assisted Payroll, via which Intuit provides the back-end aspects of payroll processing,
including tax payments and filings, for customers who process their payrolls using QuickBooks.
Finally, our Complete Payroll offering provides payroll processing, direct deposit, check delivery
and tax payment services for customers who do not need QuickBooks and who provide payroll
information via the Web or personal computer. Direct deposit is also available with these offerings
for additional fees.

Merchant Services.

Our Innovative Merchant Solutions (IMS) business offers a full range of merchant
services to small businesses. These include credit card, debit card, electronic benefits, check
guarantee and gift card processing services as well as Web-based transaction processing services
for online merchants. In addition to processing services, IMS provides a full range of support for
its merchants that includes customer service, charge-back retrieval and support, and fraud and loss
prevention screening.

Consumer Tax

Our Consumer Tax business offers a number of tax return preparation products and services that
appeal to customers whose returns have varying levels of complexity, consistent with our Right For
Me strategy. Our current solutions include:

Consumer Tax Return Preparation Offerings

. Our TurboTax products and services are designed to
enable individuals and small business owners to prepare their own federal and state personal and
small business income tax returns easily, quickly and accurately. They are designed to be easy to
use, yet sophisticated enough for complex tax returns. For the 2006 tax season we offered a range
of software products and services that included desktop and online versions of TurboTax Basic,
TurboTax Deluxe, TurboTax Premier, and TurboTax Home and Business. We also offered TurboTax
Business desktop software and TurboTax Free Edition online. Our online offerings are an interactive
tax preparation service that enables individual taxpayers to prepare and electronically file their
federal and state income tax returns entirely online. In addition, our innovative Instant Data
Entry feature enables taxpayers to import data directly into their tax returns from Form W-2
(wages) and Form 1099 (interest, dividends and stock transactions) from participating financial
institutions and payroll service companies. This feature saves TurboTax users time and increases
accuracy.

Electronic Filing and Other Services

. Through our electronic filing center, our desktop and
Web-based tax preparation customers can electronically file their federal income tax returns, as
well as state returns in all states that support electronic filing. For the 2006 tax year our
online tax services were offered through the Web sites of approximately 1,900 financial
institutions, electronic retailers and other merchants and on Yahoo!® Finance Tax Center. We also
offer services that enable taxpayers to pay for their tax products and services with their
anticipated refund.



Intuit Tax Freedom Project

. Under the Intuit Tax Freedom Project, we provide online federal and
state income tax return preparation and electronic filing services at no charge to eligible
taxpayers. In fiscal 2007 we provided approximately 1.5 million free federal returns under this
initiative. We are a member of the Free File Alliance, a consortium of private sector companies
that entered into an agreement with the federal government in October 2002, which was renewed in
October 2005 for four additional years. Under this agreement, a number of private sector companies
have been providing Web-based federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to eligible
taxpayers. See also

“Competition – Consumer Tax”

later in this Item 1.

Professional Tax

Our Professional Tax segment provides a variety of software and services for accountants and tax
preparers in public practice who serve multiple clients. We design, create, sell and support
offerings that help professional accountants and tax preparers provide accounting, tax planning and
tax compliance services to their individual and business clients and that help them manage their
own practices more effectively. Our current professional tax software product lines are Lacerte and
ProSeries. Lacerte software is designed for full-service accounting firms that prepare the most
complex returns. We offer two versions of our ProSeries software: ProSeries Professional Edition,
designed for year-round tax practices that prepare moderately complex tax returns; and ProSeries
Basic Edition, designed for the needs of smaller and seasonal tax practices. Customers can elect to
license professional tax products for a flat fee for unlimited annual use, or use them on a
“pay-per-return” basis. Lacerte and ProSeries customers can file their clients’ tax returns using
our electronic filing services. We also offer EasyACCT Professional Accounting Series, which allows
accountants to create financial statements and prepare tax forms such as Form W-2 and Form 940 for
their clients, as well as several other software products that help accountants provide a broader
spectrum of services to their clients.

Financial Institutions

Our Digital Insight business provides a comprehensive portfolio of outsourced online banking
software products that are generally hosted in our data centers and delivered as an on-demand
service offering to small and medium sized financial institutions.

Consumer Banking.

We offer Internet banking applications that financial institutions make
available to their retail customers. These applications include the ability to view transaction
history, account balances, check images and statements; funds transfer between accounts;
inter-institutional transfers; bill payment and bill presentment; and interfaces to personal
financial management software such as Quicken.

Business Banking.

We also offer business banking software products and services that financial
institutions make available to their business customers. These offerings include features similar
to those of our retail product as well as lockbox reporting, payroll direct deposit, wire and
inter-account fund transfers, account reconciliations, foreign exchange trade and interfaces to
business financial management software such as QuickBooks. Our business banking software products
can be deployed as a licensed software implementation or hosted in our data centers. A licensed
implementation allows financial institutions to host our software using their own equipment and
facilities.

Other Banking Products and Services.

We offer supporting products and services for consumer and
business online banking that include Web portal technology, wireless capability, target marketing,
professional services and Web site development and maintenance.

Other Businesses

Quicken.

Our Quicken line of desktop software products helps users organize, understand and manage
their personal finances. Quicken allows customers to reconcile bank accounts, record credit card
and other transactions, write checks, and track investments, mortgages and other assets and
liabilities. Quicken also allows customers to flag their tax-related financial transactions and
download that information into our TurboTax consumer tax return preparation software. We offer
Quicken Starter Edition and Quicken Deluxe as well as Quicken Premier, which offers more robust
investment and tax planning tools; Quicken Home and Business, which allows customers to manage both
personal and small business finances in one application; and Quicken for Mac.



Intuit Real Estate Solutions

. Our Intuit Real Estate Solutions business offers software and
related technical support, consulting and training services for residential, commercial and
corporate property managers. In addition to its domestic operations, this business has operations
in six international locations.

Canada and the United Kingdom.

In Canada, we offer versions of QuickBooks that we have
“localized,” that is, customized to meet the unique needs of customers in that specific
international location. These include QuickBooks software offerings, payroll offerings and service
plans. We also offer QuickTax and TaxWiz consumer tax return preparation software; ProFile
Financial Application Suite professional tax preparation products and ProFile Advisor memberships
for accountants; and localized versions of Quicken in Canada. In the United Kingdom, we offer
localized versions of QuickBooks and QuickBooks Payroll, including products and services sold in
partnership with banks.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

Since the personal computer and software industries are characterized by rapid technological
change, shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements, a
continuous high level of investment is required for the enhancement of existing products and the
development of new products. We develop the majority of our products internally. We may also
supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring strategically important products and
technology from third parties, or establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or
expand our offerings more rapidly. We have a number of United States patents and pending
applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology.

Our traditional core desktop software products – QuickBooks, Quicken, TurboTax, Lacerte and
ProSeries – tend to have fairly predictable, structured development cycles of about a year, with
annual product releases. We also develop new products for which development cycles are less
predictable. Developing consumer and professional tax software presents unique challenges because
of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate tax law and tax form changes
within a rigid timetable. The development timing for our other small business and financial
institutions offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the
development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each particular project.

In our Financial Institutions business, we have relationships and have developed interfaces with
most of the major vendors of core processing software and outsourced core processing services to
financial institutions. These system interfaces allow us to access a financial institution’s host
system to provide end users access to their account data. In addition to developing new interfaces,
we continue to significantly enhance our many existing interfaces in order to deliver more robust
connectivity and increase operating efficiencies.

We continue to make substantial investments in research and development. Our future research and
development efforts will be focused on enhancing existing products and services and on developing
new products and services to address customer needs in existing and new markets. We anticipate that
the products we develop in the future will offer increased ease of use, be customized for specific
customer categories, be Web-integrated or Web-based, and feature improved integration with other
Intuit and third party products and services and with our internal information systems. We also
expect to continue to focus significant research and development efforts on multi-year projects to
modernize the technology platforms for many of our products. Our research and development expenses
were $472.5 million or 17% of total net revenue in fiscal 2007, $385.8 million or 17% of total net
revenue in fiscal 2006, and $292.6 million or 15% of total net revenue in fiscal 2005.

SEASONALITY

Our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Professional Tax businesses are highly seasonal. Some of our other
offerings are also seasonal, but to a lesser extent. Revenue from many of our small business
software products, including QuickBooks, tends to be at its peak around calendar year end, although
the timing of new product releases or changes in our offerings can materially shift revenue between
quarters. Sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the
period from November through April. In our Consumer Tax business, a greater proportion of our
revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of
TurboTax Online, for which revenue is recognized upon filing. These seasonal patterns mean that our
total net



revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending January 31 and third quarter ending
April 30. We typically report losses in our first quarter ending October 31 and fourth quarter
ending July 31, when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue
at relatively consistent levels.

MARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS

Markets

Our primary target customers are small and medium sized businesses, consumers, accounting
professionals, and small and medium sized financial institutions. The markets in which we compete
have always been characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent
new product introductions and enhancements by competitors. Over the past few years the Internet has
accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that customers learn about and purchase
products. Real-time, personalized online experiences are rapidly becoming the standard. Many
customers now begin their shopping process online and make their purchase either online or at a
retail location, driving the need to create integrated, multi-channel shop and buy experiences.
Market and industry changes are quickly rendering existing products and services obsolete, so our
success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models,
updated competitive strategies, new or enhanced products and services, alternative distribution
methods and other changes in the way we do business.

Our target customers for outsourced online consumer and business banking are small and medium sized
financial institutions seeking a comprehensive Internet solution in order to compete with the
larger national banks in their market. The majority of our sales opportunities are with financial
institutions evaluating a conversion from a competitive Internet banking platform, often in
response to end user demands for increased functionality. To a lesser degree, we market to
newly-created banks and other financial institutions that have yet to offer online banking to their
customers.

Marketing Programs

To sell our products and services to small businesses, consumers and accounting professionals, we
use a variety of marketing programs to generate software orders, stimulate demand and generally
maintain and increase customer awareness of our products and services. These programs include
direct-response mail and email campaigns; Web marketing, including purchasing key words from major
search engine companies; telephone solicitations; newspaper, magazine, billboard, radio and
television advertising; and promotional offers that we coordinate with major retailers and computer
original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs. We also use workflow-integrated in-product messaging in
some of our software products to market other related products and services, including third-party
products and services.

In our Financial Institutions business, our marketing efforts are primarily focused on identifying
potential financial institution clients and marketing our services to consumer end users in
cooperation with our financial institution clients. Our marketing efforts include press relations,
advertising, direct mail, trade show meetings with Internet banking user groups, and client
conferences hosted by us and our core processing partners. We offer cooperative marketing programs
under which our financial institution clients partner with us to promote higher adoption and
retention of the online channel and cross-sell additional products to online end users. We also
receive marketing benefits in our Financial Institutions business from endorsements and promotional
arrangements. We are exclusively endorsed by the American Bankers Association (ABA) for our
Internet banking product and we have promotional arrangements with several state banking
associations that promote our products to their constituents.

Sales and Distribution Channels

Multi-Channel Shop and Buy Experiences.

Our customers increasingly use the Internet to research
products and services. Some customers buy these products and services online, while others prefer
to make their final decision at a retail location. We tailor our Web sites, promotions and retail
displays to this emerging integrated multi-channel shop and buy model.

Direct Sales Channel

. We sell many of our products and services for small businesses, consumers
and accounting professionals directly to our customers through our Web sites and call centers.



In our Financial Institutions business, we sell our products and services to financial institutions
using a direct sales model and, to a lesser extent, in cooperation with core processing partners.
Our sales and account management team is primarily organized by financial institution asset size
and location. Our typical sales cycle is approximately six to twelve months for new financial
institutions and four to six months for add-on sales to existing customers. Financial Institutions
sales compensation plans are aligned with our primary goals of driving new sales, renewing
contracts with existing customers and selling add-on products to existing customers.

Retail Distribution Channel

. We sell our QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken software and small
business payroll services at retail in the United States by selling directly and through
distributors to office supply superstores, warehouse clubs, consumer electronics retailers, general
mass merchandisers, e-commerce companies and catalogers. In Canada and other international markets,
we also rely on distributors and other third parties, who sell products into the retail channel.

We continue to benefit from strong relationships with a number of major North American retailers,
which allows us to minimize our dependence on any specific retailer. We deliver products to larger
retailers through a combination of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central warehouse
locations. We also sell and ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through
distributors. See

“Manufacturing and Distribution”

later in this Item 1. We continue to
aggressively manage our inventory to optimize in-stock presence and ensure good product placement
within retail stores. In response to current retail trends, we are also placing a greater
proportion of inventory with retailers on a consignment basis.

OEM Channel

. Through our relationships with selected personal computer OEMs, we sell software to
customers purchasing new OEM systems and we sell products offered by OEMs to their customers after
the point of sale. Although revenue from our OEM channel is much less significant than revenue from
our other distribution channels, OEM relationships help us to attract new customers and generate
sales of our core desktop software products.

Third-Party “Value-Added” Distribution Arrangements

. In our Financial Institutions business, we
have joint marketing arrangements with several core processing vendors. More than half of our
Financial Institutions segment revenue is derived from these referral and reseller agreements with
core processing vendors. They include Fiserv, Open Solutions, Inc,. Fidelity Information Services,
Inc., Metavante Corporation and Computer Services Inc. To deliver bill payment and bill presentment
services to our financial institution customers, we also maintain value-added reseller
relationships with major providers such as Metavante Corporation and CheckFree Corporation. We have
integrated these products into our offerings, enabling financial institutions to offer bill payment
and bill presentment within their online banking suites.

We supplement our small business and consumer direct sales capabilities and our retail and OEM
distribution relationships with selected third-party distribution arrangements. We believe these
relationships will enhance the growth opportunities for certain product and service offerings by
allowing us to benefit from the value-added marketing and sales expertise of these third parties.
For example, our Innovative Merchant Solutions merchant services business participates in a limited
liability company that acquires merchant customers for IMS. See Note 1 to the financial statements
in Item 8. During fiscal 2008 and beyond, we expect to continue to optimize, expand and support our
network of third-party relationships.

COMPETITION

Overview

We face intense competition in all of our businesses, both domestically and internationally.
Competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve, particularly small business,
consumer tax and online banking, has grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this
trend to continue. Some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial, technical
and marketing resources than we do. As we implement our customer-driven strategies, we face
increased competitive threats from larger companies than we have historically faced. In addition,
the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete.
This is particularly true for Web-based products and services, where the barriers to entry are
lower than they are for more traditional software products and services. To attract customers, many
new Web-based competitors are offering free or low-priced entry-level products which we must take
into account in our pricing strategies.



Our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology solutions similar to
ours. However, for many of our products and services, other important competitive alternatives for
customers are manual tools and processes, or general-purpose software. Many of our new customers
have used pencil and paper or software such as word processors and spreadsheets, rather than
competitors’ software and services, to perform financial tasks. For example, many taxpayers
prepared their tax returns manually before using TurboTax; a large number of small businesses used
spreadsheets to keep their books and calculate their payrolls before purchasing QuickBooks; and
many end user customers used paper checkbooks to track their bank accounts and pay their bills
before using online banking software. We believe that there is a long-term trend away from manual
methods and toward the use of both online and desktop software to accomplish these tasks that will
provide us future growth opportunities.

Competition Specific to Business Segments

Small Business.

QuickBooks is the leading product in the retail sales channel for its category. We
face significant competitive challenges in our QuickBooks business and our Payroll and Payments
business from Microsoft Corporation, which in September 2005 launched accounting software and
associated services that directly target small business customers. Increasingly, our small business
products and services also face competition from free online banking and payment services offered
by financial institutions and others. In our merchant services business, we also compete directly
with a number of independent sales organizations, none of which dominates the market.

Consumer Tax

. In the private sector we face intense competition primarily from H&R Block, the
makers of TaxCut software, and increasingly from Web-based offerings such as 2nd Story Software’s
TaxACT, where we are subject to significant and increasing price pressure. We also compete for
customers with assisted tax preparation businesses such as H&R Block.

We also face potential competitive challenges in our Consumer Tax business from publicly funded
government entities that offer electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to
individual taxpayers. We are a member of the Free File Alliance, a consortium of private sector
companies that signed an agreement with the federal government in October 2002 that was renewed for
four years in October 2005. Under this agreement, a number of private sector companies, rather than
the federal government, have been providing Web-based federal tax preparation and filing services
at no cost to eligible federal taxpayers through initiatives such as our Intuit Tax Freedom
Project. Approximately 20 states have also adopted Free File Alliance public-private agreements
while approximately 20 other states offer some form of direct government tax preparation and filing
services free to qualified taxpayers. We continue to actively work with others in the private and
public sectors to advance the goals of the Free File Alliance policy initiative and to support
successful public-private partnerships. However, future administrative, regulatory or legislative
activity in this area could harm our Consumer Tax business.

Professional Tax.

Our ProSeries professional tax offerings face pricing pressure from competitors
seeking to obtain our customers through deep product discounts and loss of customers to competitors
with offerings at lower prices. Our Lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from
competitively-priced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with non-tax
functionality.

Financial Institutions.

The market for Internet banking services is highly competitive. In the
area of retail Internet banking, we primarily compete with other companies that provide outsourced
online banking services to financial institutions, including Online Resources, S1 Corporation and
FundsXpress (a subsidiary of First Data Corporation). Also, vendors such as Corillian (now part of CheckFree
Corporation) that primarily target the largest financial institutions occasionally compete with us
in our market segment. In addition, Fiserv, Open Solutions, Inc., Fidelity Information Services,
Inc., Jack Henry, Metavante Corporation and several other vendors of core processing services to
financial institutions offer their own online banking products, although many of these firms also
offer our products through a referral or reseller arrangement with us. Our primary competitors in
the business banking services market segment are vendors of business banking systems for large
corporations and include P&H Solutions, BankLink, Fundtech, and S1 Corporation.

Competitive Factors

We believe the most important competitive factors for our core software products – QuickBooks,
Quicken, TurboTax, Lacerte and ProSeries – are ease of use, product features, size of the installed
customer base, brand name recognition, value, and product and support quality. Access to
distribution channels is also important for our QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken products. In
addition, the ability for customers to upgrade within product families as their businesses grow is
a significant competitive factor for our QuickBooks products. Productivity is also an important
competitive factor for the full-service accounting firms to which we market our Lacerte products.
We believe we compete effectively on these factors as our QuickBooks, Quicken and TurboTax products
are the leading products in the retail sales channel for their respective categories.

For our service offerings such as small business payroll, merchant services and outsourced online
banking, features and ease of use, the integration of these products with related software, brand
name recognition, effective distribution, quality of support and scalability of operations are
important competitive factors.



CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT

We provide customer service and technical support by telephone, e-mail, online chat, online
communities, and our customer service and technical support Web sites. We have full-time and
outsourced customer service and technical support staffs, which we supplement with seasonal
employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes, such as during the tax
return filing season or following a major product launch. We outsource to several firms
domestically and internationally. Most of our internationally outsourced consumer and small
business customer service and technical support personnel are currently located in India and the
Philippines.

We offer free self-help information through our technical support Web sites for QuickBooks,
Quicken, TurboTax and our Professional Tax software products. Customers use our Web sites to find
answers to commonly asked questions and check on the status of orders. Under certain support plans,
customers can also use our Web sites to receive product updates electronically. Support
alternatives and fees vary by product. We also sponsor online user communities where customers can
share product advice with each other.

MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION

Desktop Software and Supplies

The major steps involved in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing CDs, printing boxes
and related materials, and assembling and shipping the final products. We have a manufacturing
agreement with ModusLink Corp. under which ModusLink provides substantially all outsourced
manufacturing related to our retail launches of QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken, as well as for
day-to-day retail order fulfillment after product launches. We have centralized the manufacturing
for our retail products in a ModusLink facility which is co-located with our primary retail
fulfillment vendor, Ingram Micro Logistics (IML), a division of Ingram Micro Inc. ModusLink has
operations in multiple locations that can provide redundancy if necessary. We also outsource the
product manufacturing and distribution for most of our direct sales orders to Arvato Services,
Inc., a division of Bertelsmann AG. We use Harland Clarke, a division of M&F Worldwide Corporation,
exclusively to fulfill orders for all of our printed checks and most other products for our
financial supplies business.

Our retail product launches are operationally complex. Our model for product delivery for retail
launches and replenishment is a hybrid of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central
warehouse locations. This allows improved inventory management by our retailers. We also ship
products for many of our smaller retail customers through distributors. We have an agreement with
IML under which IML handles all logistics, fulfillment and similar functions for our retail sales.

We have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has historically not been a
significant problem for us. Prior to major product releases for our core desktop software products
we tend to have significant levels of backlog, but at other times backlog is minimal and we
typically ship products within a few days of receiving an order. Because of this fluctuation in
backlog, we believe that backlog is not a reliable predictor of our future core desktop software
sales.

Internet-Based Products and Services

Intuit’s data centers house most of the systems, networks and databases required to operate and
deliver our Internet-based products and services. These include QuickBooks Online Edition, online
payroll products and services for QuickBooks and non-QuickBooks users, TurboTax Online, consumer
and professional electronic tax filing services, and Digital Insight outsourced online banking
applications and services. Through our data centers, we connect customers to products and services
and we store the vast amount of data that represents the content on our Web sites. As our
businesses continue to move toward delivering more Web-based products and services, this
infrastructure will become even more critical in the future. Our data centers consist of numerous
servers and databases located in several sites across the United States. Due to our evolving
business needs, we have begun executing a plan to build a new data center in Washington state to
support our longer term hosting and system availability requirements.



PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION AND TRANSACTIONS

We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations and to financial
institution requirements relating to the privacy and security of customer and employee personal
information. We are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to telemarketing and email
activities. Additional laws in both areas are likely to be passed in the future, which could result
in significant limitations on the ways in which we can use personal information and communicate
with our customers, or may significantly increase our compliance costs. If our business expands to
new industry segments that are regulated for privacy and security, or to countries outside the
United States that have strict data protections laws, our compliance requirements and costs will
increase.

We comply with United States federal and other country guidelines and practices to help ensure that
customers are aware of, and can control, how we use information about them. Our primary Web sites,
such as QuickBooks.com and TurboTax.com, have been certified by TRUSTe, an independent, non-profit
organization that operates a Web site privacy certification program representing industry standard
practices to address users’ and regulators’ concerns about online privacy. We also use privacy
statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices, as well as provide them the
opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information.

To address security concerns, we use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the
information customers give to us from loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration. Whenever customers
transmit sensitive information, such as a credit card number or tax return data, to us through one
of our Web sites, that information is stored on servers that allow encryption of the information as
it is transmitted to us. We work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external
access using numerous commercially available computer security products as well as internally
developed security procedures and practices.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

The financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation.
Our financial institution customers, which include commercial banks and credit unions, operate in
markets that are subject to rigorous regulatory oversight and supervision. The compliance of our
products and services with these requirements depends on a variety of factors including the
particular functionality, the interactive design and the charter or license of the financial
institution. Our financial services customers must independently assess and determine what is
required of them under these regulations and are responsible for ensuring that our system and the
design of their Web sites conform to their regulatory obligations.

We are not licensed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration or other federal or state agencies that
regulate or supervise depository institutions or other providers of financial services. Our Digital
Insight subsidiary is examined by the Federal Financial Institution Examination Council under the
Information Technology examination guidelines. Although we believe we are not subject to direct
supervision by federal and state banking agencies with regard to other regulations, we have from
time to time agreed to examinations of our business and operations by these agencies. We are also
subject to encryption and security export laws and regulations which, depending on future
developments, could render our business or operations more costly, less efficient or impossible.

Our consumer tax and professional tax businesses are also subject to federal and state government
requirements, including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns, the provision
of tax preparer assistance and the use of customer information. In addition, we offer certain other
products and services, such as small business payroll, which are subject to special regulatory
requirements. As we expand our financial institutions, tax and small business products and
services, we may become subject to additional government regulation. New laws or regulations may be
adopted in these areas that could impose significant limitations on our business and increase our
cost of compliance. We continually analyze new business opportunities, and new businesses that we
pursue may require additional costs for regulatory compliance.



INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We regard our products as proprietary. We attempt to protect our intellectual property by relying
on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret and trademark laws, restrictions on disclosure
and other methods. In particular, we have a substantial number of registered trademarks including
Intuit, QuickBooks, TurboTax, Lacerte, ProSeries, Digital Insight and Quicken. We have registered
these and other trademarks and service marks in the United States and, depending on the relevance
of each brand to other markets, in many foreign countries. Most registrations can be renewed
perpetually at 10-year intervals. We also currently hold a small but growing patent portfolio. We
regularly file applications for patents, copyrights and trademarks and service marks in order to
protect proprietary intellectual property that we believe is important to our business. We also
license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our products.

We face a number of risks relating to our intellectual property, including unauthorized use and
unauthorized copying, or piracy, of our products. Litigation may be necessary to protect our
intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of
others. Patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be
enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction. Furthermore, other parties have
asserted and may, in the future, assert infringement claims against us. These claims and any
litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement
against us along with an assessment of damages. Litigation, even if not meritorious, could result
in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. In addition, third party
licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.

EMPLOYEES

As of July 31, 2007 we had approximately 8,200 employees in major offices in the United States,
Canada, the United Kingdom and other locations. We believe our future success and growth will
depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business. We do
not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and we believe employee
relations are generally good. Although we have employment-related agreements with a number of key
employees, these agreements do not guarantee continued service. We believe we offer competitive
compensation and a good working environment. We were named one of

Fortune

magazine’s “100 Best
Companies to Work For” in each of the last six years. However, we face intense competition for
qualified employees, and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention.



ITEM 1A

RISK FACTORS

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. All statements in this report,
other than statements that are purely historical, are forward-looking statements. Words such as
“expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “forecasts,” “estimates,” “seeks,” and
similar expressions also identify forward-looking statements. In this report, forward-looking
statements include, without limitation, the following:

We caution investors that forward-looking statements are only predictions based on our current
expectations about future events and are not guarantees of future performance. We encourage you to
read carefully all information provided in this report and in our other filings with the SEC before
deciding to invest in our stock or to maintain or change your investment. These forward-looking
statements are based on information as of the filing date of this Annual Report, and we undertake
no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statement for any reason.

Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors
that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking
statements. These factors include the following:

We face intense competitive pressures in all of our businesses that may harm our operating results.

We have formidable competitors, and we expect competition to remain intense during fiscal 2008 and
beyond. The number, resources and sophistication of the companies with whom we compete have
increased as we continue to expand our product and service offerings. Our competitors may
introduce new and improved products and services, bundle new offerings with market-leading
products, reduce prices, gain better access to distribution channels, advertise aggressively or
beat us to market with new products and services. We also face growing competition from providers
of free online and desktop accounting, tax, banking and other financial services. Any of these
competitive actions taken over any prolonged period could diminish our revenue and profitability
and could affect our ability to keep existing customers and acquire new customers.



QuickBooks and Payroll and Payments.

Losing existing or potential QuickBooks customers to
competitors causes us to lose potential revenue in the short-term and limits our opportunities to
sell related products and services in the future. Many competitors provide accounting and business
management products and services to small businesses. For example, Microsoft Corporation currently
offers a version of its small business accounting software for no additional charge to users of its
operating system, and offers, in partnership with third parties, several other competitive products
and services for small businesses. Although we have successfully competed with Microsoft in the
past, Microsoft’s small business offerings may have a significant negative impact on our future
revenue and profitability.

We may experience pricing pressure for our small business payroll offerings due to the larger size
and economies of scale of certain competitors in that business. The growth of electronic banking
and other electronic payment systems is decreasing the demand for checks and consequently causing
pricing pressure for our financial supplies business as competitors aggressively compete for share
of this shrinking market.

Consumer Tax.

Our consumer tax business faces significant competition from both the public and
private sector. In the public sector we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities
developing or contracting to provide software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation
and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers.

•

Government Encroachment

. Agencies of the U.S. federal and state governments have made
several recent attempts to offer taxpayers free online tax preparation and filing services.
In October 2002 the Internal Revenue Service agreed not to provide its own competing tax
software product or service so long as participants in a consortium of tax preparation
software companies, including Intuit, agreed to provide Web-based federal tax preparation
and filing services at no cost to qualified taxpayers under an arrangement called the Free
File Alliance. In October 2005 the IRS and the Free File Alliance signed a new four-year
agreement that continues to restrict the IRS from entering the tax preparation business.
Although the Free File Alliance has kept the federal government from being a direct
competitor to Intuit’s tax offerings, it has fostered additional Web-based competition and
could cause us to lose significant revenue opportunities from our Consumer Tax customer
base. Companies have used the Free File Alliance and its position on the IRS Web site as a
marketing tool to grow brand awareness and attract customers to their other paid services,
including state tax filing, which has intensified competition. In addition, taxpayers who
formerly have paid for Intuit’s products may elect to use our or our competitors’ free
federal service instead. The IRS retains the right to terminate the agreement with the Free
File Alliance upon 24 months written notice. If the IRS were to terminate the agreement and
elect to provide government software and electronic filing services to taxpayers at no
charge, or if the federal government were to significantly alter the Free File Alliance or
require the provision of government tax filing services directly to taxpayers, our revenue
and profits could suffer. See the discussion on the Free File Alliance in Item 1,

“Business
– Competition.”

In 2007, approximately 20 state governments had agreements with the private sector based on
the federal Free File Alliance agreement and had agreed to discontinue or otherwise not
provide direct government tax preparation services. However, approximately 20 other states,
including California, directly offered their own online tax preparation and filing services
to taxpayers. For the 2004 and 2005 tax years California tested a limited pilot program
under which a state-operated electronic system automatically prepared and filed
approximately 10,000 state income tax returns with no individual transaction charge to those
taxpayers. The California Franchise Tax Board voted in December 2006 to renew and expand the
program for tax year 2007, even though the California legislature had previously enacted a
law restricting the extension of this program beyond the 2005 tax year. These or similar
programs could be introduced or expanded in the future, which could cause us to lose
customers and enable our competitors to gain market share by using free offerings to attract
customers to ancillary paid offerings. We anticipate that governmental encroachment will
present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future.

•

Private Sector Competition

. In the private sector we face intense competition primarily
from H&R Block, which offers tax preparation services and software, and from other
companies offering Web-based offerings such as 2nd Story Software, which subjects us to
significant and increasing price pressure. In addition, the availability of free online
tax preparation services, whether through the Free File Alliance or otherwise, may reduce
demand for our paid offerings which would harm our business and results of operations.
Pricing pressure may also cause us to bundle products and services for which we have



previously charged separate fees, which could lead to a decrease or deferral of revenue and
could harm our operating results.

Professional Tax.

Our ProSeries professional tax offerings face pricing pressure from competitors
seeking to obtain our customers through deep product discounts and loss of customers to competitors
with offerings at lower prices. Our Lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from
competitively-priced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with non-tax
functionality.

Financial Institutions.

In February 2007 we completed the acquisition of Digital Insight
Corporation, which provides outsourced online banking applications and services to financial
institutions including banks and credit unions. We now compete with several companies that provide
these services to financial institutions. The market for online banking services is highly
competitive. We face competition from two main sources: other companies similar to Digital Insight
that offer outsourced Internet banking offerings, and vendors of core processing services to
financial institutions. Also, vendors that primarily target the largest financial institutions
occasionally compete in our target market. In some instances, we also compete with companies with
whom we have referral or reseller relationships. Some of our current and potential competitors
have longer operating histories and may be in a better position to produce and market their
services due to their greater technical, marketing and other resources, as well as their greater
name recognition and larger installed bases of customers. In addition, many of our competitors
have well-established relationships with our current and potential financial institution customers
and core processing vendors and have extensive knowledge of our industry.

As we negotiate the renewal of long-term service contracts with current customers, we may be
subject to competitive pressures and other factors that may require concessions on pricing and
other material contract terms to induce the customer to remain with us. We depend on our financial
institution clients to market and promote our products to their end user customers, but these
efforts may not be successful, and we may not be able to persuade potential customers to adopt our
solutions in place of financial institutions’ own proprietary solutions or offerings by third
parties. If we are unable to compete effectively with other online banking service providers, our
business results may suffer.

Future revenue growth for our core products depends upon our successful introduction of new and
enhanced products and services.

A number of our businesses derive a significant amount of their revenue through one-time upfront
license fees and rely on customer upgrades and service offerings to generate a significant portion
of their revenues. In addition, our consumer tax business depends significantly on revenue from
customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services.
As our existing products mature, encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more
challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful
incremental value. If we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of upgraded
products to our customers, our upgrade and service revenues will be harmed. Similarly, our
business will be harmed if we are not successful in our efforts to develop and introduce new
products and services to retain our existing customers, expand our customer base and increase
revenues per customer. Unless our online banking offerings are successfully deployed and marketed
by a significant number of financial institutions and achieve widespread market acceptance by their
end user customers for a significant period of time, our business may also be harmed.

In some cases, we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on products
or services that do not ultimately succeed in their markets. We have encountered difficulty in
launching new products and services in the past. For example, due to lack of customer demand we
discontinued our SnapTax consumer tax offering at the end of fiscal 2005 and we discontinued our
Easy Estimator for contractors offering at the end of fiscal 2007. If we misjudge customer needs,
our new products and services will not succeed and our revenues and earnings will be harmed. As we
expand our offerings to new customer categories we run the risk of customers shifting from higher
priced and higher margin products to newly introduced lower priced offerings. For instance, our
QuickBooks Simple Start and ProSeries Basic offerings may attract users that would otherwise have
purchased our higher priced, more full featured offerings.



If we fail to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our electronic tax
offerings, or if the IRS or other governmental agencies experience difficulties in receiving
customer submissions, we could lose customers and our revenue and earnings could decrease.

Our Web-based tax preparation services and electronic filing services are an important and growing
part of our tax businesses and must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during the
peak tax season from January to April. We face significant risks and challenges in maintaining
these services and maintaining adequate service levels, particularly during peak volume service
times. Similarly, governmental entities receiving electronic tax filings must also handle large
volumes of data and may experience difficulties with their systems preventing the receipt of
electronic filings. If customers are unable to file their returns electronically they may elect to
make paper filings. This would result in reduced electronic tax return preparation and filing
revenues and would harm our reputation and ability to attract and retain customers. For example,
on April 17, 2007 our customers experienced significant delays in electronically filing their
income tax returns due to an intermittent database problem in our e-filing system. We refunded
approximately $9 million in credit card charges for our consumer electronic filing and online tax
preparation services that were made during the time that the delays occurred. These refunds did not
have a significant impact on our fiscal 2007 financial condition or results of operations. However,
we may experience problems with our online systems and services in the future, and any prolonged
interruptions in our Web-based tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the
tax season would result in lost customers, additional refunds of customer charges, negative
publicity and increased operating costs, any of which could significantly harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

The nature of our products necessitates timely product launches and if we experience significant
product quality problems or delays, it will harm our revenue, earnings and reputation.

All of our tax products and many of our non-tax products have rigid development timetables that
increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays. Our tax preparation
software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate
unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels
of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing
deadline. Due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which
we operate, our products sometimes contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the
operation of the software. When we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code,
distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage
existing product inventory in our distribution channels. If we encounter development challenges or
discover errors in our products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product
launch date. Any major defects or launch delays could lead to loss of customers and revenue,
negative publicity, customer and employee dissatisfaction, reduced retailer shelf space and
promotions, and increased operating expenses, such as inventory replacement costs, legal fees or
payments resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due
solely to calculation errors in our consumer tax preparation products.

Our
businesses collect, use and retain personal customer information and
enable customer transactions, which presents security
risks, requires us to incur expenses and could harm our business.

A number of our businesses collect, use and retain large amounts of personal customer information,
including credit card numbers, tax return information, bank account numbers and passwords, personal
and business financial data, social security numbers and other payroll information. These
businesses also enable customers to perform various transactions. In addition, we collect and
maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business. Some of this
personal customer and employee information is held and some transactions are executed by third
parties. We and our vendors use commercially available security technologies to protect
transactions and personal information. We use security and business controls to limit access and
use of personal information. However, a third party may be able to circumvent these security and
business measures, and errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could
result in a breach of customer or employee privacy or theft of assets. We employ contractors,
temporary and seasonal employees who may have access to the personal information of customers and
employees or who may execute transactions in the normal course of their duties. While we conduct
necessary and appropriate background checks of these individuals and limit access to systems and
data, it is possible that one or more of these individuals could circumvent these controls,
resulting in a security breach. The ability to execute transactions and the possession and use of
personal information in conducting our



business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens
that could require notification of a security breach, restrict
our use of personal information and hinder our ability to acquire new customers or market to
existing customers. We have incurred — and will continue to incur — significant expenses to
comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation,
industry standards or contractual obligations.

In the past we have experienced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues and we
could face similar suits in the future. A major breach of our security measures or those of third
parties that execute transactions or hold and manage personal information could have serious
negative consequences for our businesses, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced
customer demand for our services, harm to our reputation and brands, further regulation and
oversight by federal or state agencies, and loss of our ability to provide financial transaction
services or accept and process customer credit card orders or tax returns. From time to time, we detect, or receive notices from customers or public or private agencies
that they have detected, vulnerabilities in our software or in third-party software components that
are distributed with our products. The existence of vulnerabilities, even if they do not result in
a security breach, can harm customer confidence and require substantial resources to address, and
we may not be able to discover or remediate such security vulnerabilities before they are
exploited. Although we have
sophisticated network and application security, internal control measures, and physical security
procedures to safeguard our systems, there can be no assurance that a security breach, loss or
theft of personal information will not occur, which could harm our business, customer reputation
and results of operations. If our business expands to new industry segments that are regulated for
privacy and security, or to countries outside the United States that have more strict data
protection laws, our compliance requirements and costs will increase.

Our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and our quarterly results fluctuate significantly.

Several of our businesses are highly seasonal causing significant quarterly fluctuations in our
financial results. Revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and third
fiscal quarters ending January 31 and April 30 due to our tax businesses contributing most of their
revenue during those quarters and the timing of the release of our small business software products
and upgrades. We experience lower revenues, and significant operating losses, in the first and
fourth quarters ending October 31 and July 31. For example, in the second and third quarters of
fiscal 2006 and 2007 we had total net revenue of between $731.5 million and $1.14 billion while in
the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006 and 2007 we had total net revenue of between $292.1
million and $432.7 million. Our financial results can also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and
year to year due to a variety of factors, including changes in product sales mix that affect
average selling prices; product release dates; the timing of our discontinuance of support for
older product offerings; our methods for distributing our products, including the shift to a
consignment model for some of our desktop products sold through retail distribution channels;
changes to our bundling strategy, including the inclusion of upgrades with certain offerings,
changes to how we communicate the availability of new functionality in the future, and the timing
of our delivery of state tax forms (any of which can impact the pattern of revenue recognition);
and the timing of acquisitions, divestitures, and goodwill and purchased intangible asset
impairment charges.

The growth of our business depends on our ability to adapt to rapid technological change.

The software industry in which we operate is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving
industry standards and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. We must continually
invest in our software architecture and developer tools in order to enhance our current products
and develop new products to meet changing customer needs and to attract and retain talented
software developers. We are currently in the process of modernizing the software platforms for a
number of our product lines, including our QuickBooks, payroll, merchant services, TurboTax,
Lacerte, Proseries and Quicken products and services. Completing these upgrades and adapting to
other technological developments may require considerable time and expense. If we experience
prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in upgrading our software architecture, our ability to
develop new products and enhancements to our current products would suffer.

Interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could compromise
the availability and security of our online products and services, which could damage our
reputation and harm our operating results.

The availability of our online products and services, including TurboTax Online, tax filing
services, QuickBooks Online Edition, online payroll and banking services, and online commerce
sites, depends on a the continuing operation of our information technology and communication
systems and those of our external service providers. Any damage to or failure of our systems could
result in interruptions in our service, which could reduce our revenues and profits, and damage our
brand. In order to prevent interruptions to the availability of our ecommerce Web sites and
Internet-based products and services, we have implemented practices for creating a fault-tolerant



environment. However, we do not have complete redundancy for all of our systems, and our disaster
recovery
planning cannot account for all eventualities. Despite our efforts to maintain continuous and
reliable server operations, we occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties.
Due to our evolving business needs and real estate planning, we have begun executing a plan to
build a new data center in Washington state to support our longer term hosting requirements. If we
do not execute this transition to the new data center in an effective manner, we could experience
unplanned service disruptions or unforeseen increases in cost which could harm our operating
results and our business. We do not maintain real-time back-up of our data, and in the event of
significant system disruption, particularly during peak tax filing season, we could experience loss
of data or processing capabilities, which could cause us to lose customers and could materially
harm our reputation and our operating results.

Our data centers and our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage
or interruption from natural disasters, malicious attacks, fire, power loss, telecommunications
failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm our
systems. If hackers were able to circumvent our security measures, we could lose proprietary
information or experience significant disruptions in the delivery of our products and services. If
our systems become unavailable or suffer a security breach, we may expend significant resources to
address these problems, and our reputation and operating results could suffer.

We rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers, distributors and
service providers to take and fulfill customer orders, handle customer service requests and host
certain online activities. Any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems could
prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause company
and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed. Our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand
our network security and other information systems could be costly, and problems with the design or
implementation of system enhancements could harm our business and our results of operations.

Our reliance on a limited number of manufacturing and distribution suppliers could harm our
business.

We have chosen to outsource the manufacturing and distribution of many of our desktop software
products to a small number of third party providers and we use a single vendor to produce and
distribute our check and business forms supplies products. Although our reliance on a small number
of suppliers, or a single supplier, provides us with efficiencies and enhanced bargaining power,
poor performance by or lack of effective communication with these parties can significantly harm
our business. This risk is amplified by the fact that we carry very little inventory and rely on
just-in-time manufacturing processes. In particular, the loss of our principal manufacturing
partner for retail would be disruptive to our business and could cause delay in a product launch.
We seek to mitigate this risk by managing our second tier vendors and maintaining contingency
plans. If we experience delays during a peak demand period or significant quality issues our
business could be significantly harmed.

As our product and service offerings become more complex our revenue streams may become less
predictable

.

Our expanding range of products and services generates more varied revenue streams than our
traditional desktop software businesses. The accounting policies that apply to these revenue
streams are more complex than those that apply to our traditional products and services. We expect
this trend to continue as we expand our offerings. For example, as we begin to offer additional
features and options as part of multiple-element revenue arrangements, we could be required to
defer a higher percentage of our product revenue at the time of sale than we do for traditional
products. This would decrease recognized revenue at the time products are shipped, but result in
increased recognized revenue in fiscal periods after shipment.

We face a number of risks in our merchant card processing business that could result in a reduction
in our revenue and earnings.

Our merchant card processing service business is subject to several specific risks, including the
following:

•

if merchants for whom we process credit card transactions are unable to pay refunds due
to their customers in connection with disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions we may
be required to pay those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of the customer
reserves we have established to make such payments;



Should any of these risks be realized our business and financial results would suffer.

Risks associated with our financial institutions business may harm our results of operations and
financial condition.

In February 2007 we completed the acquisition of Digital Insight, a provider of outsourced online
banking services and applications to financial institutions. This new financial institutions
business is subject to several risks, including the following:

•

consolidation among core processing vendors may affect our reseller and revenue-sharing
agreements with certain core processor organizations or reduce the likelihood of extending
our agreements at expiration;

•

if any of our products fail to be supported by financial institutions’ core processing
vendors, we would have to redesign our products to suit these financial institutions, and
we cannot assure that any redesign could be accomplished in a cost-effective or timely
manner, and we could experience higher implementation costs or the loss of current and
potential customers;

•

the financial institutions business experiences lengthy sales cycles for a variety of
reasons, which could cause us to expend substantial employee and management resources
without making a sale or could cause our operating results to fall short of anticipated
levels for a particular quarter; and

•

consolidation of the banking and financial services industry could result in a smaller
market for our products and services, may cause us to lose relationships with key
customers, or may result in a change in the technological infrastructure of the combined
entity, which may make it difficult to integrate our offerings.

Our dependence on a small number of larger retailers and distributors could harm our results of
operations.

We sell most of our desktop software products through our retail distribution channel and a
relatively small number of larger retailers and distributors generate a significant portion of our
sales volume. Our principal retailers have significant bargaining leverage due to their size and
available resources. Historically, some retailers have elected to offer our tax products
exclusively. Any change in principal business terms, loss of exclusivity, major disruption or
termination of a relationship with these resellers could result in a potentially significant
decline in our revenues and earnings. The sourcing decisions, product display locations and
promotional activities that retailers undertake can greatly impact the sales of our products. The
fact that we also sell our products directly could cause retailers or distributors to reduce their
efforts to promote our products or stop selling our products altogether. If any of our retailers or
distributors experience financial difficulties we may be unable to collect amounts that we are
owed. At January 31, 2007, in the midst of the 2006 consumer tax season, amounts due from our 10
largest retailers and distributors represented approximately 57% of total gross accounts
receivable.

Increased government regulation of our businesses could harm our operating results.

The tax preparation industry has received increased attention from legislative and regulatory
bodies in recent years, both because of the continuing focus on free tax preparation and because of
the nature of certain services used to process and transfer refunds to taxpayers. If legislative
or regulatory bodies increase their regulation or oversight of the tax preparation industry or
restrict the types of products and services that can be offered to consumers, this could



increase
our cost of doing business by requiring compliance with new regulations, and could limit our
revenue opportunities.

We are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to
successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services. Changes in state-imposed
requirements by one or more of the states, including the required use of specific technologies or
technology standards, could significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our
customers and could prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely
manner.

Our financial institutions business provides services to banks, credit unions and other
institutions that are subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation. As a result,
our financial institution customers require that our products and services comply with the
regulations applicable to these customers. If we are unable to comply with these regulations, we
could incur significant costs and penalties, face litigation or governmental proceedings, and lose
our ability to sell to these customers. Any of these adverse events could harm our results of
operations and our reputation. In addition, as we seek to grow our business, we may expand into
more highly-regulated areas, which will require increased investment in compliance and auditing
functions or new technologies in order to meet regulatory standards. Government authorities could
adopt other laws, rules or regulations that place new burdens or restrictions on our business or
determine that our operations are directly subject to existing rules or regulations, such as
requirements related to data collection, retention and processing, which could make our business
more costly, less efficient or impossible to conduct, and could require us to modify our current or
future products or services, which could harm our operating results.

If we do not respond promptly and effectively to customer service and technical support inquiries
we will lose customers and our revenue and earnings will decline.

The effectiveness of our customer service and technical support operations are critical to customer
satisfaction and our financial success. If we do not respond effectively to service and technical
support requests we will lose customers and miss revenue opportunities, such as paid service,
product renewals and new product sales. We occasionally experience customer service and technical
support problems, including longer than expected waiting times for customers when our staffing and
systems are inadequate to handle a higher-than-anticipated volume of requests. Training and
retaining qualified customer service and technical support personnel is particularly challenging
due to the expansion of our product offerings and the seasonality of our tax business. For
example, although many of our consumer tax service representatives return each tax season, it is
challenging to expand the number of representatives from about 150 during off-season months to
about 1,500 at the peak of the season. If we do not adequately train our support representatives
our customers will not receive an appropriate level of support, we will lose customers and our
financial results will suffer.

If we encounter problems with our third-party customer service and technical support providers our
business and operating results will be harmed.

We outsource a substantial portion of our customer service and technical support activities to
domestic and international third-party service providers, including service providers in India and
the Philippines, and we expect to continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future. This
strategy provides us with lower operating costs and greater flexibility, but also presents risks to
our business, including the following:

•

In recent years India and the Philippines have experienced political instability and
changing policies that may impact our operations. In addition, for a number of years India
and Pakistan have been in conflict and an active state of war between the two countries
could disrupt our services.

•

Customers may react negatively to providing information to and receiving support from
overseas organizations.

•

We may not be able to affect the quality of support as directly as we are able to in our
company-run call centers.

•

International outsourcing has received considerable negative attention in the media,
which could harm our reputation, and the U.S. government may adopt legislation that would
affect how we operate and how customers perceive our service. For example, members of the
U.S. Congress have discussed restricting the flow of personal information to overseas
providers and requiring representatives in foreign jurisdictions to affirmatively identify
themselves by name and location.



•

We rely on a global communications infrastructure that may be interrupted in a number of
ways. For example, in fiscal 2007 an earthquake in Taiwan caused temporary disruption to
overseas infrastructure.

We are exposed to risks associated with credit card and payment fraud and with credit card
processing.

Many of our customers use credit cards or automated payment systems to pay for our products and
services. We have suffered losses, and may continue to suffer losses, as a result of orders placed
with fraudulent credit card or other payment data. For example, under current credit card
practices, we may be liable for fraudulent credit card transactions if we do not obtain a
cardholder’s signature, a frequent practice in Internet sales. We employ technology solutions to
help us detect fraudulent transactions. However, the failure to detect or control payment fraud
could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

We are subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, as in
effect from time to time. Failure to comply with these rules or requirements may subject us to
fines and higher transaction fees or cause us to lose our ability to accept credit card payments
from our customers, resulting in harm to our business and results of operations.

If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may exploit our
innovations, which could weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue and earnings.

Our success depends upon our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of copyright, trade
secret, trademark, patent, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and
protect our proprietary rights. As part of our confidentiality procedures, we generally enter into
non-disclosure agreements with our employees, contractors, distributors and corporate partners and
into license agreements with respect to our software, documentation and other proprietary
information. The creation and protection of our proprietary rights are expensive and may require
us to engage in costly and distracting litigation. Despite these precautions, third parties could
copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization. Because we
outsource significant aspects of our product development, manufacturing and distribution we are at
risk that confidential portions of our intellectual property could become public by lapses in
security by our contractors. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future,
certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These
licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our
reputation. It is also possible that other companies could successfully challenge the validity or
scope of our patents and that our patent portfolio, which is relatively small, may not provide us
with adequate protection. Ultimately, our attempts to secure legal protection for our proprietary
rights may not be adequate and our competitors could independently develop similar technologies,
duplicate our products, or design around patents and other intellectual property rights. If our
intellectual property protection proves inadequate we could lose our competitive advantage and our
financial results will suffer.

Third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur
significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products.

From time to time, we have received claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights
of others. As the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of
these products further overlap, and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, we
believe that we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims, including patent,
copyright, and trademark infringement claims. We expect that software products in general will
increasingly be subject to these claims as the number of products and competitors increase, the
functionality of products overlap and as the patenting of software functionality continues to grow.
We have, from time to time, received allegations of patent infringement claims in the past and may
receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our products infringe upon patents held
by third parties. Some of these claims are currently the subject of pending litigation against us
and against some of our OEM customers. These claims may involve patent holding companies or other
adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own, and against whom our own
patents may provide little or no deterrence. Future claims could present an exposure of uncertain
magnitude. The ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, any
such claim, with or without merit, could be time consuming to defend, result in costly litigation,
divert management’s time and attention from our business, require us to stop selling, to delay
shipping or to redesign our products, or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or
licensing arrangements, or to satisfy indemnification



obligations that we have with some of our
customers. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation arising out of
intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business.

In addition, we license and use software from third parties in our business. These third party
software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms. Also, these third
parties may from time to time receive
claims that they have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, including patent and
copyright infringement claims, which may affect our ability to continue licensing their software.
Our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays or other
disruptions in our business, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.

We expect copying and misuse of our intellectual property to be a persistent problem causing lost
revenue and increased expenses.

Our intellectual property rights are among our most valuable assets. Policing unauthorized use and
copying of our products is difficult, expensive, and time consuming. Current U.S. laws that
prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of
many other countries provide very little protection. We may not be able to prevent
misappropriation of our technology. For example, we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of
our software being sold through online auction sites and other online marketplaces. In addition,
efforts to protect our intellectual property may be misunderstood and perceived negatively by our
customers. Although we continue to evaluate and put in place technology solutions to attempt to
lessen the impact of piracy, and we continue to increase our civil and criminal enforcement
efforts, we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased
expenses.

Although we are unable to quantify the extent of piracy of our software products, software piracy
may depress our net revenues. We engage in efforts to educate consumers on the benefits of
licensing genuine products and to educate lawmakers on the advantages of a business climate where
intellectual property rights are protected, and we cooperate with the Software & Information
Industry Association in their efforts to combat piracy. However, these efforts may not
fully combat the effect of piracy of our products.

We do not own all of the software, other technologies and content used in our products and
services.

Many of our products are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. We
believe we have all of the necessary licenses from third parties to use and distribute third party
technology and content that we do not own that is used in our current products and services. From
time to time we may be required to renegotiate with these third parties — or negotiate with new
third parties — to include their technology or content in our existing products, in new versions
of our existing products or in wholly new products. We may not be able to negotiate or renegotiate
licenses on reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use or
continue to use third-party technology or content in our products and services, we may not be able
to sell the affected products, which would in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and
operating results.

Certain of our offerings include third-party software that is licensed under so-called “open
source” licenses, some of which may include a requirement that, under certain circumstances, we
make available, or grant licenses to, any modifications or derivative works we create based upon
the open source software. Although we have established internal review and approval processes to
mitigate these risks, we cannot be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval
prior to use in our products. Many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be
eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, harm our business.

Our acquisition and divestiture activities could disrupt our ongoing business, may involve
increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions.

We have acquired and may continue to acquire companies, products and technologies that complement
our strategic direction. In February 2007 we completed the acquisition of Digital Insight for
total consideration of approximately $1.34 billion including the value of assumed vested options.
Acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:

•

inability to successfully integrate the acquired technology and operations into our
business and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies, and procedures;

•

inability to realize synergies expected to result from an acquisition;



Acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky. We can not be certain that our previous,
pending or future transactions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the
conduct, operating results or financial condition of our business. Many transactions are subject
to closing conditions, which may not be satisfied, and transactions may not be successfully
completed even after their public announcement. We have generally paid cash for our recent
acquisitions. These transactions may involve further use of our cash resources, the issuance of
equity or debt securities, the incurrence of other forms of debt, the amortization of expenses
related to intangible assets, or potential future impairment charges related to goodwill that we
record on our balance sheet, which will be subject to annual testing in the future, any of which
could harm our financial condition and results of operations. In particular, we allocated a
portion of the purchase price for Digital Insight to goodwill, which could be subject to potential
future impairment charges, and we also allocated a portion of the purchase price to identified
intangible assets, which we expect to amortize over a period of three to five years. Further, we
funded $1 billion of the purchase price of Digital Insight with the proceeds of senior unsecured
notes. The use of debt to fund acquisitions or for other purposes significantly increases our
interest expense and leverage. If we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition,
current shareholders’ percentage ownership and earnings per share may be diluted.

In March 2007 we sold certain assets related to our Complete Payroll and Premier Payroll Service
businesses to ADP. Because the final purchase price is contingent upon the number of customers that
transition to ADP, the final purchase price could be materially less than the maximum purchase
price if we do not successfully transition customers. We also expect to recognize any gain on the
sale of these assets over a period not to exceed one year from the date of sale. Although ADP is
obligated to pay us certain fees to service customers prior to their transition to ADP, our costs
to service these customers may exceed those fees.

We have issued $1 billion in a debt offering and may incur other debt in the future, which could
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

In connection with the acquisition of Digital Insight, we have issued $1 billion in senior
unsecured notes. We have also entered into a $500 million five-year revolving credit facility.
Although we have no current plans to request any advances under this credit facility, we may use
the proceeds of any future borrowing for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or
expansion of our business.

We have not previously incurred substantial amounts of debt for borrowed money, and our incurrence
of this debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other
things:

•

increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive
pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash from operations
to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow
available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions; and

•

limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our
business and our industry.

Our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our
ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness,
and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with
these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, our long-term
non-convertible debt includes covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain
liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the
covenants under our long-term debt or our revolving credit facilities and do not obtain a waiver
from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be
declared immediately due and payable.



In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and
liquidity of both our debt and equity securities. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other
negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility would
increase. In addition, any downgrades in our credit ratings could affect our ability to obtain
additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing.

If actual product returns exceed returns reserves our financial results would be harmed.

We ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to
sell, in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers will run out of products. This is
particularly true for our Consumer Tax products, which have a short selling season and for which
returns occur primarily in our fiscal third and fourth quarters. Like many software companies that
sell their products through distributors and retailers, we have historically accepted significant
product returns. We establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial
statements based on estimated returns and we closely monitor product sales and inventory in the
retail channel in an effort to maintain adequate reserves. In the past, returns have not differed
significantly from these reserves. However, if we experience actual returns that significantly
exceed reserves, it would result in lower net revenue. For example, if we had increased our fiscal
2007 returns reserves by 1% of non-consignment sales to retailers for QuickBooks, TurboTax and
Quicken, our fiscal 2007 total net revenue would have been approximately $3.3 million lower. In
addition, our policy of recognizing revenue from distributors and retailers upon delivery of
product for non-consignment sales is predicated upon our ability to reasonably estimate returns. If
we do not continue to demonstrate our ability to estimate returns then our revenue recognition
policy for these types of sales may no longer be appropriate.

Acquisition-related costs and impairment charges can cause significant fluctuation in our net
income.

Our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses, including amortization and impairment of
purchased intangible assets, charges for in-process research and development, and impairment of
goodwill. Total acquisition-related costs in the categories identified above were $50.9 million in
fiscal 2007, $18.3 million in fiscal 2006 and $21.8 million in fiscal 2005. Although under current
accounting rules goodwill is no longer amortized, we may incur impairment charges related to the
goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions. We test the
impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of
impairment arise. The timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of
operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior
periods. At July 31, 2007, we had $1.5 billion in goodwill and $292.9 million in net purchased
intangible assets on our balance sheet, both of which could be subject to impairment charges in the
future. New acquisitions, and any impairment of the value of purchased assets, could have a
significant negative impact on our future operating results.

If we fail to operate our payroll business effectively our revenue and earnings will be harmed.

Our payroll business handles a significant amount of dollar and transaction volume. Due to the
size and volume of transactions that we handle, effective processing systems and controls are
essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately. Despite our efforts, it is
possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated. In addition to any direct
damages and fines that any such problems would create, which could be substantial, the loss of
customer confidence in our accuracy and controls would seriously harm our business. The systems
supporting our payroll business are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult
to scale. We must constantly continue to upgrade our systems and processes to ensure that we
process customer data in an accurate, reliable and timely manner. These upgrades must also meet
the various regulatory requirements and deadlines associated with employer-related payroll
activities. Any failure of our systems or processes in critical switch-over times, such as in
January when many businesses elect to change payroll service providers, would be detrimental to our
business. If we failed to timely deliver any of our payroll products, it could cause our current
and prospective customers to choose a competitor’s product for that year’s payroll and not to
purchase Intuit products in the future. If these efforts are not successful our revenue growth and
profitability will decline.



Interest income attributable to payroll customer deposits may fluctuate or be eliminated, causing
our revenue and earnings to decline.

We currently record revenue from interest earned on customer deposits that we hold pending payment
of funds to taxing authorities or to customers’ employees. If interest rates decline, or there are
regulatory changes that diminish the amount of time that we are required or permitted to hold such
funds, our interest revenue will decline.

We may be unable to attract and retain key personnel.

Much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel,
including members of our executive team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions.
Experienced personnel in the software and services industries are in high demand and competition
for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley and San Diego, California, where the
majority of our employees are located. Although we strive to be an employer of choice, we may not
be able to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel which would cause our business
to suffer.

We are frequently a party to litigation that is costly to defend and consumes the time of our
management.

Due to our financial position and the large number of customers that we serve we are often forced
to defend litigation. See Item 3,

“Legal Proceedings,”

for information regarding specific pending
litigation. Defending litigation consumes the time of our management and is expensive for Intuit.
Even though we often seek insurance coverage for litigation defense costs, there is no assurance
that our defense costs, which can be substantial, will be covered in all cases. In addition, by
its nature, litigation is unpredictable and we may not prevail even in cases where we strongly
believe a plaintiff’s case has no valid claims. If we do not prevail in litigation we may be
required to pay substantial monetary damages or alter our business operations. Regardless of the
outcome, litigation is expensive and consumes the time of our management and may ultimately reduce
our income.

Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future financial results.

Our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes
in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their
interpretation. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax
returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the
likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our
provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous
examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.

If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to detect fraud
or report our financial results accurately, which could harm our business and the trading price of
our common stock.

We periodically assess our system of internal controls, and the internal controls of service
providers upon which we rely, to review their effectiveness and identify potential areas of
improvement. In addition, from time to time we acquire businesses, many of which have limited
infrastructure and systems of internal controls. Performing assessments of internal controls,
implementing necessary changes, and maintaining an effective controls environment is expensive and
requires considerable management attention. Internal control systems are designed in part upon
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and all such systems, however well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
system are met. Because of the inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
If we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls or prevent fraud, we
could suffer losses, could be subject to costly litigation, investors could lose confidence in our
reported financial information and our brand and operating results could be harmed.

We and our independent registered public accounting firm must certify the adequacy of our internal
controls over financial reporting annually. Identification of material weaknesses in internal
controls over financial reporting could harm our business.



Business interruptions could adversely affect our future operating results.

Several of our major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake, fire, power
shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, and other events beyond our control. The
majority of our research and development activities, our corporate headquarters, our principal
information technology systems, and other critical business operations are located near major
seismic faults. We do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses. While we
maintain disaster recovery facilities for key data centers that support the information systems,
networks and databases that are necessary to operate our business, we do not have disaster recovery
facilities for all of our data centers. Our operating results and financial condition could be
materially harmed in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or man-made disaster.

California for our Innovative Merchant Solutions business. The lease term is 10 years beginning on
October 1, 2008.

Due to our evolving business needs, we have begun executing a plan to build a new data center in
Washington state to support our longer term hosting requirements. In January 2007 we purchased the
land on which to build this data center.

We also lease or own facilities in a number of other domestic locations and internationally in
Canada, the United Kingdom and several other locations. We believe our facilities are adequate for
our current and near-term needs, and that we will be able to locate additional facilities as
needed. See Note 10 to the financial statements in Item 8 for more information about our lease
commitments.



ITEM 3

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Muriel Siebert & Co., Inc. v. Intuit Inc., Index No. 03-602942, Supreme Court of the State of New
York, County of New York

On September 17, 2003 Muriel Siebert & Co., Inc. filed a complaint against Intuit alleging various
claims for breach of contract, breach of express and implied covenants of good faith and fair
dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, misrepresentation and/or fraud, and promissory estoppel. The
allegations relate to Quicken Brokerage powered by Siebert, a strategic alliance between the two
companies. The complaint seeks compensatory damages of up to $11.1 million, punitive damages of up
to $33.0 million, and other damages. Intuit unsuccessfully sought to compel the matter to
arbitration. On February 7, 2005 Intuit filed a motion to dismiss all but one of the plaintiff’s
claims in New York state court. On September 6, 2005 the court dismissed Siebert’s fraud and
punitive damages claims. On May 8, 2007 the Court of Appeals of the State of New York resolved in
Intuit’s favor a motion by Siebert to disqualify Intuit’s counsel, and the case is now proceeding
again in the trial court. No trial date has yet been set. Intuit believes this lawsuit is without
merit and will vigorously defend the litigation.

Other Litigation Matters

Intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened
litigation, that arise in the normal course of our business, including assertions that we may be
infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others. We currently believe that the
ultimate amount of liability, if any, for any pending claims of any type (either alone or combined)
will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The
ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, litigation can have an
adverse impact on Intuit because of defense costs, negative publicity, diversion of management
resources and other factors. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation
arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business.

Stockholders

As of September 6, 2007 we had approximately 900 record holders and approximately 86,000 beneficial
holders of our common stock.

Dividends

Intuit has never paid any cash dividends on its common stock. From time to time we consider the
advisability of paying a cash dividend. We currently anticipate that we will retain all future
earnings for use in our business and for repurchases under our stock repurchase programs. We do not
anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

On July 6, 2006 we implemented a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend.

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities

None.

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers

During the three months ended July 31, 2007 we repurchased no shares of our common stock under our
stock repurchase programs. At July 31, 2007, we had authorization from our Board to expend $800
million for future stock repurchases.

ITEM 6

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following tables show Intuit’s selected financial information for the past five fiscal years.
The comparability of the information is affected by a variety of factors, including acquisitions
and divestitures of businesses, share-based compensation expense, amortization of purchased
intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets, gains and losses related
to marketable equity securities and other investments, and repurchases of common stock under our
stock repurchase programs.

On July 6, 2006 we implemented a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend. All
share and per share figures in the selected financial data below, in Item 7, and in the statement
of operations and notes to the financial statements in Item 8 retroactively reflect this stock
split.

We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment,”

on
August 1, 2005 using the modified prospective transition method. Because we elected to use the
modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated to include
share-based compensation expense for stock options or our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. See Note 1
and Note 12 to the financial statements in Item 8 for more information.

In February 2007 we acquired Digital Insight Corporation for a purchase price of approximately
$1.34 billion and issued $1 billion in related debt. We have included Digital Insight’s results of
operations in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. In July 2007 we
signed a definitive agreement to sell our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions business and the
sale was completed in August 2007. In addition, we sold our Intuit Information Technology Solutions
business in fiscal 2006, our Intuit Public Sector Solutions business in fiscal 2005, and our wholly
owned Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, in fiscal 2003. We accounted for these sold businesses as
discontinued operations and, accordingly, we have reclassified the selected financial data for all
periods presented to reflect them as such. To better understand the information in the tables,
investors should read

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations”

in Item 7, and the financial statements and related notes in Item 8.

ITEM 7

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A)
includes the following sections:

•

Executive Overview that discusses at a high level our operating results and some of the
trends that affect our business.

•

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates that we believe are important to
understanding the assumptions and judgments underlying our financial statements.

•

Results of Operations that includes a more detailed discussion of our revenue and
expenses.

•

Liquidity and Capital Resources which discusses key aspects of our statements of cash
flows, changes in our balance sheets and our financial commitments.

You should note that this MD&A discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks
and uncertainties. Please see the section entitled

“Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors”

at
the beginning of Item 1A for important information to consider when evaluating such statements.

You should read this MD&A in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in Item 8.
As discussed below, in February 2007 we completed the acquisition of Digital Insight Corporation
for a total purchase price of approximately $1.34 billion. Accordingly, we have included Digital
Insight’s results of operations in our consolidated results of operations from the date of
acquisition. We have also reclassified our financial statements for all periods presented to
reflect certain businesses we have sold as discontinued operations. See

“Results of Operations —
Dispositions and Discontinued Operations”

later in this Item 7 for more information. Unless
otherwise noted, the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations.

Executive Overview

This overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that
affect our business. We believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to
understand our financial results for fiscal 2007 as well as our future prospects. This summary is
not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion
and analysis provided elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Seasonality

Our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Professional Tax businesses are highly seasonal. Some of our other
offerings are also seasonal, but to a lesser extent. Revenue from many of our small business
software products, including QuickBooks, tends to be at its peak around calendar year end, although
the timing of new product releases or changes in our offerings can materially shift revenue between
quarters. Sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the
period from November through April. In our Consumer Tax business, a greater proportion of our
revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of
TurboTax Online, for which revenue is recognized upon filing. These seasonal patterns mean that our
total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending January 31 and third quarter
ending April 30. We typically report losses in our first quarter ending October 31 and fourth
quarter ending July 31, when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses
continue at relatively consistent levels. We believe the seasonality of our revenue is likely to
continue in the future.

Overview of Financial Results

Total net revenue for fiscal 2007 was $2.7 billion, up 17% compared with fiscal 2006. We acquired
Digital Insight and created a new Financial Institutions segment in February 2007. Excluding
revenue from our Financial Institutions segment, fiscal 2007 total net revenue increased 11%
compared with fiscal 2006. Almost 30% of the fiscal 2007 revenue increase was due to 15% higher
revenue in our Consumer Tax segment. Our QuickBooks segment and our Payroll and Payments segment
each contributed about 15% of the fiscal 2007 revenue increase.



Operating income from continuing operations of $637.6 million for fiscal 2007 increased 13%
compared with $565.6 million for fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 revenue growth was partially offset by
higher total operating costs and expenses. Higher operating expenses in fiscal 2007 reflect our
acquisition of Digital Insight, continued investment in research and development for new and
existing offerings as well as increases in advertising and other marketing spending to support the
launch of our QuickBooks and Consumer Tax offerings. The effects of these factors are described in
more detail below.

Net income from continuing operations of $443.5 million for fiscal 2007 increased 16% compared with
$381.0 million for fiscal 2006. Interest expense on the debt we issued in connection with our
February 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight was partially offset by higher interest income. We
recorded a pre-tax net gain of $31.7 million on the sale of certain outsourced payroll assets in
fiscal 2007. Our effective tax rates for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were approximately 36% and
38%. Diluted net income per share from continuing operations of $1.25 for fiscal 2007 increased 18%
compared with $1.06 for fiscal 2006. Average shares outstanding declined as a result of repurchases
of common stock under our stock repurchase programs, partially offset by the issuance of shares in
connection with our employee stock plans.

On February 6, 2007 we completed the acquisition of Digital Insight for a total purchase price of
approximately $1.34 billion. In order to finance a portion of this transaction, on February 6, 2007
we borrowed $1 billion under a bridge credit facility, which we retired on March 12, 2007 with the
proceeds of our issuance of $1 billion in senior notes. We funded the remainder of the purchase
price with our existing cash balances. Our future operating results will reflect interest expense
related to the senior notes.

In March 2007 we completed the sale of certain assets related to our Complete Payroll and Premier
Payroll Service businesses to Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP) for a price of up to
approximately $135 million in cash. The final purchase price is contingent upon the number of
customers that transition to ADP. Due to actual customer attrition during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2007, we currently estimate the maximum sales price to be approximately $120 million. We
will recognize the gain on the sale of the assets as customers are transitioned pursuant to the
agreement over a period not to exceed one year from the date of the sale. We recognized a pre-tax
net gain of $31.7 million on the sale of the assets in fiscal 2007.

In July 2007 we signed a definitive agreement to sell our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions
(IDMS) business. The sale was completed in August 2007 for approximately $100 million in cash. IDMS
was part of our Other Businesses segment. We have accounted for IDMS as a discontinued operation
and segregated the net assets and operating results of IDMS from continuing operations for all
periods presented. We expect to record a gain on the sale of IDMS in the first quarter of fiscal
2008.

We ended fiscal 2007 with cash and investments totaling $1.3 billion. In fiscal 2007 we generated
cash from operations, from the issuance of long-term debt and, to a lesser extent, from the
issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. During the same period we used cash for the
purchase of Digital Insight and for purchases of property and equipment. We also repurchased 17.1
million shares of our common stock for $506.6 million under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal
2007. At July 31, 2007, we had authorization from our Board to expend $800 million for future stock
repurchases.

On March 22, 2007 we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for a $500
million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on March 22, 2012. We may use amounts
borrowed under this credit facility for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or
expansion of our business. To date we have not borrowed under the credit facility, but we may
borrow under the credit facility from time to time as opportunities and needs arise. See

“Liquidity
and Capital Resources — Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility”

below for more information.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a
significant impact on our net revenue, operating income or loss and net income or loss, as well as
on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. We believe that the estimates,
assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest
potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting
policies. Senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these



critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Audit
Committee of our Board of Directors.

Net Revenue — Revenue Recognition

We derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products, license fees, software
subscriptions, product support, professional services, payroll services, merchant services,
transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items.
We follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue. For additional
information, see

“Net Revenue”

in Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8. We generally
recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product
or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. However,
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions
and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. For
example, for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to
allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver, to determine whether
undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services, to
determine whether vendor-specific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to
determine whether and when each element has been delivered. If we were to change any of these
assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue
that we report in a particular period. Amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to
arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred
revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied.

In connection with the sale of certain products, we provide a limited amount of free technical
support assistance to customers. We do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with
sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant.
The technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is
recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent. We accrue the estimated cost
of providing this free support upon product shipment.

Net Revenue — Return and Rebate Reserves

As part of our revenue recognition policy, we estimate future product returns and rebate payments
and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates. Our return
policy allows distributors and retailers, subject to contractual limitations, to return purchased
products. Product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of excess
and obsolete products. In determining our product returns reserves, we consider the volume and
price mix of products in the retail channel, historical return rates for prior releases of the
product, trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our
products (including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products). We
fully reserve for excess and obsolete products in the distribution channels.

Our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and end-user rebates.
Our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors’
and retailers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs, which we
typically establish annually. Our reserves for end-user rebates are estimated based on the terms
and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program, actual sales during the promotion and
historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program.

In the past, actual returns and rebates have not differed significantly from the reserves that we
have established. However, actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently
uncertain. If we were to change our assumptions and estimates, our revenue reserves would change,
which would impact the net revenue we report. If actual returns and rebates are significantly
greater than the reserves we have established, the actual results would decrease our future
reported revenue. Conversely, if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our
reserves, this would increase our future reported revenue. For example, if we had increased our
fiscal 2007 returns reserves by 1% of non-consignment sales to retailers for QuickBooks, TurboTax
and Quicken, our fiscal 2007 total net revenue would have been $3.3 million lower.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. The accounts
receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid. In
determining the amount of the



reserve, we consider our historical level of credit losses. We also make judgments about the
creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, and we assess
current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future. Our reserves
have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses. However, since we cannot reliably
predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our
reserves will continue to be adequate. If actual credit losses are significantly greater than the
reserve we have established, that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce
our reported net income. Conversely, if actual credit losses are significantly less than our
reserve, this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our
reported net income.

Business Combinations – Purchase Accounting

Under the purchase method of accounting, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to
the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their
estimated fair values. We record the excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values as
goodwill. We engage third-party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These valuations require us to make significant estimates
and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing
purchased technology, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash
flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and
updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and
projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges. In addition, we
have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate
depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation
or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.

Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets – Impairment Assessments

We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other long-lived
assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary impairment
in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist. We test the
impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of
impairment arise. The timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of
operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior
periods. In order to estimate the fair value of long-lived assets, we typically make various
assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to, consider market
factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business.
We evaluate cash flows at the lowest operating level and the number of reporting units that we have
identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting
units and integrated operations following acquisitions. Based on these assumptions and estimates,
we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated
on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future
values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a
variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal
factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe
the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate,
different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. More
conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in
impairment charges, which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance
sheet. Conversely, less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges,
higher net income and higher asset values. At July 31, 2007, we had $1.5 billion in goodwill and
$292.9 million in net purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet.

Accounting for Share-Based Compensation Plans

Prior to August 1, 2005, we accounted for our share-based employee compensation plans under the
measurement and recognition provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,”

and related Interpretations, as permitted by Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.”

We recorded no share-based employee compensation expense
for options granted under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan or its predecessor plans prior to August
1, 2005 as all options granted under those plans had exercise prices equal to the fair market value
of our common stock on the date of grant. We also recorded no compensation expense in connection
with our Employee Stock Purchase Plan as the purchase price of the stock was not less than 85% of
the



lower of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning of each offering period or at
the end of each purchase period. In accordance with SFAS 123 and SFAS 148,

“Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure,”

we disclosed our net income or loss and net
income or loss per share as if we had applied the fair value-based method in measuring compensation
expense for our share-based incentive programs.

Effective August 1, 2005, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment,”

using the modified prospective transition method. Under that transition
method, compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date includes: (a) period
compensation expense for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of,
August 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
provisions of SFAS 123, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, and (b) period compensation expense for
all share-based payments granted on or after August 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). Because we elected to use the modified
prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. At July 31, 2007,
there was $178.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based
compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to
expense in the future. Total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in
estimated forfeitures. We expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of
2.2 years.

Effective August 1, 2006, we began using a lattice binomial model and the assumptions shown in Note
12 to the financial statements in Item 8 to estimate the fair value of stock options granted. Prior
to that date we used the Black Scholes valuation model. This change did not have a material impact
on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our stock options have various
restrictions, including vesting provisions and restrictions on transfer, and are often exercised
prior to their contractual maturity. We therefore believe that lattice binomial models are more
capable of incorporating the features of our stock options than closed-form models such as the
Black Scholes model. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we estimated the expected term
of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model. Prior to that, we
estimated the expected term of options granted based on historical exercise patterns. We estimate
the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly
traded one-year and two-year options on our common stock, consistent with SFAS 123(R) and
Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107. Our decision to use implied
volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our
assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than
historical volatility. We base the risk-free interest rate that we use in our option valuation
model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity U.S. Treasury
issues with equivalent remaining terms. We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock
and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use
an expected dividend yield of zero in our option valuation model. SFAS 123(R) requires us to
estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if
actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting
option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are
expected to vest. For options granted before August 1, 2005, we amortize the fair value on an
accelerated basis. This is the same basis on which we amortized options granted before August 1,
2005 for our pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123. For options granted on or after August 1, 2005,
we amortize the fair value on a straight-line basis. All options are amortized over the requisite
service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. We may elect to use
different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future, which could materially affect
our net income or loss and net income or loss per share.

Legal Contingencies

We are subject to certain legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation
that arise in the normal course of our business. We review the status of each significant matter
quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or
legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a
liability and an expense for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the
determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable.
Our accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information
becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation
and may revise our estimates. Potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of
potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of
operations.



Income Taxes – Estimates of Effective Tax Rates, Deferred Taxes and Valuation Allowance

When we prepare our financial statements, we estimate our income taxes based on the various
jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our
worldwide income tax provision. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the
United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to
which, additional taxes will be due. We record an additional amount in our provision for income
taxes in the period in which we determine that our recorded tax liability is less than we expect
the ultimate tax assessment to be. If in a later period we determine that payment of this
additional amount is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit in that
later period. As a result, our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the audit issues and
related tax positions require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective tax
rate and materially affect our operating results. This also requires us to estimate our current tax
exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items
for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities,
which we show on our balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets
will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation
allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting
period, we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations.

Our net deferred tax asset at July 31, 2007 was $156.7 million, net of the valuation allowance of
$2.5 million. We recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be
able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets (consisting primarily of certain state net
operating loss carryforwards) before they expire. The valuation allowance is based on our estimates
of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred
tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need
for the valuation allowance, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into
account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the
valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax
provision and net income in the period in which we make the increase.

Total net revenue increased $379.9 million or 17% in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006.
Total net revenue was higher in fiscal 2007 due to our February 2007 acquisition of Digital
Insight, to revenue growth in our Consumer Tax segment and, to a lesser extent, to revenue growth
in our QuickBooks segment and our Payroll and Payments segment. Revenue from our Financial
Institutions segment, which includes Digital Insight, was $150.4 million in fiscal 2007 compared
with $24.4 million in fiscal 2006. Consumer Tax revenue increased $106.8 million or 15% in fiscal
2007 due to 16% growth in federal online units, excluding units donated through the Free File
Alliance, and to price increases. QuickBooks segment revenue increased $59.3 million or 11% in
fiscal 2007 due to unit growth and favorable product mix. Payroll and Payments revenue increased
$54.6 million or 12% in fiscal 2007 due to growth in the QuickBooks Payroll and the Payments customer bases, favorable Payroll product mix and higher
transaction



volume per customer in our Payments business. See

“Total Net Revenue by Business
Segment”

below for more information.

Higher revenue in fiscal 2007 was partially offset by higher expenses, including increases compared
with fiscal 2006 of approximately $87 million for product development expenses, approximately $85
million for advertising and other selling and marketing expenses and approximately $80 million for
cost of revenue associated with our revenue growth. See

“Operating Expenses”

below for more
information.

Net income from continuing operations increased $62.5 million or 16% in fiscal 2007. Interest
expense on the debt we issued in connection with our February 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight
of $27.1 million was partially offset by $13.0 million higher interest income in fiscal 2007
compared with fiscal 2006. Interest income increased in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due
to higher interest rates and higher average invested balances. We recorded a pre-tax net gain of
$31.7 million on the sale of certain outsourced payroll assets in fiscal 2007. Our effective tax
rates for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were approximately 36% and 38%. See

Income Taxes

later in
this Item 7 for more information.

Diluted net income per share from continuing operations increased 18% to $1.25 in fiscal 2007
compared with $1.06 in fiscal 2006. Average shares outstanding declined during fiscal 2007 as a
result of repurchases of 17.1 million shares of common stock under our stock repurchase programs,
partially offset by the issuance of 12.1 million shares in connection with our employee stock
plans.

At July 31, 2007, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.3 billion, an increase of
$106.5 million from July 31, 2006. In fiscal 2007 we generated $726.8 million in cash from our
continuing operations and received approximately $1 billion in cash from the issuance of long-term
debt and $211.4 million in cash from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.
During the same period we used approximately $1.2 billion in cash for the purchase of Digital
Insight (net of cash acquired) and $153.2 million in cash for purchases of property and equipment
and capitalization of internal use software. We also repurchased 17.1 million shares of our common
stock for $506.6 million under our stock repurchase programs during fiscal 2007. At July 31, 2007,
we had authorization from our Board to expend $800 million for future stock repurchases.

Total Net Revenue

The table below and the discussion of net revenue by business segment that follows it are organized
in accordance with our six reportable business segments. See Note 8 to the financial statements in
Item 8 for descriptions of product revenue and service and other revenue for each segment.

In February 2007 we completed the acquisition of Digital Insight, a provider of outsourced online
banking applications and services to banks and credit unions. We combined Digital Insight with our
existing financial institutions group, which had been part of our Other Businesses segment, to
create a new Financial Institutions segment during fiscal 2007. We have reclassified our existing
financial institutions business from our Other Businesses segment to our Financial Institutions
segment for all periods presented. We have also reclassified segment results for all periods
presented to reflect the transfer of our MyCorporation business from our Consumer Tax segment to
our QuickBooks segment. MyCorporation revenue was $7.9 million in fiscal 2007 and $4.4 million in
fiscal 2006. MyCorporation revenue was not significant in fiscal 2005.

Total Net Revenue by Business Segment

QuickBooks

Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006

. QuickBooks segment net revenue increased $59.3 million or
11% in fiscal 2007 compared with 2006. Total QuickBooks software unit sales were 10% higher in
fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due in part to new promotions, including our first-ever
QuickBooks television advertisements. Revenue



growth in fiscal 2007 was also driven by favorable product mix, with QuickBooks Premier units
increasing 25% in fiscal 2007.

Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005

. QuickBooks segment net revenue increased $35.9 million or
7% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Total QuickBooks software unit sales were up 14% in
fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. This higher unit volume more than offset lower average
selling prices for QuickBooks software due to price reductions for new users and the elimination of
upgrade rebates. We believe that the higher unit volume was a result of product improvements,
successful execution of our QuickBooks 2006 product launch and growth in the category that was
driven by publicity surrounding a significant new market entrant.

Payroll and Payments

Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006.

Payroll and Payments net revenue increased $54.6 million or
12% in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. In our Payments business, merchant services revenue
increased 36% in fiscal 2007 due to 22% growth in the customer base and 9% higher transaction
volume per customer. Merchant services revenue slowed in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due
to new customer acquisition remaining relatively constant on a larger customer base. Small business
payroll revenue grew 3% in fiscal 2007 due to 4% growth in the customer base and, to a lesser
extent, to favorable product mix that resulted in higher revenue per customer. We estimate that
revenue growth in our Payroll and Payments segment in fiscal 2007 would have been approximately 16%
if the sale of portions of our Complete Payroll and Premier Payroll Services customer base to ADP
had not occurred.

Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005

. Payroll and Payments net revenue increased $90.3 million or
24% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Our combined payroll offerings accounted for slightly
more than half of the fiscal 2006 revenue increase while our merchant services represented slightly
less than half of the revenue increase. QuickBooks Payroll revenue was 23% higher in fiscal 2006
compared with fiscal 2005 because of a combination of favorable product mix, 7% growth in the
customer base and the residual effects of a price increase that we implemented in fiscal 2005.
Revenue from our other payroll offerings increased 11% in fiscal 2006, driven by 17% growth in the
number of QuickBooks Assisted Payroll and Complete Payroll customers processing payrolls, price
increases and increased interest income on funds held for payroll customers, partially offset by
attrition in the Premier Payroll Service customer base. Merchant services revenue increased 47% in
fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 due to 32% growth in the customer base and 18% higher
transaction volume per customer.

Consumer Tax

Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006.

Consumer Tax net revenue increased $106.8 million or 15% in
2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to 16% growth in federal online units, excluding units donated
through the Free File Alliance, and to price increases. Consumer Tax net revenue for fiscal 2007
included the impact of approximately $9 million in refunds to customers who experienced delays in
electronically preparing or filing their income tax returns on April 17, 2007. We believe that the
continuing trend among individual taxpayers toward the use of software, rather than manual methods,
to prepare their own income tax returns will continue to be important to the growth of our Consumer
Tax business.

Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005.

Consumer Tax net revenue increased $135.4 million or 24% in
fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Paid federal TurboTax unit sales were up 20% in fiscal 2006,
driven by a 57% increase in federal TurboTax Online units sold which accounted for the majority of
the revenue increase for that period. To a lesser extent, higher fiscal 2006 revenue was due to
growth in revenue from attach services such as electronic filing. We believe that fiscal 2006
Consumer Tax revenue growth was positively affected by changes in our offering and pricing
strategies that included eliminating rebates and bundling federal and state consumer tax products.
These changes were designed to simplify our offerings in response to customer feedback.

Professional Tax

Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006.

Professional Tax net revenue increased $18.8 million or 7%
in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to add-on product penetration and price increases.



Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005.

Professional Tax net revenue increased $7.9 million or 3%
in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 due to overall growth in the Professional Tax customer
base that was partially offset by a shift in product mix toward our lower priced offerings.

Financial Institutions

Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006.

Financial Institutions net revenue increased $126.0 million
to $150.4 million in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due almost entirely to our February 2007
acquisition of Digital Insight.

Other Businesses

Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006.

Other Businesses net revenue increased $14.4 million or 5%
in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. Quicken revenue was flat while revenue from our business
in Canada increased 11% and revenue from our Intuit Real Estate Solutions business grew 28%.

Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005.

Other Businesses total net revenue increased $25.1 million
or 10% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Quicken revenue was slightly lower in fiscal 2006.
Canadian revenue increased 23% in fiscal 2006 due to strong growth in sales of QuickBooks products
and to a lesser extent to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Our cost of revenue has three components: (1) cost of product revenue, which includes the
direct costs of manufacturing and shipping our software products; (2) cost of service and other
revenue, which reflects direct costs associated with providing services, including data center
costs related to delivering Internet-based services, and costs associated with revenue sharing and
online transactions revenue; (3) amortization of purchased intangible assets, which represents the
cost of amortizing over their useful lives developed technologies that we obtained through
acquisitions.

Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006.

Cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of
service and other revenue increased slightly to 25% in fiscal 2007 from 24% in fiscal 2006. The
impact of growth in TurboTax Online and electronic tax filing services, which have relatively lower
costs of revenue, was offset by the impact of our acquisition of Digital Insight, which has
relatively higher costs of revenue. Amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in fiscal
2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to the amortization of Digital Insight purchased intangible
assets that we acquired in February 2007.

Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005.

Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue
decreased to 12% in fiscal 2006 compared with 13% in fiscal 2005. Growth in TurboTax units came
disproportionately through our Web TurboTax offer, which had lower costs per unit than our desktop
offerings. This was partially offset by higher cost of product revenue in our QuickBooks segment,
which resulted from 14% QuickBooks unit growth. Cost of service and other revenue as a percentage
of service and other revenue decreased to 24% in fiscal 2006 from 26% in fiscal 2005. Growth in our
Consumer Tax electronic filing revenue, Assisted Payroll revenue and merchant



services revenue, all of which had lower relative cost increases associated with their related
revenue increases, was mostly offset by higher costs in our QuickBooks segment, which resulted from
improvements in service levels for technical support plan customers.

Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006.

Individually and in the aggregate, operating expenses
as a percentage of total net revenue were generally consistent in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal
2006. Total operating expenses in dollars increased $205.9 million in fiscal 2007, approximately
$60 million of which was due to our February 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight.

Including Digital Insight, approximately 42% of the fiscal 2007 increase in total operating
expenses was due to higher research and development expenses. During fiscal 2007 we continued to
invest in research and development for existing offerings as well as for new offerings.
Approximately 41% of the fiscal 2007 increase in total operating expenses was due to higher selling
and marketing expenses that included increases in radio, television and online advertising expenses
for our Consumer Tax and QuickBooks offerings as well as additional investments in direct marketing
and product management. Acquisition-related charges increased in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal
2006 due to the amortization of Digital Insight purchased intangible assets that we acquired in
February 2007.

Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005.

Individually and in the aggregate, operating expenses as a
percentage of total net revenue were generally consistent in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005.
Total operating expenses in dollars increased $215.4 million in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal
2005. Share-based compensation expense for stock options and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan that
we recorded as a result of our adoption of SFAS 123(R) on August 1, 2005 accounted for
approximately $63 million of that increase. In fiscal 2006 total operating expenses also increased
by approximately $75 million for new product development and approximately $60 million for
additional advertising and other marketing programs and improved customer support service levels,
particularly in our QuickBooks and Consumer Tax segments. Excluding the impact of share-based
compensation expense, sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue declined due to lower
direct selling costs associated with our fiscal 2006 focus on the retail channel.

Segment Operating Income (Loss)

Segment operating income or loss is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating
expenses. Segment expenses do not include certain costs, such as corporate general and
administrative expenses and share-based compensation expenses, which are not allocated to specific
segments. These unallocated costs totaled $506.2 million in fiscal 2007, $465.2 million in fiscal
2006 and $383.0 million in fiscal 2005. Share-based compensation expenses for stock options and our
Employee Stock Purchase Plan that we began recording in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 accounted
for $65.0 million of the increase in unallocated costs for fiscal 2006. See Note 1 and Note 12 to
the financial statements in Item 8. Segment expenses also do not include amortization of purchased
intangible



assets, acquisition-related charges, and impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets. In
addition, segment expenses do not include interest expense, interest and other income, and realized
net gains or losses on marketable equity securities and other investments. See Note 8 to the
financial statements in Item 8 for reconciliations of total segment operating income to income from
continuing operations for each fiscal year presented.

QuickBooks

Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006.

QuickBooks segment operating income as a percentage of
related revenue was approximately the same in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. The $59.3 million growth
in QuickBooks segment revenue in fiscal 2007 was partially offset by higher expenses, including
increases of approximately $11 million for cost of revenue, approximately $16 million for selling
and marketing expenses (which consisted primarily of higher radio and television advertising
expenses and additional investments in direct marketing and product management) and approximately
$18 million for product development expenses in fiscal 2007.

Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005.

QuickBooks segment operating income as a percentage of
related revenue decreased to 31% in fiscal 2006 from 40% in fiscal 2005. Higher fiscal 2006
QuickBooks revenue resulted from higher unit volume that more than offset the impact of lower
average selling prices. However, lower average selling prices yielded lower profit per unit. Higher
unit volume in fiscal 2006 also resulted in higher customer support costs. We also spent more on
QuickBooks product development and on improvements to technical support service levels in fiscal
2006 compared with fiscal 2005.

Payroll and Payments

Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006.

Payroll and Payments segment operating income as a
percentage of related revenue increased to 42% in fiscal 2007 from 39% in fiscal 2006. Most of the
fiscal 2007 revenue growth in this segment came from products and services with relatively lower
costs of revenue, such as QuickBooks Payroll, Assisted Payroll and merchant services. The $54.6
million higher Payroll and Payments revenue in fiscal 2007 was partially offset by higher expenses,
including increases of approximately $7 million for product development expenses, approximately $5
million for selling and marketing expenses and approximately $6 million for general and
administrative expenses in fiscal 2007.

Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005.

Payroll and Payments segment operating income as a
percentage of related revenue increased to 39% in fiscal 2006 from 36% in fiscal 2005. More of the
fiscal 2006 revenue growth in this segment came from products and services with relatively lower
costs of revenue, such as QuickBooks Payroll and merchant services.

Consumer Tax

Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006.

Consumer Tax segment operating income as a percentage of
related revenue decreased to 63% in fiscal 2007 from 66% in fiscal 2006. The $106.8 million growth
in Consumer Tax revenue in fiscal 2007 was partially offset by higher expenses, including increases
of approximately $45 million for selling and marketing expenses (including higher radio, television
and online advertising expenses as well as higher direct marketing expenses) and approximately $18
million for product development expenses in fiscal 2007.



Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005.

Consumer Tax segment operating income as a percentage of
related revenue was approximately the same in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. Higher revenue and lower
rebate processing fees were partially offset by higher expenses for television and Web advertising
and to a lesser extent for product development and customer support in fiscal 2006.

Professional Tax

Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006.

Professional Tax segment operating income as a percentage
of related revenue increased to 52% in fiscal 2007 from 50% in fiscal 2006. Professional Tax
revenue increased $18.8 million while expenses were relatively stable in fiscal 2007 compared with
fiscal 2006.

Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005.

Professional Tax segment operating income as a percentage
of related revenue was the same in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. Revenue and operating expenses were
similar in the two periods.

Financial Institutions

Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006.

Financial Institutions segment operating income as a
percentage of related revenue decreased to 26% in fiscal 2007 from 50% in fiscal 2006. The change
in segment operating income structure is due to our February 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight,
which we combined with our existing financial institutions business to create a new Financial
Institutions segment. This new segment is significantly larger and has higher costs than the Intuit
financial institutions business that preceded it.

Other Businesses

Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006.

Other Businesses segment operating income as a percentage
of related revenue increased to 33% in fiscal 2007 from 29% in fiscal 2006. The fiscal 2007
improvement in segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was due to the May 2006
sale of our MasterBuilder business, which had relatively low operating margins.

Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005.

Other Businesses segment operating income as a percentage of
related revenue was nearly the same in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. Quicken revenue was slightly
lower while expenses to develop and market new offerings increased in fiscal 2006. Higher revenue
combined with relatively stable spending produced better operating margins in Canada.

Non-Operating Income and Expenses

Interest Expense

In order to finance a portion of our acquisition of Digital Insight, on February 6, 2007 we
borrowed $1 billion under a bridge credit facility, which we retired on March 12, 2007 with the
proceeds of our issuance of $1 billion in senior notes. Interest expense for fiscal 2007 included
interest on the $1 billion bridge credit facility at 5.77% while it was outstanding, interest on
$500 million in principal amount of the senior notes at 5.40% and interest on $500 million in
principal amount of the senior notes at 5.75%. The senior notes are due in March 2012 and March
2017 and are redeemable by Intuit at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. We are amortizing a
total of $7.3 million in debt issuance costs to interest expense over the terms of the related
senior notes.

license and distribution agreements that we entered into when we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage
business in July 2002.

Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate was approximately 36% for fiscal 2007, approximately 38% for fiscal 2006 and
approximately 33% for fiscal 2005. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 differed from the federal
statutory rate of 35% due to state income taxes, which were partially offset by the benefit we
received from tax exempt interest income, federal and state research and experimental credits and
the domestic production activities deduction. In addition, in fiscal 2007 we benefited from the
retroactive extension of the federal research and experimental credit as it related to fiscal 2006.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% due to state
income taxes and the taxable gain on the sale of our Master Builder business, which were partially
offset by the benefit we received from tax exempt interest income, federal and state research and
experimental credits and the domestic production activities deduction. Our effective tax rate for
fiscal 2005 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% due to the net effect of the reversal
of $25.7 million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved, the
federal research and experimental credit and to the benefit received from tax-exempt interest
income offset by state taxes. See Note 11 to the financial statements in Item 8.

In December 2006 the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 was signed into law. The Act includes a
reinstatement of the federal research and experimental credit retroactive to January 1, 2006. We
recorded a discrete tax benefit of $3.7 million for the retroactive amount related to fiscal 2006
during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The credit as reinstated has an expiration date of
December 31, 2007.

We acquired Digital Insight on February 6, 2007. See Note 6 to the financial statements in Item 8.
Digital Insight had approximately $76 million in federal net operating loss carryforwards at the
date of acquisition. We have recorded the tax effects of these carryforwards and other federal tax
credit carryforwards, which together totaled $34.4 million, as deferred tax assets at the date of
acquisition. The carryforwards will not result in an income tax provision benefit, but they will
reduce income taxes payable and cash paid for income taxes as they are utilized. At July 31, 2007,
we had total federal net operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credit carryforwards of $25.3
million and $4.9 million.

At July 31, 2007, we had net deferred tax assets of $156.7 million which included a valuation
allowance of $2.5 million for certain state net operating loss carryforwards. The allowance
reflects management’s assessment that we may not receive the benefit of loss carryforwards in
certain state jurisdictions. While we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient, it may
be necessary to increase this amount if it becomes more likely that we will not realize a greater
portion of the net deferred tax assets. We assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation
allowance on a quarterly basis. See Note 11 to the financial statements in Item 8.



Dispositions and Discontinued Operations

During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 we sold the assets and businesses described below. See Note 7 to
the financial statements in Item 8 for a more complete description of these dispositions and
discontinued operations and for a summary of the impact that discontinued operations have had on
our statements of operations for those fiscal years.

Intuit Distribution Management Solutions Discontinued Operations

In July 2007 we signed a definitive agreement to sell our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions
(IDMS) business. The sale was completed in August 2007 for approximately $100 million in cash. IDMS
was part of our Other Businesses segment. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets,”

we determined that IDMS became a
discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. We have therefore segregated the
operating results of IDMS from continuing operations in our statements of operations for all
periods presented. We expect to record a gain on the sale of IDMS in the first quarter of fiscal
2008.

Sale of Outsourced Payroll Assets

In March 2007 we sold certain assets related to our Complete Payroll and Premier Payroll Service
businesses to ADP for a price of up to approximately $135 million in cash. The final purchase price
is contingent upon the number of customers that transition to ADP. Due to actual customer attrition
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we currently estimate the maximum sales price to be
approximately $120 million. The assets were part of our Payroll and Payments segment. In accordance
with the provisions of SFAS 144, we have not accounted for this transaction as a discontinued
operation. We will recognize the net gain on the sale of the assets as customers are transitioned
pursuant to the agreement over a period not to exceed one year from the date of the sale. In fiscal
2007 we recorded a pre-tax net gain of $31.7 million in our statement of operations for customers
who transitioned to ADP during that period.

Sale of Master Builder Business

In May 2006 we sold our Master Builder construction management software and solutions business,
which was part of Intuit Construction Business Solutions (ICBS) in our Other Businesses segment. The Master Builder business had quarterly revenue
of approximately $5 million. We recorded a $7.7 million net loss on disposal of the business,
including income tax expense of $10.1 million, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. In accordance
with the provisions of SFAS 144, we have not accounted for this transaction as a discontinued
operation.

Intuit Information Technology Solutions Discontinued Operations

In December 2005 we sold our Intuit Information Technology Solutions (ITS) business for
approximately $200 million in cash. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, we have
segregated the operating results of ITS from continuing operations in our statements of operations
for all periods prior to the sale. We recorded a $34.3 million net gain on disposal of ITS which is
included in net income from discontinued operations in our fiscal 2006 statement of operations.

Intuit Public Sector Solutions Discontinued Operations

In December 2004 we sold our Intuit Public Sector Solutions (IPSS) business for approximately $11
million in cash and accounted for the sale as a discontinued operation. In accordance with SFAS
144, we have segregated the operating results of IPSS from continuing operations in our statements
of operations for all periods prior to the sale. In fiscal 2005 we recorded a $4.8 million net loss
on disposal of IPSS that included an income tax provision of $4.3 million for the estimated tax
payable in connection with the expected tax gain on the transaction. These amounts are included in
net income from discontinued operations in our fiscal 2005 statement of operations.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Statements of Cash Flows

At July 31, 2007 our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.3 billion, an increase of
$106.5 million from July 31, 2006. We generated $726.8 million in cash from our continuing
operations during fiscal 2007. We used $1.4 billion in cash for investing activities during that
period, including approximately $1.2 billion for our purchase of Digital Insight (net of cash
acquired) and $153.2 million for purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal
use software. We generated $733.9 million in cash from financing activities during fiscal 2007,
including approximately $1 billion from the issuance of long-term debt and $211.4 million from the
issuance of common stock under employee stock plans partially offset by $506.6 million for the
repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs. See Item 5,

“Purchases of Equity
Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers,” “Stock Repurchase Programs”

below and Note 12
to the financial statements in Item 8.

Our expenditures for property and equipment increased from $44.5 million in fiscal 2006 to $104.9
million in fiscal 2007 primarily due to the construction of our new San Diego facility. We expect
our expenditures for property and equipment and capitalized internal use software to increase from
a total of $153.2 million in fiscal 2007 to approximately $300 million in fiscal 2008. This planned
increase in capital expenditures is related to investments in infrastructure, offices and data
centers to support the expected growth in our business.

The following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal 2007,
fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. See the financial statements in Item 8 for complete statements of cash
flows for those periods.

We generated cash from our operating activities during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, primarily
from net income from continuing operations in each of those years. We used cash for investing
activities during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, including acquisitions of businesses, purchases of
property and equipment and capitalization of internal use software. We generated cash from
financing activities in fiscal 2007 primarily from the issuance of long-term debt in connection
with our acquisition of Digital Insight and from the issuance of common stock under employee stock
plans, partially offset by the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs. We
used cash for financing activities in fiscal 2006 and 2005 primarily for the repurchase of common
stock under our stock



repurchase programs, partially offset by proceeds that we received from the issuance of common
stock under employee stock plans in each of these fiscal years.

Stock Split

On July 6, 2006 we implemented a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend. All
share and per share figures in this Item 7 and in the statements of operations and notes to the
financial statements in Item 8 retroactively reflect this stock split.

Stock Repurchase Programs

Our Board of Directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of
common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. During fiscal 2007 we
repurchased 17.1 million shares of our common stock for $506.6 million under our repurchase
programs. From the inception of these programs in May 2001 through the end of fiscal 2007, we
repurchased 158.7 million shares of our common stock for $3.8 billion. At July 31, 2007, we had
authorization from our Board to expend $800 million for future stock repurchases.

Digital Insight Acquisition

On February 6, 2007 we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Digital Insight for a total
purchase price of approximately $1.34 billion including the value of vested options assumed. See
Note 6 to the financial statements in Item 8. We borrowed $1 billion under a one-year unsecured
bridge credit facility with two institutional lenders in order to pay a portion of the purchase
price of Digital Insight. This bridge facility accrued interest at a rate of 5.77%. On March 12,
2007 we retired this bridge credit facility with the proceeds of our issuance of $1 billion in
long-term senior unsecured notes. We issued $500 million of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due on
March 15, 2012 (the 2012 Notes) and $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15,
2017 (the 2017 Notes). The 2012 Notes and the 2017 Notes are redeemable by Intuit at any time,
subject to a make-whole premium. The 2012 Notes and the 2017 Notes include covenants that limit our
ability to grant liens on our facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject
to significant allowances.

Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility

On March 22, 2007 we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for a $500
million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on March 22, 2012. Advances under the
credit facility will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Citibank’s
base rate or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.18% to
0.575% based on our senior debt credit ratings. The applicable interest rate will be increased by
0.05% for any period in which the total principal amount of advances and letters of credit under
the credit facility exceeds $250 million. The agreement includes covenants that require us to
maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 and a ratio of annual EBITDA to interest
payable of not less than 3.00 to 1.00. We may use amounts borrowed under this credit facility for
general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business. To date we have
not borrowed under the credit facility, but we may borrow under the credit facility from time to
time as opportunities and needs arise. See Note 9 to the financial statements in Item 8.

Loans to Officers

Outstanding loans to officers totaled $8.9 million at July 31, 2007 and July 31, 2006. Loans to
officers at July 31, 2007 were relocation loans secured by real property with original terms of 10
years. Of the total loans at July 31, 2007, $4.4 million accrue no interest for the term of the
note. The remaining loans at that date accrue interest at rates equal to applicable federal rates
in effect at the time the loans were made. At July 31, 2007 no loans were in default and all
interest payments were current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreements. All of the
loans were approved by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, which consists solely
of independent directors. Consistent with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, no
loans to officers have been made or modified since July 30, 2002 and we do not intend to make or
modify loans to officers in the future. See Note 16 to the financial statements in Item 8.



Other

We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing
strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. We may decide to use cash and cash
equivalents, investments, and the revolving line of credit facility described above to fund such
activities in the future.

Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents,
investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal
working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments and
other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

At July 31, 2007, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in
Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.

Innovative Merchant Solutions Loan and Buyout Commitments

In April 2005 our wholly owned subsidiary, Innovative Merchant Solutions (IMS), became a member of
Superior Bankcard Services, LLC (SBS), a newly formed entity that acquires merchant accounts for
IMS. Our consolidated financial statements include the financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of SBS, after elimination of all significant intercompany balances and transactions,
including amounts outstanding under the credit agreement described below. See Note 1 to the
financial statements in Item 8. In connection with the formation of this entity IMS agreed to
provide to SBS revolving loans in an amount of up to $24.5 million under the terms of a credit
agreement. In June 2006 IMS entered into an amendment to the credit agreement to increase the
amount of funds IMS may loan under that agreement to $40.0 million. The credit agreement expires in
July 2013, although certain events, such as a sale of SBS, can trigger earlier termination. Amounts
outstanding under the agreement at July 31, 2007 totaled $11.2 million at an interest rate of
9.25%. There are no scheduled repayments on the outstanding loan



balance. All unpaid principal amounts and the related accrued interest are due and payable in full
at the loan expiration date.

The operating agreement of SBS requires that, no later than July 2009, either IMS agree to purchase
the minority members’ interests in SBS at a price to be set by negotiation or arbitration, or IMS
and the minority members pursue a sale of their interests in SBS to a third party.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

FIN 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”

In June 2006 the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. (FIN) 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes.”

FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109, “

Accounting for Income Taxes.”

FIN
48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It
also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2006, which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning August 1,
2007. We are in the process of evaluating this guidance and therefore have not yet determined the
impact that the adoption of FIN 48 will have on our financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

SFAS 157,

“Fair Value Measurements”

In September 2006 the FASB issued SFAS 157,

“Fair Value Measurements.”

SFAS 157 provides enhanced
guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The standard also responds to
investors’ requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and
liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value
measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or
liabilities to be measured at fair value. This standard does not expand the use of fair value in
any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007,
which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2008. We are in the
process of evaluating this standard and therefore have not yet determined the impact that the
adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

SFAS 159,

“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”

In February 2007 the FASB issued SFAS 159,

“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities.”

SFAS 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial
assets and liabilities at fair value. The standard’s objective is to reduce both complexity in
accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related
assets and liabilities differently. The standard requires companies to provide additional
information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily
understand the effect of the company’s choice to use fair value on its earnings. It also requires
companies to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has
chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet. The new standard does not eliminate
disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards, including requirements for
disclosures about fair value measurements included in SFAS 157,

“Fair Value Measurements,”

and SFAS
107,

“Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments.”

SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2007, which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year
beginning August 1, 2008. We are in the process of evaluating this standard and therefore have not
yet determined the impact that the adoption of SFAS 159 will have on our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.



ITEM 7A

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Investment Portfolio

We do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments and funds held for
payroll customers. Our investments and funds held for payroll customers consist of instruments that
meet quality standards consistent with our investment policy. This policy specifies that, except
for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United
States government, and money market or cash management funds, we diversify our holdings by limiting
our investments and funds held for payroll customers with any individual issuer.

The following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments as of July 31, 2007
by stated maturity. The table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security
and includes cash equivalents and investments that are part of funds held for payroll customers on
our balance sheet. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds. Approximately 94% of
our available-for-sale debt securities have an interest reset date, put date or mandatory call date
within one year. At July 31, 2007, the weighted average interest rate earned on our money market
accounts was 5.52% and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments
was 6.20%.

Interest Rate Risk

Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of investments and funds held for payroll customers are
subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate movements affect the
interest income we earn on cash equivalents, investments and funds held for payroll customers and
the value of those investments. Should the Federal Reserve Target Rate increase by 10% or about 53
basis points from the level of July 31, 2007, the value of our investments and funds held for
payroll customers would decline by approximately $1.0 million. Should interest rates increase by
100 basis points from the level of July 31, 2007, the value of our investments and funds held for
payroll customers would decline by approximately $1.9 million.

We are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our $500 million
revolving credit facility. Advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are
equal to Citibank’s base rate or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that
ranges from 0.18% to 0.575% based on our senior debt credit ratings. Consequently, our interest
expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to
borrow any amounts under the credit facility. At July 31, 2007, no amounts were outstanding under
the credit facility.

In connection with our acquisition of Digital Insight, on March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of
5.40% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2012 and $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes
due on March 15, 2017. Since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates, they are not subject
to market risk due to changes in interest rates.

Impact of Foreign Currency Rate Changes

The functional currency of our international operating subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets
and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate on the balance
sheet date. Revenue, costs and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange in effect
during the period. We report translation gains and losses as a



separate component of stockholders’ equity. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign
exchange transactions in our statements of operations.

Since we translate foreign currencies (primarily Canadian dollars, British pounds and Indian
rupees) into U.S dollars for financial reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can have an impact
on our financial results. The historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been
immaterial. We believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant
primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations
almost exclusively in their local currencies. Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our
financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons
cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future, there can be no guarantee
that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future. As of July 31, 2007 we
did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP,

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intuit Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intuit Inc. as of July 31, 2007 and
2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2007. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of Intuit’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Intuit Inc. at July 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended July 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set
forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of Intuit Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting
as of July 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
September 12, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

As discussed in Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, under the heading
Share-Based Compensation Plans, in fiscal 2006 Intuit Inc. changed its method of accounting for
stock-based compensation.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP,

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intuit Inc.

We have audited Intuit Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2007, based
on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Intuit Inc.’s management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Intuit Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of July 31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the fiscal 2007 consolidated financial statements of Intuit Inc. and our
report dated September 12, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

INTUIT INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

Intuit Inc. provides business and financial management solutions for small and medium sized
businesses, financial institutions, consumers, and accounting professionals. Our flagship software
products and services, including QuickBooks, Quicken and TurboTax software, simplify small business
management and payroll processing, personal finance, and tax preparation and filing. Lacerte and
ProSeries are Intuit’s tax preparation software suites for professional accountants. Our financial
institutions division, anchored by Digital Insight Corporation, provides on-demand banking services
to help banks and credit unions serve businesses and consumers. Founded in 1983 and headquartered
in Mountain View, California, we sell our products and services primarily in the United States.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Intuit and its wholly
owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated all significant intercompany balances and transactions in
consolidation. We have reclassified certain amounts previously reported in our financial statements
to conform to the current presentation, including amounts related to discontinued operations and
reportable segments.

The consolidated financial statements also include the financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of Superior Bankcard Services, LLC (SBS), an entity formed in April 2005 that
acquires merchant accounts for our Innovative Merchant Solutions (IMS) business. IMS provides
merchant services to small businesses that include credit card, debit card and other payment
processing services. At July 31, 2007 and July 31, 2006, SBS had total assets of $14.8 million and
$14.3 million. SBS had total revenue of $13.5 million and $7.1 million for the twelve months ended
July 31, 2007 and 2006. We are allocated 51% of the earnings and losses of this entity and 100% of
the losses in excess of the minority interest capital balances. We therefore eliminate the portion
of the SBS financial results that pertain to the minority interests on a separate line in our
statements of operations and balance sheets. The operating agreement of SBS requires that, no later
than July 2009, either IMS agree to purchase the minority members’ interests in SBS at a price to
be set by negotiation or arbitration, or IMS and the minority members pursue a sale of their
interests in SBS to a third party.

On July 6, 2006 we implemented a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend. All
share and per share figures in the statements of operations and the notes to the financial
statements retroactively reflect this stock split.

As discussed in Note 6, in February 2007 we acquired Digital Insight Corporation for a purchase
price of approximately $1.34 billion. We have included Digital Insight’s results of operations in
our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.

As discussed in Note 7, in July 2007 we signed a definitive agreement to sell our Intuit
Distribution Management Solutions (IDMS) business. The sale was completed in August 2007. In
December 2005 we sold our Intuit Information Technology Solutions (ITS) business and in December
2004 we sold our Intuit Public Sector Solutions (IPSS) business. Accordingly, we have reclassified
our financial statements for all periods prior to the sales to reflect IDMS, ITS and IPSS as
discontinued operations. Unless noted otherwise, discussions in these notes pertain to our
continuing operations.

As discussed later in this Note 1, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment,”

on August 1, 2005 using the modified prospective transition
method. Because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method, results for prior
periods have not been restated. See Note 12 for information on the impact of our adoption of this
standard on our statements of operations.



Seasonality

Our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Professional Tax businesses are highly seasonal. Some of our other
offerings are also seasonal, but to a lesser extent. Revenue from many of our small business
software products, including QuickBooks, tends to be at its peak around calendar year end, although
the timing of new product releases or changes in our offerings can materially shift revenue between
quarters. Sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the
period from November through April. These seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is
usually highest during our second quarter ending January 31 and third quarter ending April 30. We
typically report losses in our first quarter ending October 31 and fourth quarter ending July 31,
when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively
consistent levels.

Use of Estimates

We make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
the disclosures made in the accompanying notes. For example, we use estimates in determining the
appropriate levels of reserves for product returns and rebates, the collectibility of accounts
receivable, the appropriate levels of various accruals, the amount of our worldwide tax provision
and the realizability of deferred tax assets. We also use estimates in determining the remaining
economic lives and carrying values of purchased intangible assets (including goodwill), property
and equipment and other long-lived assets. In addition, we use assumptions to estimate the fair
value of share-based compensation. Despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and use
reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ from our estimates.

Net Revenue

We derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products, license fees, software
subscriptions, product support, professional services, payroll services, merchant services,
transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items.
We recognize revenue for software products and related services in accordance with the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, “

Software Revenue
Recognition

,” as modified by SOP 98-9. For other offerings, we follow Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
104,

“Revenue Recognition

.” We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and
collectibility is probable.

In some situations, we receive advance payments from our customers. We defer revenue associated
with these advance payments and the relative fair value of undelivered elements under multiple
element arrangements until we ship the products or perform the services. Deferred revenue consisted
of the following at the dates indicated:

$

In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (FASB’s) Emerging Issues Task
Force Issue No. 01-9, “

Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller
of the Vendor’s Product

,” we account for cash consideration (such as sales incentives) that we give
to our customers or resellers as a reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless
we receive a benefit that we can identify and for which we can reasonably estimate the fair value.



Product Revenue

We recognize revenue from the sale of our packaged software products and supplies when legal title
transfers, which is generally when our customers download products from the Web, when we ship the
products or, in the case of certain agreements, when products are delivered to retailers. We sell
some of our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Quicken products on consignment to certain retailers. We
recognize revenue for these consignment transactions only when the end-user sale has occurred. For
products that are sold on a subscription basis and include periodic updates, we recognize revenue
ratably over the contractual time period. We record revenue net of our sales tax obligations.

We recognize product revenue in accordance with SFAS 48,

“Revenue Recognition When Right of Return
Exists.”

We reduce product revenue from distributors and retailers for estimated returns that are
based on historical returns experience and other factors, such as the volume and price mix of
products in the retail channel, return rates for prior releases of the product, trends in retailer
inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products (including the
competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our product). We also reduce product
revenue for the estimated redemption of rebates on certain current product sales. Our estimated
reserves for distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and
retailers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs, which we
typically establish annually. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms
and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program, actual sales during the promotion and
historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program.

Service Revenue

We recognize revenue from payroll processing and payroll tax filing services as the services are
performed, provided we have no other remaining obligations to these customers. We generally require
customers to remit payroll tax funds to us in advance of the applicable payroll due date via
electronic funds transfer. We include in total net revenue the interest earned on invested balances
resulting from timing differences between when we collect these funds from customers and when we
remit the funds to outside parties.

We offer several technical support plans and recognize support revenue over the life of the plans.
Service revenue also includes Web services such as TurboTax Online and electronic tax filing
services in both our Consumer Tax and Professional Tax segments. Service revenue for electronic
payment processing services that we provide to merchants is recorded net of interchange fees
charged by credit card associations because we do not control these fees. Finally, service revenue
includes revenue from consulting and training services, primarily in our Intuit-Branded Small
Business segment. We generally recognize revenue as these services are performed, provided that we
have no other remaining obligations to these customers and that the services performed are not
essential to the functionality of delivered products and services.

We recognize revenue from our outsourced online banking applications and services for financial
institutions, for which we host our customers’ Internet banking and business banking applications,
in two ways. Revenue earned for upfront fees for implementation services is recognized ratably over
the greater of the initial life of the customer contract or the estimated life of the customer
service relationship, which is approximately seven years. Revenue and amounts billed for recurring
monthly services are earned as services are performed.

Other Revenue

Other revenue consists primarily of revenue from revenue-sharing arrangements with third-party
service providers. We recognize transaction fees from revenue-sharing arrangements as end-user
sales are reported to us by these partners.

Multiple Element Arrangements

We enter into certain revenue arrangements for which we are obligated to deliver multiple products
and/or services (multiple elements). For these arrangements, which generally include software
products, we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered elements based on their vendor-specific
objective evidence of fair value (VSOE). VSOE is the price charged when that element is sold
separately.

In situations where VSOE exists for all elements (delivered and undelivered), we allocate the total
revenue to be earned under the arrangement among the various elements, based on their relative fair
value. For transactions where VSOE exists only for the undelivered elements, we defer the full fair
value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee
and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as



revenue. If VSOE does not exist for an undelivered service element, we recognize the revenue from
the arrangement as the services are delivered. If VSOE does not exist for undelivered elements that
are specified products or features, we defer revenue until the earlier of the delivery of all
elements or the point at which we determine VSOE for these undelivered elements.

We recognize revenue related to the delivered products or services only if: (1) the above revenue
recognition criteria are met; (2) any undelivered products or services are not essential to the
functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) payment for the delivered products or
services is not contingent upon delivery of the remaining products or services; and (4) we have an
enforceable claim to receive the amount due in the event that we do not deliver the undelivered
products or services.

For arrangements where undelivered services are essential to the functionality of delivered
software, we recognize both the product license revenues and service revenues under the percentage
of completion contract method in accordance with the provisions of SOP 81-1, “

Accounting for
Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts

.” To date, product license
and service revenues recognized pursuant to SOP 81-1 have not been significant.

Shipping and Handling

We record the amounts we charge our customers for the shipping and handling of our software
products as product revenue and we record the related costs as cost of product revenue in our
statements of operations. Product revenue from shipping and handling is not significant.

Customer Service and Technical Support

We include the costs of providing customer service under paid technical support contracts on the
cost of service revenue line in our statements of operations. We include customer service and free
technical support costs on the sales and marketing expense line on our statements of operations.
Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order
processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through Web sites, e-mail and other
electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance to customers. In connection with
the sale of certain products, we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to
customers. We do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products,
since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant. The technical support is
generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product
enhancements are minimal and infrequent. We accrue the estimated cost of providing this free
support upon product shipment.

Software Development Costs

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 86, “

Accounting for Costs of Computer Software
to be Sold, Leased, or otherwise Marketed

,” requires companies to expense software development
costs as they incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those
costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. To date, our
software has been available for general release concurrent with the establishment of technological
feasibility and, accordingly, we have not capitalized any development costs. SFAS 2, “

Accounting
for Research and Development Costs

,” establishes accounting and reporting standards for research
and development. In accordance with SFAS 2, costs we incur to enhance our existing products or
after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are
incurred and included in research and development costs in our statements of operations.

Internal Use Software

We capitalize costs related to computer software developed or obtained for internal use in
accordance with SOP 98-1, “

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use

.” Software obtained for internal use has generally been enterprise-level business and
finance software that we customize to meet our specific operational needs. Costs incurred in the
application development phase are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives, generally
three to five years. We have not sold, leased or licensed software developed for internal use to
our customers and we have no intention of doing so in the future.



Advertising

We expense advertising costs as we incur them. We recorded advertising expense of approximately
$94.9 million in fiscal 2007, $64.5 million in fiscal 2006 and $44.5 million in fiscal 2005.

Leases

We review all leases for capital or operating classification at their inception under the guidance
of SFAS 13,

“Accounting for Leases,”

as amended. We use our incremental borrowing rate in the
assessment of lease classification and define the initial lease term to include the construction
build-out period but to exclude lease extension periods. We conduct our operations primarily under
operating leases. For leases that contain rent escalations, we record the total rent payable during
the lease term, as defined above, on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. We record
the difference between the rents paid and the straight-line rent in a deferred rent account in
other current liabilities or long-term obligations, as appropriate, on our balance sheets.

In accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin (FTB) No. 88-1,

“Issues Relating to Accounting for
Leases,”

we record landlord allowances as deferred rent liabilities in other current liabilities or
long-term obligations, as appropriate, on our balance sheets. We record landlord cash incentives as
operating activity on our statements of cash flows. We record other landlord allowances as non-cash
investing and financing activities on our statements of cash flows. Also in accordance with FTB
88-1, we classify the amortization of landlord allowances as a reduction of occupancy expense on
our statements of operations.

Capitalization of Interest Expense

In accordance with SFAS 34,

“Capitalization of Interest Cost

,” we capitalize interest on capital
projects, including facilities build-out projects and internal use computer software projects.
Capitalization commences with the first expenditure for the project and continues until the project
is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We amortize capitalized interest to
depreciation expense using the straight-line method over the same lives as the related assets.
Capitalized interest was not significant in fiscal 2007, 2006 or 2005.

Foreign Currency

The functional currency of all our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets and
liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet
date. Revenue, costs and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange in effect during the
year. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance
sheet. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in our
statements of operations.

Income Taxes

When we prepare our financial statements, we estimate our income taxes based on the various
jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our
worldwide income tax provision. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the
United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to
which, additional taxes will be due. We record an additional amount in our provision for income
taxes in the period in which we determine that our recorded tax liability is less than we expect
the ultimate tax assessment to be. If in a later period we determine that payment of this
additional amount is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit in that
later period. As a result, our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the audit issues and
related tax positions require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective tax
rate and materially affect our operating results. This also requires us to estimate our current tax
exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items
for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities,
which we show on our balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets
will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation
allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting
period, we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations.

We record a valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize
some of our deferred tax assets (consisting primarily of certain state net
operating loss carryforwards) before



they expire. The valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the
jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be
realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation
allowance, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional
deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the valuation allowance would
have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax provision and net income in the
period in which we make the increase.

Per Share Computations

We compute basic net income or loss per share using the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. We compute diluted net income per share using the weighted average
number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.
Dilutive potential common shares consist of the shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options
and upon the vesting of restricted stock units (RSUs) under the treasury stock method. In loss
periods, basic net loss per share and diluted net loss per share are identical since the effect of
potential common shares is anti-dilutive and therefore excluded.

We adopted SFAS 123(R) on August 1, 2005. See “

Share-Based Compensation Plans”

later in this Note
1. In accordance with that standard, for the twelve months ended July 31, 2007 and 2006 we included
stock options with combined exercise prices and unrecognized compensation expense that were less
than the average market price for our common stock, and RSUs with unrecognized compensation expense
that was less than the average market price for our common stock, in the calculation of diluted net
income per share. We excluded stock options with combined exercise prices and unrecognized
compensation expense that were greater than the average market price for our common stock, and RSUs
with unrecognized compensation expense that was greater than the average market price for our
common stock, from the calculation of diluted net income per share because their effect was
anti-dilutive. Under the treasury stock method, the amount that must be paid to exercise stock
options, the amount of compensation expense for future service that we have not yet recognized for
stock options and RSUs, and the amount of tax benefits that will be recorded in additional paid-in
capital when the awards become deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.

In accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees,”

for the twelve months ended July 31, 2005 we excluded stock options with exercise
prices that were greater than the average market price for our common stock from the calculation of
diluted net income per share because their effect was anti-dilutive.

net income per share for the periods indicated.

Cash Equivalents and Investments

We consider highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of
purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds in all
periods presented. Investments consist of available-for-sale debt securities that we carry at fair
value. Except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies
of the United States government, and money market or cash management funds, we diversify our
investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer.

We use the specific identification method to compute gains and losses on investments. We include
unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of tax, in stockholders’ equity. Available-for-sale
debt securities are classified as current assets based upon our intent and ability to use any and
all of these securities as necessary to satisfy the significant short-term liquidity requirements
that may arise from the highly seasonal and cyclical nature of our businesses. Because of our
significant business seasonality, stock repurchase programs and acquisition



opportunities, cash flow requirements may fluctuate dramatically from quarter to quarter and
require us to use a significant amount of the investments held as available-for-sale securities.
See Note 2.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are not interest bearing. We maintain
an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. We review
our accounts receivable by aging category to identify significant customers or invoices with known
disputes or collectibility issues. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, we provide
reserves based on the age of the receivable. In determining the amount of the reserve, we make
judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations.
We also consider our historical level of credit losses and current economic trends that might
impact the level of future credit losses.

Funds Held for Payroll Customers and Payroll Customer Fund Deposits

Funds held for payroll customers at July 31, 2007 represent cash held on behalf of our payroll
customers that is invested in cash and cash equivalents. Funds held for payroll customers at July
31, 2006 represent cash held on behalf of our payroll customers that is invested in cash, cash
equivalents and available-for-sale investment-grade debt securities. Payroll customer fund deposits
consist primarily of direct deposit funds and payroll taxes we owe on behalf of our payroll
customers.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. We calculate
depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which
range from three to 30 years. We amortize leasehold improvements using the straight-line method
over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or remaining lease terms. We include the
amortization of assets that are recorded under capital leases in depreciation expense.

Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

We record goodwill when the purchase price of net tangible and intangible assets we acquire exceeds
their fair value. We amortize the cost of identified intangible assets on a straight-line basis
over periods ranging from three to seven years.

We regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values of our long-lived assets are
impaired. In accordance with SFAS 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”

we review goodwill
and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually in
our fourth fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for
impairment. In accordance with SFAS 144, “

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets

,” we review intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other long-lived assets when
an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. In our reviews, we look for facts or
circumstances, either internal or external, indicating that we may not recover the carrying value
of the asset. We measure impairment losses related to long-lived assets based on the amount by
which the carrying amounts of these assets exceed their fair values. Our measurement of fair value
under SFAS 142 is generally based on a blend of an analysis of the present value of estimated
future discounted cash flows and a comparison of revenue and operating income multiples for
companies of similar industry and/or size. Our measurement of fair value under SFAS 144 is
generally based on the present value of estimated future discounted cash flows. Our analysis is
based on available information and on assumptions and projections that we consider to be reasonable
and supportable. The discounted cash flow analysis considers the likelihood of possible outcomes
and is based on our best estimate of projected future cash flows. If necessary, we perform
subsequent calculations to measure the amount of the impairment loss based on the excess of the
carrying value over the fair value of the impaired assets.

Share-Based Compensation Plans

Our share-based employee compensation plans are described in Note 12. Prior to August 1, 2005, we
accounted for these share-based employee compensation plans under the measurement and recognition
provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,”

and related Interpretations, as permitted by SFAS 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.”

Accordingly, we recorded no share-based



employee compensation expense for options granted under the 2005 Plan or its predecessor plans
during the twelve months ended July 31, 2005 as all options granted under those plans had exercise
prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. We also recorded no
compensation expense in that period in connection with our Employee Stock Purchase Plan as the
purchase price of the stock was not less than 85% of the lower of the fair market value of our
common stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period. In
accordance with APB 25, we recorded compensation expense for restricted stock. In accordance with
SFAS 123 and SFAS 148,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure,”

we
provided pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per share disclosures for each period
prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) as if we had applied the fair value-based method in measuring
compensation expense for our share-based compensation plans.

Effective August 1, 2005, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment,”

using the modified prospective transition method. Under that transition
method, compensation expense that we recognized for the twelve months ended July 31, 2007 and 2006
included: (a) period compensation expense for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not
yet vested as of, August 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with
the original provisions of SFAS 123, adjusted for forfeitures, and (b) period compensation expense
for all share-based payments granted on or after August 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). For options granted before August 1,
2005, we amortize the fair value on an accelerated basis. This is the same basis on which we
amortized options granted before August 1, 2005 for our pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123. For
options granted on or after August 1, 2005, we amortize the fair value on a straight-line basis.
All options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the
vesting periods. Because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method, results for
prior periods have not been restated. In March 2005 the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, which provides supplemental implementation guidance for
SFAS 123(R). We have applied the provisions of SAB 107 in our adoption of SFAS 123(R). See Note 12
for information on the impact of our adoption of SFAS 123(R) and the assumptions we use to
calculate the fair value of share-based employee compensation.

Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers and Suppliers

We operate in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Significant technological
changes, shifting customer requirements, the emergence of competitive products or services with new
capabilities and other factors could negatively impact our operating results.

We are also subject to risks related to changes in the values of our significant balance of
investments and funds held for payroll customers. Our portfolio of investments consists of
investment-grade securities and our funds held for payroll customers consist of cash, cash
equivalents and investment-grade securities. Except for direct obligations of the United States
government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market or cash
management funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer.

We sell a significant portion of our products through third-party retailers and distributors. As a
result, we face risks related to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. For example, at
January 31, 2007, in the midst of the 2006 consumer tax season, amounts due from our 10 largest
retailers and distributors represented approximately 57% of total gross accounts receivable. To
appropriately manage this risk, we perform ongoing evaluations of customer credit and limit the
amount of credit extended as we deem appropriate but generally do not require collateral. We
maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have historically been within our
expectations. However, since we cannot necessarily predict future changes in the financial
stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. No
customer accounted for 10% or more of total net revenue in fiscal 2007, 2006 or 2005, nor did any
customer account for 10% or more of accounts receivable at July 31, 2007 or July 31, 2006. Amounts
due from Rock Acquisition Corporation, the purchaser of our Quicken Loans mortgage business, under
certain licensing and distribution agreements were included in accounts receivable and totaled $9.3
million at July 31, 2007 and 2006.

We rely on three third-party vendors to perform the manufacturing and distribution functions for
our primary retail desktop software products. We also have a key single-source vendor that prints
and fulfills orders for all of our checks and most other products for our financial supplies
business. While we believe that relying heavily on key vendors improves the efficiency and
reliability of our business operations, relying on any one vendor for a



significant aspect of our business can have a significant negative impact on our revenue and
profitability if that vendor fails to perform at acceptable service levels for any reason,
including financial difficulties of the vendor.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

FIN 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”

In June 2006 the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. (FIN) 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes.”

FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109, “

Accounting for Income Taxes.”

FIN
48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It
also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2006, which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning August 1,
2007. We are in the process of evaluating this guidance and therefore have not yet determined the
impact that the adoption of FIN 48 will have on our financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

SFAS 157,

“Fair Value Measurements”

In September 2006 the FASB issued SFAS 157,

“Fair Value Measurements.”

SFAS 157 provides enhanced
guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The standard also responds to
investors’ requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and
liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value
measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or
liabilities to be measured at fair value. This standard does not expand the use of fair value in
any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007,
which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2008. We are in the
process of evaluating this standard and therefore have not yet determined the impact that the
adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

SFAS 159,

“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”

In February 2007 the FASB issued SFAS 159,

“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities.”

SFAS 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial
assets and liabilities at fair value. The standard’s objective is to reduce both complexity in
accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related
assets and liabilities differently. The standard requires companies to provide additional
information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily
understand the effect of the company’s choice to use fair value on its earnings. It also requires
companies to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has
chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet. The new standard does not eliminate
disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards, including requirements for
disclosures about fair value measurements included in SFAS 157,

“Fair Value Measurements,”

and SFAS
107,

“Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments.”

SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2007, which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year
beginning August 1, 2008. We are in the process of evaluating this standard and therefore have not
yet determined the impact that the adoption of SFAS 159 will have on our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

We periodically review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is
other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation
concerns. We believe that the investments that we held at July 31, 2007 were not
other-than-temporarily impaired. While certain available-for-sale debt securities have fair values
that are below cost, we believe that if the securities were held to maturity it is probable that
principal and interest would be collected in accordance with contractual terms. We believe that the
unrealized losses at July 31, 2007 are due to changes in interest rates and not due to increased
credit risk.

We include realized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities in interest and
other income in our statements of operations. Gross realized gains and losses on our
available-for-sale debt securities were as follows for the periods indicated:

Software Development Costs

,” we
capitalize costs related to the development of computer software for internal use in accordance
with SOP 98-1. We capitalized internal use software costs totaling $48.3 million in fiscal 2007,
$37.6 million in fiscal 2006 and $31.3 million in fiscal 2005. These amounts included capitalized
labor costs of $13.2 million in fiscal 2007, $13.7 million in fiscal 2006 and $17.9 million in
fiscal 2005. Costs related to internal use software projects are included in the capital in
progress category of property and equipment until project completion, at which time they are
transferred to the computer software category and amortized on a straight-line basis over their
useful lives, which are generally three to five years.

4. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

As discussed in Note 1, “

Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

,” under
current accounting rules goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests.
Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment during fiscal 2007 were as shown in
the following table. Our reportable segments are described in Note 8. We transferred $41.8 million
in goodwill for our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions business from our Other Businesses
segment to long-term assets of discontinued operations at July 31, 2006. See Note 7. The fiscal
2007 increase in goodwill in our QuickBooks segment was due to the acquisition of StepUp Commerce,
Inc. The fiscal 2007 increase in goodwill in our new Financial Institutions segment was due to the
acquisition of Digital Insight Corporation. See Note 6.

other revenue and amortization of purchased intangible assets in our statements of operations.
Amortization of other purchased intangible assets such as customer lists is charged to
acquisition-related charges in our statements of operations. The table does not include
amortization for customer lists with a net book value of $5.1 million at July 31, 2007 which became
assets held for sale during the third quarter of fiscal 2007. See Note 7,

“Sale of Outsourced
Payroll Assets.”

The table also does not include amortization for IDMS purchased intangible assets
with a net book value of $10.0 million at July 31, 2007 which we have transferred to long-term
assets of discontinued operations. See Note 7,

5. Comprehensive Net Income (Loss)

SFAS 130, “

Reporting Comprehensive Income

,” establishes standards for reporting and displaying
comprehensive net income (loss) and its components in stockholders’ equity. SFAS 130 requires that
the components of other comprehensive income (loss), such as changes in the fair value of
available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustments, be added to our net
income (loss) to arrive at comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) items
have no impact on our net income (loss) as presented in our statements of operations.

6. Acquisitions

Digital Insight Corporation

Purchase Price

On February 6, 2007 we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Digital Insight Corporation for a
total purchase price of approximately $1.34 billion including the value of vested options assumed.
Digital Insight is a provider of outsourced online banking applications and services to banks,
credit unions and savings and loan associations. We intend to combine workflows in our financial
management tools with online banking capabilities offered by Digital Insight to create new, easier
to use, and better-value offerings for consumers and small businesses. We have



included Digital
Insight’s results of operations in our consolidated results of operations from the date of
acquisition. We combined Digital Insight with our existing financial institutions group, which had
been part of our Other Businesses segment, to create a new Financial Institutions segment during
the twelve months ended July 31, 2007. See Note 8.

Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement, we paid a cash amount of $39.00 per share for
each outstanding share of Digital Insight common stock and assumed options to purchase Digital
Insight common stock which were converted as of the acquisition date into options to purchase
approximately 1.5 million shares of our common stock. The total purchase price of the acquisition
was as follows:

Acquisition-related transaction costs

11,424

Total purchase price

$

1,344,427

The fair value of the assumed Digital Insight stock options was determined using a lattice
binomial model. The use of the lattice binomial model and the method of determining the variables
used in that model were consistent with our valuation of stock options in accordance with SFAS
123(R),

“Share-Based Payment.”

In addition to vested stock options valued at $13.9 million, we
assumed unvested stock options valued at $7.9 million that will be amortized to share-based
compensation expense over a weighted average vesting period of 2.4 years. The acquisition-related
transaction costs included legal, accounting and investment banking fees.

Under the purchase method of accounting, in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 we allocated the total
purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on their estimated fair values. We estimated the fair values with the assistance of a third
party appraisal firm. The fair values assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired were
based on estimates and assumptions determined by management. We recorded the excess of purchase
price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill, none of which is deductible for income tax
purposes. The acquired goodwill was assigned to our Financial Institutions segment. See Note 4. We
allocated the purchase price using the information currently available. In the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2007 we recorded a $10.7 million decrease to the net deferred income tax liability and a
corresponding decrease to goodwill. We decreased the net deferred income tax liability as a result
of a determination, after obtaining additional information, regarding the realizability of certain
deferred tax assets not previously recorded. We may continue to adjust the preliminary purchase
price allocation after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations,
liabilities assumed, and revisions of preliminary estimates. The purchase price allocation may not
be finalized until the third quarter of fiscal 2008.

The total preliminary allocation of the Digital Insight purchase price is as follows:

intangible assets relate to Digital Insight’s ability to sell existing, in-process and future
versions of its products to its existing customers. We amortize purchased intangible assets on a
straight-line basis over their respective useful lives. The following table presents the details of
the identifiable intangible assets acquired.

ended July 31, 2007.

Pro Forma Financial Information

The unaudited financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of
operations of Intuit and Digital Insight on a pro forma basis, as though the companies had been
combined as of the beginning of each of the periods presented. The pro forma financial information
is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations
that would have been achieved if the acquisition and the issuance of $1 billion of related senior
notes (see Note 10) had taken place at the beginning of each of the periods presented. The pro
forma financial information for all periods presented also includes adjustments to share-based
compensation expense for stock options assumed, adjustments to depreciation expense for acquired
property and equipment, amortization charges for acquired intangible assets, adjustments to
interest income, and related tax effects.

The pro forma financial information for the twelve months ended July 31, 2007 combines our results
for that period, which include the results of Digital Insight subsequent to February 6, 2007, the
date of acquisition, and the historical results for Digital Insight for the six months ended
December 31, 2006. The pro forma financial information for the twelve months ended July 31, 2006
combines our historical results for that period with the historical results of Digital Insight for
the twelve months ended June 30, 2006.

StepUp Commerce, Inc.

In August 2006 we acquired all of the outstanding shares of StepUp Commerce, Inc. (StepUp) for a
total purchase price of approximately $60 million in cash. We deposited $7.5 million of the total
purchase price in a third-party escrow account to be held through January 2008 to cover breaches of
representations and warranties set forth in the purchase agreement, should they arise. StepUp
provides services that allow small businesses to present their product information and images to
online shoppers. We acquired StepUp as part of our Right for Me initiative to offer a



wider range of business solutions for small businesses. StepUp became part of our QuickBooks
segment. Tangible assets and liabilities acquired were not significant. We allocated $8.9 million
of the purchase price to identified intangible assets and recorded the excess purchase price of
$50.4 million as goodwill, none of which is deductible for income tax purposes. The identified
intangible assets are being amortized over terms ranging from three to five years. We have included
StepUp’s results of operations in our consolidated results of operations from the date of
acquisition. StepUp’s results of operations for periods prior to the date of acquisition were not
material when compared with our consolidated results.

7. Dispositions and Discontinued Operations

Intuit Distribution Management Solutions Discontinued Operations

In July 2007 we signed a definitive agreement to sell our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions
(IDMS) business. The sale was completed in August 2007 for approximately $100 million in cash. The
decision was a result of management’s desire to focus resources on Intuit’s core products and
services. IDMS was part of our Other Businesses segment.

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-lived Assets,”

we determined that IDMS became a long-lived asset held for sale in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2007. SFAS 144 provides that a long-lived asset classified as held for sale
should be measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Since the
carrying value of IDMS at July 31, 2007 was less than the estimated fair value less cost to sell,
no adjustment to the carrying value of this long-lived asset was necessary during the twelve months
ended July 31, 2007. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, we discontinued the
amortization of IDMS intangible assets and the depreciation of IDMS property and equipment in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.

Also in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144 we determined that IDMS became a discontinued
operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. We have therefore segregated the net assets and
operating results of IDMS from continuing operations on our balance sheets and in our statements of
operations for all periods presented. Assets held for sale at July 31, 2007 and 2006 consisted
primarily of goodwill and purchased intangible assets. Because IDMS cash flows were not material
for any period presented, we have not segregated the cash flows of IDMS on our statements of cash
flows. See the table later in this Note 7 for the components of net income from discontinued
operations.

Sale of Outsourced Payroll Assets

In March 2007 we sold certain assets related to our Complete Payroll and Premier Payroll Service
businesses to Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP) for a price of up to approximately $135 million
in cash. The final purchase price is contingent upon the number of customers that transition to
ADP. Due to actual customer attrition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we currently
estimate the maximum sales price to be approximately $120 million. The assets were part of our
Payroll and Payments segment. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144,

“Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets,”

we have not accounted for this transaction as a
discontinued operation because the operations and cash flows of the assets could not be clearly
distinguished, operationally or for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of our outsourced
payroll business. We will recognize the net gain on the sale of the assets as customers are
transitioned pursuant to the agreement over a period not to exceed one year from the date of the
sale. In the twelve months ended July 31, 2007 we recorded a pre-tax net gain of $31.7 million in
our statement of operations for customers who transitioned to ADP during that period. We held
deposits received from ADP of $30.3 million in other current liabilities on our balance sheet at
July 31, 2007. Assets held for sale at July 31, 2007 consisted of $5.1 million in customer lists
and were included in purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet.

Sale of Master Builder Business

In May 2006 we sold our Master Builder construction management software and solutions business,
which was part of Intuit Construction Business Solutions in our Other Businesses segment. The
Master Builder business had quarterly revenue of approximately $5 million. We recorded a $7.7
million net loss on disposal of the business, including income tax expense of $10.1 million in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. In accordance with the provisions



of SFAS 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets,”

we have not
accounted for this transaction as a discontinued operation as the operations and cash flows of the
Master Builder business could not be clearly distinguished, operationally or for financial
reporting purposes, from the rest of the entity.

Intuit Information Technology Solutions Discontinued Operations

In December 2005 we sold our Intuit Information Technology Solutions (ITS) business for
approximately $200 million in cash. The buyer deposited approximately $20 million of the total
purchase price in a third-party escrow account to be held through December 2006 to cover breaches
of representations and warranties set forth in the purchase agreement, should they arise. We
received the full escrow amount in January 2007. The decision to sell ITS was a result of our
desire to focus resources on our core products and services. ITS was part of our Other Businesses
segment.

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-lived Assets,”

we accounted for the sale of ITS as discontinued operations. We have therefore
segregated the operating results and cash flows of ITS from continuing operations in our statements
of operations and statements of cash flows for all periods prior to the sale. We recorded a $34.3
million net gain on disposal of ITS which is included in net income from discontinued operations in
our statement of operations for the twelve months ended July 31, 2006. See the table later in this
Note 7 for the components of net income from discontinued operations.

Intuit Public Sector Solutions Discontinued Operations

In December 2004 we sold our Intuit Public Sector Solutions (IPSS) business for approximately $11
million in cash. The decision to sell IPSS was a result of our desire to focus resources on our
core products and services. IPSS was part of our Other Businesses segment. In accordance with SFAS
144, we accounted for the sale as discontinued operations. We have therefore segregated the
operating results and cash flows of IPSS from continuing operations in our statements of operations
and statements of cash flows for all periods prior to the sale. We recorded a $4.8 million net loss
on disposal of IPSS during the twelve months ended July 31, 2005 that included a $4.3 million
income tax provision for the estimated tax payable in connection with the expected tax gain on the
sale of IPSS. See the table later in this Note 7 for the components of net income from discontinued
operations.

8. Industry Segment and Geographic Information

SFAS 131, “

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

,” establishes
standards for the way in which public companies disclose certain information about operating
segments in their financial reports. Consistent with SFAS 131, we have defined six reportable
segments, described below, based on factors such as how we manage our operations and how our chief
operating decision maker views results. We define the chief operating decision maker as our Chief
Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. We have aggregated two operating segments to
form our Payroll and Payments reportable segment.

In February 2007 we completed the acquisition of Digital Insight, a provider of outsourced online
banking applications and services to banks and credit unions. We combined Digital Insight with our
existing financial institutions group, which had been part of our Other Businesses segment, to
create a new Financial Institutions segment. We have reclassified previously reported fiscal 2006
and 2005 segment results to be consistent with the fiscal 2007 presentation. We have also
reclassified segment results for all periods presented to reflect the transfer of our MyCorporation
business from our Consumer Tax segment to our QuickBooks segment. MyCorporation net revenue was
$7.9 million in fiscal 2007 and $4.4 million in fiscal 2006. MyCorporation net revenue was not
significant in fiscal 2005.

QuickBooks product revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks desktop software products and
financial supplies such as paper checks, envelopes and invoices. QuickBooks service and other
revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks Online Edition, QuickBooks support plans and royalties
from small business online services.

Payroll and Payments product revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks Payroll, a family of
products sold on a subscription basis offering payroll tax tables, forms and electronic tax payment
and filing to small businesses that prepare their own payrolls. Payroll and Payments service and
other revenue is derived from small business payroll services as well as from merchant services
such as credit and debit card processing provided by our Innovative Merchant Solutions business.
Service and other revenue for this segment also includes interest earned on funds held for payroll
customers.

Consumer Tax product revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax federal and state consumer and
small business desktop tax return preparation software. Consumer Tax service and other revenue is
derived primarily from TurboTax Online tax return preparation services and electronic filing
services.

Professional Tax product revenue is derived primarily from Lacerte and ProSeries professional tax
preparation software products. Professional Tax service and other revenue is derived primarily from
electronic filing services, bank product transmission services and training services.

Financial Institutions service and other revenue is derived primarily from outsourced online
banking software products that are hosted in our data centers and delivered as on-demand service
offerings to banks, credit unions and savings and loan associations by our Digital Insight
business.

Other Businesses consist primarily of Quicken and Canada. Quicken product revenue is derived
primarily from Quicken desktop software products. Quicken service and other revenue consists
primarily of fees from consumer online transactions and from Quicken-branded credit card and bill
payment offerings that we provide through our partners. In Canada, product revenue is derived
primarily from localized versions of QuickBooks and Quicken as well as QuickTax and TaxWiz consumer
desktop tax return preparation software and ProFile professional tax preparation products. Service
and other revenue in Canada consists primarily of revenue from payroll services and QuickBooks
support plans.

Our QuickBooks, Payroll and Payments, Consumer Tax, Professional Tax and Financial Institutions
segments operate primarily in the United States. All of our segments sell primarily to customers
located in the United States. International total net revenue was less than 5% of consolidated
total net revenue for all periods presented.

We include costs such as corporate general and administrative expenses and share-based compensation
expenses that are not allocated to specific segments in a category we call Corporate. The Corporate
category also includes amortization of purchased intangible assets, acquisition-related charges,
impairment of goodwill and purchased



intangible assets, interest expense, interest and other income, and realized net gains or losses on
marketable equity securities and other investments.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary
of significant accounting policies in Note 1. Except for goodwill and purchased intangible assets,
we do not generally track assets by reportable segment and, consequently, we do not disclose total
assets by reportable segment. See Note 4 for goodwill by reportable segment.

The following tables show our financial results by reportable segment for the twelve months ended
July 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

9. Current Liabilities

Bridge Credit Facility

In connection with our February 6, 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight (see Note 6), we borrowed $1
billion under a one-year unsecured bridge credit facility with two institutional lenders in order
to pay a portion of the purchase price of Digital Insight. This bridge credit facility accrued
interest at 5.77%. On March 12, 2007 we retired this bridge credit facility with the proceeds of
our issuance of $1 billion in long-term senior unsecured notes. See Note 10.

Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility

On March 22, 2007 we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for a $500
million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on March 22, 2012. Advances under the
credit facility will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Citibank’s
base rate or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.18% to
0.575% based on our senior debt credit ratings. The applicable interest rate will be increased by
0.05% for any period in which the total principal amount of advances and letters of credit under
the credit facility exceeds $250 million. The agreement includes covenants that require us to
maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 and a ratio of annual EBITDA to interest
payable of not less than 3.00 to 1.00. We may use amounts borrowed under this credit facility for
general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business. To date we have
not borrowed under this credit facility.

10. Long-Term Obligations and Commitments

Senior Unsecured Notes

In connection with our acquisition of Digital Insight (see Note 6), on March 12, 2007 we issued
$500 million of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2012 (the 2012 Notes) and $500
million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017 (the 2017 Notes) (together, the
Notes), for a total principal amount of $1 billion. The Notes are redeemable by Intuit at any time,
subject to a make-whole premium. On March 12, 2007 we retired the bridge credit facility described
in Note 9 with the proceeds of our issuance of these senior unsecured notes. The Notes include
covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and to enter into sale and
leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances. Based on the trading prices of the Notes
at July 31, 2007 and the interest rates we could obtain for other borrowings with similar terms at
that date, the estimated fair value of the Notes at July 31, 2007 was $963.0 million.

The following table summarizes our senior unsecured notes:

Derivative Instruments

In December 2006 we entered into a $500 million notional amount five-year forward starting swap and
a $500 million notional amount 10-year forward starting swap designated as cash flow hedges of the
interest payments on the senior notes described above. Under these interest rate swap contracts, we
made fixed-rate interest payments and received variable-rate interest payments based on the London
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The effect of these swaps was to offset changes in the fixed rate
between the date we entered into the interest rate swaps and the



issuance date of the senior notes. We settled the interest rate swaps on March 7, 2007 for a
cumulative gain of $0.7 million which will be amortized using the effective yield method as an
adjustment of interest expense over the term of the related debt in our statements of operations.
At July 31, 2007, the net unamortized gain of $0.4 million was included in other comprehensive
income in the stockholders’ equity section of our balance sheet.

Innovative Merchant Solutions Loan and Buyout Commitments

In April 2005 our wholly owned subsidiary, Innovative Merchant Solutions (IMS), became a member of
Superior Bankcard Services, LLC (SBS), a newly formed entity that acquires merchant accounts for
IMS. Our consolidated financial statements include the financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of SBS, after elimination of all significant intercompany balances and transactions,
including amounts outstanding under the credit agreement described below. See Note 1. In connection
with the formation of this entity IMS agreed to provide to SBS revolving loans in an amount of up
to $24.5 million under the terms of a credit agreement. In June 2006 IMS entered into an amendment
to the credit agreement to increase the amount of funds IMS may loan under that agreement to $40.0
million. The credit agreement expires in July 2013, although certain events, such as a sale of SBS,
can trigger earlier termination. Amounts outstanding under this agreement at July 31, 2007 totaled
$11.2 million at an interest rate of 9.25%. Amounts outstanding under this agreement at July 31,
2006 totaled $11.9 million at interest rates ranging from 6.75% to 9.25%. There are no scheduled
repayments on the outstanding loan balance. All unpaid principal amounts and the related accrued
interest are due and payable in full at the loan expiration date.

The operating agreement of SBS requires that, no later than July 2009, either IMS agree to purchase
the minority members’ interests in SBS at a price to be set by negotiation or arbitration, or IMS
and the minority members pursue a sale of their interests in SBS to a third party.



Operating Leases

We lease office facilities and equipment under various operating lease agreements. Our facilities
leases generally provide for periodic rent increases and many contain escalation clauses and
renewal options. Certain leases require us to pay property taxes, insurance and routine
maintenance. Annual minimum commitments under all of these leases are shown in the table below.

Purchase Obligations

At July 31, 2007, we had unconditional purchase obligations of approximately $97.5 million. These
unconditional purchase obligations represent agreements to purchase products and services that are
enforceable, legally binding, and specify terms that include fixed or minimum quantities to be
purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payments.
The largest of these commitments totaled $63.3 million and relates to future outsourced payment
fulfillment and bill management services to financial institutions that contract with our Digital
Insight business for Internet banking services. This commitment expires in June 2010.

Reversals of reserves for all periods presented related to potential income tax exposures that
were resolved.

In accordance with SFAS 123(R), which we adopted on August 1, 2005, tax savings from expected
future deductions based on the expense attributable to our stock option plans are reflected in the
federal and state tax provisions for fiscal 2007 and 2006. They were not reflected in the provision
for fiscal 2005.

Tax deductions associated with stock option exercises related to grants vesting prior to August 1,
2005 are credited to stockholders’ equity. Excess tax benefits associated with stock option
exercises related to grants vesting on or after August 1, 2005 are also credited to stockholders’
equity. The reductions of income taxes payable resulting from the exercise of employee stock
options and other employee stock programs that were credited to stockholders’ equity were
approximately $56.1 million in fiscal 2007, $58.0 million in fiscal 2006 and $26.4 million in
fiscal 2005.

In December 2006 the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 was signed into law. The Act includes a
reinstatement of the federal research and experimental credit retroactive to January 1, 2006. We
recorded a discrete tax benefit of approximately $3.7 million for the retroactive amount related to
fiscal 2006 during the twelve months ended July 31, 2007. The credit as reinstated has an
expiration date of December 31, 2007.

We have provided a valuation allowance related to the benefits of certain state capital loss
carryforwards and state net operating losses that we believe are unlikely to be realized. The
valuation allowance decreased by $1.9 million in fiscal 2007. The decrease was due to utilization
of $1.0 million and expired losses of $0.9 million. The valuation allowance decreased by $1.6
million in fiscal 2006 and by $1.5 million in fiscal 2005.

We acquired Digital Insight on February 6, 2007. See Note 6. Digital Insight had approximately
$76 million in federal net operating loss carryforwards at the date of acquisition. We have
recorded the tax effects of these federal carryforwards and other federal tax credit carryforwards,
which together totaled approximately $34.4 million, as deferred tax assets at the date of
acquisition. These carryforwards will not result in an income tax provision benefit, but they will
reduce income taxes payable and cash paid for income taxes as we utilize them.

At July 31, 2007, we had total federal net operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credit
carryforwards of $25.3 million and $4.9 million. The carryforwards will expire starting in fiscal
2019 and 2017. Utilization of the net operating losses and credits are subject to annual
limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits
before utilization.



At July 31, 2007, we had various state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for which we
have recorded a gross deferred tax asset of $5.7 million and a valuation allowance of $2.5 million.
The state net operating losses will expire starting in fiscal 2011. Utilization of the net
operating losses may be subject to annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the
expiration of net operating losses before utilization.

12. Stockholders’ Equity

Stock Split

On July 6, 2006 we implemented a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend. All
share and per share figures in the statements of operations and notes to the financial statements
retroactively reflect this stock split. This stock split was an equity restructuring that is
considered a modification under SFAS 123(R), but it did not result in a change in fair value of any
equity awards.

Stock Repurchase Programs

Intuit’s Board of Directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of
common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. Under these programs, we
repurchased 17.1 million shares of our common stock for $506.6 million in fiscal 2007, 31.0 million
shares of our common stock for $784.2 million in fiscal 2006 and 32.4 million shares of our common
stock for $709.2 million in fiscal 2005. At July 31, 2007, we had authorization from our Board to
expend $800 million for future stock repurchases.

Repurchased shares of our common stock are held as treasury shares until they are reissued or
retired. When we reissue treasury stock, if the proceeds from the sale are more than the average
price we paid to acquire the shares we record an increase in additional paid-in capital.
Conversely, if the proceeds from the sale are less than the average price we paid to acquire the
shares, we record a decrease in additional paid-in capital to the extent of increases previously
recorded for similar transactions and a decrease in retained earnings for any remaining amount.

Description of Stock Plans

Our stockholders approved our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan on December 9, 2004. The 2005 Plan
replaces our 2002 Equity Incentive Plan, 1996 Directors Stock Option Plan and 1998 Option Plan for
Mergers and Acquisitions. Beginning December 9, 2004 no further awards could be granted under the
2002 Plan, Directors Plan or 1998 Plan. However, all outstanding equity awards under these plans
remain in effect in accordance with their terms. There were 3,861,820 shares available for grant
under the 2002 Plan, 13,750 shares available for grant under the Directors Plan and 4,570,588
shares available for grant under the 1998 Plan on the date of their termination for a total of
8,446,158 shares. These shares ceased to be available for grant under any of our equity
compensation plans upon adoption of the 2005 Plan.

Under the 2005 Plan, we are permitted to grant incentive and non-qualified stock options,
restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (RSUs), stock appreciation rights and stock bonus
awards to our employees, non-employee directors and consultants. The 2005 Plan provides for the
automatic grant of stock options to non-employee directors according to a formula in the plan
document. For other awards, the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board
of Directors (the Compensation Committee) or its delegates determine who will receive grants, when
those grants will be exercisable, their exercise price and other terms. There are a total of
36,000,000 shares authorized under the 2005 Plan. Up to 50% of equity awards granted each year can
be at less than full fair market value. All options granted to date under the 2005 Plan have
exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant. All RSUs are
considered to be granted at less than the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant
because they have no exercise price. Options granted under the 2005 Plan typically vest over three
years based on continued service and have a seven year term.

Outstanding awards that were originally granted under the 2002, Directors, and 1998 Plans remain in
effect in accordance with their terms. The general terms of the 2002 Plan are similar to the
general terms of the 2005 Plan. Our Directors Plan provided for the grant of non-qualified stock
options to non-employee directors of Intuit. Most options under our Directors Plan are subject to
vesting over time based on continued service, with vesting periods ranging from one to four years,
and all options under this plan expire after ten years. Our 1998 Plan provided for the



grant of non-qualified stock options to individuals whom we hired as a result of our acquisitions
of or mergers with other companies for a period of 18 months following the completion of those
transactions.

Description of Employee Stock Purchase Plan

On November 26, 1996 our stockholders adopted our Employee Stock Purchase Plan under Section 423 of
the Internal Revenue Code. The ESPP permits our eligible employees to make payroll deductions to
purchase our stock on regularly scheduled purchase dates at a discount. The ESPP has been amended
several times since its adoption. We amended it most recently on December 15, 2006 to increase the
total shares available for issuance to 13,800,000 shares, on July 27, 2005 to extend its term to
July 27, 2015, and on January 25, 2005 to reduce the length of the offering periods from twelve
months to three months effective with the June 2005 offering period. The purchase price for shares
purchased under the ESPP is 85% of the lower of the closing price for Intuit common stock on the
first day or the last day of the offering period in which the employee is participating.

Under the ESPP, employees purchased 1,099,757 shares of Intuit common stock in fiscal 2007 and
1,050,198 shares in fiscal 2006 and 1,215,922 shares in fiscal 2005. At July 31, 2007 there were
3,274,337 shares available for issuance under this plan.



Impact of the Adoption of SFAS 123(R)

Share-Based Compensation Expense

See Note 1 for a description of our adoption of SFAS 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment,”

on August 1,
2005. The following table summarizes the total share-based compensation expense for stock options,
restricted stock awards, RSUs and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan that we recorded for continuing
operations for the periods shown. The impact of our adoption of SFAS 123(R) on discontinued
operations was nominal for these periods.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), we presented deferred compensation as a separate
component of stockholders’ equity. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R), on August 1,
2005 we reclassified the balance in deferred compensation to additional paid-in capital on our
balance sheet.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), we presented all tax benefits for deductions resulting from
the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares under our ESPP plan as operating cash
flows on our statement of cash flows. SFAS 123(R) requires the cash flows resulting from the tax
benefits for tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recorded for those options and
ESPP shares (excess tax benefits) to be classified as financing cash flows. Accordingly, we
classified the $30.9 million and $27.0 million in excess tax benefits for the twelve months ended
July 31, 2007 and July 31, 2006 as financing cash inflows rather than as operating cash inflows on
our statement of cash flows for those fiscal years.



Comparable Disclosures

As discussed in Note 1, we accounted for share-based employee compensation under SFAS 123(R)’s fair
value method during the twelve months ended July 31, 2007 and 2006. Prior to August 1, 2005 we
accounted for share-based employee compensation under the provisions of APB 25. Accordingly, we
recorded no share-based compensation expense for stock options or our Employee Stock Purchase Plan
for the twelve months ended July 31, 2005. The following table illustrates the effect on our net
income and net income per share for the twelve months ended July 31, 2005 if we had applied the
fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to share-based compensation using the Black-Scholes
valuation model.

Determining Fair Value

Valuation and Amortization Method.

Effective August 1, 2006 we began estimating the fair value of
stock options granted using a lattice binomial model and a multiple option award approach. Prior to
that date we used the Black Scholes valuation model and a multiple option approach. This change did
not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our
stock options have various restrictions, including vesting provisions and restrictions on transfer,
and are often exercised prior to their contractual maturity. We therefore believe that lattice
binomial models are more capable of incorporating the features of our stock options than
closed-form models such as the Black Scholes model. The use of a lattice binomial model requires
the use of extensive



actual employee exercise behavior and a number of complex assumptions including the expected
volatility of our stock price over the term of the options, risk-free interest rates and expected
dividends. For options granted before August 1, 2005, we amortize the fair value on an accelerated
basis. This is the same basis on which we amortized options granted before August 1, 2005 for our
pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123. For options granted on or after August 1, 2005, we amortize
the fair value on a straight-line basis. All options are amortized over the requisite service
periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. We record compensation expense for
the market value of restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method. We amortize the value
of restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the restriction period.

Expected Term

. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that they are
expected to be outstanding and is a derived output of the lattice binomial model. The expected term
of stock options is impacted by all of the underlying assumptions and calibration of our model. The
lattice binomial model assumes that option exercise behavior is a function of the option’s
remaining vested life and the extent to which the market price of our common stock exceeds the
option exercise price. The lattice binomial model estimates the probability of exercise as a
function of these two variables based on the history of exercises and cancellations on all past
option grants made by us. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we estimated the expected
term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model. For the first
three quarters of fiscal 2006 and for fiscal 2005, we estimated the expected term of options
granted based on historical exercise patterns.

Expected Volatility

. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we estimate the volatility of
our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of one-year and two-year
publicly traded options on our common stock, consistent with SFAS 123(R) and SAB 107. Our decision
to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common
stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price
trends than historical volatility. Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we estimated the
volatility of our common stock at the date of grant using the historical volatility of our stock
over periods that were approximately equal to the average expected term of our options or the
length of the offering periods under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Risk-Free Interest Rate.

We base the risk-free interest rate that we use in our option valuation
model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity U.S. Treasury
issues with equivalent remaining terms.

Dividends.

We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate
paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend
yield of zero in our option valuation model.

Forfeitures.

SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those
estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use
historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation
expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. For purposes of calculating pro forma
information under SFAS 123 for periods prior to fiscal 2006, we accounted for forfeitures as they
occurred.

We define in-the-money options at July 31, 2007 as options that had exercise prices that were
lower than the $28.64 market price of our common stock at that date. The aggregate intrinsic value
of options outstanding at July 31, 2007 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price
of the underlying options and the market price of our common stock for the shares that were
in-the-money at that date. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal 2007
was $154.5 million and during fiscal 2006 was $158.1 million, determined as of the date of
exercise.

We recorded $50.9 million in share-based compensation expense for stock options and our Employee
Stock Purchase Plan in continuing operations for the twelve months ended July 31, 2007. The total
tax benefit related to this share-based compensation was $17.9 million. We recorded $65.0 million
in share-based compensation expense for stock options and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan in
continuing operations for the twelve months ended July 31, 2006. The total tax benefit related to
this share-based compensation was $23.4 million.

At July 31, 2007, there was $123.5 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested
stock options which we will amortize to expense in the future. Unrecognized compensation cost will
be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures. We expect to recognize that cost over a
weighted average vesting period of 2.2 years.

We received $185.7 million and $257.6 million in cash from option exercises under all share-based
payment arrangements for the twelve months ended July 31, 2007 and 2006. The actual tax benefits
that we realized related to tax deductions for non-qualified option exercises and disqualifying
dispositions under all share-based payment arrangements totaled $58.7 million and $62.0 million for
those periods.

Due to our ongoing program of repurchasing our common stock on the open market, at July 31, 2007 we
had 90.6 million treasury shares. We satisfy option exercises from this pool of treasury shares.

The total fair value of RSUs vested during the twelve months ended July 31, 2007 was $6.3
million. We recorded $25.4 million and $5.3 million in share-based compensation expense for RSUs in
continuing operations for the twelve months ended July 31, 2007 and 2006. The total tax benefit
related to this RSU compensation expense was $6.4 million and $1.9 million.

At July 31, 2007, there was $55.0 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested
RSUs which we will amortize to expense in the future. Unrecognized compensation cost will be
adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures. We expect to recognize that cost over a
weighted average vesting period of 2.0 years.

13. Benefit Plans

Executive Deferred Compensation Plan

In December 2004 we adopted our 2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan that was effective
January 1, 2005. We adopted the 2005 Plan to meet the requirements of the new restrictions on
deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The 2005 Plan was designed
to track the provisions of our original Executive Deferred Compensation Plan that became effective
March 15, 2002. All deferrals for compensation that would otherwise be payable on or after January
1, 2005 and employer contributions made on or after January 1, 2005 are credited to participants
under the new 2005 Plan. No new deferrals or contributions will be made to the original plan. Both
plans provide that executives who meet minimum compensation requirements are eligible to defer up
to 50% of their salaries and up to 90% of their bonuses and commissions. We have agreed to credit
the participants’ contributions with earnings that reflect the performance of certain independent
investment funds. We may also make discretionary employer contributions to participant accounts in
certain circumstances. The timing, amounts and vesting schedules of employer contributions are at
the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee or its delegate. The benefits under this plan are
unsecured and are general assets of Intuit. Participants are generally eligible to receive payment
of their vested benefit at the end of their elected deferral period or after termination of their
employment with Intuit for any reason or at a later date to comply with the restrictions of Section
409A. Discretionary company contributions and the related earnings vest completely upon the
participant’s disability, death or a change of control of Intuit.



We made employer contributions to the plan of $0.9 million in fiscal 2007, $0.5 million in fiscal
2006 and $1.3 million in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2004 and 2003, we also entered into several
agreements in which we committed to make employer contributions on behalf of certain executives
provided that they remain employed at Intuit on certain future dates. All of these contributions
were fully vested at the time of contribution.

We held assets of $33.8 million and liabilities of $35.9 million related to this plan at July 31,
2007. We held assets of $26.5 million and liabilities of $27.8 million related to this plan at July
31, 2006. Assets related to this plan are in other long-term assets and liabilities related to this
plan are in other current liabilities on our balance sheets. The plan liabilities include accrued
employer contributions not yet funded to the plan.

401(k) Plan

Employees who participate in the Intuit Inc. 401(k) Plan may contribute up to 20% of pre-tax salary
to the plan, subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The plan allows Intuit to
make matching contributions. During fiscal 2007 we matched employee contributions to the greater of
(a) $0.75 per dollar of salary contributed by the employee, up to a maximum matching contribution
of $3,000; or (b) 75 percent of the first six percent of salary contributed by the employee,
subject to IRS limitations. Fifty percent of matching contributions vest after two years of service
by the employee and 100% of matching contributions vest after three years of service. Participating
employees who are age 50 or older may also make catch-up contributions. These contributions are not
matched. Matching contributions were $27.5 million in fiscal 2007, $23.6 million in fiscal 2006 and
$13.4 million in fiscal 2005.

14. Stockholder Rights Plan

On April 29, 1998 our Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan designed to protect the
long-term value of Intuit for its stockholders during any future unsolicited acquisition attempt.
In connection with the plan, the Board declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right
for each share of Intuit’s common stock outstanding on May 11, 1998 (the Record Date) and further
directed the issuance of one such right with respect to each share of Intuit’s common stock that is
issued after the Record Date, except in certain circumstances. If a person or a group (an Acquiring
Person) acquires 20% or more of Intuit’s common stock, or announces an intention to make a tender
offer for Intuit’s common stock, the consummation of which would result in a person or group
becoming an Acquiring Person, then the rights will be distributed (the Distribution Date). After
the Distribution Date, each right may be exercised for 1/6000

th

of a share of a newly
designated Series B Junior Participating Preferred stock at an exercise price of $300.00. The
rights will expire on May 1, 2008. In July 2002 we adopted a policy that requires an independent
committee of our Board of Directors to review the rights plan at least once every three years to
consider whether maintaining the rights plan continues to be in the best interests of Intuit and
its stockholders. In April 2005 the Nominating and Governance Committee of our Board of Directors,
which is composed solely of independent directors, reviewed the rights plan and determined that it
continues to be in the best interests of Intuit and its stockholders.

15. Litigation

Muriel Siebert & Co., Inc. v. Intuit Inc., Index No. 03-602942, Supreme Court of the State of New
York, County of New York

On September 17, 2003 Muriel Siebert & Co., Inc. filed a complaint against Intuit alleging various
claims for breach of contract, breach of express and implied covenants of good faith and fair
dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, misrepresentation and/or fraud, and promissory estoppel. The
allegations relate to Quicken Brokerage powered by Siebert, a strategic alliance between the two
companies. The complaint seeks compensatory damages of up to $11.1 million, punitive damages of up
to $33.0 million and other damages. Intuit unsuccessfully sought to compel the matter to
arbitration. On February 7, 2005 Intuit filed a motion to dismiss all but one of the plaintiff’s
claims in New York state court. On September 6, 2005 the court dismissed Siebert’s fraud and
punitive damages claims. On May 8, 2007 the Court of Appeals of the State of New York resolved in
Intuit’s favor a motion by Siebert to disqualify Intuit’s counsel, and the case is now proceeding
again in the trial court. No trial date has yet been set. Intuit believes this lawsuit is without
merit and will vigorously defend the litigation.



Other Litigation Matters

Intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened
litigation, that arise in the normal course of our business, including assertions that we may be
infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others. We currently believe that the
ultimate amount of liability, if any, for any pending claims of any type (either alone or combined)
will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The
ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, litigation can have an
adverse impact on Intuit because of defense costs, negative publicity, diversion of management
resources and other factors. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation
arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business.

16. Related Party Transactions

Loans to Officers

Prior to July 30, 2002, loans to officers were made generally in connection with their relocation
and purchase of a residence near their new place of work. The loans were all approved by the
Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, which consists solely of independent directors.
Consistent with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation enacted on July 30, 2002, we
have not made or modified any loans to officers since that date and we do not intend to make or
modify any loans to executive officers in the future. At July 31, 2007, no loans were in default
and all interest payments were current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreements.

At July 31, 2007, loans to executive officers in the principal amount of $4.4 million were
outstanding and loans to other officers in the principal amount of $4.5 million were outstanding.
At July 31, 2006, loans to executive officers in the principal amount of $5.7 million were
outstanding and loans to other officers in the principal amount of $3.2 million were outstanding.
These amounts were classified as long-term assets on our balance sheets in accordance with the
terms of the loan agreements. Of the total loans to officers at July 31, 2007, $4.4 million accrue
no interest for the term of the note. The remaining loans to officers at July 31, 2007 accrue
interest at rates equal to the applicable federal rates in effect at the time the loans were made.
All of the loans to officers at July 31, 2007 were secured by real property and had original terms
of 10 years.

Repurchases of Vested Restricted Stock

In the third quarters of fiscal 2007 and 2005 we entered into share repurchase agreements with
Stephen M. Bennett, our Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to which we repurchased shares of our
common stock from Mr. Bennett at the closing price quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market on the dates
of repurchase. We repurchased 5,362 shares of Intuit common stock at a price of $29.48 per share
from Mr. Bennett in fiscal 2007 and 31,890 shares of Intuit common stock at a price of $20.91 per
share from Mr. Bennett in fiscal 2005. All of the proceeds from these repurchases were remitted to
federal and state taxing authorities to satisfy Mr. Bennett’s federal, state and Medicare tax
withholding obligations resulting from the vesting of 15,000 shares and 75,000 shares of Intuit
common stock under his January 2000 new-hire restricted stock awards. These repurchases were
approved by the Compensation Committee and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, which
consist solely of independent directors.



17. Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

The following tables contain selected quarterly financial data for fiscal years 2007 and 2006. We
accounted for our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions, Intuit Public Sector Solutions and
Intuit Information Technology Solutions businesses as discontinued operations and as a result the
operating results of these businesses have been segregated from continuing operations in our
statements of operations and in these tables. See Note 7.

ITEM 9A

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures, Intuit’s Chief
Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) have concluded that as of the end of the
period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K our disclosure controls and procedures as defined
under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) were effective to provide reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission
and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2007 based on the guidelines established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of this evaluation, our management has concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July 31, 2007 to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. We reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the Audit Committee
of Intuit’s Board of Directors.

Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, independently assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2007. Ernst & Young
has issued an attestation report concurring with management’s assessment, which is included in Part
II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

During our most recent fiscal quarter, there has not occurred any change in our internal control
over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

We maintain a Business Conduct Guide that incorporates our code of ethics applicable to all
