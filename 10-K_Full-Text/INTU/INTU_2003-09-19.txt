CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Throughout this Report, we make forward-looking statements that are based on
our current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and our
industry, and that reflect our beliefs and assumptions based on information
available to us at the date of this Report. Many of these statements are
located in the sections entitled “Business” and “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” In some cases, you
can identify these statements by words such as “may,” “might,” “will,”
“should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,”
“predicts,” “potential” or “continue,” and other similar terms. These
forward-looking statements include, among other things, projections of our
future financial performance, our anticipated growth, the strategies and trends
we anticipate in our businesses and the customer segments in which we operate
and the competitive nature and anticipated growth of those segments.

We caution investors that forward-looking statements are only predictions,
based on our current expectations about future events. These forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks,
uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Our actual
results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Some of the important
factors that could impact our future operating results and could cause our
results to differ are discussed in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risks That Could
Affect Future Results.” We encourage you to read that section carefully. You
should carefully consider those risks, in addition to the other information in
this Report and in our other filings with the SEC, before deciding to invest in
our stock or to maintain or change your investment. We caution investors not
to rely on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s
analysis only as of the date of this Report. We undertake no obligation to
revise or update any forward-looking statement for any reason, except as
required by law.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Intuit’s Mission: Transforming Business and Financial Management

Our mission is to transform the way people run their businesses and manage
their financial lives. Our goal is to create changes so profound and simple
that customers wouldn’t dream of going back to their old ways of keeping
their books, managing their businesses, preparing their taxes or organizing
their personal finances. Our products and



services fall into the following
principal categories: QuickBooks® small business accounting and business
management solutions; small business products and services that include
payroll, financial supplies, technical support and information technology
management solutions; TurboTax® consumer tax products and services; ProSeries®
and Lacerte® professional tax products and services; Intuit-branded business
management solutions designed to meet the specialized requirements of
businesses in selected industries (which we call “Verticals”); and our other
businesses, which consist primarily of Quicken® personal finance products and
services and our Canadian business. Details about our offerings are provided
in “Products and Services” below.

Company Growth Strategy

Intuit has a tradition of successful customer-driven innovation, using
technology to address complex customer problems and develop solutions that make
things easier. By applying strategic and operational rigor to this foundation,
we believe we can accelerate our customer-driven innovation and deliver
stronger revenue and profit growth.

There are four key fundamentals that support our growth strategy:

•

We deliberately choose to be in businesses with large, underserved
market opportunities where we believe we have the strategic and durable
advantage to produce long-term profitable growth.

•

We use operational rigor and process excellence methodology, tools
and resources to execute more effectively on a daily basis. Our goal
is higher service levels at lower cost.

•

We expand our tradition of customer-driven innovation by looking
for new, large customer problems and challenging conventional wisdom to
create solutions for customers and profitable growth for Intuit.

•

We apply strategic rigor to identify new adjacent markets and
acquire companies that help us expand our leadership positions in our
small business and tax businesses. Our goal is to create new growth
platforms that drive faster profitable growth.

By being both disciplined and innovative, we can improve execution and deliver
more — for example, by tightening development cycles, we can introduce more
new products more quickly. The new products drive stronger growth and give
customers a broader range of offerings to best meet their needs.

Customer-Focused Product Strategy

We strive to deliver a range of products and services that can provide a
compelling customer proposition for a wide variety of customers with differing
needs. In fiscal 2003, we continued to execute on that broad strategy and
added key people, processes and infrastructure to our organization.

In September 2001 we announced our “Right for My Business” strategy. The
primary purpose of this strategy is to address the market opportunity for
businesses with up to 250 employees. Our goal is to offer the right solution
for each small business in our targeted markets. Our Right for My Business
strategy has two separate components. The first is focused on our QuickBooks
products and related small business products and services. The second is
focused on our Vertical Business Management Solutions products and services.

Here are the key elements of the
QuickBooks and small business component of our Right for My
Business strategy:

•

We have been expanding our QuickBooks product line to offer
easy-to-use, industry-specific versions of QuickBooks, which we call
“flavors.” These products include QuickBooks Premier: Accountant
Edition for accounting professionals and Premier and Enterprise
versions of QuickBooks for contractors and healthcare providers.



•

We are also offering versions of QuickBooks designed for bigger,
more complex businesses — including QuickBooks Premier for small
businesses needing more advanced accounting functionality and
QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions Business Management Software for
businesses with up to 250 employees.

•

We offer business solutions that go beyond accounting software to
address a wider range of business management challenges that small
businesses face. For example, we offer QuickBooks Point of Sale, an
add-on product for retail businesses. We also offer a broad range of
payroll services and financial supplies, as well as software solutions
that help businesses manage their information technology resources and
assets. In the first quarter of fiscal 2004, we announced QuickBooks
Customer Manager, a stand-alone desktop software package that works
with or independently of QuickBooks. This new product is designed to
provide small businesses with integrated tools to manage their customer
relationships.

•

We continue to expand the Intuit Developer Network. This
initiative encourages third-party software developers to develop
applications that exchange data with QuickBooks and other Intuit
products by giving them limited access to application programming
interfaces for certain of our software products. At the end of fiscal
2003, there were approximately 300 third-party applications available
for QuickBooks and other Intuit products. These applications allow our
customers to derive even more value from their Intuit software.

Under the Vertical Business Management Solutions component of our Right for My
Business strategy, we provide Intuit-branded business management solutions
designed to meet the specialized requirements of businesses in selected
industries (which we call “Verticals”) that want more complete and customizable
functionality. These currently include business solutions for the construction
industry; nonprofit organizations, universities and government agencies;
commercial and residential property managers; and wholesale durable goods
distributors.

Multi-year customer-focused strategies are also reshaping our other businesses:

•

In connection with our Consumer Tax “Right for Me” strategy, we
have introduced new functionality in our TurboTax Premier desktop
products to address the unique needs of investors, those planning for
retirement and rental property owners.

•

Under our Professional Accounting Solutions’ “Right for My Firm,
Right for My Clients” strategy, in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 we
announced QuickBooks Client Manager, a client management tool for
professional accountants that works with or independent of QuickBooks
and our Lacerte and ProSeries professional tax preparation software.

•

In fiscal 2003, we introduced Quicken Premier, which offers more
robust investment and tax planning tools. In the first quarter of
fiscal 2004, we began offering Quicken products with improved ease of
use and reduced setup and maintenance time so that customers can more
readily enjoy the benefits of complete and up-to-date financial records
in one place.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

Intuit offers products and services in six business segments: QuickBooks, Small
Business Products and Services, Consumer Tax, Professional Accounting
Solutions, Vertical Business Management Solutions and Other Businesses. Our
primary products and services are sold mainly in the United States and are
described below. For financial information about these businesses, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” and Note 11 of the financial statements. For a description of the
principal risks associated with these businesses, see “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risks that
Could Affect Future Results.”

Net revenue from our QuickBooks desktop software products represented about 15%
of our total net revenue in fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003. Net revenue from our
Consumer Tax products and services accounted for 25% to 27%



of our total net revenue in those periods. Net revenue from our Professional
Accounting Solutions products and services represented between 15% and 17% of
total net revenue in fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003. No other class of similar
products or services accounted for 10% or more of total net revenue in these
periods.

QuickBooks

Our QuickBooks product line brings extensive bookkeeping capabilities, as well
as business management tools, to small business users in an easy-to-use design
that does not require customers to be familiar with debit/credit accounting.
We offer a range of products to suit the needs of different types of small
businesses, including QuickBooks Basic, which provides accounting functionality
suitable for smaller, less complex businesses; QuickBooks Pro, which supports
up to five multiple simultaneous users; QuickBooks Premier, for small
businesses needing more advanced accounting functionality; QuickBooks
Enterprise Solutions Business Management Software, designed for businesses with
up to 250 employees; QuickBooks Premier: Accountant Edition, for accounting
professionals with multiple QuickBooks clients; QuickBooks Point of Sale, an
add-on product for retail businesses; and Premier and Enterprise versions of
QuickBooks that are customized for contractors, nonprofit agencies and
healthcare providers. As part of our Right for My Business strategy, we expect
to introduce additional versions of QuickBooks during fiscal 2004 and beyond.

Small Business Products and Services

Small Business Service Solutions.

We offer a variety of technical support
options to our QuickBooks customers through our Small Business Service
Solutions group. These include a free self-help information section on our
QuickBooks.com Web site as well as a variety of support plans that are priced
based on the level of personal assistance and response time the customer
requires.

Payroll.

Our payroll business provides solutions to help small business owners
better manage key tasks relating to their employees. Our current payroll
offerings consist primarily of two solutions:

•

Our QuickBooks Do-It-Yourself Payroll offers payroll tax tables,
forms and electronic tax payment and filing services on a subscription
basis to small businesses that prepare their own payrolls.

•

Our outsourced payroll services consist of our QuickBooks Assisted
Payroll Service and our Intuit Payroll Services Complete Payroll.
QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service is an online payroll service that
handles the back-end aspects of payroll processing, including tax
payments and filings. It is integrated with QuickBooks, which
minimizes customer data entry. Our Intuit Payroll Services Complete
Payroll provides traditional, full service payroll processing, tax
payment and check delivery services. We offer these services with
QuickBooks integration or on a standalone basis. Complete Payroll
includes the business of CBS Employer Services, Inc., which we acquired
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. It also encompasses our former
Premier Payroll Service, which we had marketed and sold jointly with
Wells Fargo Bank. In February 2003, we acquired the rights to brand
and market the offering directly to Premier Payroll Service customers
who currently use Intuit’s service.

Financial Supplies.

We offer a range of financial supplies, such as paper
checks, envelopes, invoices, deposit slips, stationery and business cards,
designed for small businesses and individuals. We also offer tax forms, tax
return presentation folders and other similar items for professional tax
preparers. Our customers can personalize many products to incorporate their
logos and use a variety of color, font and design options.

Small Business Online Services.

Our more recent QuickBooks products offer a
variety of optional business management services for an additional fee,
including QuickBooks Online Billing, which allows small businesses to bill and
receive customer payments electronically; QuickBooks Merchant Account Service,
which enables small businesses to accept credit card payments from their
customers; QuickBooks Shipping Manager, which gives small businesses access to
Federal Express® shipping and tracking information that is integrated with
QuickBooks; and the QuickBooks Business Mastercard®, which allows small
businesses to download their credit card transactions directly into QuickBooks.



Information Technology Solutions.

Our Intuit Track-It! line of products and
services offer businesses robust tools to track and support their information
technology assets and resources. As part of our “Right for My Business”
strategy, Intuit Track-It! products provide comprehensive asset management,
help desk and knowledge management solutions to businesses.

Consumer Tax

Consumer Tax Preparation Offerings.

Our TurboTax products and services are
designed to enable individuals and small business owners to prepare their own
federal and state personal and business income tax returns easily, quickly and
accurately. They are designed to be easy to use, yet sophisticated enough for
complex tax returns. We offer a range of customized desktop software products
as well as TurboTax for the Web, an interactive tax preparation service that
enables individual taxpayers to prepare their federal and state income tax
returns entirely online. One of our premium offerings, TurboTax Premier,
addresses the unique income tax needs of investors, those planning for
retirement and rental property owners. In addition, our innovative Instant
Data Entry feature enables taxpayers to import data directly into their tax
returns from Form W-2s (wages), Form 1098s (mortgage interest) and Form 1099s
(interest, dividends and stock transactions) from approximately 70
participating financial institutions and payroll service companies. This
feature saves TurboTax users significant time and increases accuracy.

Electronic Filing Services.

Through our electronic filing center, customers of
our desktop and Web-based tax preparation offerings can electronically file
their federal tax returns, as well as state returns in all states that support
electronic filing. For the 2001 and 2002 tax years, we were the exclusive
provider of online tax preparation services on the Yahoo!® Finance Tax Center,
and for the 2002 tax year our online tax services were also offered through the
websites of approximately 1,500 financial institutions, electronic retailers
and other merchants.

Intuit Tax Freedom Project.

Under the Intuit Tax Freedom Project, a
philanthropic public service initiative of the Intuit Financial Freedom
Foundation, we provide online federal income tax return preparation and
electronic filing services at no charge to lower income and other underserved
federal taxpayers. We are a member of the Free File Alliance, a consortium of
private sector companies that signed a three-year agreement with the federal
government in October 2002 under which a number of private sector companies,
rather than the federal government, are providing Web-based federal tax
preparation and filing services at no cost through voluntary public service
initiatives. We donated approximately 1.3 million federal units under this
program in fiscal 2003.

Professional Accounting Solutions

Professional Accounting Solutions provides software and services for
accountants in public practice who serve multiple clients. In addition to
solutions sold directly to accountants, Professional Accounting
Solutions also takes the leading role in
generating revenue from Intuit products sold or referred by accountants to
their small-business clients.

ProTax.

ProSeries® and Lacerte® tax preparation software products are designed
for tax professionals who prepare tax returns for their individual and business
clients. Customers can elect to license professional tax products for a flat
fee for unlimited annual use, or use them on a “pay-per-return” basis.
ProSeries and Lacerte customers can file their clients’ tax returns through
Intuit’s electronic filing services. In addition, Lacerte Tax Planner helps
tax professionals provide tax planning services to their clients, and ProSeries
Fixed Asset Manager is a time and effort-saving system for managing asset
information.

Accountant Relations.

Accountant Relations is responsible for advising
accountants on how Intuit solutions can help them better serve their clients,
manage their practices and grow their businesses. To help familiarize
accountants with Intuit products and services, Accountant Relations administers
the Intuit Accountant Training Network, which provides training and information
to accountants in more than 50 cities nationwide. Accountant Relations also
provides a collection of subscription-based membership and communication
programs, product certifications, an informational Web site and Web-based tools
for accounting professionals. Additionally, Accountant Relations drives
Intuit’s strategy for developing a network of accountants who recommend and
promote Intuit business and financial management solutions to their
small-business clients and other accountants.

Accounting Solutions.

Accounting Solutions develops offerings that help
accountants better serve their clients, manage their practices and grow their
businesses. QuickBooks Client Manager: Accountant Edition is a new client



information and task management tool designed specifically for the needs of
professional accountants. It employs a single, easy-to-use interface that
enables accountants to organize and use client information stored in other
software programs such as Lacerte and ProSeries professional tax software and
Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. QuickBooks Client
Manager is a stand-alone desktop software package that works with or
independently of QuickBooks. Intuit® EasyACCT® Professional Accounting Series
allows accountants to create financial statements and prepare tax forms (such
as W-2s and 940s) for their clients. Accounting Solutions also supports
software products from other Intuit business units that are developed or
adapted for use by accountants. For example, QuickBooks Financial Statement
Reporter enables accountants who use QuickBooks Premier: Accountant Edition
2003 or QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions Version 3.0 to easily create a
complete, professional set of financial statements.

Vertical Business Management Solutions

In fiscal 2002, we acquired four companies that enable us to provide
Intuit-branded accounting and business management solutions to customers in
selected industries, which we call “Verticals.” These vertical businesses sell
their products primarily in the United States and on a limited basis in Canada.
Reported as a single business segment, these vertical businesses include:

Quicken Software.

Our Quicken line of desktop software products helps users
organize, understand and manage their personal finances. Quicken allows
customers to reconcile bank accounts, record credit card and other
transactions, write checks, and track investments, mortgages and other assets
and liabilities. Quicken also allows customers to flag their tax-related
financial transactions and download that information into our TurboTax consumer
tax software. We offer basic and deluxe versions of the product as well as
Quicken Premier, which offers more robust investment and tax planning tools;
Quicken Premier Home and Business, which allows customers to manage both
personal and small business finances in one application; and Quicken for Mac.

Quicken.com and Other Online Services.

We provide a range of online services
that help consumers manage their financial lives. Quicken.com™ is our primary
personal finance Web site. It enables customers to automate financial
management tasks and make informed financial decisions by giving them software
tools, resources and objective information about a variety of personal finance
topics, including investing, mortgages, insurance, taxes, banking and
retirement, in a single online destination. Customers can also purchase many
Intuit products and services from the site’s electronic store. Other online
services that we offer include bill payment and online banking services through
the Quicken desktop product and a Quicken credit card. Quicken and/or
Quicken.com customers can also link directly to third-party providers of other
services, such as insurance and mortgages. In fiscal 2003, we also offered
brokerage services provided by a third party under a joint brokerage services
agreement. We expect that we will cease to offer this service during the first
or second quarter of fiscal 2004. We do not currently charge customers a fee
to access most features on Quicken.com, but we receive revenue from financial
institutions and other companies that advertise and/or sell their products or
services through links from Quicken.com.

Global Business

We have business operations in Canada and we also serve markets across Europe,
Southeast Asia and other selected locations. We have established third-party
relationships with local companies in certain countries to help us better



address specific markets. In all international markets except Canada and
Europe, we focus primarily on small business products.

Canada and the United Kingdom.

In Canada, we offer versions of QuickBooks that
we have “localized,” that is, customized to meet the unique needs of customers
in that specific international location. These include Right for My Business
versions of QuickBooks targeted at contractors, retail establishments,
professional accountants, property managers and nonprofit organizations which
we introduced during fiscal 2003; QuickTax™ consumer tax return preparation
software, including Right for Me QuickTax products for investors, those who
maintain home offices and taxpayers preparing for retirement, which we
introduced during fiscal 2003; TaxWiz consumer tax return preparation software,
which we acquired during fiscal 2003; ProFile™ Financial Application Suite
professional tax preparation products; and localized versions of Quicken. In
the United Kingdom, we also offer localized versions of QuickBooks and Quicken,
as well as the TaxCalc™ consumer tax return product.

Other Locations.

We offer localized versions of QuickBooks and Quicken
products in selected European markets through local distributors and agents.
We also offer localized versions of QuickBooks and Quicken products in
Australia, New Zealand and Singapore through a development, marketing and
distribution arrangement with Australia-based Reckon Limited.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

Historically, our desktop software products have tended to have a fairly
predictable, structured development cycle of about a year, with annual product
releases. This trend has been changing. For our small business desktop
products, we now supplement annual releases of our core QuickBooks products
with periodic releases of QuickBooks products for larger or more complex
businesses and for our industry-specific QuickBooks products. The development
timing for our service offerings, such as outsourced payroll, is determined by
business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the development
cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each particular project.
Developing tax preparation software presents unique challenges because of the
demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate annual tax law
and tax form changes within a rigid timetable. The product development cycles
for our Vertical Business Management Solutions businesses are sometimes longer
than one year for major product releases. For a description of other risks and
challenges we face relating to our product development, see “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Risks That Could Affect Future Results.”

During the past few years, we have devoted significant resources to developing
new products and services, including QuickBooks Premier, QuickBooks Premier:
Accountant Edition, QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions Business Management
Software, industry-specific versions of QuickBooks, the Intuit Developer
Network, TurboTax Premier, the Instant Data Entry feature of our TurboTax
products and services and Quicken Premier. We supplement our internal
development efforts by acquiring strategically important products and
technology from third parties, or establishing other relationships that enable
us to expand our offerings more rapidly. For example, during fiscal 2002 we
acquired four companies that provide business management products in selected
vertical industries, and we worked closely with a third-party technology
provider to develop our QuickBooks Point of Sale software. In fiscal 2003 we
acquired the technology assets underlying this software from the same provider.
In fiscal 2003 we also acquired Blue Ocean Software, a company with a product
that helps businesses manage their information technology resources and assets,
and we formed a strategic alliance with a third-party database company that
allows us to use their data management and synchronization package in our
future research and development.

We also devote resources to improving our existing products and services. For
our desktop software products, our recent development efforts have focused on
creating an easier, more seamless end-to-end customer experience, as well as
adding new features. For example, in fiscal 2003 our TurboTax product
development team invested significant resources in improving areas of the
product that customers told us weren’t easy to use or resulted in customer
support contacts. We also continue to incorporate technology in our products
and services to address customer concerns about privacy and security while
minimizing the impact on performance and ease of use. In addition, in recent
years we have developed technology that helps reduce unlicensed use of some of
our desktop software products. Our QuickBooks products require registration
after an initial trial period, and our professional tax return preparation
products and our Canadian consumer tax products contain technology that
restricts sharing of



those products. We have also developed technology to unlock marketing and
trial versions of many of our U.S. products, such as TurboTax MyCD.

During the past few years, we have made a number of improvements to our product
development process. We team technical support and product development
personnel so that we can anticipate feature usability and support issues early
in the development process. In fiscal 2003, the QuickBooks product development
team deployed a rigorous process to build customer requirements into the
development and beta processes. QuickBooks 2003 continued to evolve during the
year through a regular update and release cycle that further integrated
customer suggestions. This iterative process improved product quality and
reduced customer service and technical support call volume for our QuickBooks
2003 products. Other significant product development process improvements
include the adoption of formal software inspections in several of our large
development groups, the introduction of an enhanced software change management
process to the tax software product development organizations and the
institutionalization of software architecture as a discipline in all major
software development groups. These changes and others, such as automating our
quality assurance testing and providing electronic updates to our beta test
customers, have allowed us to shorten our development cycles and launch more
new products more quickly.

Our research and development expenses were $196.1 million in fiscal 2001,
$198.5 million in fiscal 2002 and $255.8 million in fiscal 2003. Over the next
few years, we expect that we will be faced with somewhat different product
development challenges than we have in the past. We will be developing more
versions of more complex products than ever before. In addition, these
products will offer increased ease of use, be customized for specific customer
needs and feature improved integration with other Intuit products and services
and with our internal information support systems. Our research and
development efforts will be focused on developing new products and services to
address customer needs in our more broadly defined market segments as well as
adding complementary products and services to drive additional, recurring
revenue from our core products. We strive to maintain a balance between
relatively low-risk investments that address existing customer needs and
investments in more innovative but higher-risk projects with potentially
greater returns.

MARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION

Markets

During the past two years, we have expanded both the markets that we serve and
the products and services that we offer in our target markets. Historically,
our target markets were individuals and small businesses with less than 20
employees. We continue to serve those markets with products and services such
as QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken. In addition to these markets, we are now
targeting small businesses with up to 250 employees. We are addressing this
new customer segment with a number of new products and services under the
umbrella of our Right for My Business strategy. We are introducing accounting
solutions to meet the specialized requirements of certain small businesses by
developing industry-specific versions of QuickBooks, which we call “flavors.”
We have introduced new Premier and Enterprise versions of QuickBooks for
companies that, due to their larger size or complexity, have more demanding
accounting needs. We have also introduced business solutions that go beyond
accounting software to address a wider range of business management challenges
that small businesses face.

In addition, we have acquired companies that offer robust business management
solutions to a wide range of businesses in selected industries, which we call
“Verticals.” We expect to continue expanding in these directions over the next
several years. See “Business Overview — Customer-Focused Product Strategy”
and “Products and Services,” above, for more details about our product and
service offerings.

Many of the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing
customer demands, continuous technological changes and improvements, shifting
industry standards and frequent new product introductions by competitors.
Market and industry changes can quickly render existing products and services
obsolete, so our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these
changes with new business models, updated competitive strategies, new or
enhanced products and services, alternative distribution methods and other
changes to the way we do business. For a description of other risks and
challenges we face relating to marketing, sales and distribution, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Risks That Could Affect Future Results.”



Distribution Channels

Over the past two years we have been broadening our distribution channels to
accommodate the recent expansion of the markets we serve and the range of
products and services we offer. Our goal is to make our products and services
available in a variety of ways so that each customer may choose the channel
that best meets that customer’s needs.

Direct Marketing Programs.

For our core desktop software products (QuickBooks,
TurboTax and Quicken), we use various types of direct marketing campaigns —
including mail, email and telephone solicitations, direct-response newspaper
and magazine advertising, and television and radio advertising — to generate
software orders, stimulate demand and generally maintain and increase consumer
awareness of our products. We also use workflow-integrated in-product
messaging in several of our software products to market our other related
products and services. In addition, we have recently initiated new direct
marketing programs in which we ship certain software products directly to
customers without charge. Customers electronically unlock and pay for the
products when they are ready to use them. Direct marketing campaigns are one
of the most effective ways to encourage existing customers to purchase
additional products and services, including software upgrades.

Direct Sales Channel.

Our direct sales efforts have historically focused on
generating sales of relatively inexpensive, off-the-shelf products to existing
customers through call centers. Our service offerings, such as Intuit Payroll
Services Complete Payroll, as well as our more sophisticated, higher-priced
software products, require a different approach to direct sales than our
traditional desktop software. As we have expanded our service offerings and
introduced more high-end software products and business management solutions
over the past two years, we have been enhancing our direct sales capabilities
to support revenue growth in these new areas, as well as in our core desktop
software. We are investing in technology to consolidate and improve our
management of customer contact data and order management tools across business
divisions and we are training our customer service personnel in consultative
selling techniques. We have expanded our direct sales staff and broadened its
role to include more extensive and personalized contact with existing and
potential customers. In addition, the products and services we offer through
our Vertical Business Management Solutions segment are sold primarily through
direct sales organizations. As a result of all of these factors, we expect
that direct sales will become an increasingly important source of revenue and
will increase our selling and marketing expenses over the next few years.

Many of our direct customers choose to order and/or take delivery of products
electronically through our Web sites. Electronic ordering and delivery are
generally more convenient for customers and more cost-efficient for Intuit.
Electronic delivery is available for most of our tax preparation products and
for all product updates for our tax preparation products.

Retail Distribution Channel.

We market our QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken
desktop software at retail in North America primarily through traditional
retail software outlets, computer superstores, office supply superstores, food
and drug retailers, warehouse clubs and general mass merchandisers. In
international markets, we also rely on distributors, value-added resellers and
other third parties, who sell products into the retail channel. We will
continue to evaluate new retail distribution channels as appropriate for
reaching our customers in the future.

We continue to benefit from strong relationships with a number of major North
American retailers, which allows us to minimize our dependence on any specific
retailer. We now ship most of our products directly to the individual store
locations of these major retailers and use distributors only to reach smaller
retailers. See “Manufacturing and Distribution.” We continue to aggressively
manage our inventory to optimize in-stock presence and ensure good product
placement within retail stores. In response to current retail trends, we are
also placing a greater proportion of inventory with retailers on a consignment
basis. See “Competition” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risks That Could Affect Future
Results.”

As we execute on our Right for My Business strategy, we are starting to offer
software products that are more complex and have higher prices than our
traditional retail software products. Our recent tailoring of some of these
software products to specific customer needs, including industry-specific
versions of QuickBooks, is also resulting in a greater number of Intuit
products. We produce and place in-store displays and other retail
merchandising aids



that educate customers about product functionality and benefits. However, we
continue to evaluate whether the retail channel will be an effective
distribution model for some of these higher-end offerings. See “Competition”
and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Risks That Could Affect Future Results.”

OEM Channel.

We have existing relationships with a number of personal computer
“original equipment manufacturers,” or OEMs, including Apple Computer Inc.,
Dell Computer Corporation, Gateway Inc. and Hewlett-Packard, which enable us to
generate sales of our core desktop software products in two ways. First,
certain OEMs “pre-bundle” new-user versions of certain desktop software
products on the computer systems that the OEMs sell to their customers. These
pre-bundled OEM sales are a good source of new customers and future revenues.
The second source of revenue from the OEM channel is “after-market” programs,
in which customers who are purchasing computers can select and purchase
software products at the same time.

Third-Party “Value-Added” Distribution Arrangements.

As we execute on our
Right for My Business strategy, we are supplementing our direct sales
capabilities and our retail and OEM distribution relationships with selected
third-party distribution arrangements. We believe these relationships will
enhance the growth opportunities for our higher-end product and service
offerings by allowing us to benefit from the value-added marketing and sales
expertise of these third parties. We currently have arrangements with third
parties who have specialized expertise in marketing, selling and providing
post-sale implementation services for some of our Vertical Business Management
Solutions businesses. During fiscal 2004 and beyond, we expect to continue to
optimize and support our network of third-party relationships to help increase
revenue for some of our existing higher-end products and services, as well as
for additional products and services we anticipate offering as we execute our
Right for My Business strategy.

COMPETITION

Overview

We face intense competition in almost all of our businesses, both domestically
and globally. Competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we
serve, particularly small business and consumer tax, has grown markedly over
the past few years and we expect this trend to continue. Some of our existing
competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing
resources than we do. As we implement our customer-focused strategies, we face
increased competitive threats from larger companies in more diverse markets
than we have historically faced. In addition, the competitive landscape can
shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Risks That Could Affect Future Results.”

For our QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken desktop software, we believe the most
important competitive factors are product features, ease of use, size of the
installed customer base, brand name recognition, price, product and support
quality and access to distribution channels. We believe we compete effectively
on these factors as our three principal desktop software products are the
leading products in the retail sales channel for their respective categories.
For most of our products and services other than desktop software, we believe
the most important competitive factors are features and ease of use, brand name
recognition, speed in getting new products and services to market, the ability
to distribute them effectively (through online methods or through retailers,
third party resellers and direct distribution) and quality of implementation
and support. For our service offerings such as outsourced payroll, service
reliability and scalability of operations are also important factors. We
believe we compete effectively on these factors.

Our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology
solutions similar to ours. These competitors are described below. However,
for many of our products and services, other important competitive alternatives
for customers are manual tools and processes, or general-purpose software.
Many of our new customers have used pencil and paper or software such as word
processors and spreadsheets, rather than competitors’ software and services, to
perform financial tasks. For example, many taxpayers prepared their tax
returns manually before using TurboTax; a large number of small businesses used
spreadsheets to keep their books and they processed their payroll using
spreadsheets and manually-written checks before purchasing QuickBooks; and most
of our personal finance customers tracked their finances with spreadsheets,
manually or not at all before using Quicken.



QuickBooks and Small Business Products and Services

Competitors for our small business accounting and business management offerings
include companies such as Best/Peachtree Software (which is owned by The Sage
Group PLC), Microsoft Corporation, and MYOB Group. Microsoft has several small
business offerings that compete with our small business offerings, including
Microsoft Business Solutions Small Business Manager, Microsoft Busines
Solutions CRM and Business Contact Manager for Microsoft Office Outlook® 2003.
We expect that Microsoft small business offerings will continue to compete with
our small business offerings, perhaps even more directly in the future. As we
expand the depth and breadth of our small business offerings, we face
competition from companies that are already offering industry-specific small
business solutions and business management tools and services for larger small
businesses. In addition to established competitors, other potential
competitors have expressed significant interest in providing accounting and
other products and services to small businesses.

Our payroll services compete directly with traditional payroll service
providers as well as Web-based service providers. Significant competitive
factors include distribution channels and a highly fragmented market, including
financial institutions that are developing or promoting their own payroll
services. We face direct competition in our Intuit Payroll Services Complete
Payroll business from traditional payroll services offered by a number of
companies, including ADP and Paychex, as well as hundreds of regional and local
companies. Our QuickBooks Assisted Payroll service competes directly with
companies offering Web-based payroll services, and indirectly with companies
offering other payroll solutions. Various companies also offer tax table
subscription and electronic filing services similar to our QuickBooks
Do-it-Yourself Payroll offering.

Our financial supplies business competes with a number of business forms
companies, including New England Business Service and Deluxe Business Systems,
as well as with printing services offered by franchises such as Kinko’s and
large office supply retailers such as Office Depot and Staples. Other
competitors include direct mail check printers, banks and a number of
smaller-scale Internet-based printing companies. In addition, our QuickBooks
products include some features (such as customizable invoicing and 1099 tax
form printing) that compete with our supplies products. Online bill payment
services and online payroll services with direct deposit capabilities also
offer competitive alternatives to printed checks. Significant competitive
factors for the supplies business include ordering convenience, methods of
reaching customers, product quality, speed of delivery and price. We believe
that our convenient access to our large QuickBooks and Quicken customer bases
is a significant competitive advantage for our financial supplies business.

Consumer Tax

Competition in the consumer tax preparation market is intense. Our major
domestic competitor for both desktop and Web-based consumer tax software
continues to be H&R Block, the makers of TaxCut software. In addition, a
number of smaller competitors have entered the online consumer tax preparation
market segment, and other larger competitors may enter both the desktop and
Web-based consumer tax market segments in the future. Our consumer tax
products and services also compete for customers with professional tax
preparers, particularly those with franchise operations and including those who
use our professional tax return preparation software.

We also face potential competitive challenges from publicly funded government
entities that offer electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost
to individual taxpayers. The federal government signed a three-year agreement
with the Free File Alliance in October 2002 under which a number of private
sector companies, rather than the federal government, are providing Web-based
federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost through voluntary public
service initiatives such as our Intuit Tax Freedom Project. As a member of the
Free File Alliance, we continue to actively work with others in the public
sector to advance the goals of the Free File Alliance program and to support a
successful public-private partnership. However, future administrative,
regulatory or legislative activity in this area could adversely affect us. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Risks That Could Affect Future Results.”

Professional Accounting Solutions

The professional accounting solutions and tax preparation software market
segment has many competitors. Our largest competitors in the United States are
CCH Incorporated, with its ProSystem fx product line; Kleinrock



Publishing, with its ATX product line; and the Thomson Corporation, with
its Creative Solutions and GoSystem offerings. We also have many smaller
competitors in this market segment. The professional tax market has been
highly fragmented in the past, but it has experienced some consolidation in
recent years.

Vertical Business Management Solutions

All of our Vertical Business Management Solutions businesses operate in highly
competitive and fragmented environments where no competitor has a significant
share of the market segment. We may experience pricing pressure in these
market segments because we compete with many small companies, who have fewer
resources than larger companies and are therefore more likely to focus on
near-term sales. In each of these market segments, the possibility exists that
through either consolidation within the market segment or the entry into the
market segment of new companies a significant competitor will emerge.

Other Businesses

In desktop personal finance software, the Microsoft Money product is our
primary domestic competition. We also face competition from Web-based personal
finance tracking and management tools that are available at no cost to
consumers through financial institutions and others. There are many
competitors for our other personal finance products and services. Some portal
Web sites and financial institutions also provide offerings such as Web-based
bill presentment and payment services that compete with services we offer.

In Canada, we face competition from a number of companies in the small business
arena, including Computer Associates International, Inc. and
Microsoft Corporation. Competitors for our Canadian consumer tax business include online
consumer tax products from a number of companies including Ufile as well as tax
preparation services from companies such as H&R Block and Liberty Tax. The
primary competitor for our professional tax business in Canada is CCH Canadian
Limited. In Europe, we face competition from Bhuldata (Wiso), Microsoft
and The Sage Group PLC (based in the
United Kingdom) in the small business market, as well as competition from
various Web-based accounting products. Our primary global competitor in the
personal finance arena is Microsoft.

CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT

We provide customer service and technical support by telephone, online chat,
fax, e-mail and our customer service and technical support Web sites. We have
full-time and outsourced customer service and technical support staffs, which
we supplement with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods
of peak call volumes, such as during the tax return filing season or following
a major product launch.

During the past few years, we have focused on developing support capabilities
that can supplement, or in some situations replace, telephone service and
support. For example, customers can use our Web sites to find answers to
commonly asked questions, check on the status of product orders and receive
product updates electronically. Alternative service and support methods are
less expensive for us and are often more efficient and effective for our
customers. We have completed a number of process excellence projects in our
customer service and technical support operations to improve our call capacity
forecasting, develop more flexible approaches to staffing and reduce support
call volumes and handling times. We have also outsourced a portion of the
growth in our customer service and technical support operations to several
firms located in the United States as well as to firms located outside the
United States, including India and Northern Ireland. We expect to continue to
outsource a portion of those operations in the future. We believe that both
these process improvement and outsourcing projects are critical to our ongoing
efforts to provide better service to customers at the same or lower cost.

We generally charge customers for technical support, but we do not charge for
installation problems or product defect issues. We offer free self-help
information through our technical support Web sites for our main product lines.
Support alternatives and fees vary widely by product, from self-help to online
chat to telephone support. Our customers can generally choose from a range of
support options that are priced based on the level of personal assistance and
response time they require. Our Vertical Business Management Solutions
businesses also offer product consulting and training services.



Despite our efforts to maintain continuous and reliable customer service and
technical support operations, we risk losing service at any one of our customer
contact centers and our redundancy systems could prove inadequate to provide
backup support. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Risks That Could Affect Future Results”
for additional information about our customer service and technical support
operations.

MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION

Desktop Software

The major steps involved in manufacturing desktop software are duplicating CDs,
printing boxes and related materials, and assembling and shipping the final
products. We have a manufacturing agreement with Modus Media International,
Inc. under which Modus provides substantially all outsourced manufacturing
related to our retail launches of QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken, as well as
for day-to-day retail order fulfillment after product launches. Although Modus
has operations in multiple locations that can provide redundancy if necessary,
we are in the process of centralizing the manufacturing for our retail products
in one of their facilities which is co-located with our primary retail
fulfillment vendor, Ingram Micro Logistics. We expect this arrangement to
result in lower manufacturing costs and shorter manufacturing cycle times.

During fiscal 2003, we also had an in-house facility that handled the
manufacturing and shipping for most direct sales orders. In the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2003, we signed an agreement with Arvato Services, Inc., a subsidiary
of Bertelsmann, to outsource our direct product manufacturing and distribution.
We expect this arrangement to result in expanded capabilities, service
improvements and lower manufacturing and distribution costs. We anticipate
that the transition to Arvato will be complete by the end of October 2003.

We have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has
historically not been a problem for us. Over the past few years, we have taken
steps to streamline our packaging and reduce our inventory and scrap costs in
order to generate greater profitability in our core desktop software
businesses.

Our retail product launches have become operationally more complex over the
past few years. We have evolved from shipping to a few hundred distribution
centers (with distributors delivering products to individual retail locations)
to a “direct to storefront” model in which we ship products directly to
approximately 10,000 individual retail locations. This allows us to be more
responsive to the needs of our retail accounts. We have an agreement with
Ingram Micro Logistics under which Ingram handles all logistics, fulfillment
and similar functions for our retail sales in support of this direct to
storefront initiative. During the past two years we have improved operational
rigor at various points in our supply chain. As a result, we have
significantly increased our on-time shipments and significantly reduced our
aggregate channel inventory levels. We have also reduced our dependence on
distributors or on any individual retail account. No distributor or retailer
accounted for 10% or more of our total net revenue during fiscal 2001, 2002 or
2003.

Prior to major product releases, we tend to have significant levels of backlog,
but at other times backlog is minimal and we normally ship products within a
few days of receiving an order. Because of this fluctuation in backlog, we
believe that backlog is not a reliable predictor of our future desktop software
sales.

Internet-based Products and Services

Intuit’s data centers house most of the systems, networks and databases
required to operate and deliver our Internet-based products and services,
including QuickBooks Online Edition, QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service,
TurboTax for the Web, electronic tax filing and Quicken.com. Through our data
centers, we connect customers to products and services, and we store the vast
amount of data that represents the content on our Web sites. Our data centers
consist of approximately 3,000 servers and 500 databases located in several
sites across the United States. In an effort to reduce unavailability, or
“down time,” for our Internet-based products and services, we generally follow
industry-standard practices for creating a fault-tolerant environment, but we
do not have complete redundancy. We also have a major initiative underway to
provide back-up processing capabilities that are designed to protect us



against site-related disasters. Despite our efforts to maintain continuous and
reliable server operations, we occasionally experience unplanned outages or
technical difficulties. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Risks That Could Affect Future Results.”

PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION

Customers are concerned about the privacy and security of the personal
information they provide to companies. This concern applies to information
they provide in connection with Internet-based products and services, as well
as information they provide through more traditional methods, such as product
registration cards. In addition to customer concerns, we are subject to
various federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and
security. We are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to
telemarketing activities. Additional laws in both areas are likely to be
passed in the future, which could result in significant limitations on the ways
in which we can communicate with our customers and significantly increase our
compliance costs. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Risks That Could Affect Future Results.”

We have established guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers are
aware of, and can control, how we use information about them. All
publicly-accessible, Intuit-owned and operated consumer Web sites at which
customer data is collected (including QuickBooks.com, TurboTax.com and
Quicken.com) have been certified by TRUSTe, an independent, non-profit privacy
organization that operates a Web site certification program to alleviate users’
concerns about online privacy. Each of our Web sites, as well as our software
products, has a privacy statement providing notice to customers of our privacy
practices, as well as providing them the opportunity to furnish instructions
with respect to use of their data.

To address security concerns, we use industry-standard security safeguards to
help protect the information customers give to us from loss, misuse and
unauthorized alteration. Whenever customers transmit sensitive information,
such as a credit card number or tax return data, to us through our Web site, we
provide them access to our servers that allow encryption of the information as
it is transmitted to us. We work to protect personally identifiable
information stored on the Web site’s servers from unauthorized access using
commercially available computer security products, such as firewalls, as well
as internally developed security procedures and practices.

We believe privacy and security issues pose a significant risk to Intuit and
other companies, especially companies doing business over the Internet.
Although we have made significant efforts to address customer concerns through
our business practices, during the past few years we have faced lawsuits and
negative publicity relating to privacy issues. Our response to these
allegations has been that we do not share any personally identifiable
information except as disclosed in our privacy policies. A major breach of
customer privacy or security, even by another company, could have serious
consequences for our businesses. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risks That Could Affect Future
Results” and “Legal Proceedings.”

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

We offer certain products and services, such as our payroll offerings, which
are subject to special regulatory requirements. As we expand our small
business offerings, we may become subject to additional government regulation,
particularly in the areas of retirement planning and other employer services.
We continually analyze new business opportunities, and new businesses that we
pursue may require additional costs for regulatory compliance.

Current government regulation poses a number of risks to us, including
potential liability to customers and/or penalties and sanctions by government
regulators. Future regulation could hamper the growth of our businesses. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Risks That Could Affect Future Results.”



INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws,
and employee and third-party nondisclosure and license agreements to protect
our software products and other proprietary technology. We do not own all of
the software and other technologies used in our products and services, but we
have the licenses from third parties that we believe are necessary and
appropriate for using that technology in our current products.

We consider our principal trademarks (including Intuit, QuickBooks, TurboTax
and Quicken) to be important assets and have registered these and other
trademarks and service marks in the United States and many foreign countries.
The initial duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country
and is 10 years in the United States. Most registrations can be renewed
perpetually at 10-year intervals.

We face a number of risks relating to our intellectual property, including
persistent piracy of our desktop software products through unauthorized use and
copying. Although we continue to evaluate technology solutions to piracy, as
well as increase our civil and criminal enforcements efforts, we expect piracy
to be a persistent problem. We also face the risk of third parties claiming
that our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights, and
we face risks to the value of our brands when we grant trademark licenses to
third parties. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Risks That Could Affect Future Results.”

EMPLOYEES

As of August 31, 2003, we had approximately 6,700 employees located primarily
in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. We believe our future
success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified
employees in all areas of our business. We do not currently have any
collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and we believe employee
relations are generally good. Although we have employment-related agreements
with a number of key employees, these agreements do not guarantee continued
service. We believe we offer competitive compensation and a good working
environment. We were selected as one of

Fortune

magazine’s “100 Best Companies
to Work For” in April 2002 and 2003. However, we face intense competition for
qualified employees, and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting
and retention.

ITEM 2

PROPERTIES

Our principal offices and corporate headquarters are located in Mountain View,
California. Our Mountain View facilities consist of approximately 485,000
square feet under leases that have expiration dates ranging from 2003 to 2015
with two five-year renewal options on about 420,000 of those square feet. We
maintain a number of leased facilities in San Diego, California, consisting of
approximately 390,000 square feet. We use these facilities for general office
space, a data center and a manufacturing and distribution center. The San
Diego leases have expiration dates ranging from 2003 through 2007 and renewal
options on about 325,000 of the total square feet that range from two one-year
options to two five-year options. We lease approximately 190,000 square feet
in Tucson, Arizona, where our primary customer call center is located, under
leases that have expiration dates ranging from 2004 to 2009 and six six-month
renewal options. In Plano, Texas we lease approximately 165,000 square feet of
space under a lease that expires in 2011 with two five-year renewal options.
Our Professional Accounting Solutions group is headquartered in Plano, and we
also have a data center there. In Reno, Nevada, the headquarters for our
payroll business, we lease approximately 140,000 square feet under leases that
have expiration dates ranging from 2003 to 2009 and two five-year renewal
options. Our four Vertical Business Management Solutions businesses lease
their principal facilities in Santa Rosa, California; Denver, Colorado;
Boulder, Colorado; Shelton, Connecticut; West Yarmouth, Massachusetts; and
Beachwood, Ohio. They also lease sales and service offices throughout the
United States and in selected international locations. We lease or own
facilities in a number of other domestic locations and in Canada and the United
Kingdom. We believe our facilities are adequate for our current and near-term
needs, and that we will be able to locate additional facilities as needed. See
Note 13 of the financial statements for more information about our lease
commitments.



ITEM 3

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On March 3, 2000, a class action lawsuit, Bruce v. Intuit Inc., was filed in
the United States District Court, Central District of California, Eastern
Division. Two virtually identical lawsuits were later filed: Rubin v. Intuit
Inc., was filed on March 8, 2000 in the United States District Court, Southern
District of New York and Newby v. Intuit Inc. was filed on April 27, 2000, in
the United States District Court, Central District of California, Eastern
Division. The Rubin case was dismissed on November 19, 2001. The Bruce and
Newby lawsuits were consolidated into one lawsuit, In re Intuit Privacy
Litigation, filed on July 28, 2000 in the United States District Court, Central
District of California, Eastern Division. Following Intuit’s successful motion
to dismiss several of the claims, an amended complaint was filed on May 2,
2001. A similar lawsuit, Almanza v. Intuit Inc. was filed on March 22, 2000 in
the Superior Court of the State of California, San Bernardino County, Rancho
Cucamonga Division. An amended complaint in the Almanza suit was filed on
October 26, 2000. These purported class actions alleged violations of various
federal and California statutes and common law claims for invasion of privacy
based upon the alleged intentional disclosure to third parties of personal and
private customer information entered at Intuit’s Quicken.com Web site. The
complaints sought injunctive relief, orders to disgorge profits related to the
alleged acts, and statutory and other damages. On January 6, 2003, a
settlement between Intuit and the plaintiffs’ counsel in all of the remaining
cases was preliminarily approved by the federal court with a final approval
hearing scheduled for June 2003. The settlement was approved by the federal
court in June 2003 and this and a related litigation in state court have been
dismissed. The settlement terms are not material to Intuit.

Leonard Knable et al. v. Intuit Inc. was filed in Los Angeles County Superior
Court on February 24, 2003. The lawsuit alleges various claims for unfair
practices and deceptive and misleading advertising, fraud and deceit and
product liability, on behalf of a purported class. The allegations are based
on the design and operation of the product activation feature in Intuit’s
TurboTax 2002 for Windows desktop software and Intuit’s representations and
disclosures about product activation. The complaint seeks disgorgement of
revenue from the sale of the product, compensatory and punitive damages,
injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees and costs. Discovery has been served by
all parties. Intuit has filed a motion to dismiss the causes of action in the
complaint. Discovery is stayed pending the court’s decision on this motion.

On September 17, 2003, Muriel Siebert

& Co., Inc. v. Intuit Inc. was filed in the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York. The lawsuit alleges various
claims for breach of contract, breach of express and implied
covenants of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty,
misrepresentation and/or fraud, and promissory estoppel. The
allegations relate to Quicken Brokerage powered by Siebert, a
strategic alliance between the two companies. The complaint seeks
compensatory, punitive, and other damages. Intuit has not been served
with the complaint. Intuit believes this lawsuit is without merit and
intends to defend the litigation vigorously.

Intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings, as well as demands,
claims and threatened litigation, that arise in the normal course of our
business. We currently believe that the ultimate amount of liability, if any,
for any pending claims of any type (either alone or combined) will not
materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
However, the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain, and either
unfavorable or favorable outcomes could have a material negative impact.
Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on Intuit because

ITEM 6

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following table shows selected consolidated financial information for
Intuit for the past five fiscal years. The comparability of the information is
affected by a variety of factors, including acquisitions and dispositions of
businesses, gains and losses related to marketable securities and other
investments and acqusition-related charges. We adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”

on August 1, 2002 and stopped amortizing goodwill at that date. Fiscal years
prior to fiscal 2003 reflect significant goodwill amortization charges.

In fiscal 2002 we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage business and in fiscal 2003
we sold our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK. We accounted for the
sales of these businesses as discontinued operations and, accordingly, we have
reclassified the selected financial data for all periods presented to reflect
Quicken Loans and Intuit KK as discontinued operations. To better understand
the information in the table, investors should read “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7, and

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

NOTE: For a more complete understanding of our financial condition and results
of operations, and some of the risks that could affect future results, see
“Risks That Could Affect Future Results” in this Item 7. This section should
also be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and
related Notes in Item 8. As discussed below, we sold our Quicken Loans
mortgage business in July 2002 and our Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, in
February 2003 and accounted for the sales of these businesses as discontinued
operations. Accordingly, we have reclassified our financial statements for all
periods prior to the sales to reflect these businesses as discontinued
operations. Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion pertains only to
our continuing operations.

Overview

Intuit’s Mission.

Our mission is to transform the way people run their
businesses and manage their financial lives. Our products and services fall
into the following principal categories: QuickBooks® small business accounting
and business management solutions; small business products and services that
include payroll, financial supplies, technical support and information
technology management solutions; TurboTax® consumer tax products and services;
ProSeries® and Lacerte® professional tax products and services; Intuit-branded
business management solutions designed to meet the specialized requirements of
businesses in selected industries (which we call “Verticals”); and our other
businesses, which consist primarily of Quicken® personal finance products and
services and our Canadian business. See “

Net Revenue

” below and Note 11 of the
financial statements for more information about our business segments.

Expanding Product and Service Offerings.

During the last year, we have
expanded the number and complexity of the products and services that we offer.
Under our Right for My Business strategy, we are introducing solutions to meet
the specialized requirements of certain small businesses by developing
industry-specific versions of QuickBooks, which we call “flavors”. We have
introduced new versions of QuickBooks for companies that, due to their larger
size or complexity, have more demanding accounting needs. We have also
introduced business solutions that go beyond accounting software to address a
wider range of business management challenges that small businesses face. In
addition, we are acquiring companies that offer robust business management
solutions to businesses in selected vertical industries. We expect to continue
to expand in these directions over the next several years.

Evolving Distribution Channels.

We have been expanding our distribution
channels to accommodate the expansion of the markets we serve and the range of
products and services we offer our target customers. In the retail channel, we
are selling an increasing proportion of our software products directly to a
variety of retailers rather than through a few major distributors. As we offer
software products that are more complex and higher priced than our traditional
retail software products, we expect that direct sales will become an
increasingly important source of revenue and new customers. Finally, as we add
products and services that are complementary to our core products, we are
focusing on strengthening our cross-selling capabilities. We expect that these
increased capabilities will allow us to generate additional revenue from our
existing customers, particularly our small business customers.



Seasonality.

Our tax businesses, and to a lesser extent our small business
products and services, are highly seasonal. Sales of tax preparation products
and services are heavily concentrated in the period from November through
April. These seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually
highest during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30.
Since fiscal 2000, we have recognized an increasing portion of our Consumer Tax
annual revenue during the third quarter compared to the second quarter, and
that trend continued during fiscal 2003. We typically report losses in our
first and fourth quarters ending October 31 and July 31 when revenue from our
tax businesses is minimal, while operating expenses to develop new products and
services continue at relatively consistent levels.

Impact of Acquisitions.

Our acquisitions of businesses and assets have
affected the comparability of our results. During the past three fiscal years,
we have completed several acquisitions, which have affected the comparability
of revenue and operating results for those years. The amortization and
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets we have acquired in
connection with acquisitions has also had a significant impact on our operating
results, and on the comparability of results for those years. During fiscal
2001 and 2002, we recorded amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets
and other acquisition-related charges of $247.8 million and $181.4 million,
which included impairment charges of $78.7 million and $22.0 million. Starting
with the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we no longer amortize goodwill in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

As a result, our acquisition-related
charges decreased significantly during fiscal 2003, to $33.9 million. There
were no impairment charges in fiscal 2003. It is possible that in the future
we may incur impairment charges related to existing goodwill, as well as to
goodwill arising out of future acquisitions. At July 31, 2003, we had $591.1
million in goodwill and $125.4 million in intangible assets on our balance
sheet. See Notes 1 and 4 of the financial statements for more information
regarding our goodwill and intangible assets and the impact of impairment
charges on our reported net income or loss.

Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and
judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue, operating
income or loss and net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain
assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. We believe that the estimates,
assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below
have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider
these to be our critical accounting policies. Senior management has discussed
the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their
disclosure in this Report with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

•

Net Revenue — Revenue Recognition.

Intuit derives revenues from
the sale of packaged software products, product support, professional
services, outsourced payroll services and multiple element arrangements
that may include any combination of these items. We follow the
appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue. See
Note 1 of the financial statements,

“Net Revenue.”

We generally
recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we
have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed
or determinable and collectibility is probable. However, determining
whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often
involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact
on the timing and amount of revenue we report. For example, for
multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in
order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must
deliver, to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the
functionality of the delivered products and services, to determine
whether vendor-specific evidence of fair value exists for each
undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has
been delivered. If we were to change any of these assumptions or
judgments, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount
of revenue that we report in a particular period. Amounts invoiced
relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are
reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized as
the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied.

•

Net Revenue — Return and Rebate Reserves.

As part of our revenue
recognition policy, we estimate future product returns and rebate
payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale
based on these estimates. Our return policy allows distributors and
retailers, subject to certain contractual limitations, to return
purchased products. For product returns reserves, we consider such
factors as the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel,
historical return rates for prior releases of the







Total Net Revenue

The table below shows total net revenue and percentage of total net revenue for
each of our business segments for fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003. We have
reclassified prior year financial information to conform to the current year
presentation for comparability. See Note 11 of the financial statements for
additional information about our business segments.



Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002.

Fiscal 2003 total net revenue of $1,650.7
million represented a 26% increase over fiscal 2002 total net revenue. The
increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth of 35% in our Small
Business Products and Services segment, 24% in our QuickBooks segment and 20%
in our Consumer Tax segment. Our Vertical Business Management Solutions
segment, which is comprised primarily of companies we acquired in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2002, contributed $94.8 million to
net revenue compared to $14.2 million in fiscal 2002. Net revenue for our
Professional Accounting Solutions segment also grew 8%. Net revenue for our
Other Businesses segment increased only 2%, due primarily to lack of growth in
the personal finance desktop software category and continuing industry-wide
slowness in spending by purchasers of Internet advertising.

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001.

Fiscal 2002 total net revenue of $1,312.2
million represented an increase of 20% over fiscal 2001 total net revenue. The
increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth of 29% in our Consumer Tax
segment, 25% in our Professional Accounting Solutions segment, 19% in our
QuickBooks segment and 16% in our Small Business Products and Services segment.
Other Businesses net revenue was flat in fiscal 2002, reflecting a decrease in
Internet advertising revenue and lower sales of Quicken due to the continuing
overall decline in the personal finance desktop software category, offset by
growth in Canada.

Total Net Revenue by Business Segment

The following net revenue discussion is categorized by our reportable business
segments, which reflect how we manage our operations and how our chief
operating decision maker views results. In fiscal 2003, we revised our
reportable segments to reflect the way we currently manage and view our
businesses. We determined that the QuickBooks product component of our fiscal
2002 Small Business segment was a separate reportable segment and we combined
our fiscal 2002 Employer Services segment with the balance of Small Business to
arrive at the fiscal 2003 segment called Small Business Products and Services.
We began reporting Vertical Business Management Solutions (formerly Small
Business Verticals) as a separate segment in fiscal 2003. Finally, we combined
our fiscal 2002 Personal Finance and Global Business segments to arrive at the
fiscal 2003 segment called Other Businesses. We have reclassified previously
reported fiscal 2002 and 2001 segment results to conform to the fiscal 2003
presentation. See Note 11 of the financial statements for additional
information about our reportable segments.

QuickBooks

QuickBooks product revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks desktop
software products. QuickBooks service revenue is derived from QuickBooks
Online Edition.

Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002.

QuickBooks total net revenue increased
24% in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. The revenue increase reflected
higher unit sales as well as higher average selling prices driven by the
introduction of certain higher-priced QuickBooks products and a shift in
revenue mix toward those products. The products include QuickBooks Premier:
Accountant Edition for accounting professionals; QuickBooks Enterprise
Solutions for businesses with up to 250 employees; QuickBooks Point of Sale for
retail businesses; and three industry-specific versions of QuickBooks. We
launched these products at the end of fiscal 2002 and during fiscal 2003 as
part of our Right for My Business strategy, and they have significantly higher
average selling prices than our original QuickBooks Basic and QuickBooks Pro
products. We expect to introduce additional versions of QuickBooks in fiscal
2004.

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001.

QuickBooks total net revenue increased
19% in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. The increase in QuickBooks product
revenue reflected higher average selling prices driven primarily by the
November 2001 launch of our higher-priced QuickBooks Premier products, as well
as higher unit sales. The volume increase was driven by strong upgrade sales,
which we believe were due in part to our decision to discontinue technical
support and tax table services during calendar 2002 for customers using certain
older versions of QuickBooks. We believe that the availability of a range of
third-party offerings from the Intuit Developer Network to QuickBooks 2002
customers may also have contributed to the stronger upgrade sales.



Small Business Products and Services

Small Business Products and Services product revenue is comprised of QuickBooks
Do-It-Yourself Payroll, which offers payroll tax tables, forms and electronic
tax payment and filing services on a subscription basis to small businesses
that prepare their own payrolls; financial supplies such as paper checks,
envelopes and invoices; and information technology management software.
Service revenue for this segment is derived primarily from outsourced payroll
services and from QuickBooks support plans. Other revenue for this segment
consists primarily of royalties from small business online services and
interest earned on customer payroll deposits.

Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002.

Small Business Products and Services
total net revenue grew 35% in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. Payroll
product revenue increased due to growth in the customer base and higher average
selling prices driven by price increases. Financial supplies product revenue
increased slightly during the year. Outsourced payroll service revenue
increased due in large part to our acquisition of CBS Employer Services, Inc.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. QuickBooks support revenue grew due to
an increase in the number of support plans sold and continued strength in the
higher-priced support plans for higher-end QuickBooks products introduced in
late fiscal 2002 and in fiscal 2003. Finally, our acquisition of Intuit
Information Technology Solutions, formerly Blue Ocean Software, Inc., in the
first quarter of fiscal 2003 also contributed to revenue growth for this
segment.

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001.

Small Business Products and Services
total net revenue increased 16% in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001.
Payroll product revenue increased, reflecting higher average selling prices and
growth in the customer base. Financial supplies product revenue increased
slightly during the year. Outsourced payroll service revenue increased,
reflecting growth in QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service due to higher average
selling prices and growth in the customer base; higher Premier payroll service
revenue; and revenue from our fourth quarter fiscal 2002 acquisition of CBS
Employer Services, Inc. Fiscal 2002 service revenue growth in this segment
also reflected strong results from QuickBooks support plans. In August 2001,
we began offering several higher-end support plans, which resulted in
significantly higher average selling prices that more than offset declines in
volume compared to fiscal 2001. Revenue growth in this segment was partially
offset by a decline in QuickBooks Internet Gateway other revenue.

Consumer Tax

Consumer Tax product revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax federal and
state consumer desktop tax return preparation software. Consumer Tax service
revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax for the Web online tax return
preparation services and consumer electronic filing services. Paid Web units
exclude tax filing units that we donate under the Intuit Tax Freedom Project.

Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002.

Consumer Tax total net revenue increased
20% in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. Total paid federal units increased
12% over fiscal 2002. Desktop revenue increased due to growth in paid federal
units and higher average selling prices for federal tax offerings with enhanced
functionality. TurboTax for the Web revenue increased due to paid federal unit
growth and higher average selling prices. Electronic filing revenue was up due
to higher federal desktop unit sales and higher average state electronic filing
prices.

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001.

Consumer Tax total net revenue increased
29% in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. Revenue from TurboTax desktop
products was up due primarily to higher average selling prices resulting from
the introduction of a higher-priced premium product. Revenue from TurboTax for
the Web was strong in fiscal 2002, reflecting a significant increase in the mix
of higher-end service offerings as well as 84% unit growth. Electronic filing
units and revenue also contributed to the year-over-year growth.

Professional Accounting Solutions

Professional Accounting Solutions product revenue is derived primarily from
ProSeries and Lacerte professional tax preparation software products.
Professional Accounting Solutions service revenue is derived primarily from
electronic filing and training services.



Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002.

Total net revenue from our professional
tax preparation products and services increased 8% in fiscal 2003 compared to
fiscal 2002. Product revenue grew 9% in fiscal 2003 due to price increases
related to product enhancements, new customer acquisition initiatives and
successful cross-sell efforts to the existing tax client base. Renewal rates
for our existing customer base remained strong during fiscal 2003.

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001.

Total net revenue from our professional
tax preparation products and services increased 25% in fiscal 2002 compared to
fiscal 2001. Approximately $21.0 million or 47% of the growth compared to
fiscal 2001 resulted from our acquisition of Tax and Accounting Software
Corporation in April 2001. Higher revenue from electronic filing services was
also a significant factor in the increase. In addition, new customer
acquisition and higher average selling prices for our ProSeries and Lacerte
unlimited-use products contributed to the revenue growth. Renewal rates for
our existing customer base remained strong during fiscal 2002.

Vertical Business Management Solutions

Vertical Business Management Solutions (“VBMS”) revenue is derived from four
businesses that we acquired in fiscal 2002 that provide business management
solutions for companies in selected industries. Those businesses are Intuit
Distribution Management Solutions, whose Intuit Eclipse™ line of products and
services offers business management software for the wholesale durable goods
industry; MRI Real Estate Solutions, whose Intuit MRI line of products and
services provides business management software solutions for commercial and
residential property managers; Intuit Construction Business Solutions, whose
Intuit MasterBuilder™ line of products and services provides business
management solutions for the construction industry; and Intuit Public Sector
Solutions, whose Intuit Fundware™ line of products and services offers
accounting and business management software solutions for nonprofit
organizations, universities and government agencies. VBMS product revenue is
derived from business management software for these vertical industries. VBMS
service revenue consists primarily of technical support, consulting and
training services.

Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002.

Our vertical businesses contributed $94.8
million in revenue for fiscal 2003 compared to $14.2 million in fiscal 2002.
Three of the four acquisitions were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2002. As a result, revenue from this segment was not significant in fiscal
2002 and consisted primarily of revenue generated by Intuit Construction
Business Solutions, which we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2002.

Other Businesses

Other Businesses consist primarily of Personal Finance and Canada. Personal
Finance product revenue is derived primarily from Quicken desktop software
products. Personal Finance service revenue is nominal while other revenue
consists of fees from consumer online transactions and Quicken.com advertising
revenue. In Canada, product revenue is derived primarily from localized
versions of QuickBooks and Quicken as well as QuickTax and TaxWiz consumer
desktop tax return preparation software and ProFile professional tax
preparation products. Service revenue in Canada consists primarily of revenue
from software maintenance contracts sold with QuickBooks.

Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002.

Other Businesses total net revenue
increased 2% in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. Personal Finance product
revenue decreased due to lack of growth in the market for personal finance
desktop software and slow consumer spending. Lower unit sales for all Quicken
products more than offset higher average selling prices for Quicken Premier and
Quicken Home and Business. Personal Finance other revenue also decreased due
to continuing slowness in Internet advertising and our exit from certain online
businesses in fiscal 2002.

Total net revenue from Canada grew in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002, due
partially to slightly higher revenue from QuickTax. Higher average selling
prices and higher unit sales for this product were fueled by the second quarter
fiscal 2003 introduction of Right for Me consumer tax products targeted at
taxpayers who maintain home offices or who are preparing for retirement. Our
new TaxWiz consumer tax preparation software also contributed to fiscal 2003
revenue growth. Canadian QuickBooks revenue for fiscal 2003 declined due to
lack of growth in the software category and decreases in the level of inventory
purchasing by retailers. The impact of these trends was partially offset by
the introduction of several Right for My Business versions of QuickBooks in
Canada in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2003.



Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001.

Other Businesses total net revenue was
flat in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. Personal Finance total net
revenue decreased due primarily to a decline in revenue from Quicken desktop
products and lower Quicken.com revenue. Solid growth in our online
transactions business partially offset these declines. The decrease in Quicken
revenue reflected the continuing overall decline in the personal finance
desktop software category. Lower Quicken.com advertising revenue reflected the
industry-wide decline in spending by purchasers of Internet advertising.

Revenue from Canada increased in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. This
reflected strong tax season results for QuickTax, due in part to the
preliminary success of our efforts to reduce unauthorized sharing of desktop
software. Canadian consumer tax revenue growth was partially offset by modest
revenue declines for QuickBooks and Quicken.

There are four components of our cost of revenue: (1) cost of product revenue,
which includes the direct cost of manufacturing and shipping our software
products; (2) cost of service revenue, which reflects direct costs associated
with providing services, including data center costs relating to delivering
Internet-based services; (3) cost of other revenue, which includes costs
associated with generating advertising and marketing and online transactions
revenue; and (4) amortization of purchased software, which represents the cost
of amortizing products we obtained through acquisitions over their useful
lives.

Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002.

Cost of product revenue as a percentage
of product revenue decreased to 15% in fiscal 2003 from 16% in fiscal 2002.
This was primarily due to strong sales of our new higher-priced QuickBooks
products, which have higher margins per unit. We also continued to improve the
packaging design process for certain products and streamline some of our
manufacturing processes during fiscal 2003. This enabled us to reduce the
per-unit materials, manufacturing and shipping costs for our shrink-wrap
software products. We expect to implement further efficiencies in our
manufacturing processes during fiscal 2004. We also expect that the mix shift
toward our higher-priced, higher-margin QuickBooks products will continue and
that growth rates for our higher-priced QuickBooks products will exceed those
for our lower-priced products.

Cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased to 35% in
fiscal 2003 from 39% in fiscal 2002. This decrease was primarily attributable
to the growth in our outsourced payroll business during fiscal 2003. As this
business grows, we are leveraging our historical investments in data center and
other infrastructure to reduce the unit cost and improve the profitability of
outsourced payroll services. In addition, starting in the third quarter of
fiscal 2003 we no longer paid royalties to Wells Fargo Bank for our Premier
payroll service. Although we now amortize the $29.2 million purchase price of
the right to market to this customer base to cost of service revenue, the
amortization expense is less than the royalties that would have been incurred
under the old agreement. We expect continued growth in our outsourced payroll
business and a full year of the lower amortization expense for our Premier
payroll service during fiscal 2004.



Cost of other revenue as a percentage of other revenue decreased to 30% in
fiscal 2003 from 40% in fiscal 2002. In the first quarter of fiscal 2002, we
moved a large number of servers that supported our Quicken.com Web site from an
external hosting company to our own data center and streamlined the
infrastructure. Over time, this led to decreased cost of other revenue for
this business.

We recorded a $5.2 million impairment charge for intangible assets related to
Quicken.com advertising revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2002.
Adjusting for this impairment charge, amortization of purchased software
increased $6.6 million in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. The increase
was a result of additional amortization for intangible assets we purchased in
connection with the acquisitions we completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2002 and the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Amortization of purchased software
expense may increase in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 as a result of
future acquisitions and impairment charges, which are not possible to predict.

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001.

Cost of product revenue as a percentage
of product revenue decreased to 16% in fiscal 2002 from 17% in fiscal 2001. We
lowered our per-unit materials, manufacturing and shipping costs for our
shrink-wrap software products, resulting in significant cost savings. These
savings were nearly offset by increased costs associated with improving our
product distribution function. During the first quarter of fiscal 2002, we
established a new third-party retail distribution relationship for our
shrink-wrap software products. This distribution relationship enabled us to
ship a larger percentage of our products directly to individual retail stores
and allowed us to provide inventory to our retail customers on a more timely
basis. By providing better service to our retailers, we reduced product
returns and related costs.

Cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased to 39% in
fiscal 2002 from 50% in fiscal 2001. This decrease was attributable primarily
to our payroll and Web-based tax businesses, which experienced significant
revenue growth with relatively fixed cost bases in fiscal 2002.

Cost of other revenue as a percentage of other revenue increased to 40% in
fiscal 2002 compared to 35% in fiscal 2001. This increase was primarily due to
increased data center costs related to our Personal Finance segment’s online
transaction business.

Amortization of purchased software decreased $2.5 million in fiscal 2002
compared to fiscal 2001. This reflected lower amortization expense in the
second half of fiscal 2002 that resulted from a lower base of assets to be
amortized. This decline was partially offset by impairment charges for certain
purchased software assets that were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal
2002, which caused the decrease in the base of assets.

Customer Service and Technical Support

Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002.

Customer service and technical support
expenses were 11% of total net revenue in fiscal 2003 compared to 13% in fiscal
2002. We continued to increase our efficiency in fiscal 2003 by improving our
utilization of internal customer service representatives and by outsourcing
some of our seasonal call center capabilities. We also increased the
proportion of customer service and technical support we provide through less
expensive methods such as Web sites, online chat, email and other electronic
means. In fiscal 2003 we benefited from the fiscal 2002 implementation of a
number of successful process excellence initiatives that reduced costs while
maintaining or increasing service levels. These benefits were partially offset
by increased demand for customer service and technical support due to the
increasing complexity of our products and to customer questions relating to
product activation technology in TurboTax desktop products. We discontinued
product activation in certain TurboTax products after the 2002 tax season.

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001.

Customer service and technical support
expenses were 13% of total net revenue in fiscal 2002 and 2001. We improved
our efficiency in fiscal 2002 by increasing the proportion of customer service
and technical support we provide through less expensive methods such as Web
sites, online chat, email and other electronic means. We also implemented a
number of successful process excellence initiatives that reduced costs while
maintaining or increasing service levels. However, these benefits were offset
by higher direct sales and support costs associated with converting the
customers of Tax Accounting and Software Company, a company that we acquired in
April 2001, to our ProSeries and Lacerte professional tax products, and by
increased demand for customer service and technical support due to our growing
customer base.



Selling and Marketing

Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002.

Selling and marketing expenses were 20%
of total net revenue in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2003, we
continued to expand our small business marketing programs to support the Right
for My Business strategy announced in fiscal 2002. Marketing expenses for
certain new QuickBooks products with advanced functionality totaled
approximately $12.0 million in fiscal 2003, compared to about $2.0 million in
marketing expenses for those products in fiscal 2002. Marketing expenses for
fiscal 2003 also increased compared to fiscal 2002 as we expanded marketing
programs to support our Consumer Tax Right for Me strategy, which we introduced
during the 2002 tax season. In addition, we added selling and marketing
expenses for the companies we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and
the first quarter of fiscal 2003. These increases were partially offset by a
decrease in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenue
for our payroll business due to significant revenue growth in that segment.

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001.

Selling and marketing expenses were 20%
of total net revenue in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2002, selling
and marketing expenses increased as we expanded our small business marketing
programs to support the Right for My Business strategy announced in September
2001. We also incurred additional marketing expenses for our Intuit
Construction Business Solutions products, which we acquired in November 2001.
These increases were partially offset by a decrease in selling and marketing
expenses as a percentage of total net revenue for our payroll business due to
significant revenue growth in that segment.

Research and Development

Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002.

Research and development expenses were
15% of total net revenue in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2003,
we continued to invest in new products and enhanced functionality for existing
products, particularly those that support our small business Right for My
Business and Consumer Tax Right for Me strategies. We also added research and
development expenses for the companies we acquired in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2002 and the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Offsetting these increases,
we continued to benefit from improvements in our development process that
resulted in shorter development times and higher quality in many of our
products.

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001.

During fiscal 2002, we increased research
and development spending in some of our highest-growth businesses —
QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Professional Accounting Solutions — by
approximately 10%. In particular, we continued to invest in our Right for My
Business strategy, including new QuickBooks Premier, Enterprise and Point of
Sale products launched in the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the Intuit
Developer Network and other new products that we expected to introduce in
fiscal 2003. At the same time, we significantly decreased or stopped spending
in less strategic areas and discontinued product lines. We also benefited from
improvements in our development process that resulted in shorter development
times and higher quality for our new QuickBooks products. The net result was
that research and development expenses in fiscal 2002 declined as a percentage
of total net revenue to 15% of total net revenue compared to 18% in fiscal
2001.

General and Administrative

Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002.

General and administrative expenses were
9% of total net revenue in fiscal 2003 compared to 8% in fiscal 2002. General
and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002
primarily due to acquisition integration costs; the addition of general and
administrative expenses for the companies we acquired in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2002 and the first quarter of fiscal 2003; and higher insurance costs.
General and administrative expenses did not include labor costs capitalized in
connection with internal use software projects of $18.0 million in fiscal 2003
and $12.9 million in fiscal 2002.

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001.

General and administrative expenses were
8% of total net revenue in fiscal 2002 compared to 9% in fiscal 2001. We
experienced increased directors’ and officers’ liability insurance costs and
costs associated with integrating our acquisitions of Intuit Construction
Business Solutions (formerly OMware, Inc.) in November 2001 and
EmployeeMatters, Inc. in December 2000. These increases were partially offset
by decreases in bad debt charges in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001.



Charge for Purchased Research and Development

In connection with certain acquisitions and with the assistance of third-party
appraisers, we determine the value of in-process projects under development for
which technological feasibility has not been established. The value of each
project is determined by estimating the costs to develop the in-process
technology into a commercially feasible product, estimating the net cash flows
we believe would result from the product and discounting these net cash flows
back to their present value. The resulting amount is recorded as a charge for
purchased research and development when we acquire certain new businesses.

In fiscal 2003, we recorded charges
totaling $8.9 million for purchased research and
development, primarily in connection with our acquisition of Blue Ocean Software, Inc.
(now Intuit Information Technology Solutions). In fiscal 2002, we recorded a
charge of $2.2 million for purchased research and development as a result of
our acquisition of Management Reports, Inc. (now MRI Real Estate Solutions).
In fiscal 2001, we recorded a charge of $0.2 million for purchased research and
development when we acquired Tax Accounting and Software Corporation.

Charge for Vacant Facilities

During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we concluded that we would not occupy
two vacant leased buildings in Mountain View, California and that we would be
unable to recover a substantial portion of our lease obligations by subleasing
the vacant space. As a result, we recorded a charge for vacant facilities of
$13.2 million in that quarter. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we
decided that based on corporate growth requirements and the current real estate
market in the San Francisco Bay Area, we would reoccupy one of these two vacant
buildings. As a result, we reversed the remaining $1.9 million reserve for the
related lease obligations to our statement of operations. At the same time, we
added $1.4 million to the reserve for the remaining vacant Mountain View
building to reflect our revised estimate of future sublease income for that
facility. Based on revised estimates, we also reversed approximately $0.6
million in reserves related to various smaller facilities for a total credit
for vacant facilities of $1.1 million to our statement of operations in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. See Note 13 of the financial statements.

Acquisition-Related Charges

Acquisition-related charges include the amortization of goodwill prior to
August 1, 2002, the amortization of purchased intangible assets and deferred
compensation expenses arising from acquisitions, and impairment charges
relating to goodwill and purchased intangible assets. Beginning on August 1,
2002, we no longer amortize goodwill due to our adoption of SFAS 142. However,
it is possible that in the future we may incur impairment charges related to
the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future
acquisitions. See Note 1 and Note 4 of the financial statements.

Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002.

In fiscal 2003, acquisition-related
charges were $33.9 million compared to $181.4 million in fiscal 2002. In
fiscal 2002, acquisition-related charges included the amortization of goodwill,
the amortization of purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation
expenses arising from acquisitions. Acquisition-related charges for fiscal
2002 also included impairment charges of $22.0 million that were related to our
Internet-based advertising business and our Site Solutions business. Beginning
with the first quarter of fiscal 2003, acquisition-related charges no longer
included amortization of goodwill due to our adoption of SFAS 142 and there
were no impairment charges in fiscal 2003.

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001.

In fiscal 2002, acquisition-related
charges were $181.4 million compared to $247.8 million in fiscal 2001.
Acquisition-related charges in fiscal 2002 included impairment charges totaling
$22.0 million that were related to our Internet-based advertising business and
our Site Solutions business. Acquisition-related charges for fiscal 2001
included impairment charges that totaled $78.7 million for goodwill and
intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisitions of Venture
Finance Software Corp., SecureTax.com and Hutchison Avenue Software
Corporation.



Loss on Impairment of Long-lived Asset

In connection with the sale of our Quicken Bill Manager business in May 2001,
we acquired a $27.0 million long-term asset related to future consideration
from Princeton eCom. See Note 8 of the financial statements. During fiscal
2002, events and circumstances indicated impairment of this asset. These
indicators included the deterioration of Princeton eCom’s financial position
and the decreased likelihood that it would receive future funding. Based on
our analysis we determined that the fair value of this asset was impaired and
recorded a charge of $27.0 million in fiscal 2002 to reduce its carrying value
to zero.

Non-Operating Income and Expenses

Interest and Other Income

Interest and other income was $38.7 million in fiscal 2003 compared to $27.3
million in fiscal 2002 and $57.6 million in fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2003 interest
and other income included $10.1 million in royalties from trademark license and
distribution agreements that we entered into when we sold our mortgage business
in July 2002. See Note 9 of the financial statements. Due to the effect of
the weakening U.S. dollar on intercompany balances with our Canadian
subsidiary, interest and other income also included foreign exchange gains of
$5.4 million in fiscal 2003, compared to a nominal foreign exchange impact in
fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2003, the interest income that we earned on our cash
and short-term investment balances decreased due in part to a continuing
decline in market interest rates compared to the same periods of the prior
year. Our interest income also decreased as a result of lower average cash and
short-term investment balances during part of fiscal 2003 compared to the same
periods of fiscal 2002 due to our use of cash to fund our acquisitions and our
stock repurchase programs. See Note 7 and Note 15 of the financial statements.

The decrease in interest and other income during fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal
2001 was due to a sharp decline in the interest we earned on our cash and
short-term investment balances in fiscal 2002, reflecting significant decreases
in market interest rates during the period.

Interest earned on customer payroll deposits is reported as revenue for our
payroll business, and is not included in interest and other income.

Gains (Losses) on Marketable Securities and Other Investments, Net

We recorded a pre-tax net gain relating to marketable securities and other
investments of $10.9 million in fiscal 2003. We recorded pre-tax net losses
relating to marketable securities and other investments of $15.5 million in
fiscal 2002 and $98.1 million in fiscal 2001. The fiscal 2003 net gain
included charges totaling $2.8 million to write down certain long-term
investments for which the decline in fair value below carrying value was
other-than-temporary. The fiscal 2002 net loss included charges totaling $9.5
million to write down certain long-term investments for which the decline in
fair value below carrying value was other-than-temporary. The fiscal 2001 net
loss included charges of $40.2 million to write down certain available-for-sale
securities for which the decline in fair value below carrying value was
other-than-temporary and $28.6 million to write down certain long-term
investments for which the decline in fair value below carrying value was
other-than-temporary.

Net Gains (Losses) on Divestitures

In March 2002, we paid $12.0 million to terminate our remaining $20.3 million
obligation under an interactive services agreement related to our Quicken Bill
Manager business, which we sold in May 2001. We recorded a pre-tax gain of
$8.3 million in connection with the termination of this agreement. See Note 8
of the financial statements.

During fiscal 2001, we recorded a pre-tax net loss of $15.3 million resulting
from our divestitures of businesses. We recorded a pre-tax loss of $16.9
million for the sale of the technology assets of our Quicken Bill Manager
business. This loss was partially offset by a pre-tax gain of $1.6 million for
the sale of certain assets of our wholly owned subsidiary, Intuit Insurance
Services, Inc., which operated our Quicken Insurance business. See Note 8 of
the financial statements.



Income Taxes

For fiscal 2003, we recorded an income tax provision of $129.6 million on
pre-tax income from continuing operations of $392.8 million, resulting in an
effective tax rate of approximately 33%. For fiscal 2002, we recorded an
income tax provision of $16.9 million on pre-tax income from continuing
operations of $70.5 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of
approximately 24%. For fiscal 2001, we recorded an income tax benefit of $12.5
million on a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $137.1 million,
resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 9%. Our effective tax rate
for fiscal 2003 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to
tax-exempt interest income and research and development credits. Our effective
tax rate for fiscal 2002 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due
to a tax benefit related to a divestiture that became available during the year
and tax-exempt interest income, offset by non-deductible merger related
charges. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2001 differs from the federal
statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of non-deductible merger and
divestiture related charges offset by the benefit received from tax-exempt
interest income.

At July 31, 2003, we had net deferred tax assets of $217.9 million, which
included a valuation allowance of $7.5 million for net operating loss
carryforwards relating to our international subsidiaries and certain state
capital loss carryforwards. The allowance reflects management’s assessment
that we may not receive the benefit of certain loss carryforwards of our
international subsidiaries and capital loss carryforwards in certain state
jurisdictions. While we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient,
it may be necessary to increase this amount if it becomes more likely that we
will not realize a greater portion of the net deferred tax asset. We assess
the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis.
See Note 14 of the financial statements.

Discontinued Operations

Intuit KK

On February 7, 2003, we sold our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK,
and accounted for the sale as discontinued operations. In accordance with SFAS
144, we have segregated the operating results of Intuit KK from continuing
operations on our statement of operations for all periods prior to the sale.
We recorded a gain on disposal of these discontinued operations of $71.0
million, net of income taxes of $5.1 million, in the third quarter of fiscal
2003. See Note 9 of the financial statements.

Quicken Loans

On July 31, 2002, we sold 87.5% of our Quicken Loans mortgage business segment
and accounted for the sale as discontinued operations. In accordance with APB
Opinion No. 30, we have segregated the operating results of Quicken Loans from
continuing operations on our statement of operations for all periods prior to
the sale. We recorded a net gain on disposal of these discontinued operations
of $23.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. In October 2002, we
sold our residual 12.5% equity interest in the purchasing company and
recognized a net gain of $5.6 million on the transaction. See Note 9 of the
financial statements.

Concurrent with the sale, we signed an agreement to license the Quicken Loans
brand and a distribution agreement under which the purchasing company will
provide mortgage services on Quicken.com. We will receive minimum royalties of
$1.75 million a year for the next five years under the licensing agreement and
minimum fees of $0.75 million a year for the next five years under the
distribution agreement. Royalties and fees under these agreements are being
recorded as earned and are included in interest and other income on our
statement of operations. For fiscal 2003, we recorded royalties of $1.75
million under the trademark licensing agreement and fees of $8.3 million under
the distribution agreement. Fees due under these agreements totaled $9.5
million at July 31, 2003 and are included in accounts receivable on our balance
sheet. See Note 9 of the financial statements.

Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change

During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we recorded a cumulative gain of $14.3
million, net of income taxes, as a result of a change in accounting principle
when we adopted SFAS 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.”

We recognized the cumulative effect of the change in how we
accounted for options to



purchase shares of S1 Corporation as of August 1, 2000. See Note 1 of the
financial statements. Subsequent fluctuations in the fair value of these
options were included in our net income or net loss until we sold them in the
first quarter of fiscal 2002.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At July 31, 2003 our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled
$1.2 billion, essentially unchanged from July 31, 2002. In fiscal 2003, we
generated cash primarily from continuing operations, discontinued operations
and the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and we used cash
primarily for our stock repurchase programs and for acquisitions. The
following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for
fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003. For complete statements of cash flows for those
periods, see the financial statements in Item 8.

We generated $569.4 million, $344.3 million and $230.7 million in cash from our
operations during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001. Net income from continuing
operations generated $263.2 million in fiscal 2003 and $53.6 million in fiscal
2002. Net loss from continuing operations used $124.7 million in fiscal 2001.
Adjustments for non-cash expenses included depreciation of $73.8 million, $58.8
million and $54.3 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001. Adjustments for
non-cash expenses also included acquisition-related charges, charges for
purchased research and development and amortization of purchased software
totaling $56.6 million, $196.0 million and $263.0 million in those periods.
Adjustments for non-cash expenses included $27.0 million for an impairment loss
on a long-lived asset in fiscal 2002 and $98.1 million for net losses on
marketable securities and other investments in fiscal 2001.

We used $486.6 million, $30.9 million and $300.0 million in cash for investing
activities during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001. Our primary use of cash for
investing activities was for business acquisitions, which totaled $214.8
million in fiscal 2003, $284.1 million in fiscal 2002 and $198.1 million in
fiscal 2001, net of cash on the balance sheets of the companies when we
acquired them. Fiscal 2003 proceeds from the sale upon maturity of short-term
investments of $2.1 billion were more than offset by reinvestments of $2.3
billion, a net investment of $224.5 million. Proceeds of $3.2 billion from the
sale upon maturity of short-term investments were partially offset by
reinvestments of $2.9 billion during fiscal 2002, a net draw of $302.7 million.
Fiscal 2001 proceeds from the sale upon maturity of short-term investments of
$3.1 billion essentially offset reinvestments of $3.2 billion. Finally, as a



result of our continued investment in information systems and infrastructure,
we also purchased property and equipment of $50.4 million, $42.1 million and
$48.4 million and capitalized internal use software development projects of
$34.3 million, $21.3 million and $23.4 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001.

We used $661.8 million and $196.1 million in cash for our financing activities
in fiscal 2003 and 2002. We generated $87.6 million in cash from financing
activities in fiscal 2001. The primary component of cash used for financing
activities in fiscal 2003 and 2002 was $814.3 million and $318.4 million for
the repurchase of stock through our stock repurchase programs. See Note 15 of
the financial statements. This was partially offset by proceeds of $155.9
million and $133.6 million we received from the issuance of common stock under
employee stock plans in fiscal 2003 and 2002. The primary component of cash
generated from financing activities in fiscal 2001 was $96.8 million we
received from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.

Cash generated by discontinued operations totaled $341.4 million in fiscal 2003
and $225.2 million in fiscal 2002 while discontinued operations used cash of
$303.1 million in fiscal 2001. Cash generated by discontinued operations in
fiscal 2003 included collection of $241.6 million in amounts due from Quicken
Loans and Intuit KK and a net gain of $71.0 million from the sale of Intuit KK.
Cash generated by discontinued operations during fiscal 2002 was primarily
from collection of $108.1 million in amounts due from Quicken Loans and Intuit
KK, net income from discontinued operations of $63.2 million and a gain of
$23.3 million on the sale of Quicken Loans. Cash used in discontinued
operations during fiscal 2001 was related primarily to an increase of $297.7
million in amounts due from Quicken Loans and Intuit KK.

In May 2001, Intuit’s Board of Directors initiated Repurchase Plan I and
authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million of common stock from
time to time over a three-year period. In July 2002, our Board of Directors
increased the authorized purchase amount by $250.0 million to a total of $750.0
million. From inception of the program through its conclusion in December
2002, we repurchased a total of 16.6 million shares of our common stock for an
aggregate cost of approximately $750.0 million. Shares of stock repurchased
under this program became treasury shares.

In March 2003, Intuit’s Board of Directors initiated Repurchase Plan II and
authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million of common stock from
time to time over a three-year period. During fiscal 2003, we repurchased a
total of 8.9 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of
approximately $390.4 million under this program. Authorized funds of $109.6
million remained available under the program at July 31, 2003. Shares of stock
repurchased under this program become treasury shares.

In August 2003, our Board of Directors initiated Repurchase Plan III and
authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million of common stock from
time to time over a three-year period. Shares of stock repurchased under this
program will become treasury shares.

Shares repurchased under the plans described above from the inception of the
plans had no significant impact on our basic and diluted net income or loss per
share in fiscal 2001 or 2002 while they increased our basic and diluted net
income per share by $0.13 and $0.12 in fiscal 2003.

Outstanding loans to executive officers and other employees totaled $19.7
million at July 31, 2003 and $21.3 million at July 31, 2002. Loans to
executive officers are primarily relocation loans. Loans are generally secured
by real property and have maturity dates of up to 10 years. As of July 31,
2003, all interest payments were current in accordance with the terms of the
loan agreements. Consistent with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley
legislation enacted on July 30, 2002, no loans to executive officers have been
made or modified since July 30, 2002 and we do not intend to make or modify
loans to executive officers in the future. See Note 19 of the financial
statements.

In March 2003, we repurchased 17,532 shares of common stock from our chief
executive officer at fair market value to provide him with the funds to pay the
payroll tax withholding obligation relating to the vesting of his restricted
stock. See Note 19 of the financial statements.

In the normal course of business, we enter into leases for new or expanded
facilities in both domestic and global locations. We also evaluate, on an
ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or
establishing



strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. We may decide
to use cash and cash equivalents to fund such activities in the future.

We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be
sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital and capital expenditure
requirements for at least the next twelve months.

our customers and $5.7 million in obligations to our employees under deferred
compensation plans. Restricted cash at July 31, 2003 also included $2.5
million that we held in escrow in connection with our fiscal 2002 acquisition
of CBS Employer Services, Inc. The escrow period expires in June
2005. See Note 1 of the financial statements.

Long-term obligations at July 31, 2003 included the $8.3 million long-term
portion of our reserve for vacant Mountain View facilities. Long-term
obligations also included $17.5 million for amounts we owe to former
stockholders of CBS Employer Services, Inc. in connection with our acquisition
of that company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. See Note 13 of the
financial statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-21,

“Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.”

Issue 00-21 provides guidance on
accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of
multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. The provisions of
Issue 00-21 will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods
beginning after June 15, 2003. We do not believe that the adoption of Issue
00-21 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46,

“Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities.”

FIN 46 requires us to consolidate a variable interest entity if we
are subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest
entity’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s residual
returns or both. A variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership,
trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does
not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do
not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its
activities. A variable interest entity often holds financial assets, including
loans or receivables, real estate or other property. A variable interest
entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development
or other activities on behalf of another company. The consolidation
requirements of FIN 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created
after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to older entities
in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Some
of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after
January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was
established. We anticipate that the adoption of FIN 46 will not have a
material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 149,

“Amendment of Statement 133
on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”

Statement 149 is intended
to result in more consistent reporting of contracts as either



freestanding derivative instruments subject to Statement 133 in its entirety,
or as hybrid instruments with debt host contracts and embedded derivative
features. In addition, Statement 149 clarifies the definition of a derivative
by providing guidance on the meaning of initial net investments related to
derivatives. Statement 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified
after June 30, 2003. We do not believe the adoption of Statement 149 will have
a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150,

“Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.”

Statement 150 establishes standards for classifying and measuring as
liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer
and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. Statement 150
represents a significant change in practice in the accounting for a number of
financial instruments, including mandatorily redeemable equity instruments and
certain equity derivatives that are frequently used in connection with share
repurchase programs. We do not use such instruments in our share repurchase
program. Statement 150 is effective for all financial instruments created or
modified after May 31, 2003, and to other instruments as of September 1, 2003.
We adopted Statement 150 on June 1, 2003 and do not believe the effect of
adopting this statement will have a material impact on our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.



RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

Company-Wide Factors That Could Affect Future Results

We face intense competitive pressures in all of our businesses, which can have
a negative impact on our revenue, profitability and market position.

We have
formidable current and potential competitors. Accordingly, we expect
competition to remain intense during fiscal 2004 and beyond. In all our
businesses, we face continual risks that competitors will introduce better
products and services, reduce prices, gain better access to distribution
channels, increase advertising (including advertising targeted at Intuit
customers), and release new products and services before we do. Any of these
competitive actions — particularly any prolonged price competition — could
result in lower net revenue and/or lower profitability for us. They could also
affect our ability to keep existing customers and acquire new customers. For
more information about the competitive environment in which we operate, see
Item 1, “Business — Competition” and the competition risk factors for each of
our businesses below.

If we do not continue to develop new products and services in a timely manner,
our future financial results will suffer.

It is necessary for us to
continually develop new products and services and to improve existing products
and services so that we can remain competitive in the markets we serve and in
the markets we seek to enter. In executing our customer-focused product
strategies, we have introduced a number of products and services that are
specially designed for specific businesses and consumer needs. Many of our
offerings have posed new product development challenges for us because several
of these offerings require that our products and services integrate with one
another and with both our web sites and our internal information systems. In
addition, our customers expect — and our business model contemplates —
increased functionality and greater inter-operability among our products and
services. Moreover, our development and enhancement processes involve several
risks, including challenges in hiring and retaining highly qualified employees,
the risk of delays in product and service launches, the risk of defects that
hinder performance and the risk that consumers will not buy new or modified
offerings. Failure to timely and successfully develop new products and
services would harm our competitive position and result in declines in our
revenue and earnings.

Expanding our product and service offerings creates risks due to the increasing
complexity and decreasing predictability of our revenue streams.

Our expanding
range of products and services generates more varied revenue streams than our
traditional desktop software businesses. The accounting policies that apply to
these revenue streams are more complex than those that apply to our traditional
products and services. We expect this trend to continue as we acquire
additional companies. For example, as we begin to offer additional features
and options as part of multiple-element sales arrangements, we could be
required to defer a higher percentage of our product revenue at the time of
sale than we do for traditional products. This would decrease revenue at the
time products are shipped, but result in increased revenue in fiscal periods
after shipment. In addition, our Vertical Business Management Solutions
businesses offer products and services with significantly higher prices than we
have traditionally offered. Revenue from these offerings tends to be less
predictable than revenue from our traditional desktop products, due to longer
sales and implementation cycles. These businesses also tend to rely on a
relatively small number of large orders for a substantial portion of their
revenue in a particular quarter, which could cause our quarterly revenue from
these businesses to fluctuate.

We are continuing to implement new information systems to enable us to execute
on our growth strategy, and problems with the design or implementation of these
new systems could interfere with our business and operations.

We are in the
process of implementing new information systems to eventually replace our
existing systems. As a part of this effort, we began implementing in fiscal
2003, and will continue to implement in fiscal 2004, new software applications
to manage our business and finance operations. We may not successfully
implement these new systems and transition data, and even if we do succeed, the
implementation may be much more costly than we anticipated. Any disruptions
relating to these systems enhancements could adversely impact our ability to do
the following in a timely and accurate manner: take customer orders, ship
products, provide services and support to our customers, bill and track our
customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business. In
addition, many of our newer businesses depend on a different operational
infrastructure than our desktop software businesses, and we must continually
develop, expand and modify our internal systems and procedures — including
call center, customer management, order management, billing and other systems
— to support these businesses. If we are unable to successfully implement new
information systems, our financial position, results of operations, cash flows
and stock price could be adversely affected.



Any significant failure in our technology systems could harm our operations and
our financial performance.

We rely on a variety of technology systems to,
among other functions, take and fulfill customer orders, handle customer
service requests, host our Web-based activities, support internal operations
and store customer and company data. Our computer and communications systems
and operations could be damaged or interrupted, or lose customer data, any of
which could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and
adversely impact our internal operations. To prevent interruptions, we must
continually upgrade our systems and processes to ensure that we have adequate
recoverability — both of which are costly and time consuming. While we have
backup systems for certain aspects of our operations, our systems are not fully
redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all
eventualities. In addition, we may have inadequate insurance coverage or
insurance limits to compensate us for losses from a major interruption. If any
of this were to occur, it could harm our financial performance, damage our
reputation and be expensive to remedy.

Business integration of acquired companies presents several challenges and we
may not fully realize the intended benefits of our acquisitions if we do not
successfully integrate them with our operations.

During the past few years, we
have completed numerous acquisitions (two in fiscal 2003 and five in fiscal
2002), and we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions as part of our Right
for My Business strategy. These acquisitions expand our product and service
offerings, personnel and geographic locations and require us to integrate
different company cultures, management teams and business infrastructures. The
integration process can strain our resources and be expensive and time
consuming, particularly if we are integrating multiple companies at the same
time. Promptly and efficiently integrating acquired businesses creates
challenges for our operational, financial and management information systems,
as well as for our product development processes. We may have difficulty
developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired
company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or
product lines to realize the value from expected synergies. Depending on the
size and complexity of an acquisition, and the number of acquisitions we are
concurrently integrating, our successful integration of the entity depends on a
variety of factors, including:

•

Retaining key employees

•

Managing facilities and employees in different geographic areas

•

Retaining key customers, and

•

Integrating or coordinating different research and development,
product manufacturing, and sales and marketing programs.

Despite our efforts to adequately staff and equip our customer service and
technical support operations, we cannot always respond promptly to customer
requests for assistance.

We occasionally experience customer service and
technical support problems, including longer than expected waiting times for
customers when our staffing and systems are inadequate to handle a
higher-than-anticipated volume of requests. When we experience these problems,
they can adversely affect customer relationships and our financial results (due
to lost revenue because of our inability to accept orders for our products or
increased costs). We also risk losing service at any one of our customer
contact centers and our redundancy systems could prove inadequate to provide
backup support. In addition, our customer-focused business strategy presents
additional technical support challenges as we increase the number and
complexity of the products we offer, particularly for our QuickBooks, Consumer
Tax and Vertical Business Management Solutions segments. To improve our
performance in this area, we must eliminate underlying causes of service and
support requests through product improvements, better order fulfillment
processes, more robust self-help tools, and improved ability to accurately
anticipate demand for support. Implementing any of these improvements can be
expensive, time consuming and ultimately prove unsuccessful.

Given the nature of the products and services that we offer, our revenue and
earnings are highly seasonal.

Several of our businesses are highly seasonal —
particularly our tax businesses, but also our small business software and
service offerings to a lesser extent. This causes significant quarterly
fluctuations in our financial results. Revenue and operating results are
usually strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending January 31
and April 30. We experience lower revenues, and often significant operating
losses, in the first and fourth quarters ending October 31 and July 31.
Recently we have recognized an increasing portion of our Consumer Tax revenue
in the third fiscal quarter compared to the second fiscal quarter. Our
financial results can also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year
due to a variety of factors, including changes in product sales mix that affect
average selling prices, product release dates, the timing of sales of our
higher-priced Vertical Business Management Solutions



offerings, our methods for distributing our products, including the shift to a
consignment model for our consumer tax products that we sell through retail
distribution channels, and the timing of acquisitions, dispositions, and
goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charges.

We face risks relating to customer privacy and security and increasing
regulation, which could hinder the growth of our businesses and affect our
financial performance.

Despite our efforts to address customer concerns about
privacy and security, these issues still pose a risk to our business, and we
have experienced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues. A
major breach of customer privacy or security by Intuit, or even by another
company, could have serious consequences for our businesses, including reduced
customer demand for our products and/or additional regulation by federal or
state agencies. In addition, we have incurred — and will continue to incur —
significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards
and protocols. If additional similar federal and state laws and/or regulations
(like the recently created federal “Do Not Call List”) that govern our direct
marketing activities (such as telesales and email campaigns) are passed, our
ability to communicate with our customers may be further limited and our
compliance costs may increase, both of which could have a negative impact on
our operating results. Moreover, in response to concerns about their
customers’ privacy, third parties (such as Internet service providers) have
developed, and may continue to develop, technology that limits or impedes our
ability to communicate with our customers, particularly via email.

We face several risks relating to our retail distribution channel through which
we sell our core desktop software products (QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken).

We face challenges with our relationships with retailers, including our ability
to negotiate favorable terms with them, the risk that retailers could
consolidate and potentially eliminate the number of retail locations in which
our products are offered, and the negative effect of the current economic
environment on retail sales generally. In addition, any change in significant
business terms, termination or significant disruption of our relationship with
any of our major resellers could result in a decline in our revenue. If any of
our retailers experience financial difficulties, it could have an adverse
effect on our operating expenses if uncollectible amounts from them exceed the
bad debt reserves we have established.

We face additional risks in the retail channel as we execute on our
Customer-Focused Product Strategy through which we offer a collection of
products and services that are tailored for a wide range of customers with
differing needs. We now offer several more stock-keeping units (SKUs) than we
have in the past and some of these products can be more complex and priced
higher than our traditional retail software products and therefore pose new
challenges for us in the retail channel. For example, to market our QuickBooks
offerings at retail we have historically relied on product packaging, in-store
displays and other retail merchandising to educate customers about our
products. However, because our industry-specific versions of QuickBooks (which
we call “flavors”) are priced higher, this strategy may prove less effective or
ineffective given the increased need to educate potential customers about the
added benefits of these products and the related higher pricing. As a result,
we may need to incur additional expenses to develop other marketing programs
that supplement our traditional in-store promotional efforts to sell these
products to customers. In addition, retailers may be reluctant to carry the
higher-priced SKUs because they are new offerings, and we have not yet been
able to demonstrate demand for these products at levels that are desirable to
our retailers. Finally, our Customer-Focused Product Strategy — and, in
particular, our Right for My Business strategy — is resulting in a greater
number of Intuit products that we’re asking our retailers to stock. Therefore,
we may experience difficulty in negotiating with our retailers to ensure that
they will carry all of our SKUs and to ensure that they will carry an adequate
supply of all of the different versions of our products in their stores. If
retail distribution proves an ineffective channel for certain of our new
offerings (and our QuickBooks flavors in particular), it could adversely impact
our growth, revenue and profitability.

Acquisition-related costs can cause significant fluctuation in our net income.

Our recent acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses, including
amortization of purchased software (which is reflected in cost of revenue), as
well as charges for in-process research and development, and amortization and
impairment of goodwill, purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation
(which are reflected in operating expenses). Total acquisition-related costs in
the categories identified above were $263.0 million in fiscal 2001, $196.0
million in fiscal 2002 and $56.6 million in fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2003
acquisition-related costs have declined primarily because of a change in the
accounting treatment of goodwill. However, we may incur less frequent, but
larger, impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to
goodwill arising out of future acquisitions. As of July 31, 2003, we had an
unamortized goodwill balance of approximately $591.1 million, which could be
subject to impairment charges in the



future. Additional acquisitions, and any impairment of the value of purchased
assets, could have a significant negative impact on our future operating
results

.

If we are required to account for options under our employee stock plans as a
compensation expense, it would significantly reduce our net income and earnings
per share.

Although we are not currently required to record any compensation
expense in connection with option grants to employees that have an exercise
price at or above fair market value, it is possible that future laws or
regulations will require us to treat all employee stock options as a
compensation expense. The increased compensation expense would significantly
reduce our net income and earnings per share under generally accepted
accounting principles.

If actual product returns exceed returns reserves our revenue would be lower.

We ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than
we expect them to sell, in order to reduce the risk that distributors or
retailers will run out of products. This is particularly true for our Consumer
Tax products, which have a short selling season and for which returns occur
primarily in our fourth fiscal quarter. Like most software companies, we have
historically accepted significant product returns. We establish reserves
against revenue for product returns in our financial statements, based on
estimated future returns of products. We closely monitor levels of product
sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain reserves
that are adequate to cover expected returns. In the past, returns have not
generally exceeded these reserves. However, if we do experience actual returns
that significantly exceed reserves, it would result in lower net revenue.

We rely on third-party vendors to handle all outsourced aspects of
manufacturing and distribution for our primary retail and primary direct
desktop software products.

To manufacture and distribute our primary retail
products at the time of product launches and to replenish products in the
retail channel after the primary launch, we have a manufacturing relationship
with Modus Media, and a distribution arrangement with Ingram Micro Logistics.
To manufacture and distribute our primary direct products (QuickBooks, TurboTax
and Quicken), we have a manufacturing and distribution relationship with Arvato
Services Inc. While we believe that relying on only three outsourcers for
product launches and replenishment improves the efficiency and reliability of
these activities, relying on any vendor for a significant aspect of our
business can have severe negative consequences if the vendor fails to perform
at acceptable service levels for any reason, including but not limited to
financial difficulties of the vendor.

Legal protection for our intellectual property is not always effective to
prevent unauthorized use or copying.

Current U.S. laws that prohibit copying
give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of
many other countries provide very little protection. Policing unauthorized use
and copying of our products is difficult, expensive, and time consuming. In
addition, efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be positively
perceived by our customers. Although we continue to evaluate technology
solutions to piracy, as well as increase our civil and criminal enforcement
efforts, we expect piracy to be a persistent problem. Changes to federal or
state laws and/or regulations could impact our ability to enforce our
intellectual property rights. Also, the Internet may tend to increase, and
provide new methods for, illegal copying of our desktop and Internet-based
products and services. In addition, we face risks relating to licensing our
intellectual property to third parties. For example, we licensed the use of
the Quicken Loans and Quicken Mortgage trademarks to the purchaser of our
Quicken Loans mortgage business. If the purchaser violates the terms of the
trademark license, it could result in serious harm to Intuit’s reputation and
serious and irreparable harm to the value of our Quicken-related brands.

We do not own all of the software, other technologies and content used in our
products and services.

We have the licenses from third parties that we believe
are necessary for using technology and content that we do not own in our
current products and services. From time to time we may be required to
renegotiate with these third parties — or negotiate with new third parties —
to include their technology or content in our existing products, in new
versions of our current products or in new products. We may not be able to
negotiate or renegotiate licenses on reasonable terms, or at all. If we’re
unable to obtain the rights necessary to use third-party technology or content
in our products and services, we may not be able to sell the affected products,
which would in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and operating
results.

We may unintentionally infringe on the intellectual property rights of others,
which could expose us to substantial damages or restrict our business
operations.

As the number of our products and services increases and their
features and content continue to expand, and as we acquire technology through
acquisitions or licenses, we may increasingly become subject to infringement
claims by third parties. From time to time, we have received communications
from



third parties in which the claimant alleges that a product or service we offer
infringes the claimant’s intellectual property rights. Occasionally these
communications result in lawsuits. In many of these cases, it is difficult to
assess the extent to which the intellectual property right that the claimant
asserts is valid or the extent to which we have any material exposure. Past
claims have not resulted in any significant litigation, settlement or licensing
expenses, but future claims could present an exposure of uncertain magnitude.
Existing or future infringement claims or lawsuits against us, whether valid or
not, may be time consuming and expensive to defend. Intellectual property
litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following: cease
selling, incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the
challenged intellectual property; obtain a license from the holder of the
infringed intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially
favorable terms or at all; or redesign our software products or services,
possibly in a manner that reduces their commercial appeal. Any of these actions
may cause material harm to our business and financial results.

Specific Factors Affecting Our QuickBooks, Small Business Products and Services and Vertical Business Management Solutions Segments

In our QuickBooks and our Small Business Products and Services businesses, we
face a wide range of competitive risks that could impact our financial results.

Our QuickBooks business faces current competition from competitors’ desktop
and Web-based software offerings. Many competitors and potential competitors
have begun providing, or have expressed significant interest in providing,
accounting and business management products and services to small businesses.
As we expand the depth and breadth of our small business offerings, we face
additional competition from others who are already offering industry-specific
small business solutions and business management tools and services for larger
small businesses. Microsoft has several small business offerings that compete
with our small business offerings, including Microsoft Business Solutions Small
Business Manager, Microsoft Busines Solutions CRM and Business Contact Manager
for Microsoft Office Outlook® 2003. We expect that Microsoft small business
offerings will continue to compete with our small business offerings, perhaps
even more directly in the future. In addition, we face direct competition in
our Intuit Payroll Services Complete Payroll business from traditional payroll
services offered by a number of companies, including ADP and Paychex. Our
financial supplies business faces ongoing pricing pressures from many of our
competitors. As we implement our Right for My Business strategy we face
increased competitive threats from larger companies in bigger markets than we
have historically faced.

We face competitive pressures in our Vertical Business Management Solutions
segment

. All of our Vertical Business Management Solutions businesses operate
in highly competitive and fragmented environments where no competitor has a
significant share of the market segment. We may experience pricing pressure in
these market segments because we compete with many small companies, who have
fewer resources than larger companies and are therefore more likely to focus on
near-term sales. In each of these market segments, the possibility exists that
through either consolidation within the market segment or the entry into the
market segment of new companies a significant competitor will emerge.

It is too soon to provide assurance that we will be able to generate
substantial and sustained revenue growth from new products and services in the
QuickBooks, Small Business Products and Services and Vertical Business
Management Solutions segments.

To meet our growth goals, we must generate
revenue from a wider range of market and customer segments, as well as from new
products and services. There are a number of risks associated with our growth
strategy, including:

•

We may have difficulty identifying potential targets for acquisition.

•

Our strategy depends on our successfully completing acquisitions and
integrating acquired companies, which presents a number of challenges
as described above under “Company-Wide Risk Factors.”

•

Our Right for My Business strategy is resulting in a dramatic increase
in the number and complexity of the products and services that we
offer. This places greater demands on our research and development,
and marketing and sales resources, as we must develop, market and sell
both the new products and services and periodic enhancements to an
expanding portfolio of products and services. This will also require
us to continually develop, expand and modify our internal business
operations systems and procedures to gain better integration so we can
support our new businesses, including our customer service and
technical support contact centers, and our customer management, order
management, billing and other systems.



•

Many of the new products and services we offer, and will be offering,
are much more complex than our traditional core desktop software
products and are priced accordingly. They will therefore require a
more consultative sales process and a higher level of post-sales
support, both of which could result in higher selling and marketing
expenses. If we are not able to effectively adapt our marketing,
sales, distribution and customer support functions to accommodate
these changes, we will not succeed in generating significant or
sustained revenue or net income from these new businesses.

Our acquisition strategy entails a number of challenges that could limit our
successful implementation of the strategy.

A key component of our Right for My
Business strategy is to continue to expand our product and service offerings,
and we expect to derive a significant portion of this expansion from
acquisitions. We could face the following risks relating to our strategy and
future acquisitions, in addition to the integration challenges noted above:

Revenue growth for our Vertical Business Management Solutions segment may be
hindered by a variety of factors, which could have a negative impact on overall
company revenue growth.

Revenue growth for our Vertical Business Management
Solutions business is subject to numerous risks. Among these are the negative
impact of the current economic environment on customer purchases of the
relatively high-priced software solutions offered by these businesses, strong
pricing pressure in these markets because we compete with many small companies,
who have fewer resources than larger companies and are therefore more likely to
focus on near-term sales

,

our ability to successfully acquire other companies
and the potential disruption to the businesses of the acquired companies during
the acquisition integration process. In addition, revenue growth in any
particular period may be difficult to predict because of the complex revenue
streams generated by these businesses, and the corresponding complexity in the
accounting policies that apply to them.

Our financial supplies business relies on a single-source vendor.

We have an
exclusive contract with John H. Harland Company to print and fulfill supplies
orders for all of our checks and most other products for our financial supplies
business. Harland fulfilled orders for about 75% to 85% of our supplies
revenue in fiscal 2001 and 2002, and almost 95% of our supplies revenue in
fiscal 2003. We believe that relying on one vendor improves customer service
and maximizes operational efficiencies for our supplies business. However, if
there are significant problems with Harland’s performance, it could have a
material negative impact on sales of supplies and on Intuit’s financial results
as a whole.

Our payroll businesses face a number of risks that could have a negative impact
on revenue and profitability.

For our payroll businesses, we must process
customer data accurately, reliably and timely in order to attract and retain
customers and avoid the costs associated with errors. We must also accurately
and timely develop new and upgraded payroll products to enable our customers to
meet the various regulatory deadlines associated with employer-related payroll
activities. If we failed to timely deliver any of our payroll products, it
could cause our current and prospective customers to choose a competitor’s
product for that year’s payroll and not to purchase Intuit products in the
future. In order to generate sustained growth for our Intuit Payroll Services
Complete Payroll, we will be required to successfully develop and manage a more
extensive and proactive direct field sales operation, which is a different
distribution method than those we have historically utilized. As our payroll
businesses involve the processing of large amounts of payroll funds and the
remittance of large amounts of income taxes, there is a potential for errors in
processing the payments or misappropriation of payroll funds by either our
customers’



employees or our own employees. Any such error or misappropriation could
subject Intuit to liabilities that could be substantial. In addition, we are
authorized by our customers to transfer money from their bank accounts to fund
amounts owed to their employees and taxing authorities. It is possible that we
could be held liable for such amounts in the event the client has insufficient
funds to cover them. Moreover, our payroll businesses, other than our
Do-It-Yourself product, include as part of their revenue interest on customer
deposits not yet remitted to taxing authorities or to customers’ employees. If
interest rates decline, or there take effect regulatory changes either
decreasing the amount of taxes withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to
taxing authorities, it would result in less interest revenue for those
businesses. If any of the above eventualities came to pass, it could have a
negative impact on the revenue, profitability and future growth of our payroll
businesses.

Specific Factors Affecting Our Consumer Tax and Professional Accounting Solutions Segments

We face intense competitive pressures from both the private and public sectors
in our Consumer Tax and Professional Accounting Solutions businesses that could
have a negative impact on revenue, profitability and market position.

There
are formidable current and potential competitors in the private sector for both
our consumer and professional tax products, and we expect competition to remain
intense in the future. Our major domestic competitor for both desktop and
Web-based consumer tax software continues to be H&R Block, the makers of TaxCut
software, and our largest professional tax competitors are CCH Incorporated,
with its ProSystem fx product line; Kleinrock Publishing, with its ATX product line; and the Thomson Corporation, with its Creative Solutions and
GoSystem offerings. These competitive pressures can have a negative impact on
our revenue, profitability and market position.

In addition, we face current and potential competition from a number of
publicly funded government entities that are offering individual taxpayers
electronic tax preparation and/or filing services, at no cost to individual
taxpayers. If governmental agencies are able to develop consumer tax
preparation and filing services and to gain consumer acceptance of those
services, it could have a negative impact on our financial results in future
years. The federal government signed a three-year Free File Alliance agreement
in October 2002 under which a number of private sector companies, rather than
the federal government, are providing Web-based federal tax preparation and
filing services at no cost through voluntary public services initiatives such
as our Intuit Tax Freedom Project. However, future administrative, regulatory
or legislative activity in this area could have a strong adverse impact the
financial performance of our Consumer Tax and Professional Accounting Solutions
businesses.

The product activation technology that we introduced into certain TurboTax
desktop products last year could have an adverse impact on this year’s results
for our Consumer Tax business.

During tax year 2002, federal versions of
TurboTax desktop products for Windows included product activation technology
that helped to prevent unlicensed users from using pass-along and/or
counterfeit copies of TurboTax to print or electronically file a tax return.
The introduction of product activation generated negative commentary in the
media and in online forums and also resulted in a modest increase in the volume
of customers contacting our customer service and technical support centers.
While we have publicly announced that we will not include product activation in
retail versions of TurboTax for Windows for the upcoming tax season, there is
uncertainty about whether the negative publicity and customer reactions to, and
experiences with, this technology last year will impact our Consumer Tax
business this year. Any significant negative repercussions relating to product
activation could adversely impact our fiscal 2004 results for our Consumer Tax
business, in particular, and our financial performance as a whole.

Significant problems or delays in developing our Consumer Tax and Professional
Tax products would result in lost revenue and customers.

Developing tax
preparation software presents a unique challenge because of the demanding
annual development cycle required to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax
form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy
and a timely launch of these products. Our tax preparation software business,
which represents a substantial portion of our annual revenue, is highly
seasonal since the customers in that market generally prepare and file their
taxes by April 15. A significantly late product launch could result in lost
revenue and lost customers. It could cause our current and prospective
customers to choose a competitor’s product for that year’s tax season or to
choose not to purchase tax preparation software at all. These risks could
result in lost revenue in the current tax year and would make it more difficult
for us to sell our products to customers in future tax seasons. Moreover, the
rigid development timetable increases the risk of errors in our products and
the risk of launch delays. Any major defects could lead to negative publicity,
customer dissatisfaction and incremental



operating expenses, including expenses resulting from our commitment to
reimburse penalties and interest paid by consumer customers due solely to
calculation errors in our products.

If we fail to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our
electronic tax offerings, we could lose revenue and customers.

Our Web-based
tax preparation and electronic filing services must effectively handle
extremely heavy customer demand during the peak tax season and the exact level
of demand for these offerings is difficult to predict. We face significant
risks and challenges in maintaining these services and maintaining adequate
service levels, particularly during peak volume service times. For example, we
experienced a relatively brief unscheduled interruption in our electronic
filing service on April 15, 2003 during which certain users of our professional
tax products were unable to receive confirmation from us that their electronic
filing had been accepted. We also experienced relatively brief unscheduled
interruptions in our electronic filing.and/or tax preparation services during
tax years 1999 and 2000, and we reached maximum capacity for a short period on
April 15, 2002. We also face risks related to the performance of our
redundancy and data recoverability systems in these businesses. If our
redundancy and data recoverability systems are inadequate, then we could lose
the ability to provide these services — or provided these services at
inadequate levels — to our customers. If we experience any prolonged
difficulties with our Web-based tax preparation or electronic filing service at
any time during the tax season, we could lose current and future customers,
receive negative publicity and incur increased operating costs, any of which
could have a significant negative impact on the financial and market success of
these businesses and have a negative impact on our near-term and long-term
financial results.

Increased state filing mandates could significantly increase our costs.

We are
required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to
successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services.
Changes in state-imposed requirements by one or more of the states, including
the required use of specific technologies or technology standards, could
significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers.

If we are unable to significantly increase accountant-facilitated sales, it
could have a negative impact on revenue growth.

We are currently focused on
developing relationships with accounting professionals in order to expand our
opportunities to sell small business products and services to their clients
under our “Right for My Firm, Right for My Clients” strategy. We view this
strategy as an important driver for our Professional Accounting Solutions
segment, as well as our QuickBooks and Small Business Products and Services
businesses. However, since this is a new model for us, we face several risks
associated with it, including the risk that we will not be able to effectively
execute this strategy and the risk that we will not derive the anticipated
benefits (including financial benefits) from this strategy. We face intense
competition in this effort, as there are an increasing number of alliances
between accountants and other professional tax preparers and providers of small
business software and services that aim to capitalize on accountant-facilitated
sales of small business products and services to their clients.

Specific Factors Affecting Our Other Businesses Segment

Our Other Businesses products face competition that could have a negative
impact on revenue, profitability and market position.

Our Quicken products
compete — domestically and internationally — directly with Microsoft Money,
which is aggressively promoted and priced. We expect competitive pressures for
Quicken to continue, both from Microsoft Money and from Web-based personal
finance tracking and management tools that are becoming increasingly available
at no cost to consumers. Competitive pressures can result in reduced revenue
and lower profitability for our Quicken product line. In Canada, we face
competition from a number of companies in the small business, consumer tax and
professional tax businesses.

The long-term viability of our personal finance business will depend on our
ability to provide new products and services that attract customers.

The
demand for personal finance desktop software products — such as our Quicken
offering — has been weakening over recent years due to the increasing
availability of free Web-based personal finance tracking and management tools
through financial institutions and others. In addition, the demand for
Internet advertising on Web sites like Quicken.com has declined precipitously.
We must identify and capitalize on additional sources of revenue for our
personal finance business to continue to grow that business and we face the
risk that any approach that we take to increase revenue for this business may
not succeed.

standards consistent with our investment policy. This policy specifies that,
except for direct obligations of the United States government and money market
or cash management funds, we diversify our holdings and limit our short-term

Interest Rate Risk

Our cash equivalents and short-term investment portfolio are subject to market
risk due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate movements affect the
interest income we earn on cash equivalents and short-term investments and the
value of those investments.

Over the past few years, we have experienced significant reductions in our
interest income due to declines in interest rates. These declines have led to
interest rates that are low by historical standards and we do not believe that
further decreases in interest rates will have a material impact on the interest
income earned on our cash equivalents and short-term investments held at July
31, 2003.

Impact of Foreign Currency Rate Changes

We translate foreign currencies (primarily Canadian dollars and British pounds)
into U.S dollars for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, currency
fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results, though the historical
impact has generally been immaterial. We believe that our exposure to currency
exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global
subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost
exclusively in their local currencies. There was a nominal currency exchange
impact from our intercompany transactions for fiscal 2001 and 2002. Due to the
effect of the weakening U.S. dollar on intercompany balances with our Canadian
subsidiary, we recorded foreign currency exchange gains of $5.4 million in
fiscal 2003. Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial
results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the
reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the
future, there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will
not be material in the future. As of July 31, 2003, we did not engage in
foreign currency hedging activities.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intuit Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intuit Inc. as
of July 31, 2002 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended July 31, 2003. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 14(a). These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of Intuit’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Intuit Inc. at
July 31, 2002 and 2003, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2003, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered
in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly
in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As disclosed in Note 1 and Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements, on

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements
of Intuit and its wholly owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated all
intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. We have
reclassified certain amounts previously reported in our financial
statements to conform to the current presentation. As discussed in Note
9, the Quicken Loans mortgage business, which we sold on July 31, 2002,
has been accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 30. Also as discussed
in Note 9, our Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, became a long-lived asset
held for sale and a discontinued operation during the second quarter of
fiscal 2003 in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) 144. The sale of Intuit KK closed on February 7,
2003. Accordingly, we have reclassified our consolidated financial
statements for all periods presented to reflect Quicken Loans and Intuit
KK as discontinued operations. Unless noted otherwise, discussions in
these notes pertain to our continuing operations.

Use of Estimates

We make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the consolidated financial statements and the disclosures made in the
accompanying notes. For example, we use estimates in determining the
fair value of undelivered elements in multiple element arrangements, in
determining reserves for product returns and rebates, and in determining
the collectibility of accounts receivable and the value of deferred tax
assets. We use estimates to determine the remaining economic lives and
carrying values of purchased intangible assets, property and equipment
and other long-lived assets. We also use assumptions when employing the
Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock
options granted for pro forma disclosures. See Note 1,

“Stock-Based
Incentive Program.”

Despite our intention to establish accurate
estimates and assumptions, actual results may differ from our estimates.

Net Revenue

We derive revenues from the sale of packaged software products and
supplies, product support, professional services, outsourced payroll
services and multiple element arrangements that may include any
combination of these items. We recognize revenue for software products
and related services in accordance with Statement of Position (“SOP”)
97-2, “

Software Revenue Recognition

,” as modified by SOP 98-9. For
other offerings, we follow Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, “

Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements.

” We recognize revenue when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the
product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and
collectibility is probable.

In some situations, we receive advance payments from our customers. We
defer revenue associated with these advance payments until we ship the
products or perform the services. Deferred revenue consisted of the
following at the dates indicated:

In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB’s”)
Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 01-9, “

Accounting for Consideration
Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendor’s Product

,”
we generally account for cash consideration (such as sales incentives)
that we give to our customers or resellers as a reduction of revenue
rather than as an operating expense.



Product Revenue

We typically recognize revenue from the sale of our packaged software
products and supplies when we ship the product. We sell some of our
QuickBooks and Consumer Tax products on consignment to a limited number
of resellers. We recognize revenue for these consignment transactions
only when the end-user sale has occurred.

We reduce product revenue from distributors and retailers for estimated
returns that are based on historical returns experience and other
factors such as the volume and price mix of products in the retail
channel, trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might
impact customer demand for our products. We also reduce product revenue
for the estimated redemption of rebates on certain current product
sales. Our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer sales
incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and retailers’ actual
performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs, which
we typically establish annually. End user rebate reserves are estimated
based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate
program, actual sales during the promotion, the amount of redemptions
received and historical redemption trends by product and by type of
promotional program.

Service Revenue

We recognize revenue from outsourced payroll processing and payroll tax
filing services as the services are performed, provided we have no other
remaining obligations to these customers. We generally require
customers to remit payroll and payroll tax funds to us in advance of the
applicable payroll due date via electronic funds transfer. We include
in total net revenue the interest earned on invested balances resulting
from timing differences between when we collect these funds from
customers and when we remit the funds to outside parties.

We offer several technical support plans and recognize support revenue
over the life of the plans. Service revenue also includes revenue from
consulting, training and Web services such as TurboTax for the Web and
electronic tax filing services. We generally recognize revenue as these
services are performed, provided that we have no other remaining
obligations to these customers and that the services performed are not
essential to the functionality of delivered products and services.

Other Revenue

Other revenue consists primarily of revenue sharing arrangements with
third-party service providers and from online advertising agreements.
We recognize transaction fees from revenue sharing arrangements as
end-user sales are reported to us by these partners. We typically
recognize revenue from online advertising agreements as the
advertisements are served or pro rata based on the contractual time
period, whichever is less.

Multiple Element Arrangements

We also enter into certain revenue arrangements for which we are
obligated to deliver multiple products and/or services (multiple
elements). For these arrangements, which generally include software
products, we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered elements
based on their vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair
value. VSOE is generally the price charged when that element is sold
separately.

In situations where VSOE exists for all elements (delivered and
undelivered), we allocate the total revenue to be earned under the
arrangement among the various elements, based on their relative fair
value. For transactions where VSOE exists only for the undelivered
elements, we defer the full fair value of the undelivered elements and
recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the
amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. If VSOE does not
exist for undelivered items that are services, then we recognize the
entire arrangement fee ratably over the remaining service period. If
VSOE does not exist for undelivered elements that are specified products
or features, we defer revenue until the earlier of the delivery of all
elements or the point at which we determine VSOE for these undelivered
elements.

We recognize revenue related to the delivered products or services only
if: (1) the above revenue recognition criteria are met; (2) any
undelivered products or services are not essential to the functionality
of the delivered products and services; (3) payment for the delivered
products or services is not contingent upon delivery of the remaining
products or services; and (4) we have an enforceable claim to receive
the amount due in the event that we do not deliver the undelivered
products or services.

For arrangements where undelivered services are essential to the
functionality of delivered software, we recognize both the product
license revenues and service revenues under the percentage of completion
contract method in accordance with the provisions of SOP 81-1,

“Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production
Type Contracts.”

We follow the percentage of completion method when
reasonably dependable estimates of progress toward completion of a
contract can be made. We estimate the percentage of completion on
contracts using hours incurred to date as a percentage of the total
estimated hours to complete the project. If we do



not have a sufficient basis on which to measure progress toward
completion, we recognize revenue using the completed contract method,
when we receive final acceptance from the customer. To date, license
and service revenues recognized pursuant to SOP 81-1 have not been
significant.

Shipping and Handling Costs

We record the amounts we charge our customers for the shipping and
handling of our software products as product revenue and we record the
related costs as cost of product revenue on our statement of operations.
Product revenue from shipping and handling totaled $22.3 million in
fiscal 2002, $25.8 million in fiscal 2002 and $29.5 million in fiscal
2003.

Customer Service and Technical Support

Customer service and technical support costs include the costs
associated with performing order processing, answering customer
inquiries by telephone and through Web sites, e-mail and other
electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance to
customers. In connection with the sale of certain products, we provide
a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers. We
do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of
these products, since the cost of providing this free technical support
is insignificant. The technical support is provided within one year
after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements
are minimal and infrequent. We accrue the estimated cost of providing
this free support upon product shipment.

Software Development Costs

SFAS 86, “

Accounting for Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased,
or otherwise Marketed

,” requires companies to expense software
development costs as they incur them until technological feasibility has
been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the
product is available for general release to customers. To date, our
software has been available for general release concurrent with the
establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, we have not
capitalized any development costs. SFAS 2, “

Accounting for Research and
Development Costs,

” establishes accounting and reporting standards for
research and development. In accordance with SFAS 2, costs we incur to
enhance our existing products or after the general release of the
service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred
and included in research and development costs on our statement of
operations.

We capitalize costs related to the development of computer software
developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 98-1,
“

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use

.” Software obtained for internal use has generally been
enterprise level business and finance software that we customize to meet
our specific operational needs. Costs incurred in the application
development phase are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives,
generally three years. We have not sold, leased or licensed software
developed for internal use to our customers and we have no intention of
doing so in the future.

Advertising

We expense advertising costs as we incur them.

Advertising expense for
fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003 was approximately $31.6 million, $28.9
million and $31.6 million.

Per Share Computations

We compute basic income or loss per share using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. We compute
diluted income or loss per share using the weighted average number of
common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the
period. Common equivalent shares consist of the shares issuable upon
the exercise of stock options under the treasury stock method. In loss
periods, basic and dilutive loss per share are identical since the
effect of common equivalent shares is anti-dilutive and therefore
excluded.

For fiscal 2001, we excluded options to purchase 14.6 million shares of
common stock from our diluted net loss per share computation because we
experienced a net loss for the year. Our diluted net income per share
computations for fiscal 2002 and 2003 included 6.1 million and 4.7
million common equivalent shares but did not include the effect of
options to purchase 8.3 million and 8.8 million shares of common stock
because the option exercise prices were greater than the average market
price of our common stock.



Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

We consider highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or
less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents
consist primarily of money market funds in all periods presented.
Short-term investments consist of available-for-sale debt securities
that we carry at fair value. We include unrealized gains and losses on
short-term investments, net of tax, in stockholders’ equity.
Available-for-sale debt securities are classified as current assets
based upon our intent and ability to use any and all of these securities
as necessary to satisfy the significant short-term liquidity
requirements that may arise from the highly seasonal and cyclical nature
of our businesses. Because of our significant business seasonality,
cash flow requirements may fluctuate dramatically from quarter to
quarter and require us to use a significant amount of the short-term
investments held as available-for-sale securities. See Note 2.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists of cash and cash equivalents relating to
product rebates due our customers, obligations to our employees under
deferred compensation plans and amounts held in escrow for third parties
in connection with acquisitions. Rebates due our customers are in cash
on our balance sheet. Amounts due our employees under deferred
compensation plans and amounts held in escrow are in other long-term
assets on our balance sheet since we do not expect to pay these amounts
out within one year. Restricted cash consisted of the following at the
dates indicated:

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are not
interest bearing. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to
reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. We review our
accounts receivable by aging category to identify specific customers
with known disputes or collectibility issues. In determining the amount
of the reserve, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of
significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also
consider our historical level of credit losses and current economic
trends that might impact the level of future credit losses.

Marketable Securities and Other Long-term Investments

We classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale, carry them
at fair value and include unrealized gains and losses on them, net of
tax, in stockholders’ equity. We use the specific identification method
to account for gains and losses on marketable equity securities. We
include realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be
other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities in gains (losses)
on marketable securities and other investments, net on our statement of
operations. Our other long-term investments consist primarily of equity
investments in privately held companies and are stated at cost, adjusted
for declines in fair value that are considered other-than-temporary.

Investments in which we intend to maintain more than a temporary 20% to
50% interest, or over which we otherwise have the ability to exercise
significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method.
Investments in which we have less than a 20% interest and over which we
do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are carried at
the lower of cost or estimated realizable value. We monitor both equity
and cost basis investments for other than temporary declines in value
and make reductions in carrying values when appropriate.



Derivative Instruments and Change in Accounting Principle

In May 1999, we completed a $50.0 million investment (970,813 shares) in
Security First Technologies, now known as S1 Corporation. In connection
with this agreement, we received options to purchase 4.8 million
additional shares of S1 common stock at a per share purchase price of
$51.50. These options contained a net-exercise feature. We adopted
SFAS 133, “

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,

” in fiscal 2001. Accordingly, we recognize all derivatives
as either assets or liabilities on our balance sheet and measure those
instruments at fair value. In August 2000, we recorded the cumulative
effect of the change in accounting for derivatives on our 4.8 million S1
options held in long-term investments. This resulted in a one-time gain
of $14.3 million, net of income taxes totaling $9.5 million, and reduced
the basic and diluted net loss per share for fiscal 2001 by $0.07 per
share. Subsequent fluctuations in the fair value of these options were
included in our net income (loss) until we sold them. For fiscal 2001,
these fluctuations resulted in a loss of $9.7 million net of income
taxes, which increased the basic and diluted net loss per share for the
period by $0.05 per share. During the first quarter of fiscal 2002, we
sold these options and recorded a realized loss of $1.9 million.

Customer Deposits and Payroll Service Obligations

Customer deposits represent cash held on behalf of our payroll
customers. Payroll service obligations consist primarily of payroll
taxes we owe on behalf of our payroll customers.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to
30 years. We amortize leasehold improvements using the straight-line
method over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or remaining
lease terms.

Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other Long-lived Assets

We record goodwill when the purchase price of net tangible and
intangible assets we acquire exceeds their fair value. In previous
fiscal years, including fiscal 2002, we generally amortized goodwill on
a straight-line basis over periods ranging from three to five years.
However, in accordance with SFAS 142, “

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

,” we did not amortize goodwill for acquisitions completed after
June 30, 2001, and effective August 1, 2002 we no longer amortized
goodwill for acquisitions completed before July 1, 2001. We amortize
the cost of identified intangible assets on a straight-line basis over
periods ranging from one to 10 years.

We regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values of our
long-lived assets are impaired. In accordance with SFAS 142, we review
goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives
for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if an event occurs
indicating the potential for impairment. In accordance with SFAS 144,
we review intangible assets that have definite useful lives and other
long-lived assets when an event occurs indicating the potential for
impairment. In our reviews, we look for facts or circumstances, either
internal or external, indicating that we may not recover the carrying
value of the asset. We measure impairment losses related to long-lived
assets based on the amount by which the carrying amounts of these assets
exceed their fair values. Our measurement of fair value is generally
based on an analysis of the present value of estimated future discounted
cash flows. Our analysis is based on available information and
reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections. The discounted
cash flow analysis considers the likelihood of possible outcomes and is
based on our best estimate of projected future cash flows. If
necessary, we perform subsequent calculations to measure the amount of
the impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying value over the
fair value of the impaired assets.

Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers and Suppliers

We operate in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing.
Significant technological changes, changes in customer requirements, the
emergence of competitive products or services with new capabilities and
other factors could negatively impact our operating results.

We are also subject to risks related to changes in the values of our
significant balance of short-term investments. Our portfolio of
short-term investments consists primarily of investment-grade
securities. Except for direct obligations of the United States
government and money market or cash management funds, we diversify our
short-



term investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer to
a maximum of $5.0 million in each of our three managed portfolios.

We sell a significant portion of our products through third-party
retailers and distributors. As a result, we face risks related to the
collectibility of our accounts receivable. To appropriately manage this
risk, we perform ongoing evaluations of customer credit and limit the
amount of credit extended as we deem appropriate but generally do not
require collateral. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses
and these losses have historically been within our expectations.
However, since we cannot necessarily predict future changes in the
financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our
reserves will continue to be adequate.

Due to changes in our distribution arrangements during fiscal 2002, we
are selling an increasing proportion of our software products directly
to a variety of retailers rather than through a few major distributors.
No distributor or individual retailer accounted for 10% or more of total
net revenue in fiscal 2001, 2002 or 2003, nor did any customer account
for 10% or more of accounts receivable at July 31, 2002 or July 31,
2003. Amounts due from Rock Acquisition Corporation under certain
licensing and distribution agreements comprised 10.8% of accounts
receivable at July 31, 2003. See Note 9.

We rely on three third-party vendors to perform substantially all
outsourced aspects of manufacturing and distribution for our primary
desktop software products. We also have a key single-source vendor for
our financial supplies business that prints and fulfills orders for all
of our checks and most other products for our financial supplies
business. While we believe that relying heavily on key vendors improves
the efficiency and reliability of our business operations, relying on
any one vendor for a significant aspect of our business can have a
significant negative impact on our revenue and profitability if that
vendor fails to perform at acceptable service levels for any reason,
including financial difficulties of the vendor.

Foreign Currency

The functional currency of all our foreign subsidiaries is the local
currency. Assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are
translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue,
costs and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange in effect
during the year. We report translation gains and losses as a separate
component of stockholders’ equity. We include net gains and losses
resulting from foreign exchange transactions on our statement of
operations. We recorded net gains from foreign exchange transactions of
$0.1 million in fiscal 2001, $1.0 million in fiscal 2002 and $5.4
million in fiscal 2003.

Stock-Based Incentive Programs

We provide equity incentives to our employees (including those we hire
as a result of acquisitions) and to our Board members. We apply the
intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion
No. 25, “

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

,” in accounting for
stock-based incentives. Accordingly, we are not required to record
compensation expense when stock options are granted to eligible
participants as long as the exercise price is not less than the fair
market value of the stock when the option is granted. We are also not
required to record compensation expense in connection with our Employee
Stock Purchase Plan as long as the purchase price of the stock is not
less than 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the stock at the
beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period.

In October 1995 the FASB issued SFAS 123, “

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

,” and in December 2002 the FASB issued SFAS 148,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure.”

Although these pronouncements allow us to continue to follow the APB 25
guidelines and not record compensation expense for most employee
stock-based awards, we are required to disclose our pro forma net income
or loss and net income or loss per share as if we had adopted SFAS 123
and SFAS 148. The pro forma impact of applying SFAS 123 and SFAS 148 in
fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003 does not necessarily represent the pro forma
impact in future years.

To determine the pro forma impact, we have employed the widely-used
Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of options granted. This
valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of
traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. This model also requires the input of highly subjective
assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because our
outstanding stock options have characteristics significantly different
from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect this estimate, we believe the
Black-Scholes model does not provide a reliable single measure of the
fair value of our stock options.



Inputs used for the valuation model for fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003
are set forth in the table below. We base the volatility factor on the
historical volatility of our stock over the most recent five-year
period, which is approximately equal to the maximum expected life of our
options.

The following table illustrates the effect on our net income or loss and
net income or loss per share if we had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS 123 and SFAS 148 to stock-based
incentives using the Black Scholes valuation model. For purposes of
this reconciliation, we add back to previously reported net income or
loss all stock-based incentive expense we have recorded that relates to
acquisitions. We then deduct the pro forma stock-based incentive
expense determined under the fair value method for all awards including
those that relate to acquisitions. The pro forma stock-based incentive
expense has no impact on our cash flow. In the future, we may elect, or
be required, to use a different valuation model, which could result in a
significantly different impact on our pro forma net income or loss.

The weighted average fair values of options granted during fiscal 2001,
2002 and 2003 were approximately $21.77, $20.31 and $22.20.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-21,

“Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.”

Issue 00-21
provides guidance on accounting for arrangements that involve the
delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to
use assets. The provisions of Issue 00-21 will apply to revenue
arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15,
2003. We do not believe that the adoption of Issue 00-21 will have a
material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46,

“Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities.”

FIN 46 requires us to consolidate a variable
interest entity if we are subject to a majority of the risk of loss from
the variable interest entity’s activities or entitled to receive a
majority of the entity’s residual returns or both. A variable interest
entity is a corporation, partnership, trust or any other legal structure
used for business purposes that either does not have



equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not
provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its
activities. A variable interest entity often holds financial assets,
including loans or receivables, real estate or other property. A
variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in
research and development or other activities on behalf of another
company. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46 apply immediately to
variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The
consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal
year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Some of the
disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after
January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was
established. We anticipate that the adoption of FIN 46 will not have a
material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 149,

“Amendment of
Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”

Statement 149 is intended to result in more consistent reporting of
contracts as either freestanding derivative instruments subject to
Statement 133 in its entirety, or as hybrid instruments with debt host
contracts and embedded derivative features. In addition, Statement 149
clarifies the definition of a derivative by providing guidance on the
meaning of initial net investments related to derivatives. Statement
149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30,
2003. We do not believe the adoption of Statement 149 will have a
material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150,

“Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity.”

Statement 150 establishes standards for classifying and
measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody
obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities
and equity. Statement 150 represents a significant change in practice
in the accounting for a number of financial instruments, including
mandatorily redeemable equity instruments and certain equity derivatives
that are frequently used in connection with share repurchase programs.
We do not use such instruments in our share repurchase program.
Statement 150 is effective for all financial instruments created or
modified after May 31, 2003, and to other instruments as of September 1,
2003. We adopted Statement 150 on June 1, 2003 and do not believe the
effect of adopting this statement will have a material impact on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Short-Term Investments

As discussed in Note 1,

“Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant
Customers and Suppliers,”

our portfolio of short-term investments
consists primarily of investment-grade securities. Except for direct
obligations of the United States government and money market or cash
management funds, we diversify our short-term investments by limiting
our holdings with any individual issuer to a maximum of $5.0 million in
each of our three managed portfolios.

Costs

,” we capitalize costs related to the development of computer
software for internal use in accordance with SOP 98-1. During fiscal
2002 and 2003, we capitalized a total of $21.3 million and $34.3 million
of internal use software costs. These amounts included $12.9 million
and $18.0 million in capitalized labor costs for those periods. Costs
related to internal use software projects are included in the capital in
progress category of property and equipment until project completion, at
which time they are transferred to the computer software category and
amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, generally
three years.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

As discussed in Note 1, we adopted SFAS 142 on August 1, 2002. As a
result, goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to annual
impairment tests. Most other intangible assets continue to be amortized
over their estimated useful lives. In accordance with the provisions of
SFAS 142, effective August 1, 2002 we transferred the net balance of
$1.9 million for assembled workforce to goodwill and no longer amortize
that intangible asset. In connection with the transitional goodwill
impairment evaluation provisions of SFAS 142, we performed a goodwill
impairment review as of August 1, 2002 and found no impairment. We also
performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of May 31, 2003 and
found no impairment.



A reconciliation of previously reported financial results to amounts
that would have been reported if the non-amortization provisions of SFAS
142 had been in effect from the beginning of fiscal 2001 is as follows:

Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment during
fiscal 2003 were as follows. Our reportable segments are described in

Purchased intangible assets consisted of the following at the dates indicated:

The increase in customer lists in fiscal 2003 was due primarily to our
acquisition of the rights to brand and market our Premier payroll
offering directly to the customers of that service. The increase in
purchased technology in fiscal 2003 was due primarily to our acquisition
of Blue Ocean Software, Inc. See Note 7.

We summarize the following expenses on the acquisition-related charges

At July 31, 2003, we expected annual amortization of our purchased
intangible assets by fiscal year to be as shown in the following table.
Amortization of purchased intangible assets is charged primarily to
amortization of purchased software in cost of revenue and to
acquisition-related charges in operating expenses on our statement of
operations. Future acquisitions could cause these amounts to increase.
In addition, if impairment events occur they could accelerate the timing
of charges.

As discussed in Note 1, we regularly perform reviews to determine if the
carrying values of our goodwill and intangible assets may be impaired.
We look for the existence of facts and circumstances, either internal or
external, which indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be
recovered.

Fiscal 2001

During fiscal 2001, events and circumstances indicated possible
impairment of certain long-lived assets, consisting principally of
acquired intangible assets and goodwill recorded in connection with our
acquisitions of Venture Finance Software Corp. (“VFSC”) in August 2000,
SecureTax.com in August 1999 and Hutchison Avenue Software Corporation
in August 1999. These indicators included the deterioration in the
business climate for Web-based companies and management’s intentions
relating to the continuation of certain services provided by our
Personal Finance segment.

We measured the impairment loss related to long-lived assets based on
the amount by which the carrying amount of such assets exceeded their
fair values. Our measurement of fair value was based on an analysis of
the future discounted cash flows, as discussed in Note 1. In performing
this analysis, we used the best information available in the
circumstances, including reasonable and supportable assumptions and
projections. The discounted cash flow analysis considered the
likelihood of possible outcomes and was based on our best estimate of
projected future cash flows. For VFSC, we considered the terminal value
cash flows expected to result from the disposition of the assets at the
end of their useful lives. The consideration from the disposition of a
portion of VFSC, our Quicken Bill Manager business, assisted management
in the determination of the fair value of the remaining assets. Based
on our analysis as described above, we recorded impairment charges of
$51.0 million, $26.0 million, and $1.7 million to reduce the carrying
value of the goodwill associated with VFSC, SecureTax and Hutchison. In
the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we reduced the carrying value of the
remaining VFSC goodwill to zero (see

Fiscal 2002

below).

Fiscal 2002

During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, events and circumstances
indicated impairment of goodwill and intangible assets that we received
in connection with our acquisitions of an Internet-based advertising
business from VFSC in August 2000 (part of our Other Businesses segment)
and the Site Solutions business that we acquired from Boston Light Corp.
in August 1999 (part of our Small Business Products and Services
segment).

Indicators of impairment for our Internet-based advertising business
included a steep decline in demand for online advertising reflecting the
industry-wide decline in Internet advertising spending, as well as
management’s assessment that revenues and profitability would continue
to decline in the future based on analyses and forecasts completed
during the second quarter of fiscal 2002. The primary indicator of
impairment for our Site Solutions business was management’s decision to
transition the customer base of Site Solutions and collaborate with a
third party to provide the website building service. This collaboration,
which began in the second quarter of fiscal 2002, eliminated our use of
technology purchased from Boston Light.



In each case, we measured the impairment loss based on the amount by
which the carrying amount of the assets exceeded their fair value based
on lower projected profits and decreases in cash flow. Our measurement
of fair value was based on an analysis of the future discounted cash
flows as discussed in Note 1. Based on our analyses, in the second
quarter of fiscal 2002 we recorded charges of $22.6 million ($17.4
million to acquisition-related charges and $5.2 million to amortization
of purchased software) to reduce the carrying value of the assets
associated with our Internet-based advertising business to zero, and a
charge of $4.7 million ($4.6 million to acquisition-related charges and
$0.1 million to amortization of purchased software) to reduce the
carrying value of assets relating to our Site Solutions business to
zero.

Comprehensive Net Income (Loss)

SFAS 130, “

Reporting Comprehensive Income,

” establishes standards for
reporting and displaying comprehensive net income (loss) and its
components in stockholders’ equity. SFAS 130 requires the components of
other comprehensive income (loss) such as changes in the fair value of
available-for-sale securities and foreign translation adjustments to be
added to our net income (loss) to arrive at comprehensive income (loss).
Other comprehensive income (loss) items have no impact on our net
income (loss) as presented on our statement of operations.

The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of
income taxes, were as follows:



6.

Deferred Compensation

When we assume unvested stock options in connection with acquisitions,
we record deferred stock-based compensation as a reduction of
stockholders’ equity. The amount recorded is equal to the difference
between the exercise price of the unvested options and the fair market
value of Intuit stock as of the closing date of the acquisition. When
we grant restricted stock to employees that is subject to vesting, we
also record deferred stock-based compensation equal to the difference
between the purchase price and the fair market value of the stock at the
date of grant. Deferred stock-based compensation is amortized
straight-line over the vesting term of these options and restricted
stock awards.

The following table summarizes the activity in deferred stock-based
compensation:

7.

Acquisitions

The acquisitions described below have been accounted for as purchase
transactions and, accordingly, the results of operations and financial
position of the acquired businesses are included in Intuit’s
consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. We
allocate the difference between the purchase price and the net book
value of acquired tangible assets between identified intangible assets
and goodwill. Identified intangible assets consist of customer lists,
covenants not to compete, purchased technology and trade names and
logos.

Fiscal 2001

In fiscal 2001, we purchased Venture Finance Software Corp. for
approximately $118.0 million in cash. We also purchased
EmployeeMatters, Inc., in exchange for approximately $41.9 million in
Intuit common stock, the elimination of approximately $8.0 million in
bridge loans we extended to EmployeeMatters prior to the closing, and
the assumption of approximately $3.4 million in liabilities. We
acquired substantially all of the assets of Tax Accounting and Software
Corporation for $63.0 million in cash and the assumption of
approximately $7.8 million in liabilities.

Fiscal 2002

In November 2001, we acquired substantially all of the assets of OMware,
Inc. for $35.5 million or 924,973 shares of Intuit common stock,
approximately $2.1 million in the assumption of debt and bridge loans
and up to $8 million in Intuit common stock to be issued contingent upon
the achievement of future performance objectives by the business unit.
OMware was branded as Intuit Construction Business Solutions and became
part of our Vertical Business Management Solutions business segment.
ICBS provides business management software solutions for construction
companies. We allocated approximately $8.5 million of the purchase
price to identified intangible assets and recorded the excess purchase
price of $27.1 million as goodwill. The identified intangible assets
are being amortized over five years.



In May 2002, we purchased all of the outstanding stock of The Flagship
Group for approximately $23.3 million or 455,259 shares of Intuit common
stock, the assumption of $4.7 million in debt and $3.3 million in cash.
Flagship was the parent company of American Fundware, Inc., which was
branded as Intuit Public Sector Solutions and became part of our
Vertical Business Management Solutions business segment. IPSS offers
financial accounting solutions for nonprofit organizations, universities
and government agencies. In connection with the agreement, we also
assumed Flagship’s outstanding employee stock options for 1,204,000
shares of Flagship common stock, which were converted into options to
purchase 130,316 shares of Intuit common stock. We allocated
approximately $4.2 million of the purchase price to identified
intangible assets and recorded the excess purchase price of $29.6
million as goodwill. The identified intangible assets are being
amortized over terms ranging from three to 12 years.

In June 2002, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of CBS Employer
Services, Inc. for approximately $75.3 million in cash (of which $25.4
million and $16.5 million was unpaid but accrued at July 31, 2002 and
2003) and $3.2 million or 73,795 shares of Intuit common stock. CBS is
a provider of full-service outsourced payroll functions for small
businesses and became part of our Small Business Products and Services
business segment. In connection with the agreement, we also assumed
CBS’s outstanding employee stock options for 665,504 shares of CBS
common stock, which were converted into options to purchase 193,891
shares of Intuit common stock. We allocated approximately $9.3 million
of the purchase price to identified intangible assets and recorded the
excess purchase price of $74.8 million as goodwill. The identified
intangible assets are being amortized over terms ranging from five to
six years. In fiscal 2003, we reduced the goodwill related to this
acquisition by $2.6 million to reflect revisions to our restructuring
plan and other acquisition-related adjustments.

In July 2002, we purchased all of the outstanding stock of Management
Reports, Inc. for approximately $92.2 million in cash. MRI was branded
as MRI Real Estate Solutions and became part of our Vertical Business
Management Solutions business segment. MRI Real Estate Solutions
provides business management software solutions for commercial and
residential property managers. We allocated approximately $14.0 million
of the purchase price to identified intangible assets and recorded the
excess purchase price of $73.4 million as goodwill. The identified
intangible assets are being amortized over terms ranging from five to
seven years.

In July 2002, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Eclipse,
Inc. for approximately $88.3 million in cash. Eclipse was branded as
Intuit Distribution Management Solutions and became part of our Vertical
Business Management Solutions business segment. IDMS provides business
management software solutions for wholesale durable goods distributors.
We allocated approximately $35.8 million of the purchase price to
identified intangible assets and recorded the excess purchase price of
$41.4 million as goodwill. The identified intangible assets are being
amortized over terms ranging from one to seven years.



The following table shows a reconciliation of previously reported
financial results to amounts that would have been reported if we had
completed our fiscal 2002 acquisitions on August 1, 2000. Because the
pro forma acquisition date is prior to June 30, 2001, these figures
include the effects of amortization of goodwill and other identified
intangible assets from the date of acquisition through July 31, 2002.
Under the provisions of SFAS 142, we stopped amortizing goodwill on
August 1, 2002. This unaudited summary information is presented for
illustrative purposes and is not necessarily indicative of results that
would have actually occurred had these acquisitions taken place at the
beginning of fiscal 2001.

Fiscal 2003

In September 2002, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Blue
Ocean Software, Inc. for approximately $177.3 million in cash. We paid
$16.5 million of the purchase price into a third-party escrow account,
to be held for a maximum of 18 months pending the finalization of
certain financial calculations that may affect the purchase price.



To date, there have been no material adjustments to the purchase price.
Blue Ocean offers software solutions that help businesses manage their
information technology resources and assets. We acquired this company
as part of our Right for My Business strategy to offer business
solutions that go beyond accounting software to address a wider range of
management challenges that small businesses face. Blue Ocean was
branded as Intuit Information Technology Solutions and became part of
our Small Business Products and Services business segment. We allocated
approximately $13.2 million of the purchase price to purchased
technology and $7.8 million to in-process research and development,
which was charged to expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. We
recorded the excess purchase price of $150.8 million as goodwill. The
purchased technology is being amortized over six years. Blue Ocean’s
results of operations for periods prior to the date of acquisition were
not material when compared to our consolidated results.

In the past, we marketed and sold our Premier payroll offering jointly
with Wells Fargo Bank. In February 2003, we acquired for $29.2 million
in cash the rights to brand and market the offering directly to Premier
payroll customers who currently use Intuit’s service. As a result of
this agreement, we no longer pay royalties to Wells Fargo on Premier
payroll revenue. We recorded the purchase price as a purchased
intangible asset and are amortizing it on a straight-line basis to cost
of service revenue over five years, the estimated useful life of the
customer base. Total accumulated amortization for this asset was $2.7
million at July 31, 2003.

In July 2003, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Income
Dynamics, Inc. for approximately $10.0 million or 224,589 shares of
Intuit common stock and $0.3 million in cash. Income Dynamics offers
software that provides tools for taxpayers to determine the fair market
value of items donated to charities. Income Dynamics became part of our
Consumer Tax business segment. We allocated approximately $3.2 million
of the purchase price to identified intangible assets and recorded the
excess purchase price of $7.9 million as goodwill. The identified
intangible assets are being amortized over terms ranging from two to
five years. Income Dynamics’ results of operations for periods prior to
the date of acquisition were not material when compared to our
consolidated results.

Purchase prices for the acquisitions described above have been allocated
on the basis of their fair values on the acquisition dates as follows:

Deferred stock compensation is recorded in stockholders’ equity and is
being amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options using
the straight-line method. Until July 31, 2002, goodwill was amortized
over estimated useful lives that ranged from three to five years. We
implemented SFAS 142 on August 1, 2002 and as a result no longer
amortize goodwill. We amortize most other intangible assets over their
estimated useful lives, which range from one to 10 years. See Note 1
and Note 4.

Divestitures

In January 2001, we sold certain assets of our Quicken Insurance
business to InsWeb Corporation for approximately $10.8 million of InsWeb
common stock. As a result of the divestiture, we recorded a pre-tax
gain of $1.6 million and a related tax provision of $0.6 million in
fiscal 2001.

In May 2001, we sold the stock of Venture Finance Software Corp., which
held the technology assets of our Quicken Bill Manager business, to
Princeton eCom Corporation. In exchange for these assets, Intuit was
entitled to receive, at Princeton eCom’s election, either approximately
20% of Princeton eCom fully diluted common stock or cash payments of a
minimum of $37.0 million or a combination of stock and cash. In
connection with this disposition, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $16.9
million and a related tax benefit of $6.4 million in fiscal 2001. At
July 31, 2001, these contractual rights were valued at $27.0 million.
In fiscal 2002, we determined that this asset was impaired and recorded
a charge to reduce the carrying value of our investment to its fair
value of zero. See Note 10.

In March 2002, we paid $12.0 million to terminate our remaining $20.3
million obligation under an interactive services agreement related to
our Quicken Bill Manager business. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $8.3
million and related tax expense of $2.7 million in fiscal 2002 in
connection with the termination of this agreement.

9.

Discontinued Operations

Quicken Loans

In July 2002, we sold 87.5% of our Quicken Loans mortgage business to
Rock Acquisition Corporation. We retained a 12.5% non-voting equity
interest in Rock, which we accounted for on a cost basis. In October
2002, we sold our minority interest in Rock to Rock’s majority
shareholders and recorded a $5.6 million gain on the transaction.

In connection with the sale, we received a five-year secured promissory
note in the principal amount of $23.3 million with market interest
rates, which was recorded as a long-term note receivable at July 31,
2002. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $23.3 million on the
disposal of discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2002. In October 2002, we received payment in full of the $23.3 million
promissory note and related accrued interest due from Rock.

We accounted for the sale of Quicken Loans as discontinued operations in
accordance with APB Opinion No. 30. The net assets, operating results
and cash flows of Quicken Loans have been segregated from continuing
operations on our balance sheets, statements of operations and
statements of cash flows for all periods prior to the sale.

As part of the sale transaction, we also agreed to provide a line of
credit of up to $375.0 million to fund mortgage loans for a transition
period of up to six months. The line of credit was secured by the
related mortgage loans and the interest rate was based on the six-month
LIBOR rate plus 1.5%. At July 31, 2002, the balance outstanding on this
line of credit was $245.6 million and was included on our balance sheet
under amounts due from discontinued operations entities. The line was
repaid in full in January 2003.



Concurrent with the sale, Rock licensed the right to use our Quicken
Loans trademark for its residential home loan and home equity loan
products. We also entered into a five-year distribution agreement with
Rock through which it will provide mortgage services on Quicken.com. We
will receive a minimum royalty of $1.75 million a year for five years
under the licensing agreement and minimum fees of $0.75 million a year
under the distribution agreement. The royalties from the licensing
agreement and the fees from the distribution agreement are recorded as
earned and included in interest and other income on our statement of
operations. For fiscal 2003, we recorded royalties of $1.75 million
under the trademark licensing agreement and fees of $8.3 million under
the distribution agreement. Fees due from Rock under these agreements
totaled $9.5 million at July 31, 2003 and are included in accounts
receivable on our balance sheet.

Intuit KK

In February 2003, we sold all of the outstanding stock of our wholly
owned Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, to Advantage Partners, Inc., a
private equity investment firm located in Japan, for 9.5 billion yen or
approximately $79.0 million. Intuit KK was part of our Other Businesses
business segment. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets,”

we
accounted for the sale as discontinued operations. The net assets,
operating results and cash flows of Intuit KK have therefore been
segregated from continuing operations on our balance sheets, statements
of operations and statements of cash flows for all periods prior to the
sale. We recorded a gain on disposal of discontinued operations of
$71.0 million, net of income taxes of $5.1 million, in the third quarter
of fiscal 2003.

Discontinued Operations Net Revenue and Income Before Income Taxes

Discontinued operations net revenue and income before income taxes for
the periods presented were as follows:

10.

Loss on Impairment of Long-lived Asset

In connection with the sale of our Quicken Bill Manager business in May
2001, we acquired a $27.0 million long-term asset related to future
consideration from Princeton eCom. See Note 8. During fiscal 2002,
events and circumstances indicated impairment of this asset. These
indicators included the deterioration of Princeton eCom’s financial
position and the decreased likelihood that it would receive future
funding. Based on our analysis we determined that the fair value of
this asset was impaired and recorded a charge of $27.0 million in fiscal
2002 to reduce its carrying value to zero.



11.

Industry Segment and Geographic Information

SFAS 131, “

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information,

” establishes standards for the way in which public
companies disclose certain information about operating segments in their
financial reports. Consistent with SFAS 131, we have defined six
reportable segments, described below, based on factors such as how we
manage our operations and how our chief operating decision maker views
results. We define the chief operating decision maker as our chief
executive officer, our chief financial officer, certain vice presidents
reporting directly to our chief executive officer and our Board of
Directors.

In fiscal 2003, we revised our reportable segments to reflect the way we
currently manage and view our businesses. We determined that the
QuickBooks product component of our fiscal 2002 Small Business segment
was a separate reportable segment and we combined our fiscal 2002
Employer Services segment with the balance of Small Business to arrive
at the fiscal 2003 segment called Small Business Products and Services.
We began reporting Vertical Business Management Solutions (formerly
Small Business Verticals) as a separate segment in fiscal 2003.
Finally, we combined our fiscal 2002 Personal Finance and Global
Business segments to arrive at the fiscal 2003 segment called Other
Businesses. In addition, in fiscal 2003 we no longer allocated certain
operating costs to our reporting segments, and we changed the way in
which we allocated other operating costs between reporting segments. We
have therefore reclassified previously reported fiscal 2002 and 2001
segment results to conform to the fiscal 2003 presentation.

All reportable segments except Small Business Products and Services,
Vertical Business Management Solutions and Other Businesses operate
solely in the United States. All segments sell primarily to customers
located in the United States. International total net revenue was less
than 5% of consolidated total net revenue for all periods presented.

QuickBooks product revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks desktop
software products. QuickBooks service revenue is derived from
QuickBooks Online Edition.

Small Business Products and Services product revenue is comprised of
QuickBooks Do-It-Yourself Payroll, financial supplies and information
technology management software. Service revenue for this segment is
derived primarily from outsourced payroll services and from QuickBooks
support plans. Other revenue for this segment consists of royalties
from small business online transactions.

Consumer Tax product revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax federal
and state consumer desktop tax return preparation software. Consumer
Tax service revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax for the Web
online tax return preparation services and consumer electronic filing
services. Other revenue for this segment is nominal.

Professional Accounting Solutions product revenue is derived primarily
from ProSeries and Lacerte professional tax preparation software
products. Professional Accounting Solutions service revenue is derived
primarily from electronic filing and training services.

Vertical Business Management Solutions (“VBMS”) revenue is derived from
four businesses that we acquired in fiscal 2002 that provide small
business management solutions for selected industries, which we call
“Verticals.” Those businesses are Intuit Distribution Management
Solutions, MRI Real Estate Solutions, Intuit Construction Business
Solutions and Intuit Public Sector Solutions. VBMS product revenue is
derived from business management software for these industries. VBMS
service revenue consists primarily of technical support, consulting and
training services.

Other Businesses consist primarily of Personal Finance and Canada.
Personal Finance product revenue is derived primarily from Quicken
desktop software products. Personal Finance service revenue is nominal
while other revenue consists of fees from consumer online transactions
and Quicken.com advertising revenue. In Canada, product revenue is
derived primarily from localized versions of QuickBooks and Quicken as
well as QuickTax and TaxWiz consumer desktop tax return preparation
software and ProFile professional tax preparation products. Service
revenue in Canada consists primarily of revenue from software
maintenance contracts sold with QuickBooks.

Corporate includes costs such as corporate general and administrative
expenses that are not allocated to specific segments. Corporate also
includes reconciling items such as acquisition-related costs (which
include acquisition-related charges, amortization of purchased software
and charges for purchased research and development), realized net gains
or losses on marketable securities and interest and other income.



The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those
described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1.
Except for goodwill and purchased intangible assets, we do not generally
track assets by reportable segment and, consequently, we do not disclose
assets by reportable segment.

The following tables show our financial results by reportable segment
for fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003.

Commitments

Reserve for Vacant Facilities

During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we concluded that we would not
occupy two vacant leased buildings in Mountain View, California and that
we would be unable to recover a substantial portion of our lease
obligations by subleasing the vacant space. The resulting $13.2 million
charge to our statement of operations was equal to the remaining future
lease commitments for these facilities, net of estimated future sublease
income. The estimated costs of abandoning these leased facilities
reflected management’s best estimates based on market information and
trend analyses we compiled.

We evaluate our assumptions quarterly for any potentially significant
change to our vacancy reserves. During the fourth quarter of fiscal
2003, we decided that based on corporate growth requirements and the
current real estate market in the San Francisco Bay Area, we would
reoccupy one of these two vacant buildings. As a result of this change
in estimate, we reversed the remaining $1.9 million reserve for the
lease obligations on that building to our statement of operations. At
the same time, we added $1.4 million to the reserve for the other vacant
Mountain View building to reflect our revised estimate of future
sublease income for that facility. Based on revised estimates, we also
reversed approximately $0.6 million in reserves related to various
smaller facilities for a total credit for vacant facilities of $1.1
million to our statement of operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2003.

Our actual future cash payments may exceed the total Mountain View
reserve balance at July 31, 2003 by a maximum of $2.8 million if we are
unable to sublease the remaining reserved Mountain View property. We
expect to use the total reserve by the end of fiscal 2010. Activity in
the reserve for vacant Mountain View facilities for the fiscal years
ended July 31, 2002 and 2003 was as follows:



CBS Employer Services Acquisition Accrual

We acquired CBS Employer Services, Inc. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002.
See Note 7. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded a total accrual
of $26.4 million that included $21.6 million for purchase price deferrals and
$4.8 million for restructuring and transaction costs. In fiscal 2003, we
reduced the restructuring accrual by $3.4 million and reduced the goodwill
related to this acquisition by the same amount to reflect revisions to our
restructuring plan. Activity in this reserve for fiscal 2002 and 2003 was as
follows:

The short-term and long-term components of this reserve and their
location on our balance sheet were as follows at the dates indicated:

income for those facilities. See

Income Taxes

Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and
cumulative effect of accounting change included income from foreign
operations of $4.6 million and $8.0 million for fiscal 2001 and 2002 and
a loss from foreign operations of $0.7 million for fiscal 2003. The
provision (benefit) for income taxes from continuing operations
consisted of the following:

We have provided a valuation reserve related to the benefits of losses

that we believe are unlikely to be realized. The valuation allowance
did not change in fiscal 2001, decreased by $4.7 million in fiscal 2002
and increased by $0.7 million in fiscal 2003.

At July 31, 2003, we had U.S. federal and foreign net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $16.4 million and $2.6 million. These
net operating losses will expire at various dates beginning in fiscal
2011 if not utilized. At July 31, 2003, we also had various state tax
credit carryforwards totaling approximately $22.7 million. The state
credit carryforwards have no expiration date. Utilization of the net
operating loss and credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial
annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The annual limitation may
result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization.

Stockholders’ Equity

Stock Option Plans

Our 1993 Equity Incentive Plan terminated on January 18, 2002 when our
stockholders approved our 2002 Equity Incentive Plan to replace the 1993
Plan. When the 1993 Plan terminated, all outstanding options under the
1993 Plan remained in effect in accordance with their terms. There were
3,809,906 shares available for grant under the 1993 Plan at its
termination. We transferred 1,900,000 of these shares to our new 2002
Plan to be available for grant under that plan. The remaining 1,909,906
shares ceased to be available for grant under any of our equity
compensation plans. Under the 1993 Plan, we were permitted to grant
incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards,
stock bonuses and performance awards to employees, directors,
consultants, and independent contractors of and advisors to Intuit. The
Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board of
Directors or its delegees determined who would receive grants,
exercisability, exercise price and other terms. The option exercise
price was generally the fair market value at the date of grant. The
outstanding options generally vest over four years based on continued
service and expire after ten years.

Under the 2002 Plan, we may grant incentive and non-qualified stock
options, restricted stock awards and stock bonuses to employees,
directors, consultants, and independent contractors of and advisors to
Intuit. The Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of
the Board of Directors or its delegees determines who will receive
grants, exercisability, exercise price and other terms. The option
exercise price is generally the fair market value at the date of grant.
During fiscal 2002, Intuit changed its standard option vesting schedule
for the 2002 Plan so that future options granted generally become
exercisable over a three-year period based on continued service and
expire seven years after the grant date. Prior to that change, options
vested over four years and expired ten years after the grant date.
During fiscal 2003, we launched a mandatory share ownership program.
Under this program all senior vice presidents, the executive vice
president and Board members are required to hold a minimum of 3,000
shares by the later of May 2006 or three years from the date the
individual becomes subject to the share ownership program. The chief
executive officer is required to hold 100,000 shares. To provide an
incentive to the senior vice presidents and the executive vice
president, we implemented a matching unit component to the share



ownership program. Under this matching unit program, we grant one share
under a stock bonus award under the 2002 Plan, up to a maximum of 1,500
shares, for each two shares one of these officers purchases during the
next three years. These matching units vest as to 100% of the shares
subject to the stock bonus award four years after grant, or earlier on
the officer’s retirement, death or disability. We record deferred
compensation expense for these matching units based on the fair value of
the award at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense at the
time the matching units vest. We awarded a total of 2,849 matching
units during fiscal 2003.

On October 7, 1996, we adopted the 1996 Directors Stock Option Plan.
This plan provides for non-qualified stock options for a specified
number of shares to be granted to all non-employee directors of Intuit.
As of December 2002, Board members who serve on the Audit Committee,
Compensation and Organizational Development Committee and Nominating and
Governance Committee receive additional annual grants. The option
exercise price equals the fair market value at the date of grant. Most
options are subject to vesting over time based on continued service,
with vesting periods ranging from one to four years. All options expire
after ten years.

On November 11, 1998, we adopted the 1998 Option Plan for Mergers and
Acquisitions. Under the 1998 Plan, we may grant non-qualified stock
options to individuals who we hire as a result of our acquisitions of,
or mergers with, other companies. The 1998 Plan was designed to meet
the “broadly based plans” exemption from the stockholder approval
requirement for stock option plans under the Nasdaq Stock Market listing
requirements at the time the plan was adopted and, accordingly, has not
been submitted to Intuit stockholders for approval. Options under the
1998 Plan can only be granted to eligible individuals within 18 months
following the completion of the relevant acquisition or merger. Options
granted to officers hired as a result of a merger or acquisition cannot
exceed 45% of all shares reserved for grant under the 1998 Plan.
Options granted under the 1998 Plan cannot have an exercise price that
is less than the fair market value of Intuit’s common stock on the date
of grant. During fiscal 2002, Intuit changed its standard option
vesting schedule for the 1998 Plan so that future options granted
generally become exercisable over a three-year period based on continued
service and expire seven years after the grant date. Prior to that
change, options generally vested over four years and expired ten years
after the grant date.

In addition, in several instances we have assumed the outstanding
options of companies that we acquired. Intuit granted no further
options under the acquired companies’ option plans after the date of
acquisition. We assumed options in connection with our acquisitions of
EmployeeMatters, Inc. in January 2001, The Flagship Group in May 2002
and CBS Employer Services, Inc. in June 2002.



A summary of activity under all option plans is as follows:

(1)

Includes 2,364,140 shares reflecting options that were canceled
and not returned to any option pool because they were granted under
expired plans, and 1,909,906 shares that were eliminated from
shares available for grant in connection with the termination of
the 1993 Plan.



We define net option grants as options granted less options canceled or
expired and returned to the pool of options available for grant. We
also monitor net option grants by subtracting from options granted both
canceled or expired options that were returned to the pool of options
available for grant and options canceled from expired plans. Net option
grants under these two methods in shares and as a percentage of shares
outstanding for fiscal 2001, 2002, and 2003 are shown in the following

Stock Repurchase Programs

In May 2001, Intuit’s Board of Directors initiated Repurchase Plan I and
authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million of its common
stock from time to time over a three-year period. In July 2002, our
Board of Directors increased the authorized purchase amount by $250.0
million to a total of $750.0 million. Shares of stock repurchased under
the program became treasury shares. The stock repurchase program was
concluded in December 2002 when the authorized purchase amount under the
program was reached.

In March 2003, Intuit’s Board of
Directors initiated Repurchase Plan II
and authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million of its
common stock from time to time over a three-year period. Shares of
stock repurchased under this program become treasury shares.

When we reissue treasury shares, if the proceeds from the sale are more
than the average price we paid to acquire the shares we record an
increase in additional paid-in capital. Conversely, if the proceeds
from the sale are less than the average price we paid to acquire the
shares, we record a decrease in additional paid-in capital to the extent
of increases previously recorded for similar transactions and a decrease
in retained earnings for any remaining amount.

Shares repurchased under the plans described above from the inception of
the plans had no significant impact on our basic and diluted net income
or loss per share in fiscal 2001 or 2002 while they increased our basic
and diluted net income per share by $0.13 and $0.12 in fiscal 2003.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In October 1996, Intuit adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code and reserved 3,800,000 shares
of common stock for issuance under that Plan. Since its adoption, our
stockholders have approved several share increases to the ESPP. At July
31, 2003, stockholders had approved a total of 4,900,000 shares for
issuance under the ESPP. In July 2003, the ESPP was amended, subject to
stockholder approval, to increase the number of shares of common stock
reserved for issuance under the Plan by 500,000 shares to 5,400,000
shares. The ESPP has been amended twice to increase the frequency of
new offering periods under the Plan as well as the frequency of share
purchases in those offering periods. Effective after the June 2003
purchase, the ESPP’s twelve-month rolling concurrent offering periods
are now composed of four three-month accrual periods at the end of which
eligible employees may purchase shares at a discount. The discount at
which the employee will be able to purchase shares under the ESPP will
depend on the offering period in which she or he is participating since
each rolling twelve-month offering period will be in its first, second,
third or fourth three-month accrual



period. The purchase price will be 85% of the lower of the closing
price for Intuit common stock on the first day of the twelve-month
offering period in which the employee is participating or the last day
of the three-month accrual period of that offering period. During
fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003 employees purchased 469,873, 583,991 and
476,454 shares of Intuit common stock under the ESPP. At July 31, 2003,
there were 1,885,016 shares available for issuance under this Plan, not
including the 500,000 shares that are pending stockholder approval.

Performance Sharing and Benefit Plans

Performance Sharing Plan

Intuit employees who are eligible for overtime pay are generally
eligible to participate in Intuit’s performance sharing plan. Prior to
fiscal 2003, certain employees who were not eligible for overtime pay
were eligible to participate in the performance sharing plan. Under the
performance sharing plan, all eligible employees receive awards that are
calculated as a percentage of the wages paid to them during six-month
performance periods. The Compensation and Organizational Development
Committee of the Board of Directors determines the percentage to be
paid, which is the same for all eligible employees, for each performance
period under the plan. Performance sharing expense for fiscal 2001,
2002 and 2003 was approximately $21.9 million, $17.6 million and $5.3
million.

Intuit Performance Incentive Plan

In fiscal 2003 we initiated the Intuit Performance Incentive Plan, a
broad-based incentive plan that replaced the Intuit Performance Sharing
Plan for many Intuit employees. Most Intuit employees who are
ineligible for overtime pay are eligible for the IPI Plan. The
Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board of
Directors determines the aggregate amount to be paid under the IPI Plan
each fiscal year. IPI Plan expense for fiscal 2003 was approximately
$65.0 million.

Executive Deferred Compensation Plan

Intuit adopted the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan effective March
15, 2002. The plan allows executives who meet minimum compensation
requirements to defer up to 50% of their salaries and up to 100% of
their bonuses and commissions. We have agreed to credit the
participants’ contributions with earnings that reflect the performance
of certain independent investment funds. We may also make discretionary
employer contributions to participant accounts. The timing, amounts and
vesting schedules of employer contributions are at our sole discretion.
The benefits under this plan are unsecured and are general assets of
Intuit. Participants are generally eligible to receive payment of their
vested benefit at the end of their elected deferral period or after
termination of their employment with Intuit for any reason.
Discretionary company contributions and the related earnings vest
completely upon the participant’s disability, death or a change of
control of Intuit. We made no employer contributions to the plan during
fiscal 2002 and $0.2 million in employer contributions to the plan
during fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2003, we also entered into several
agreements in which we committed to make fully vested employer
contributions on behalf of certain executives provided that they remain
employed at Intuit on certain future dates. We held assets and
liabilities of $0.3 million at July 31, 2002 and $5.7 million at July
31, 2003 related to this plan in other assets and in other current
liabilities on our balance sheet.

Benefit Plans

Employees who participate in the Intuit 401(k) Plan may contribute up to
20% of pre-tax salary to the plan, subject to Internal Revenue Service
limitations. Intuit matches a specified portion of the employee
contributions up to a maximum amount per employee per year. The amount
is subject to change on an annual basis. At July 31, 2002 and 2003, the
match was 75%, up to $2,500. Matching contributions were approximately
$6.9 million, $8.4 million and $10.9 million for fiscal 2001, 2002 and
2003. Participating employees age 50 or older may also make catch-up
contributions. These contributions are not matched.

17.

Stockholder Rights Plan

On April 29, 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights
plan designed to protect the long-term value of Intuit for its
stockholders during any future unsolicited acquisition attempt. In
connection with the plan, the Board declared a dividend of one preferred
share purchase right for each share of Intuit’s common stock outstanding
on May 11, 1998 (the “Record Date”) and further directed the issuance of
one such right with respect to each share of Intuit’s common stock that
is issued after the Record Date, except in certain circumstances. If a
person or a group



(an “Acquiring Person”) acquires 20% or more of Intuit’s common stock,
or announces an intention to make a tender offer for Intuit’s common
stock, the consummation of which would result in a person or group
becoming an Acquiring Person, then the rights will be distributed (the
“Distribution Date”). After the Distribution Date, each right may be
exercised for 1/3000th of a share of a newly designated Series B Junior
Participating Preferred stock. In January 2003, the Board amended the
rights plan to change the exercise price for the rights from $83.33 per
1/3 of 1/1000th share to $300.00 per 1/3 of 1/1000th share. The
preferred stock has been structured so that the value of 1/3000th of a
share of this preferred stock will approximate the value of one share of
common stock. The rights will expire on May 1, 2008. In July 2002, we
adopted a policy that requires an independent committee of our Board of
Directors to review the rights plan at least once every three years to
consider whether maintaining the rights plan continues to be in the best
interests of Intuit and its stockholders.

18.

Litigation

On March 3, 2000, a class action lawsuit, Bruce v. Intuit Inc., was
filed in the United States District Court, Central District of
California, Eastern Division. Two virtually identical lawsuits were
later filed: Rubin v. Intuit Inc., was filed on March 8, 2000 in the
United States District Court, Southern District of New York and Newby v.
Intuit Inc. was filed on April 27, 2000, in the United States District
Court, Central District of California, Eastern Division. The Rubin case
was dismissed on November 19, 2001. The Bruce and Newby lawsuits were
consolidated into one lawsuit, In re Intuit Privacy Litigation, filed on
July 28, 2000 in the United States District Court, Central District of
California, Eastern Division. Following Intuit’s successful motion to
dismiss several of the claims, an amended complaint was filed on May 2,
2001. A similar lawsuit, Almanza v. Intuit Inc. was filed on March 22,
2000 in the Superior Court of the State of California, San Bernardino
County, Rancho Cucamonga Division. An amended complaint in the Almanza
suit was filed on October 26, 2000. These purported class actions
alleged violations of various federal and California statutes and common
law claims for invasion of privacy based upon the alleged intentional
disclosure to third parties of personal and private customer information
entered at Intuit’s Quicken.com Web site. The complaints sought
injunctive relief, orders to disgorge profits related to the alleged
acts, and statutory and other damages. On January 6, 2003, a settlement
between Intuit and the plaintiffs’ counsel in all of the remaining cases
was preliminarily approved by the federal court with a final approval
hearing scheduled for June 2003. The settlement was approved by the
federal court in June 2003 and this and a related litigation in state
court have been dismissed. The settlement terms are not material to
Intuit.

Leonard Knable et al. v. Intuit Inc. was filed in Los Angeles County
Superior Court on February 24, 2003. The lawsuit alleges various claims
for unfair practices and deceptive and misleading advertising, fraud and
deceit and product liability, on behalf of a purported class. The
allegations are based on the design and operation of the product
activation feature in Intuit’s TurboTax 2002 for Windows desktop
software and Intuit’s representations and disclosures about product
activation. The complaint seeks disgorgement of revenue from the sale
of the product, compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive relief and
attorneys’ fees and costs. Discovery has been served by all parties.
Intuit has filed a motion to dismiss the causes of action in the
complaint. Discovery is stayed pending the court’s decision on this
motion.

Intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings, as well as
demands, claims and threatened litigation, that arise in the normal
course of our business. We currently believe that the ultimate amount
of liability, if any, for any pending claims of any type (either alone
or combined) will not materially affect our financial position, results
of operations or liquidity. However, the ultimate outcome of any
litigation is uncertain, and either unfavorable or favorable outcomes
could have a material negative impact. Regardless of outcome,
litigation can have an adverse impact on Intuit because of defense
costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.

Related Party Transactions

Loans to Executive Officers and Other Employees

Prior to July 30, 2002, loans to executive officers were generally made
in connection with their relocation and purchase of a residence near
their new place of work. Consistent with the requirements of the
Sarbanes-Oxley legislation enacted on July 30, 2002, we have not made or
modified any loans to executive officers since July 30, 2002. We do not
intend to make or modify any loans to executive officers in the future.



Loans to executive officers and other employees at July 31, 2002 and
2003 were as follows:

executive officers totaling approximately $1.1 million were also repaid
during fiscal 2003.

Of the total loans to executive officers at July 31, 2003, $9.4 million
accrue no interest for either the term of the note or for up to four
years. The remaining loans to executive officers at July 31, 2003
accrue interest at rates equal to the applicable federal rates in effect
at the time the loans were made. Of the total outstanding loans to
executive officers and other employees at July 31, 2003, loans with a
remaining principal balance of $18.6 million were secured by real
property. The loans have terms that range from one to ten years.

Repurchase of Vested Restricted Stock

In March 2003, our chief executive officer vested in 37,500 shares of
restricted stock. To provide Mr. Bennett with the funds to pay the
related payroll tax withholding obligation we repurchased from him
17,532 shares of common stock at $39.02 per share, the closing market
price of Intuit stock on the date the restricted stock vested.

Selected Quarterly Consolidated Financial Data (Unaudited)

The following tables contain selected quarterly consolidated financial
data for fiscal years 2002 and 2003. We accounted for the July 2002
sale of our Quicken Loans mortgage business segment and the February
2003 sale of our Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, as discontinued
operations. As a result, the operating results of Quicken Loans and
Intuit KK have been segregated from continuing operations in our
consolidated financial statements and in these tables. See Note 9. In
addition, we amortized certain goodwill during fiscal 2002 but ceased
amortizing goodwill when we adopted SFAS 142 on August 1, 2002. This
affects the comparability of quarterly results for fiscal 2002 and 2003.
See Note 4.

Events Subsequent to Date of Independent Auditor’s Report (Unaudited)

Acquisition

On July 22, 2003, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all
of the membership interests of Innovative Merchant Solutions LLC (“IMS”)
and a related entity doing business as Innovative Gateway Solutions for
an aggregate purchase price of up to $116.0 million in cash. IMS offers
a full range of merchant account services to small businesses
nationwide, including credit and debit card processing services. As
part of our Right for My Business strategy, Intuit plans to operate IMS
as a separate business unit under its Small Business Products and
Services segment. IMS will continue to be led by its current chief
executive officer and will be headquartered in Calabasas, California.
The transaction has been approved by Intuit’s Board of Directors and by
the members of IMS and Innovative Gateway Solutions and is expected to
close in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 upon the satisfaction of
remaining closing conditions.

Stock Repurchase Plan

In August 2003, Intuit’s Board of Directors initiated Repurchase Plan III and
authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million of its common stock
from time to time over a three-year period. Shares of stock repurchased under
this program will become treasury shares.

Litigation

On September 17, 2003, Muriel Siebert
& Co., Inc. v. Intuit Inc. was filed in the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York. The lawsuit alleges various
claims for breach of contract, breach of express and implied covenants
of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty,
misrepresentation and/or fraud, and promissory estoppel. The
allegations relate to Quicken Brokerage powered by Siebert, a
strategic alliance between the two companies. The complaint seeks
compensatory, punitive, and other damages. Intuit has not been served
with the complaint. Intuit believes this lawsuit is without merit and
intends to defend the litigation vigorously.
