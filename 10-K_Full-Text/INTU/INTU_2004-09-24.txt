BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Intuit’s Mission: Transforming Business and Financial Management

Intuit’s mission is to transform the way people run their businesses and manage
their financial lives. Our goal is to create solutions so profound and simple
that customers wouldn’t dream of going back to their old ways of keeping their
books, managing their businesses, preparing their or their clients’ taxes, or
organizing their personal finances.

We have three business portfolios: Small Business, Tax and Other. These three
portfolios contain a total of five business segments, as discussed below.

Small Business

. Our Small Business portfolio consists of two segments,
QuickBooks-Related and Intuit-Branded Small Business.

•

QuickBooks-Related includes our QuickBooks accounting and business
management software as well as the products and services that people
add on to QuickBooks. These include financial supplies, Do-It-Yourself
Payroll, technical support and merchant services.

•

Intuit-Branded Small Business products and services are designed
primarily for small businesses but do not carry the QuickBooks brand or
require the use of QuickBooks. Intuit-Branded Small Business offerings



include outsourced payroll, information technology management solutions
and solutions designed to meet the specialized needs of businesses in
four selected industries.

Tax

.

Our Tax portfolio consists of two segments, Consumer Tax and Professional Tax.

•

Consumer Tax includes our TurboTax consumer tax return preparation products and services.

•

Professional Tax includes our ProSeries and Lacerte professional tax products and services.

Other

. Our Other portfolio contains one business segment, Other Businesses.
This segment consists primarily of our Quicken personal finance products and
services and our Canadian business.

Company Growth Strategy

Intuit has a tradition of successful customer-driven invention — applying
technology to address complex customer problems and develop solutions that make
tasks simpler. This tradition has allowed us to build a strong portfolio of
businesses that are dedicated to satisfying a variety of customer needs. By
applying strategic and operational rigor to this foundation, we believe we can
continue to deliver solid revenue and profit growth.

Three key fundamentals support our growth strategy:

•

We carefully choose the businesses we’re in, focusing primarily on
small business and tax. We choose to be in businesses with large,
underserved market opportunities where we believe we have the strategic
and durable advantage to produce long-term profitable growth. We’ve
made a number of acquisitions and divestitures in the past several
years to adjust our business portfolio so that it remains consistent
with this focus.

•

We expand our tradition of customer-driven invention by looking for
significant new customer problems and challenging conventional wisdom
to create solutions for customers and generate profitable growth for
Intuit.

•

We use operational rigor and process excellence methodology, tools
and resources to execute more effectively on a daily basis. Our goal is
better customer experiences at lower cost.

Customer-Driven Product Strategy

Our focus on customer needs is embodied in our overarching Right for Me product
strategy. This strategy is carried out through a number of business-specific
initiatives. Using the Right for Me approach, we seek to gain a deep
understanding of a broad range of customer needs in our targeted markets.
Building on this knowledge, we then develop products and services to meet those
specific needs. For example, in December 2001 we launched our small business
Right for Me product strategy, taking a customer-driven rather than a “one size
fits all” approach to small business product development. As a result, we have
expanded our QuickBooks product line to offer industry-specific versions of
QuickBooks for small businesses as well as versions of QuickBooks designed for
bigger, more complex companies, addressing the market opportunity for
businesses with up to 250 employees. Similarly, we are pursuing multi-year,
customer-driven strategies in our Consumer Tax, Professional Tax and Other
Businesses segments. See

“Products and Services”

below for more information on
these business-specific initiatives.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

Intuit offers products and services in five business segments:
QuickBooks-Related, Intuit-Branded Small Business, Consumer Tax, Professional
Tax and Other Businesses. Our primary products and services are sold mainly in
the United States and are described below. For financial information about
these businesses, see

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations”

and Note 11 to the financial statements.



Classes of similar products or services that accounted for 10% or more of total
net revenue in fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004 were as follows:

QuickBooks-Related

QuickBooks

. Our QuickBooks product line brings bookkeeping capabilities and
business management tools to small business users in an easy-to-use design that
does not require them to be familiar with debit/credit accounting. As part of
our Right for Me strategy, we offer a range of products to suit the needs of
different types of small businesses. These include QuickBooks Basic, which
provides accounting functionality suitable for smaller, less complex
businesses; QuickBooks Pro, which supports up to five simultaneous users;
QuickBooks Premier, for small businesses needing more advanced accounting
functionality; and QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions Business Management
Software, designed for businesses with up to 250 employees. Our Premier and

including Accountant, Manufacturing and Wholesale, Retail, Non-Profit,
Contractor, and Professional Services. QuickBooks Online Edition provides
Web-based financial management tools that link multiple users and locations.

As part of our Right for Me strategy, we also offer the following business
solutions that go beyond accounting software to address a variety of small
business needs.

QuickBooks Point of Sale

. Our QuickBooks Point of Sale offering helps
retailers manage customer transactions. The Basic version is suitable for
single stores that want to ring up sales using barcodes and track inventory and
customer purchases. The Pro version offers more advanced functionality such as
serial number tracking and the ability to process layaways and special orders
while the Pro Multi-Store version allows the transfer of information between
stores.

Financial Supplies

. We offer a range of financial supplies designed for small
businesses and individuals. These include paper checks, envelopes, invoices,
deposit slips, stationery and business cards. We also offer tax forms, tax
return presentation folders and other supplies for professional tax preparers.
Our customers can personalize many products to incorporate their logos and use
a variety of color, font and design options.

QuickBooks Do-It-Yourself Payroll

. Provides payroll tax tables, forms and
electronic tax payment and filing on a subscription basis to small businesses
that prepare their own payrolls.

QuickBooks Technical Support

. We offer several technical support options to
our QuickBooks customers. These include a free self-help information section on
our QuickBooks.com Web site as well as support plans that are sold separately
and priced based on the level of personal assistance and response time the
customer requires.

Innovative Merchant Solutions

. We offer a full range of merchant services to
small businesses nationwide. These include credit and debit card processing
services and Web-based transaction processing services for online merchants.

Intuit Developer Network

. The Intuit Developer Network is an initiative that
encourages third-party software developers to build applications that exchange
data with QuickBooks and other Intuit products by giving them access to certain
application programming interfaces. At the end of fiscal 2004, there were
approximately 30,700 registered IDN developers and 345 third-party applications
available for QuickBooks and other Intuit products.



Intuit-Branded Small Business

We offer Intuit-branded business management solutions for small and
medium-sized businesses that include outsourced payroll, information technology
management solutions and accounting and business management solutions designed
to meet the specialized requirements of businesses in four selected industries.

Outsourced Payroll

. Our outsourced payroll services consist of QuickBooks
Assisted Payroll Service, Complete Payroll and Premier Payroll Service.
QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service provides the back-end aspects of payroll
processing, including tax payments and filings, for customers who process their
payrolls using QuickBooks. Complete Payroll provides traditional, full service
payroll processing, direct deposit, check delivery and tax payment services. We
offer Complete Payroll with QuickBooks integration or on a standalone basis. We
also continue to provide full service outsourced payroll to our Premier Payroll
Service customers.

Intuit Information Technology Solutions

. Our Intuit Track-It! products and
services offer small and medium-sized businesses robust tools to track and
support their information technology assets and resources. Intuit Track-It!
provides information technology managers with comprehensive asset management
and help desk solutions. Intuit Information Technology Solutions also offers
network management solutions and consulting and training services.

Intuit Distribution Management Solutions (IDMS)

. IDMS offers Intuit Eclipse
software and related technical support, consulting and training services for
small and medium-sized companies in the wholesale durable goods industry.

Intuit Real Estate Solutions (IRES)

. IRES offers MRI Residential software for
residential property managers, MRI Commercial software for commercial property
managers and CRE Manager software for corporate property managers. IRES also
offers technical support, consulting and training services for these software
products. IRES has subsidiaries in five international locations.

Intuit Construction Business Solutions (ICBS)

. ICBS offers Intuit
MasterBuilder software and related technical support, consulting and training
services for small and medium-sized businesses in the construction industry.

Intuit Public Sector Solutions (IPSS)

. IPSS offers Intuit Fundware software
and related technical support, consulting and training services for nonprofit
organizations, universities and government agencies. In August 2004, management
formally approved a plan to sell IPSS.

Consumer Tax

Our Right for Me strategy in Consumer Tax strives to offer tax return
preparation products and services that appeal to customers who are in a variety
of life stages. Our current solutions include:

Consumer Tax Return Preparation Offerings

. Our TurboTax products and services
are designed to enable individuals and small business owners to prepare their
own federal and state personal and business income tax returns easily, quickly
and accurately. They are designed to be easy to use, yet sophisticated enough
for complex tax returns. We offer a range of desktop software products as well
as TurboTax for the Web, an interactive tax preparation service that enables
individual taxpayers to prepare their federal and state income tax returns
entirely online. One of our premium offerings, TurboTax Premier, addresses the
unique income tax needs of investors, those planning for retirement and rental
property owners. In addition, our innovative Instant Data Entry feature enables
taxpayers to import data directly into their tax returns from Form W-2s
(wages), Form 1098s (mortgage interest) and Form 1099s (interest, dividends and
stock transactions) from approximately 65 participating financial institutions
and payroll service companies. This feature saves TurboTax users time and
increases accuracy.

Electronic Filing Services

. Through our electronic filing center, our desktop
and Web-based tax preparation customers can electronically file their federal
income tax returns, as well as state returns in all states that support
electronic filing. For the 2001, 2002 and 2003 tax years, we provided online
tax preparation services on the Yahoo!® Finance Tax Center. For the 2003 tax
year our online tax services were offered through the Web sites of
approximately 1700 financial institutions, electronic retailers and other
merchants.



Intuit Tax Freedom Project

. Under the Intuit Tax Freedom Project, a
philanthropic public service initiative of the Intuit Financial Freedom
Foundation, we provide online federal income tax return preparation and
electronic filing services at no charge to disadvantaged and underserved
federal taxpayers. We are a member of the Free File Alliance, a consortium of
private sector companies that signed a three-year agreement with the federal
government in October 2002 under which a number of private sector companies,
rather than the federal government, are providing Web-based federal tax
preparation and filing services at no cost through voluntary public service
initiatives. Unless the government or the consortium elect to terminate the
agreement, it will renew every two years in perpetuity after the October 2005
expiration of the initial term. We donated approximately 724,000 federal units
under this program in fiscal 2004.

Professional Tax

Our Professional Tax segment provides a variety of software and services for
accountants in public practice who serve multiple clients. We design, create,
sell and support offerings that help professional accountants provide
accounting, tax planning and tax compliance services to their individual and
business clients and that help them manage their own practices more
effectively. Our current tax software products include ProSeries and Lacerte.
For the 2004 tax year, we will offer two new products: ProSeries Basic Edition,
designed for the needs of smaller tax practices, and ProSeries Express Edition,
designed for tax practices that focus on helping taxpayers obtain their tax
refunds quickly. Customers can elect to license professional tax products for a
flat fee for unlimited annual use, or use them on a “pay-per-return” basis.
ProSeries, ProSeries Basic, ProSeries Express and Lacerte customers can file
their clients’ tax returns using Intuit’s electronic filing services. In
addition, Intuit® EasyACCT® Professional Accounting Series (which allows
accountants to create financial statements and prepare tax forms such as W-2s
and 940s for their clients), Lacerte Tax Planner and ProSeries Fixed Asset
Manager help accountants provide a fuller spectrum of services to their
clients.

Other Businesses

Quicken Software

. Our Quicken line of desktop software products helps users
organize, understand and manage their personal finances. Quicken allows
customers to reconcile bank accounts, record credit card and other
transactions, write checks, and track investments, mortgages and other assets
and liabilities. Quicken also allows customers to flag their tax-related
financial transactions and download that information into our TurboTax consumer
tax software. We offer basic and deluxe versions of the product as well as
Quicken Premier, which offers more robust investment and tax planning tools;
Quicken Premier Home and Business, which allows customers to manage both
personal and small business finances in one application; and Quicken for Mac.

Quicken.com and Other Online Services.

Our Quicken.com personal finance Web
site allows visitors to learn more about and acquire our offerings. The site
also gives visitors access to Web-based financial tools, resources and
objective information from Intuit and third-party providers about a variety of
personal finance topics, including mortgages, insurance, taxes, banking and
retirement, and allows Quicken personal finance software users to monitor their
investments online. We offer other online services that we sell separately for
a fee, including Quicken-branded bill payment via the Web or the Quicken
desktop product. In addition, Quicken offers access to online banking services
provided by various financial institutions and Intuit markets a Quicken-branded
affinity credit card. Any visitor to Quicken.com can also link directly to
third-party providers of other services, such as insurance and mortgages. We
receive revenue from financial institutions and other companies that sell their
products and services via Quicken.com or the Quicken desktop product.

Canada and the United Kingdom

. In Canada, we offer versions of QuickBooks that
we have “localized,” that is, customized to meet the unique needs of customers
in that specific international location. These include QuickBooks software
offerings, payroll offerings and service plans. We also offer QuickTax™ and
TaxWiz consumer tax return preparation software; ProFile™ Financial Application
Suite professional tax preparation products and ProFile Advisor memberships for
accountants; and localized versions of Quicken in Canada. In the United
Kingdom, we offer localized versions of QuickBooks (including products and
services sold in partnership with banks) and Quicken, as well as TaxCalc
consumer tax return preparation software.

Other Locations

. We license localized versions of QuickBooks and Quicken
products in selected European markets through local distributors and agents. We
also license localized versions of QuickBooks and Quicken products in
Australia, New Zealand and Singapore through a development, marketing and
distribution arrangement with



Australia-based Reckon Limited. In addition, we have a branding agreement for
QuickBooks in China and a distribution arrangement for QuickBooks and Quicken
in South Africa.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

Since the personal computer and software industries are characterized by rapid
technological change, shifting customer needs and frequent new product
introductions and enhancements, a continuous high level of investment is
required for the enhancement of existing products and the development of new
products. We develop the majority of our products internally. We may also
supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring strategically
important products and technology from third parties, or establishing other
relationships that enable us to expand our offerings more rapidly.

Our core desktop software products (QuickBooks, TurboTax, ProSeries, Lacerte
and Quicken) tend to have fairly predictable, structured development cycles of
about a year, with annual product releases. These businesses also develop new
products whose development cycles are less predictable. Developing consumer and
professional tax software presents unique challenges because of the demanding
development cycle required to accurately incorporate tax law and tax form
changes within a rigid timetable. The development timing for our outsourced
payroll offerings is determined by business needs and regulatory requirements
and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of
each particular project. The product development cycles for the other
businesses in our Intuit-Branded Small Business segment also vary, and can be
longer than one year for major product releases.

Over the next few years, we expect that we will be developing more versions of
more complex products than ever before. In addition, we anticipate that these
products will offer increased ease of use, be customized for specific customer
categories and feature improved integration with other Intuit products and
services and with our internal information systems. Our research and
development efforts will be focused on developing new products and services to
address customer needs in our more broadly defined markets as well as adding
complementary products and services to drive additional, recurring revenue from
our core products. Our research and development expenses were $198.5 million in
fiscal 2002, $255.8 million in fiscal 2003 and $281.1 million in fiscal 2004
and represented 15% of total net revenue in each of those periods.

SEASONALITY

Our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Professional Tax businesses are highly
seasonal. Some of our other offerings are seasonal, but to a lesser extent.
Revenue from upgrades for many of our small business software products tend to
be concentrated around calendar year end. Sales of income tax preparation
products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from November
through April. These seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is
usually highest during our second quarter ending January 31 and third quarter
ending April 30. We typically report losses in our first quarter ending October
31 and fourth quarter ending July 31, when revenue from our tax businesses is
minimal while operating expenses to develop new products and services continue
at relatively consistent levels.

MARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION

Markets

Our primary target markets are small businesses with up to 20 employees,
professional accountants and individuals. In addition, we have acquired several
companies that offer business management solutions to small and medium-sized
businesses. These include Innovative Merchant Solutions, Intuit Information
Technology Solutions, Intuit Distribution Management Solutions, Intuit Real
Estate Solutions, Intuit Construction Business Solutions and Intuit Public
Sector Solutions.

Many of the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly shifting
customer demands, continuous technological change and frequent new product
introductions by competitors. Market and industry changes can quickly render
existing products and services obsolete, so our success depends on our ability
to respond rapidly to



these changes with new business models, updated competitive strategies, new or
enhanced products and services, alternative distribution methods and other
changes to the way we do business.

Marketing Programs

We use a variety of marketing programs to generate software orders, stimulate
demand and generally maintain and increase customer awareness of our products.
These programs include mail, email and telephone solicitations, direct-response
newspaper and magazine advertising, and television and radio advertising. We
also use workflow-integrated in-product messaging in several of our software
products to market other related products and services, including third-party
products and services. Customers who respond to direct marketing campaigns and
in-product messaging purchase products and services from us by telephone or
through our Web sites.

Distribution Channels

Direct Sales Channel

. We sell many of our products and services directly to
our customers through our Web sites, call centers and direct sales force. Over
the past three years, we have introduced more sophisticated, higher-priced
software products and business management solutions. These include broader
outsourced payroll offerings and business solutions for information technology
managers and businesses in selected industries. As a result, we have been
enhancing our direct sales capabilities to support revenue growth in these
areas.

Retail Distribution Channel

. We market our QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken
desktop software at retail in North America primarily through office supply
superstores, warehouse clubs, consumer electronics retailers, food and drug
retailers, catalogers and general mass merchandisers. In international markets,
we also rely on distributors, value-added resellers and other third parties,
who sell products into the retail channel.

We continue to benefit from strong relationships with a number of major North
American retailers, which allows us to minimize our dependence on any specific
retailer. We deliver products to larger retailers through a combination of
direct to store deliveries and shipments to central warehouse locations. We
also ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through
distributors. See

“Manufacturing and Distribution.”

We continue to aggressively
manage our inventory to optimize in-stock presence and ensure good product
placement within retail stores. In response to current retail trends, we are
also placing a greater proportion of inventory with retailers on a consignment
basis.

As we continue to execute on the Right for Me strategies in each of our
businesses, we are offering software products that are more complex and have
higher prices than our traditional retail software products. Our recent
tailoring of some of these software products to specific customer needs,
including industry-specific versions of QuickBooks, is also resulting in a
greater number of Intuit products. We produce and place in-store displays and
other retail merchandising aids that educate customers about product
functionality and benefits.

OEM Channel

. We have relationships with a number of personal computer
“original equipment manufacturers,” or OEMs, including Apple Computer Inc.,
Dell Inc. and Hewlett-Packard. Although aggregate revenue from our OEM channel
is much less significant than revenue from our other distribution channels, OEM
relationships help us to generate sales of our core desktop software products
in two ways. First, certain OEMs “pre-bundle” new-user versions of certain
desktop software products on the computer systems that the OEMs sell to their
customers. These pre-bundled OEM sales are a good source of new customers and
future revenues. The second source of revenue from the OEM channel is
“after-market” programs, in which customers who are purchasing computers can
select and purchase software products at the same time.

Third-Party “Value-Added” Distribution Arrangements

. We supplement our direct
sales capabilities and our retail and OEM distribution relationships with
selected third-party distribution arrangements. We believe these relationships
will enhance the growth opportunities for our higher-end product and service
offerings by allowing us to benefit from the value-added marketing and sales
expertise of these third parties. We currently have arrangements with third
parties who have specialized expertise in marketing, selling and providing
post-sale implementation services for Innovative Merchant Solutions and some of
our Intuit-Branded Small Business solutions. During fiscal 2005 and beyond, we
expect to continue to optimize and support our network of third-party
relationships.



COMPETITION

Overview

We face intense competition in all of our businesses, both domestically and
internationally. Competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we
serve, particularly small business and consumer tax, has grown markedly over
the past few years and we expect this trend to continue. Some of our existing
competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing
resources than we do. As we implement our customer-driven strategies, we face
increased competitive threats from larger companies in more diverse markets
than we have historically faced. In addition, the competitive landscape can
shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete.

Consumer Tax

. We also face potential competitive challenges in our Consumer
Tax business from publicly funded government entities that offer electronic tax
preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers. We are a
member of the Free File Alliance, a consortium of private sector companies that
signed a three-year agreement with the federal government in October 2002.
Under this agreement, a number of private sector companies, rather than the
federal government, are providing Web-based federal tax preparation and filing
services at no cost to disadvantaged and underserved federal taxpayers through
voluntary public service initiatives such as our Intuit Tax Freedom Project.
Unless the government or the consortium elect to terminate the agreement, it
will renew every two years in perpetuity after the October 2005 expiration of
the initial three-year term. A number of states have adopted similar
public-private agreements modeled after the Free File Alliance. However, many
other states have taken the opposite approach and offer some form of directly
sponsored tax preparation and filing services free to qualified taxpayers. We
continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to
advance the goals of the Free File Alliance policy initiative and to support
successful public-private partnership. However, future administrative,
regulatory or legislative activity in this area could adversely affect our
Consumer Tax business.

QuickBooks, TurboTax, ProSeries, Lacerte and Quicken desktop software

. We
believe the most important competitive factors for our desktop software
products are product features, ease of use, size of the installed customer
base, brand name recognition, price, and product and support quality. Access to
distribution channels is also important for our QuickBooks, TurboTax and
Quicken products. We believe we compete effectively on these factors as
QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken products are the leading products in the
retail sales channel for their respective categories.

Products and services other than desktop software

. We believe the most
important competitive factors for products and services other than desktop
software are features and ease of use, brand name recognition, speed in getting
new products and services to market, the ability to distribute them effectively
and quality of implementation and support. We believe we compete effectively on
these factors. For our service offerings such as outsourced payroll, service
reliability and scalability of operations are also important factors. Due to
the size of our principal competitors in these service businesses, we will need
to scale our businesses to compete effectively over the long term. Significant
competitive factors for our financial supplies business include ordering
convenience, product quality, speed of delivery and price. We believe that our
convenient access to our large QuickBooks and Quicken customer bases is a
significant competitive advantage for our financial supplies business.

CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT

We provide customer service and technical support by telephone, online chat,
fax, e-mail and our customer service and technical support Web sites. We have
full-time and outsourced customer service and technical support staffs, which
we supplement with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods
of peak call volumes, such as during the tax return filing season or following
a major product launch. We outsource to several firms domestically and
internationally. Most of our internationally outsourced customer service and
technical support personnel are located in India.



We offer free self-help information through our technical support Web sites for
our main product lines. For example, customers can use our Web sites to find
answers to commonly asked questions and check on the status of product orders.
Under support plans, customers can also use our Web sites to receive product
updates electronically. Support alternatives and fees vary by product.

MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION

Desktop Software and Supplies

The major steps involved in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing
CDs, printing boxes and related materials, and assembling and shipping the
final products. We have a manufacturing agreement with Modus Link under which
Modus provides substantially all outsourced manufacturing related to our retail
launches of QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken, as well as for day-to-day retail
order fulfillment after product launches. Although Modus has operations in
multiple locations that can provide redundancy if necessary, we have
centralized the manufacturing for our retail products in one of their
facilities which is co-located with our primary retail fulfillment vendor,
Ingram Micro Logistics. We also outsource the product manufacturing and
distribution for all of our direct sales orders to Arvato Services, Inc., a
subsidiary of Bertelsmann. We use John H. Harland Company exclusively to
fulfill orders for all of our printed checks and most other products for our
financial supplies business.

Our retail product launches are operationally complex. Our model for product
delivery for retail launches and replenishment is a hybrid of direct to store
deliveries and shipments to central warehouse locations. This allows improved
inventory management by our retailers. We also ship products for many of our
smaller retail customers through distributors. We have an agreement with Ingram
Micro Logistics under which Ingram handles all logistics, fulfillment and
similar functions for our retail sales.

We have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has
historically not been a significant problem for us. Prior to major product
releases for our core desktop software products we tend to have significant
levels of backlog, but at other times backlog is minimal and we typically ship
products within a few days of receiving an order. Because of this fluctuation
in backlog, we believe that backlog is not a reliable predictor of our future
core desktop software sales.

Internet-based Products and Services

Intuit’s data centers house most of the systems, networks and databases
required to operate and deliver our Internet-based products and services. These
include QuickBooks Online Edition, QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service,
TurboTax for the Web, consumer and professional electronic tax filing services
and Quicken.com. Through our data centers, we connect customers to products and
services and we store the vast amount of data that represents the content on
our Web sites. Our data centers consist of approximately 3,500 servers and
1,100 databases located in several sites across the United States. In an effort
to reduce unavailability, or “down time,” for our Internet-based products and
services, we generally follow industry-standard practices for creating a
fault-tolerant environment, but we do not have complete redundancy. We have
back-up processing capabilities that are designed to protect us against
site-related disasters for most of our mission-critical applications. Despite
our efforts to maintain continuous and reliable server operations, we
occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties.

PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION

Customers are concerned about the privacy and security of the personal
information they provide to companies. This concern applies to information they
provide in connection with Internet-based products and services, as well as
information they provide through more traditional methods, such as product
registration cards. In addition to customer concerns, we are subject to various
federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and security. We are
also subject to laws and regulations that apply to telemarketing and email
activities. Additional laws in both areas are likely to be passed in the
future, which could result in significant limitations on the ways in which we
can communicate with our customers and significantly increase our compliance
costs.



We comply with Federal guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers
are aware of, and can control, how we use information about them. All
publicly-accessible, Intuit-owned and operated consumer Web sites at which
customer data is collected (including QuickBooks.com, TurboTax.com and
Quicken.com) have been certified by TRUSTe, an independent, non-profit privacy
organization that operates a Web site certification program to alleviate users’
concerns about online privacy. We use privacy statements to provide notice to
customers of our privacy practices, as well as provide them the opportunity to
furnish instructions with respect to use of their data.

To address security concerns, we use industry-standard security safeguards to
help protect the information customers give to us from loss, misuse and
unauthorized alteration. Whenever customers transmit sensitive information,
such as a credit card number or tax return data, to us through one of our Web
sites, we provide them access to our servers that allow encryption of the
information as it is transmitted to us. We work to protect personally
identifiable information stored on the Web site’s servers from unauthorized
access using commercially available computer security products, such as
firewalls, as well as internally developed security procedures and practices.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

We offer certain products and services, such as outsourced payroll, which are
subject to special regulatory requirements. As we expand our small business
products and services, we may become subject to additional government
regulation, particularly in the areas of retirement planning and other employer
services. We continually analyze new business opportunities, and new businesses
that we pursue may require additional costs for regulatory compliance.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We generally rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws
and patents as well as employee and third-party nondisclosure and license
agreements to protect our software products, services and other proprietary
technology. We do not own all of the software and other technologies used in
our products and services, but we have the licenses from third parties that we
believe are necessary and appropriate for using that technology in our current
offerings.

We consider our principal trademarks (including Intuit, QuickBooks, TurboTax
and Quicken) to be important assets and have registered these and other
trademarks and service marks in the United States and, depending on the
relevance of each brand to other markets, in many foreign countries. The
initial duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country and
is 10 years in the United States. Most registrations can be renewed perpetually
at 10-year intervals.

EMPLOYEES

As of August 31, 2004, we had approximately 6,700 employees located in the
United States and internationally in Canada, the United Kingdom and several
other locations. We believe our future success and growth will depend on our
ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business.
We do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our
employees, and we believe employee relations are generally good. Although we
have employment-related agreements with a number of key employees, these
agreements do not guarantee continued service. We believe we offer competitive
compensation and a good working environment. We were selected as one of

Fortune

magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” in April 2002, 2003 and 2004.
However, we face intense competition for qualified employees, and we expect to
face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention.

Florida. Our four industry solutions businesses lease their principal
facilities in Santa Rosa, California; Denver, Colorado; Boulder, Colorado;
Shelton, Connecticut; West Yarmouth, Massachusetts; and Beachwood, Ohio. They
also lease sales and service offices across the United States and in selected
international locations. Finally, we lease or own facilities in a number of
other domestic locations and internationally in Canada, the United Kingdom and
several other locations.

We believe our facilities are adequate for our current and near-term needs, and
that we will be able to locate additional facilities as needed. See Note 13 to
the financial statements for more information about our lease commitments.

ITEM 3

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

1) Muriel Siebert & Co., Inc. v. Intuit Inc., Index No. 03-602942, Supreme
Court of the State of New York, County of New York.

On September 17, 2003, Muriel Siebert & Co., Inc. filed a complaint against
Intuit alleging various claims for breach of contract, breach of express and
implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty,
misrepresentation and/or fraud, and promissory estoppel. The allegations relate
to Quicken Brokerage powered by Siebert, a strategic alliance between the two
companies. The complaint seeks compensatory, punitive, and other damages. On
September 22, 2003, Intuit filed an arbitration demand against Siebert & Co.,
Inc. in San Jose, California seeking arbitration of all claims asserted by both
parties. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York
has stayed the matter while it determines whether it will proceed in New York
state court or in arbitration. Intuit believes this lawsuit is without merit
and intends to defend the litigation vigorously.



2) Intuit/Quicken Sunsetting Litigation, Master File No. 1-04-CV-016394,
Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara (Anthony Flannery v.
Intuit Inc., et al, Civil No. 1-04-CV-016394 and Daniel J. Mason v. Intuit Inc.
et al, Civil No. 1-04-CV-018345).

On or about March 19, 2004, plaintiff Anthony Flannery, on his behalf and on
behalf of a class of persons allegedly similarly situated, filed a complaint
against Intuit in Santa Clara Superior Court, alleging that Intuit’s retirement
of certain services and live technical support associated with its Quicken
1998, Quicken 1999 and Quicken 2000 products constituted a breach of express
and implied warranties and violated sections 17200 and 17500 of the California
Business and Professions Code, as well as the Consumer Legal Remedies Act
(“CLRA”). The complaint seeks certification as a class action, as well as
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, disgorgement of profits,
restitution, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees from Intuit.

On or about April 21, 2004, plaintiff Daniel Mason, on his behalf and on behalf
of a class of persons allegedly similarly situated, filed a complaint against
Intuit in Santa Clara Superior Court making allegations virtually identical to
those of Anthony Flannery. On July 14, 2004, the Court consolidated the two
cases pursuant to stipulation of the parties.

On July 29, 2004, plaintiffs filed a consolidated First Amended Complaint.
Intuit’s response to that Complaint is due on October 8, 2004. The parties have
only recently initiated discovery. No trial date is set. Intuit believes this
lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend the litigation vigorously.

3) Cynthia Belotti v. Intuit Inc., et al, Civil No. 1-04-CV-020277, Superior
Court of California, County of Santa Clara.

On or about May 24, 2004, plaintiff Cynthia Belotti, on her behalf and on
behalf of a class of persons allegedly similarly situated, filed a complaint
against the Company in Santa Clara Superior Court, alleging that Intuit’s
retirement of certain add-on business services and live technical support
associated with its QuickBooks 2001and QuickBooks 2002 products constituted a
breach of express and implied warranties and violated sections 17200 and 17500
of the California Business and Professions Code. The complaint sought
certification as a class action, as well as damages, disgorgement of profits,
restitution, injunctive relief and attorney’s fees from Intuit.

On or about July 13, 2004, plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint that added
Ental Precision Machining, Inc., as plaintiff; plaintiffs’ counsel has also
dismissed without prejudice all claims on behalf of Cynthia Belotti. Intuit’s
response to that Complaint is due on October 8, 2004. The parties have only
recently initiated discovery. No trial date is set. Intuit believes this
lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend the litigation vigorously.

Intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings, as well as demands,
claims and threatened litigation, that arise in the normal course of our
business, including assertions that we may be infringing patents or other
intellectual property rights of others. We currently believe that the ultimate
amount of liability, if any, for any pending claims of any type (either alone
or combined) will not materially affect our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. We also believe that we would be able to obtain any
necessary licenses or other rights to disputed intellectual property rights on
commercially reasonable terms. However, the ultimate outcome of any litigation
is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact
on Intuit because of defense costs, negative publicity, diversion of management
resources and other factors. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other
rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could
adversely affect our business.

Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans

Information regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity

filed for our December 2004 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.



ITEM 6

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following tables show Intuit’s selected consolidated financial information
for the past five fiscal years. The comparability of the information is
affected by a variety of factors, including acquisitions and divestitures of
businesses, gains and losses related to marketable securities and other
investments, acquisition-related charges and repurchases under our stock
repurchase programs. We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or
SFAS, No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”

on August 1, 2002 and
stopped amortizing goodwill on that date. Fiscal years prior to fiscal 2003
reflect significant goodwill amortization charges.

In fiscal 2002 we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage business and in fiscal 2003
we sold our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK. We accounted for the
sales of these businesses as discontinued operations and, accordingly, we have
reclassified the selected financial data for all periods prior to the sales to
reflect Quicken Loans and Intuit KK as discontinued operations. To better
understand the information in the tables, investors should read

“Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”

in
Item 7, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in Item 8.

We adopted SFAS 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities,”

in fiscal 2001 and recognized the cumulative
effect of the change in how we accounted for options to purchase
shares of S1 Corporation as of August 1, 2000. If we had adopted
SFAS 133 at the beginning of fiscal 2000, pro forma net income
would have been $299.1 million and pro forma diluted net income
would have been $1.42 per share. In accordance with SFAS 133, we
included unrealized gains and losses on the S1 options in our
fiscal 2001 and 2002 reported results until we sold them in the
first quarter of fiscal 2002.

ITEM 7

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We begin our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations (MD&A) with a discussion of the Critical Accounting
Policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and
judgments underlying our financial statements. This is followed by a discussion
of our Results of Operations that begins with an Overview followed by a more
detailed discussion of our revenue and expenses. We then provide an analysis of
our Liquidity and Capital Resources with a discussion of key aspects of our
statements of cash flows, changes in our balance sheets, and our financial
commitments. Following these discussions is the section entitled Risks That
Could Affect Future Results which details some important factors that may
significantly impact our future financial performance. You should also note
that this MD&A discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve
risks and uncertainties. Please see the section entitled

“Caution Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements”

at the end of this Item 7 for important information
to consider when evaluating such statements.

You should read this MD&A in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial
Statements and related Notes in Item 8. As discussed below, we sold our Quicken
Loans mortgage business in fiscal 2002 and our Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK,
in fiscal 2003 and accounted for the sales of these businesses as discontinued
operations. Accordingly, we have reclassified our financial statements for all
periods prior to the sales to reflect these businesses as discontinued
operations. Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion pertains only to
our continuing operations.

Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and
judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue, operating
income or loss and net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain
assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. We believe that the estimates,
assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below
have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider
these to be our critical accounting policies. Senior management has discussed
the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their
disclosure in this Report with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

•

Net Revenue – Revenue Recognition

. Intuit derives revenues from
the sale of packaged software products, license fees, product support,
professional services, outsourced payroll services, transaction fees
and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of
these items. We follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for
each type of revenue. See Note 1 to the financial statements,

“Net
Revenue.”

We generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the
service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is
probable. However, determining whether and when some of these criteria
have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can
have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we
report. For example, for multiple element arrangements we must make
assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among
the various elements we must deliver, to determine whether undelivered
services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products
and services, to determine whether vendor-specific evidence of fair
value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and
when each element has been delivered. If we were to change any of these
assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material increase or
decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular
period. Amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to
arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our
balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable
revenue recognition criteria are satisfied.

•

Net Revenue – Return and Rebate Reserves

. As part of our revenue
recognition policy, we estimate future product returns and rebate
payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale
based on these estimates. Our return policy allows distributors and
retailers, subject to certain contractual limitations, to return
purchased products. Product returns by distributors and retailers
relate primarily to the return of obsolete products. In determining our
product returns reserves, we consider the volume and price mix of
products in the retail channel, historical return rates for prior
releases of the product, trends in retailer inventory and economic
trends that might impact customer demand for our products (including
the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our
products). We fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution
channels.



Our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive
rebates and end-user rebates. Our estimated reserves for distributor and
retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and retailers’
actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs,
which we typically establish annually. Our reserves for end-user rebates
are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific
promotional rebate program, actual sales during the promotion, the amount
of redemptions received and historical redemption trends by product and
by type of promotional program.

In the past, actual returns and rebates have approximated and not
generally exceeded the reserves that we have established. However, actual
returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain. If we
were to change our assumptions and estimates, our revenue reserves would
change, which would impact the net revenue we report. If actual returns
and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have
established, the actual results would decrease our future reported
revenue. Conversely, if actual returns and rebates are significantly less
than our reserves, this would increase our future reported revenue. For
example, if we had increased our fiscal 2004 returns reserves by 1% of
non-consignment sales to retailers for QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken,
our fiscal 2004 total net revenue would have been $4.0 million lower.

•

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

. We make ongoing assumptions
relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. The accounts
receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts
that might not be paid. In determining the amount of the reserve, we
consider our historical level of credit losses. We also make judgments
about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing
credit evaluations, and we assess current economic trends that might
impact the level of credit losses in the future. Our reserves have
generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses. However,
since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial
stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will
continue to be adequate. If actual credit losses are significantly
greater than the reserve we have established, that would increase our
general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income.
Conversely, if actual credit losses are significantly less than our
reserve, this would eventually decrease our general and administrative
expenses and increase our reported net income.

•

Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets –
Impairment Assessments

. We make judgments about the recoverability of
purchased intangible assets and other long-lived assets whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary
impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance
sheet may exist. We test the impairment of goodwill annually in our
fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment
arise. The timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to
our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not
have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods. In order to estimate
the fair value of long-lived assets, we typically make various
assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset
relates to, consider market factors specific to that business and
estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business. We
evaluate cash flows at the lowest operating level and the number of
reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more
probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and
integrated operations following acquisitions. Based on these
assumptions and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an
impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our
balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value. Assumptions and
estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex
and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors,
including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and
internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our
internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates
we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate,
different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our
reported financial results. More conservative assumptions of the
anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in
impairment charges, which would decrease net income and result in lower
asset values on our balance sheet. Conversely, less conservative
assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges, higher
net income and higher asset values. We recorded impairment charges for
goodwill and purchased intangible assets of $27.3 million in fiscal
2002 and $18.7 million in fiscal 2004. At July 31, 2004, we had $670.0
million in goodwill and $107.3 million in net purchased intangible
assets on our balance sheet.

•

Accounting for Stock-Based Incentive Programs

. We currently
measure compensation expense for our stock-based incentive programs
using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles
Board, or APB, Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees.”

Under this method, we do not record compensation expense
when stock options are granted to eligible participants as long as the



exercise price is not less than the fair market value of the stock when
the option is granted. We also do not record compensation expense for shares purchased in connection with our Employee Stock Purchase Plan as
long as the purchase price of the stock is not less than 85% of the lower
of the fair market value of the stock at the beginning of each offering
period or at the end of each purchase period. In accordance with SFAS
123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,”

and SFAS 148,

“Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure,”

we disclose
our pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if
the fair value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation
expense for our stock-based incentive programs. We have elected to follow
APB 25 because the fair value accounting provided for under SFAS 123
requires the use of option valuation models that were not developed for
use in valuing incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares.

On March 31, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued its
exposure draft,

“Share-Based Payment,”

which is a proposed amendment to
SFAS 123. The exposure draft would require all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options and purchases under
employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized in the statement of
operations based on their fair values. The FASB expects to issue a final
standard late in 2004 that would be effective for public companies for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2004. We have not yet assessed
the impact of adopting this new standard.

We monitor progress at the FASB and other developments with respect to
stock-based incentive compensation. We may have to recognize
substantially more compensation expense in future periods if we are
required or elect to expense the value of stock-based incentive
compensation or if we decide to alter our current employee compensation
programs to provide other benefits in place of incentive stock options.

•

Income Taxes – Estimates of Effective Tax Rates, Deferred Taxes and
Valuation Allowance.

When we prepare our consolidated financial
statements, we estimate our income taxes based on the various
jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is
required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. We
recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United
States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether,
and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We record an
additional amount in our provision for income taxes in the period in
which we determine that our recorded tax liability is less than we
expect the ultimate tax assessment to be. If in a later period we
determine that payment of this additional amount is unnecessary, we
reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit in that later period.
As a result, our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the
audit issues and related tax positions require judgment and can
materially increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as
impact our operating results. This also requires us to estimate our
current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result
from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting
purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and
liabilities, which we show on our consolidated balance sheet. We must
then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be
realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we
establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation
allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record
a corresponding tax expense on our statement of operations.

Our net deferred tax asset at July 31, 2004 was $167.2 million, net of
the valuation allowance of $7.5 million. We recorded the valuation
allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to
utilize some of our deferred tax assets (consisting primarily of certain
net operating losses carried forward by our international subsidiaries
and certain state capital loss carryforwards) before they expire. The
valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the
jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred
tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable
income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, we could be
required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account
additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An
increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which
could be material, on our income tax provision and net income in the
period in which we make the increase.

In fiscal 2004 we revised our reportable segments to reflect the way we
currently manage our operations and view our results. Our five business
segments are now QuickBooks-Related, Intuit-Branded Small Business, Consumer
Tax, Professional Tax and Other Businesses. Total net revenue increased in
fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to growth in our
QuickBooks-Related and Consumer Tax segments. Fiscal 2004 growth in our
QuickBooks-Related segment was driven by sales of higher-priced versions of
QuickBooks and by continuing growth in the QuickBooks Do-It-Yourself Payroll,
or DIY, customer base and average selling prices, which resulted in higher DIY
revenue. Total net revenue increased in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002
primarily due to growth in our QuickBooks-Related and Consumer Tax segments,
with the QuickBooks-Related revenue increase fueled by sales of higher-priced
versions of QuickBooks and by DIY revenue. Fiscal 2003 revenue also increased
compared with fiscal 2002 because of acquisitions in our Intuit-Branded Small
Business segment.

The markets for many of our products are maturing and as a result we believe
that our revenue growth is slowing. We continue to develop new products and
services to mitigate the impact of this slowing growth in the long term.

Income from continuing operations grew faster than revenue in fiscal 2004
primarily due to an increase in revenue from higher-margin products, such as
industry-specific versions of QuickBooks and DIY, and to the fact that we
reduced costs while revenue grew in our Quicken business. Income from
continuing operations grew faster than revenue in fiscal 2003 primarily due to
an increase in revenue from higher-margin products, efficiencies in customer
service and technical support, significantly lower acquisition-related charges
in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 charges for vacant facilities, impairment of
goodwill and intangible assets, and impairment of long-lived assets that did
not recur in fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2003 acquisition-related charges were
significantly lower compared with fiscal 2002 because due to our adoption of
SFAS 142 fiscal 2003 acquisition-related charges do not include amortization of
goodwill.

Net income (after tax) from continuing operations grew faster than revenue in
fiscal 2004 primarily due to the factors cited above and the reversal of $35.7
million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were
resolved, partially offset by lower interest and other income and lower gains
on marketable securities and other investments. Net income (after tax) from
continuing operations grew faster than revenue in fiscal 2003 primarily due to
the factors cited above and to higher interest and other income and gains on
marketable securities and other investments in fiscal 2003, partially offset by
a fiscal 2002 gain on divestiture of businesses that did not recur in fiscal
2003 and a higher effective tax rate in fiscal 2003 than in fiscal 2002.

Diluted net income per share from continuing operations grew faster than net
income (after tax) from continuing operations for fiscal 2004 and 2003
primarily due to the net reduction of average shares outstanding resulting from
repurchases of stock under our stock repurchase programs.

At July 31, 2004, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled
$1.0 billion. In fiscal 2004 we generated cash primarily from continuing
operations and the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and we
used cash primarily for our stock repurchase programs, acquisitions and capital
expenditures. In fiscal 2004 we bought 13.5 million shares of our common stock
under our stock repurchase programs at an average price of $45.01 for a total
price of $609.4 million. We completed our third stock repurchase program in
June 2004 and at July 31, 2004 authorized funds of $500.0 million remained
available under our fourth program.



Total Net Revenue

The table below and the discussion of total net revenue that follows it are
categorized by our five reportable business segments. In the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004 we revised our reportable segments to reflect the way we currently
manage our operations and view our results. We combined our fiscal 2003
QuickBooks segment with the businesses from our fiscal 2003 Small Business
Products and Services segment that relate to and support QuickBooks to form the
fiscal 2004 segment called QuickBooks-Related. We also combined our outsourced
payroll and information technology businesses with our fiscal 2003 Vertical
Business Management Solutions segment to form the fiscal 2004 segment called
Intuit-Branded Small Business. We made no changes to our Consumer Tax,
Professional Tax and Other Businesses segments. We have reclassified previously
reported fiscal 2003 and 2002 segment results to be consistent with the fiscal
2004 presentation.

We reclassified a total of $28.1 million for certain fiscal 2003
electronic filing revenue in our Consumer Tax and Professional Tax segments
from product revenue to service revenue to be consistent with our fiscal 2004
presentation. Total fiscal 2003 revenue for each of these segments did not
change as a result of these reclassifications. See Note 11 to the financial statements for
additional information about our business segments.

Fiscal 2004 total net revenue increased compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due
to growth in DIY revenue in our QuickBooks-Related segment and to growth in
TurboTax for the Web and electronic filing services in our Consumer Tax
segment. Fiscal 2003 total net revenue increased over fiscal 2002 primarily due
to higher revenue in our QuickBooks-Related, Consumer Tax and Intuit-Branded Small Business
segments. In fiscal 2003 our Intuit-Branded Small Business segment included
revenue from the date of acquisition for three companies we acquired in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and one company we acquired in the first quarter
of fiscal 2003.

Total Net Revenue by Business Segment

QuickBooks-Related

QuickBooks-Related product revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks desktop
software products; QuickBooks Do-It-Yourself Payroll, or DIY, which offers
payroll tax tables, forms and electronic tax payment and filing on a
subscription basis to small businesses that prepare their own payrolls; and
financial supplies such as paper checks, envelopes and invoices.
QuickBooks-Related service revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks Online
Edition, QuickBooks support plans and merchant services. Other revenue for this
segment consists primarily of royalties from small business online services.

Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003

. QuickBooks-Related total net revenue
grew in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 due to increased sales of
higher-priced industry-specific versions of QuickBooks and higher DIY revenue
driven by growth in the average customer base, an increase in
QuickBooks-related services and the full impact in fiscal 2004 of a December
2002 price increase. Our October 2003 acquisition of Innovative Merchant
Solutions also contributed to the higher fiscal 2004 total net revenue.

Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002

. QuickBooks-Related total net revenue
increased in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002, reflecting higher
QuickBooks unit sales as well as higher average selling prices driven by the
introduction of certain higher-priced QuickBooks products and a shift in
revenue mix toward those products. DIY revenue increased due to growth in the
average customer base and higher average selling prices driven by price
increases. QuickBooks support revenue grew due to an increase in the number of
support plans sold and strength in the higher-priced support plans for
higher-end QuickBooks products.

Intuit-Branded Small Business

Intuit-Branded Small Business product revenue is derived primarily from
business management software for information technology and four selected
industries: wholesale durable goods; residential, commercial and corporate
property management; construction; and nonprofit organizations, universities
and government agencies. In August 2004 management formally approved a plan to
sell our Intuit Public Sector Solutions business. Intuit-Branded Small Business
service revenue is derived from technical support, consulting and training
services for those software products and from outsourced payroll services.
Service revenue for this segment also includes interest earned on funds held
for payroll customers.

Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003

. Intuit-Branded Small Business total net
revenue increased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to new
client acquisition in our wholesale durable goods and property management
solutions businesses as well as higher average selling prices from increased
customer use of support and other services in these businesses and in our
information technology business.

Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002

. Intuit-Branded Small Business total net
revenue was higher in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 due to our
acquisition of several businesses. Higher outsourced payroll revenue in fiscal
2003 was primarily a result of our acquisition of CBS Employer Services, Inc.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. We also acquired our wholesale durable
goods, property management and nonprofit businesses in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2002. They contributed $80.6 million in revenue for fiscal 2003 compared
with $3.4 million in fiscal 2002. Finally, we acquired Intuit Information
Technology Solutions in the first quarter of fiscal 2003.



Consumer Tax

Consumer Tax product revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax federal and
state consumer desktop tax return preparation software. Consumer Tax service
revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax for the Web online tax return
preparation services and consumer electronic filing services.

Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003

. Consumer Tax total net revenue
increased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 as a result of TurboTax for
the Web and retail desktop unit growth, higher attach rates for electronic
filing services and higher average selling prices.

Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002

. Consumer Tax total net revenue grew in
fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 due to an increase in desktop revenue
that was driven by unit growth and higher average selling prices for federal
tax offerings with enhanced functionality; higher TurboTax for the Web revenue
due to unit growth and higher average selling prices; and an increase in
electronic filing revenue due to higher federal desktop unit sales and higher
average state electronic filing prices.

Professional Tax

Professional Tax product revenue is derived primarily from ProSeries and
Lacerte professional tax preparation software products. Professional Tax
service revenue consists of electronic filing and training services.

Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003

. Professional Tax total net revenue grew
slightly in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 due to additional sales to
existing customers, higher average selling prices related to product
enhancements and increased sales of our unlimited electronic filing product as
a result of new government rules requiring the electronic filing of certain
professionally prepared 2003 income tax returns. However, revenue growth in
fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by competition from lower-priced
professional tax preparation software products. Although we have revised our
product strategy to address this competition for the 2004 tax year, it is
possible that this competition may continue to negatively affect revenue growth
rates for our Professional Tax segment in the future.

Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002

. Professional Tax total net revenue grew
in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 due to price increases related to
product enhancements, new customer acquisition initiatives and successful
cross-sell efforts to the existing tax client base. Renewal rates for our
existing customer base remained strong during fiscal 2003.

Other Businesses

Other Businesses consist primarily of Quicken and Canada. Quicken product
revenue is derived primarily from Quicken desktop software products. Quicken
other revenue consists primarily of fees from consumer online transactions and
from Quicken-branded credit card and bill payment offerings that we provide
through our partners. We exited the online advertising business in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004. In Canada, product revenue is derived primarily from
localized versions of QuickBooks and Quicken as well as QuickTax and TaxWiz
consumer desktop tax return preparation software and ProFile professional tax
preparation products. Service revenue in Canada consists primarily of revenue
from software maintenance contracts sold with QuickBooks.

Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003

. Other Businesses total net revenue grew
slightly in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to higher
Quicken revenue.

In fiscal 2004 Quicken direct unit sales increased in response to direct mail
campaigns for upgrades due to the discontinuation of support for older versions
of the product and for TurboTax cross-selling offers. Retail unit sales also
increased. Aggregate average selling prices for Quicken were higher in fiscal
2004 compared with fiscal 2003 due to a shift in demand to our higher-priced
Quicken Premier and Quicken Home and Business products. Partially offsetting
these increases, Quicken other revenue declined in fiscal 2004 due to the
expiration or termination of contracts with several significant online
advertising customers. We exited the online advertising business in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004.



Canadian revenue in U.S. dollars was slightly higher in fiscal 2004 compared
with fiscal 2003 due to the favorable effect of the strengthening Canadian
dollar in fiscal 2004. Total net revenue in Canadian dollars decreased in
fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003, primarily due to lower demand for
QuickBooks in Canada. QuickTax revenue was also down in fiscal 2004 due to a
decline in unit sales that was partially offset by higher average selling
prices related to a shift in demand toward the higher-priced specialty versions
of that product.

Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002

. Other Businesses total net revenue
increased slightly in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002. Quicken revenue
decreased while Canadian revenue grew.

Quicken product revenue decreased due to lack of growth in the market for
personal finance desktop software and slow consumer spending. Lower unit sales
for all Quicken products more than offset higher average selling prices for
Quicken Premier and Quicken Home and Business. Quicken other revenue also
decreased due to continuing slowness in Internet advertising and our exit from
certain online businesses in fiscal 2002.

Total net revenue from Canada grew in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002,
due partially to slightly higher revenue from QuickTax. Higher average selling
prices and higher unit sales for this product were fueled by the introduction
of Right for Me consumer tax products targeted at taxpayers who maintain home
offices or who are preparing for retirement. Our new TaxWiz consumer tax
preparation software also contributed to fiscal 2003 revenue growth. Canadian
QuickBooks revenue for fiscal 2003 declined due to lack of growth in the
software category and decreases in the level of inventory purchasing by
retailers.

Our cost of revenue has four components: (1) cost of product revenue, which
includes the direct costs of manufacturing and shipping our software products;
(2) cost of service revenue, which reflects direct costs associated with
providing services, including data center costs related to delivering
Internet-based services; (3) cost of other revenue, which includes costs
associated with generating advertising and marketing and online transaction
revenue; and (4) amortization of purchased software, which represents the cost
of amortizing developed technologies that we obtained through acquisitions over
their useful lives.

Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003

. Cost of product revenue as a percentage
of product revenue decreased slightly in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003.
This was primarily due to a continuing shift toward sales of our higher-priced
QuickBooks products and to lower royalties incurred for our Consumer Tax and
Quicken products.

Cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased in fiscal
2004 compared with fiscal 2003. This decrease was due to growth in our Consumer
Tax service revenue, which had minimal incremental costs. Cost of service
revenue as a percentage of service revenue also decreased in fiscal 2004 due to
growth in revenue from the higher-margin businesses we acquired during fiscal
2003 and 2004, notably Intuit Information Technology Solutions and Innovative
Merchant Solutions.

Cost of other revenue as a percentage of other revenue increased in fiscal 2004
compared with fiscal 2003. This was primarily due to declining Quicken other
revenue resulting from the fiscal 2004 expiration or termination of contracts
with several significant online advertising customers, which had minimal
associated costs. We exited the online advertising business in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004.



Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002

. Cost of product revenue as a percentage
of product revenue decreased slightly in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002.
This was primarily due to a shift toward sales of our new higher-priced
QuickBooks products, which have higher margins per unit, and to cost reductions
due to improvements in packaging design and manufacturing processes during
fiscal 2003.

Cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased in fiscal
2003 compared with fiscal 2002 primarily as a result of growth in our
outsourced payroll business during fiscal 2003. In addition, starting in the
third quarter of fiscal 2003 we no longer paid royalties to Wells Fargo Bank
for our Premier Payroll Service. Although we amortized the $29.2 million
purchase price of the right to market to this customer base to cost of service
revenue in fiscal 2003, the amortization expense was less than the royalties
that would have been incurred under the old agreement.

Cost of other revenue as a percentage of other revenue decreased in fiscal 2003
compared with fiscal 2002. In the first quarter of fiscal 2002, we moved a
large number of servers that supported our Quicken.com Web site from an
external hosting company to our own data center and streamlined the
infrastructure. Over time, this led to decreased cost of other revenue for this
business.

Overview of Operating Expenses

We define core operating expenses as the controllable costs of running our
business. Total core operating expenses increased in fiscal 2004 compared with
fiscal 2003 and in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002. Individually and in
the aggregate, core operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue
were generally consistent in these



periods. Operating expenses that changed by more than 1% of total net revenue
from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2004 are discussed below.

Customer Service and Technical Support

Customer service and technical support expenses declined as a percentage of
total net revenue in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 and in fiscal 2003
compared with fiscal 2002. We continued to increase our efficiency in these
periods by improving our utilization of internal customer service
representatives and by outsourcing some of our seasonal call center
capabilities. We also increased the proportion of customer service and
technical support we provide through less expensive methods such as Web sites,
online chat, email and other electronic means. These benefits were partially
offset by higher demand for customer service and technical support due to the
increased number of our offerings.

General and Administrative

General administrative expenses increased as a percentage of total net revenue
in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 and in fiscal 2003 compared with
fiscal 2002 due to increased spending for infrastructure and new information
systems.

Acquisition-Related Charges

Fiscal 2004 and 2003 acquisition-related charges declined significantly
compared with fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2002 acquisition-related charges included the
amortization of goodwill. Due to our adoption of SFAS 142, fiscal 2004 and
fiscal 2003 acquisition-related charges did not include the amortization of
goodwill.

Loss on Impairment of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, events and circumstances indicated
impairment of goodwill that we recorded in connection with our acquisition of
Intuit Public Sector Solutions. IPSS became part of our Intuit-Branded Small
Business segment. The primary indicator of impairment was the fact that actual
sales levels did not meet initial projections. Based on our analysis, in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we recorded a charge of $18.7 million to reduce
the carrying value of the goodwill to $10.9 million. In August 2004 management
formally approved a plan to sell IPSS. See Note 4 to the financial statements.

The fiscal 2002 loss on impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets
related to certain Internet-based businesses in our Intuit-Branded Small
Business and Other Businesses segments. Indicators of impairment included a
steep decline in demand for online advertising reflecting the industry-wide
decline in Internet advertising spending and our decision to eliminate the use
of certain technology purchased from one of the businesses. Based on our
analyses, in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we recorded charges totaling
$27.3 million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill and purchased
intangible assets associated with these businesses to zero. See Note 4 to the
financial statements.

Loss on Impairment of Long-Lived Asset

In connection with the sale of our Quicken Bill Manager business in May 2001,
we acquired a $27.0 million long-term asset related to future consideration
from the buyer. During fiscal 2002, events and circumstances indicated
impairment of this asset and we recorded a charge of $27.0 million to reduce
its carrying value to zero. See Note 10 to the financial statements.

Segment Operating Income (Loss)

Segment operating income or loss is segment net revenue less segment cost of
revenue and operating expenses. Segment expenses do not include certain costs,
such as corporate general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to
specific segments. In addition, segment expenses do not include
acquisition-related costs, which include acquisition-related charges, goodwill
and purchased intangible asset impairment charges, amortization of purchased
software and charges for purchased research and development. Segment expenses
also do not include realized net



gains or losses on marketable securities and other investments, and interest
and other income. See Note 11 to the financial statements for reconciliations of total segment operating
income to income from operations for each fiscal year presented.

QuickBooks-Related

Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003

. The increase in QuickBooks-Related
segment operating income in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 was primarily
due to 18% higher revenue that included strong growth in our high-margin DIY
payroll business. In addition, fiscal 2004 operating income for this segment
included operating income for Innovative Merchant Solutions, which we acquired
in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. These factors were partially offset by
increases in spending for QuickBooks product development, technical support,
marketing programs and direct sales personnel and infrastructure.

Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002

. The increase in QuickBooks-Related
segment operating income in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 was primarily
due to 20% higher revenue that included strong growth in our high-margin DIY
payroll business. These factors were partially offset by increases in spending
for product development, marketing, sales and technical support for
industry-specific versions of QuickBooks that launched late in fiscal 2002 and
throughout fiscal 2003.

Intuit-Branded Small Business

Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003

. Our Intuit-Branded Small Business
segment had operating income in fiscal 2004 after it broke even in fiscal 2003
because revenue for this segment grew 14% while we held costs steady in our
information technology and industry solutions businesses. Partially offsetting
these improvements, outsourced payroll operating income was lower in fiscal
2004 because we incurred expenses for additional sales and service personnel
during the first half of the year that were not completely offset by increased
revenue.

Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002

. Intuit-Branded Small Business broke
even in fiscal 2003 after experiencing an operating loss in fiscal 2002. The
primary reasons for the improvement in operating margin were growth in our
outsourced payroll business and our acquisition of Intuit Information
Technology Solutions in the first quarter of fiscal 2003.

Consumer Tax

Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003

. Consumer Tax segment operating income
growth in fiscal 2004 was slightly above revenue growth for that period because
gross margin improvements due to higher average selling prices and growing
high-margin service revenues were only partially offset by additional costs
incurred for national television and radio advertising in fiscal 2004.

Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002

. Consumer Tax segment operating income
growth in fiscal 2003 was above revenue growth for that period as improvements
in average selling prices were partially offset by additional costs incurred
for higher partner royalties and infrastructure.



Professional Tax

Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003

. Professional Tax segment operating
income declined slightly on a 3% revenue increase in fiscal 2004 compared with
fiscal 2003. Segment operating income did not grow in fiscal 2004 because of
increased spending on product development and customer service.

Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002

. Professional Tax segment operating
income grew in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 due to streamlining of
training and materials costs that produced higher gross margins on 8% revenue
growth. Operating expenses for this segment remained relatively flat in fiscal
2003 due to staffing efficiencies achieved in customer service.

Other Businesses

Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003

. Other Businesses segment operating
income grew faster than revenue due primarily to Quicken revenue increases on
relatively flat costs and our exit from the online brokerage business in the
first quarter of fiscal 2004. Partially offsetting the Quicken improvements,
Canadian operating income was down in fiscal 2004.

Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002

. Other Businesses segment operating
income grew during fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 as a result of reduced
spending in our Quicken online advertising business and reduction of other
Quicken operating expenses as operational efficiencies were introduced.
Canadian operating income was also slightly higher in fiscal 2003.

Total interest and other income declined in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal
2003 but increased in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002. The interest
income that we earn on our cash and short-term investment balances decreased
$8.1 million in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 and $9.6 million in
fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 due to our reinvestment of maturing
instruments in new instruments that generally yielded lower current market
interest rates. In addition, due to the Company’s continued investment in its
stock repurchase programs and in acquisitions, average invested balances were
lower in fiscal 2004 than in fiscal 2003 and were lower in fiscal 2003 than in
fiscal 2002.

Fiscal 2004 and 2003 interest and other income included royalties from
trademark license and distribution agreements that we entered into when we sold
our mortgage business in July 2002. See Note 9 to the financial statements.
This is the primary reason for the increase in total interest and other income
in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002. Interest and other income also
includes net gains resulting from foreign exchange transactions that were due
primarily to the effect of the weakening U.S. dollar on intercompany balances
with our Canadian subsidiary.



Gains (Losses) on Marketable Securities and Other Investments, Net

We recorded pre-tax net gains relating to marketable securities and other
investments in fiscal 2004 and 2003 while we recorded a pre-tax net loss
relating to marketable securities and other investments in fiscal 2002. The
fiscal 2003 net gain and fiscal 2002 net loss included charges totaling $2.8
million and $9.5 million to write down certain long-term investments for which
the decline in fair value below carrying value was other-than-temporary.

Gain on Divestiture of Business

In March 2002 we paid $12.0 million to terminate our remaining $20.3 million
obligation under an interactive services agreement related to our Quicken Bill
Manager business, which we sold in May 2001. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $8.3
million in connection with the termination of this agreement.

Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate was 30% for fiscal 2004, 33% for fiscal 2003 and 24% for
fiscal 2002. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 differed from the federal
statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of reversals of $35.7 million in
reserves related to potential income tax exposures that have been resolved and
to the benefit received from tax-exempt interest income and various tax credits
offset by state taxes, acquisition-related charges and deferred tax
adjustments. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 differed from the federal
statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of the benefit received from
tax-exempt interest income and various tax credits offset by state taxes and
acquisition-related charges. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2002 differed
from the federal statutory rate primarily due to a tax benefit related to a
divestiture that became available during the year and to tax-exempt interest
income offset by non-deductible merger related charges. See Note 14 to the
financial statements.

At July 31, 2004, we had net deferred tax assets of $167.2 million, which
included a valuation allowance of $7.5 million for net operating loss
carryforwards relating to our international subsidiaries and certain state
capital loss carryforwards. The allowance reflects management’s assessment that
we may not receive the benefit of certain loss carryforwards of our
international subsidiaries and capital loss carryforwards in certain state
jurisdictions. While we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient,
it may be necessary to increase this amount if it becomes more likely that we
will not realize a greater portion of the net deferred tax assets. We assess
the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. See
Note 14 to the financial statements.

Discontinued Operations

Intuit KK

In February 2003 we sold our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, and
accounted for the sale as discontinued operations. In accordance with SFAS 144,
we have segregated the operating results of Intuit KK from continuing
operations on our statement of operations for all periods prior to the sale. We
recorded a gain on disposal of these discontinued operations of $71.0 million,
net of income taxes of $5.1 million, in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. See
Note 9 to the financial statements.

Quicken Loans

In July 2002 we sold 87.5% of our Quicken Loans mortgage business segment and
accounted for the sale as discontinued operations. In accordance with APB 30,
we have segregated the operating results of Quicken Loans from continuing
operations on our statement of operations for all periods prior to the sale. We
recorded a net gain on disposal of these discontinued operations of $23.3
million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. In October 2002, we sold our
residual equity interest in the purchasing company and recognized a net gain of
$5.6 million on the transaction. We receive royalties and fees under certain
licensing and distribution agreements that relate to our former Quicken Loans
business. We record these amounts as other income on our statement of
operations. See Note 9 to the financial statements.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Statements of Cash Flows

At July 31, 2004 our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled
$1.0 billion, a decrease of $187.6 million from July 31, 2003. In fiscal 2004,
we generated cash primarily from continuing operations and the issuance of
common stock under employee stock plans and we used cash primarily for our
stock repurchase programs, acquisitions and capital expenditures. The following
table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal
2004, 2003 and 2002. See the financial statements for complete statements of
cash flows for those periods.

We generated cash from our operations during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
including net income from continuing operations in each of those years.
Acquisition-related costs were significantly higher in fiscal 2002 than in
fiscal 2003 and 2004 primarily because we amortized goodwill in fiscal 2002.
Due to our adoption of SFAS 142, we stopped amortizing goodwill in fiscal 2003.
Acquisition-related costs also included impairments of goodwill and purchased
intangible assets of $27.3 million in fiscal 2002 and $18.7 million in fiscal
2004.

We used cash for investing activities during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002. Our
primary use of cash for investing activities was for business acquisitions. On
a net basis, we invested cash in available-for-sale debt securities in fiscal
2004 and 2003 while we drew cash from them in fiscal 2002.

We used cash for our financing activities in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
primarily for the repurchase of stock under our stock repurchase programs. See

“Stock Repurchase Programs”

below and Note 15 to the financial statements. This
was partially offset by proceeds that we received from the issuance of common
stock under employee stock plans in each of these fiscal years.

Cash generated by discontinued operations in fiscal 2003 included collection of
$241.6 million in amounts due from Quicken Loans and Intuit KK and a net gain
of $71.0 million from the sale of Intuit KK. Cash generated by discontinued
operations during fiscal 2002 was primarily from collection of $108.1 million
in amounts due from Quicken Loans and Intuit KK, net income from discontinued
operations of $63.2 million and a gain of $23.3 million on the sale of Quicken
Loans.



Stock Repurchase Programs

Intuit’s Board of Directors has initiated a series of common stock repurchase
programs. Shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become
treasury shares. The following table summarizes our stock repurchase programs

Loans to Executive Officers and Other Employees

Outstanding loans to executive officers and other employees totaled $17.1
million at July 31, 2004 and $19.7 million at July 31, 2003. Loans to executive
officers are primarily relocation loans that are generally secured by real
property and have original maturity dates of up to 10 years. At July 31, 2004,
no loans were overdue and all interest payments were current in accordance with
the terms of the loan agreements. Consistent with the requirements of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, no loans to executive officers have been made or
modified since July 30, 2002 and we do not intend to make or modify loans to
executive officers in the future. See Note 19 to the financial statements.

Other

We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or
businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other
companies. We may decide to use cash and cash equivalents to fund such
activities in the future.

We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be
sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital and capital expenditure
requirements for at least the next twelve months.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

On March 31, 2004, the FASB issued its exposure draft,

“Share-Based Payment,”

which is a proposed amendment to SFAS 123. The exposure draft would require all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options
and purchases under employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized as expenses
in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods.
The FASB expects to issue a final standard late in 2004 that would be effective
for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2004. We
have not yet assessed the impact of adopting this new standard. See Note 1 to
the financial statements.



RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

We face intense competitive pressures in all of our businesses that may negatively impact our revenue, profitability and market position.

We have formidable competitors and we expect competition to remain intense
during fiscal 2005 and beyond. The number, resources and sophistication of the
companies with whom we compete has increased as we continue to expand our
product and service offerings. Microsoft Corporation, in particular, presents
a significant threat to a number of our businesses due to its market position,
strategic focus and superior financial resources. Our competitors may
introduce new and improved products and services, bundle new offerings with
market-leading products, reduce prices, gain better access to distribution
channels, advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and
services. Any of these competitive actions – particularly any prolonged price
competition – could diminish our revenue and profitability and could affect our
ability to keep existing customers and acquire new customers. Some additional
competitive factors that may impact our businesses are as follows:

QuickBooks-Related

. Losing existing or potential QuickBooks customers to
competitors causes us to lose potential software revenue and limits our
opportunities to sell related products and services such as our financial
supplies, DIY payroll and merchant service offerings. Many competitors and
potential competitors provide, or have expressed significant interest in
providing, accounting and business management products and services to small
businesses. For example, Microsoft currently offers a number of competitive
small business offerings and has indicated part of its growth strategy is to
focus on small business offerings. Accordingly, we expect that competition
from Microsoft in the small business area will intensify over time with the
introduction of small business offerings that directly compete with our
QuickBooks and other offerings. Given its market position and resources, if
Microsoft launches additional products and services that directly compete with
our offerings it may have a significant negative impact on our revenue and
profitability.

Consumer Tax

. Our consumer tax business faces significant competition from
both the public and private sector. In the public sector we face the risk of
federal and state taxing authorities developing or contracting to provide
software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic
filing at no charge to taxpayers.

•

Federal Government

. Agencies of the U.S. government have made
several attempts during the two most recent presidential
administrations to offer taxpayers a form of free tax preparation
software and filing service. However, in October 2002 the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service agreed not to develop or deploy its own
competing tax software product or service so long as participants in an
association of private tax preparation software companies, including
Intuit, agreed to provide Web-based federal tax preparation and filing
services at no cost to qualified taxpayers for a period of three years,
subject to recurring two-year extensions. The relationship, called the
“Free File Alliance,” is intended to serve lower income, disadvantaged
and underserved taxpayers with the objective of making free online tax
preparation software and filing services available to at least 60% of
taxpayers. Although the Free File Alliance has kept the federal
government from being a direct competitor to our tax offerings, it has
caused us to lose revenue opportunities for a large percentage of the
tax base. In addition, some of our competitors are using the Free File
Alliance as a free marketing tool by giving away services at the
federal level and attempting to make money from ancillary service
offerings. Further, were the federal government to terminate the Free
File Alliance and elect to provide its own software and electronic
filing services available to taxpayers at no charge it would negatively
impact our revenue and profits.

•

State Governments

. State taxing authorities have also actively
pursued strategies to provide free online tax return preparation and
electronic filing services for state taxpayers. During 2004 at least
15 states participated in Free File Alliance collaborations with
private sector software companies to offer free online tax preparation
and electronic filing services to qualified taxpayers. However, 22
states, including California, directly offered their own online
services to taxpayers. It is possible that other governmental entities
that currently do not offer such services will elect to pursue similar
competitive offerings in the future. These publicly sponsored programs
have caused us to lose potential customers to free offerings and have
enabled competitors to gain market share at our expense by using
participation in the free alliances as an effective tool to attract
customers to ancillary paid offerings. Given the efficiencies that
electronic tax filing provides to taxing authorities, we anticipate
that governmental competition will present a continued competitive
threat to our business for the foreseeable future.



•

Private Sector

. In the private sector we face intense competition
primarily from H&R Block, the makers of TaxCut software, and from
web-based competitive offerings. We also compete for customers with
low-cost assisted tax preparation businesses, such as H&R Block.

Other Segments (Intuit-Branded Small Business, Professional Tax and Other
Businesses)

. Our professional tax offerings face pricing pressure from
competitors seeking to obtain our customers through deep product discounts and
loss of customers to competitors offering no-frills offerings at low prices.
This business also faces competition from competitively-priced integrated
accounting solutions that are more complete than our current offerings. The
substantial size of our principal competitors in the outsourced payroll
services business and our merchant card processing service business benefit
from greater economies of scale that may result in pricing pressure for our
offerings. The growth of electronic banking and other electronic payment
systems is decreasing the demand for checks and consequently causing pricing
pressure for our supplies products as competitors aggressively compete for
share of this shrinking market. Our Quicken products compete both with
Microsoft Money, which is aggressively promoted and priced, and with Web-based
electronic banking and personal finance tracking and management tools that are
becoming increasingly available at no cost to consumers. These competitive
pressures may result in reduced revenue and lower profitability for our Quicken
product line and related bill payment service offering.

The growth of some of our businesses is slowing and if we do not continue to
introduce new and enhanced products and services our revenues and margins will
decline.

We are seeing a slowdown in the revenue growth rate for some of our businesses
as they mature. This trend causes our product development efforts to be even
more critical to our success. Product and service enhancements are necessary
for us to differentiate our offerings from those of our competitors and to
motivate our existing customers to purchase upgrades, or annual licenses in the
case of our tax offerings. A number of our businesses derive a significant
amount of their revenue through one-time upfront license fees and rely on
customer upgrades and service offerings that include upgrades to generate a
significant portion of their revenues. As our existing products mature,
encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging
unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have
meaningful incremental value. If we are not able to develop and clearly
demonstrate the value of upgraded products to our customers, our upgrade and
service revenues will be negatively impacted. Similarly, our business will be
harmed if we are not successful in our efforts to develop and introduce new
products and services that expand our customer base and revenues per customer.

We are implementing new information systems and problems with the design or
implementation of these systems could interfere with our business and
operations.

We are in the process of implementing new information systems to replace
existing systems that manage our business and finance operations. Due to the
size and complexity of our portfolio of businesses, the conversion process is
very challenging. We began switching over in large part to the new information
systems in September 2004 with the upgrade of significant financial systems,
order-taking systems, middleware systems (systems to allow for interoperability
of different databases) and network security systems. Although the upgraded
systems appear to be functioning in a stable manner and performing tasks at
acceptable performance levels for our current business demands, we may still
encounter difficulties as our business demands increase and as greater
functionality from the systems is required. For example, we have not yet
successfully closed a financial reporting period with data generated by the
upgraded systems. Similarly, the upgraded systems have not yet been subject
to, and may not be able to handle, the demand peaks caused by the seasonal
nature of our business. In addition, although the switch over of our more
critical systems is underway, we will be continuing to replace existing systems
throughout fiscal year 2005. Any disruptions relating to our systems
enhancements, particularly any disruptions impacting our operations during our
second and third fiscal quarters, could adversely impact our ability to do the
following in a timely and accurate manner: take customer orders, ship products,
provide services and support to our customers, bill and track our customers,
fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business. Even if we do
succeed, the implementation may be much more costly than we anticipated. If we
are unable to successfully implement new information systems as planned, in
addition to adversely impacting our financial position, results of operations,
and cash flows in the short and long term, it could also affect our ability to
collect the information necessary to timely file our first quarter fiscal 2005
financial reports with the SEC.



Our new product and service offerings may not achieve market success or may
cannibalize sales of our existing products, causing our revenues and earnings
to decrease.

Our future success depends in large part upon our ability to identify emerging
opportunities in our target markets and our capacity to quickly develop, and
sell products and services that satisfy these demands in a cost effective
manner. Successfully predicting demand trends is difficult and we may expend a
significant amount of resources and management attention on products or
services that do not succeed in their markets. We have encountered difficulty
in launching new products and services in the past. For example, in 2003 we
ended our Quicken Brokerage service offering due to lack of customer acceptance.
If we misjudge customer needs, our new products and
services will not succeed and our revenues and earnings will be negatively
impacted. In addition, as we expand our offerings to new customer categories
we run the risk of customers shifting from higher priced and higher margin
products to newly introduced lower priced offerings.

If we experience significant product quality problems or delays it will harm
our revenues, operating income and reputation.

All of our tax products, and many of our non-tax products, have rigid
development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the
risk of launch delays. Many of our products are highly complex and require
interoperability with other software products and services. Our tax
preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due
to the need to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year
and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of
these products to prepare and file their taxes by April 15th. Due to this
complexity and the condensed development cycles under which we operate our
products sometimes contain “bugs” that can unexpectedly interfere with the
operation of the software. For example, our software may face interoperability
difficulties with software operating systems or programs being used by our
customers. When we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code,
distribute patches to customers that had already purchased the product and
recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels.
If we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late
in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product launch date. Any
major defects or launch delays could lead to the following:

•

loss of customers to competitors, which could also deprive us of
future revenue attributable to repeat purchases, product upgrades and
purchases of related services;

•

negative publicity and damage to our brands;

•

customer dissatisfaction;

•

reduced retailer shelf space and product promotions; and

•

increased operating expenses, such as inventory replacement costs
and in our consumer tax business, expenses resulting from our
commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due
solely to calculation errors in our consumer tax preparation products.

If we fail to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our
electronic tax offerings, or if the IRS or other governmental agencies
experience difficulties in receiving customer submissions, we could lose
revenue and customers.

Our Web-based tax preparation and electronic filing services must effectively
handle extremely heavy customer demand during the peak tax season. We face
significant risks and challenges in maintaining these services and maintaining
adequate service levels, particularly during peak volume service times.
Similarly, governmental entities receiving electronic tax filings must also
handle large volumes of data and may experience difficulties with their systems
preventing the receipt of electronic filings. If customers are unable to file
their returns electronically they may elect to make paper filings. This would
result in reduced electronic tax return preparation and filing revenues and
profits and would negatively impact our reputation and ability to keep and
attract customers who demand a reliable electronic filing experience. We have
experienced relatively brief unscheduled interruptions in our electronic filing
and/or tax preparation services during past tax years. For example, on April
15, 2003 we experienced a relatively brief unscheduled interruption in our
electronic filing service during which certain users of our professional tax
products were unable to receive confirmation from us that their electronic
filing had been accepted and on April 15, 2002 we reached maximum capacity for
processing e-filings for short period of time. If we experience any prolonged
difficulties with our Web-based tax preparation or electronic filing service at
any time during the tax season, we could lose current and future customers,
receive negative publicity and incur increased



operating costs, any of which could have a significant negative impact on the
financial and market success of these businesses and have a negative impact on
our near-term and long-term financial results.

Our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and our quarterly results
fluctuate significantly.

Several of our businesses are highly seasonal causing significant quarterly
fluctuations in our financial results. Revenue and operating results are
usually strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending January 31
and April 30 due to our tax businesses contributing most of their revenue
during those quarters and the timing of the release of our small business
software upgrades. We experience lower revenues, and significant operating
losses, in the first and fourth quarters ending October 31 and July 31. Our
financial results can also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year
due to a variety of factors, including changes in product sales mix that affect
average selling prices, product release dates, the timing of our discontinuance
of support for older product offerings, the timing of sales of our
higher-priced Intuit-Branded Small Business offerings, our methods for
distributing our products, including the shift to a consignment model for some
of our desktop products sold through retail distribution channels, and the
timing of acquisitions, divestitures, and goodwill and purchased intangible
asset impairment charges.

As our product and service offerings become more complex our revenue streams
become less predictable.

Our expanding range of products and services generates more varied revenue
streams than our traditional desktop software businesses. The accounting
policies that apply to these revenue streams are more complex than those that
apply to our traditional products and services. We expect this trend to
continue as we acquire additional companies and expand our offerings. For
example, as we begin to offer additional features and options as part of
multiple-element sales arrangements, we could be required to defer a higher
percentage of our product revenue at the time of sale than we do for
traditional products. This would decrease recognized revenue at the time
products are shipped, but result in increased recognized revenue in fiscal
periods after shipment. For example, some of our TurboTax offerings provide
for both use of our software and filing of returns electronically, causing some
of our revenue to be deferred until the time of the actual filing of tax
returns by our customers. In addition, our Intuit-Branded Small Business
segment businesses offer products and services with significantly higher prices
than we have traditionally offered. Revenue from these offerings tends to be
less predictable than revenue from our traditional desktop products, due to
longer sales and implementation cycles. These businesses also tend to rely on
a relatively small number of large orders for a substantial portion of their
revenue in a particular quarter, which could cause our quarterly revenue from
these businesses to fluctuate.

Acquisition-related costs and impairment charges can cause significant
fluctuation in our net income.

Our recent acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses, including
amortization of purchased software (which is reflected in cost of revenue), as
well as charges for in-process research and development, and amortization and
impairment of goodwill, purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation
(which are reflected in operating expenses). Total acquisition-related costs
in the categories identified above were $196.0 million in fiscal 2002, $56.6
million in fiscal 2003 and $56.6 million in fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2003 and 2004
acquisition-related costs have declined primarily because of a change in the
accounting treatment of goodwill. However, we may incur less frequent, but
larger, impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to
goodwill arising out of future acquisitions. We test the impairment of
goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators
of impairment arise. The timing of the formal annual test may result in charges
to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have
been reasonably foreseen in prior periods. For example, at the end of fiscal
2004 we incurred an impairment charge of $18.7 million related to our
acquisition of Intuit Public Sector Solutions. As of July 31, 2004, we had an
unamortized goodwill balance of approximately $670.0 million, which could be
subject to impairment charges in the future. New acquisitions, and any
impairment of the value of purchased assets, could have a significant negative
impact on our future operating results.

If we do not respond promptly and effectively to customer service and technical
support inquiries we will lose customers and our revenues will decline.

The effectiveness of our customer service and technical support operations are
critical to customer satisfaction and our financial success. If we do not
respond effectively to service and technical support requests we will lose
customers and miss out on potential revenue opportunities, such as paid service
and new product sales. In our



service offerings, such as our merchant card processing and outsourced payroll
businesses, customer service delivery is fundamental to retaining and
maintaining existing customer and acquiring new customers. We occasionally
experience customer service and technical support problems, including longer
than expected waiting times for customers when our staffing and systems are
inadequate to handle a higher-than-anticipated volume of requests. We also
risk losing service at any one of our customer contact centers and our
redundancy systems could prove inadequate to provide backup support. Training
and retaining qualified customer service and technical support personnel is
particularly challenging due to the expansion of our product offerings and the
seasonality of our tax business. For example, in fiscal 2004 the number of our
consumer tax service representatives ranged from 10 during off-season months to
about 750 at the peak of the season. If we do not adequately train our support
representatives our customers will not receive the level of support that they
demand and we strive to deliver. To improve our performance in this area, we
must eliminate underlying causes of service and support requests through
product improvements, better order fulfillment processes, more robust self-help
tools, and improved ability to accurately anticipate demand for support.
Implementing any of these improvements can be expensive, time consuming and
ultimately prove unsuccessful. If we do not deliver the high level of support
that our customers expect for any of the reasons stated above we will lose
customers and our financial results will suffer.

If we encounter problems with our third-party customer service and technical
support providers our business will be harmed and margins will decline.

We outsource a substantial portion of our customer support activities to
third-party service providers, most significantly to service providers in
India. During fiscal 2004 we greatly increased the number of third-party
customer service representatives working on our behalf and we expect to
continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future. This strategy
provides us with lower operating costs and greater flexibility, but also
presents risks to our business, including the following:

•

International outsourcing has received considerable negative
attention in the media and there are indications that the U.S. Congress
may pass legislation that would impact how we operate and impact
customer perceptions of our service. For example, in Congress
legislators have discussed restricting the flow of personal information
to overseas providers and requiring representatives in foreign
jurisdictions to affirmatively identify themselves by name and
location;

•

Customers may react negatively to providing information to and
receiving support from overseas organizations;

•

We may not be able to impact the quality of support that we provide
as directly as we are able to in our company-run call centers;

•

In recent years India has experienced political instability and
changing policies that may impact our operations. In addition, for a
number of years India and Pakistan have been in conflict and an active
state of war between the two countries could disrupt our services; and

•

We rely on a global communications infrastructure that may be
interrupted in a number of ways. For example, in fiscal 2004 we had to
reroute calls to India due to an underwater cable being cut in the
Mediterranean Sea.

We face significant risks in our retail distribution channel that could result
in loss of revenues and reduced margins.

We sell most of our desktop software products through our retail distribution
channel and a relatively small number of retailers generate much of our sales
volume. Our principal retailers have significant bargaining leverage due to
their size and available resources. Any change in principal business terms,
termination or major disruption of our relationship with these resellers could
result in a potentially significant decline in our revenues and earnings. For
example, the sourcing decisions, product display locations and promotional
activities that retailers undertake can greatly impact the sales of our
products. Due to its seasonal nature, sales of TurboTax are particularly
impacted by such decisions and if our principal distribution sources were to
elect to carry or promote competitive products our revenues would decline. The
fact that we also sell our products directly could cause retailers to reduce
their efforts to promote our products or stop selling our products altogether.
If any of our retailers run into financial difficulties we may be unable to
collect amounts that we are owed.



Selling new products may be more challenging and costlier than selling our
historical products, causing our margins to decline.

Because our strategy for some of our products involves the routine introduction
of new products at retail, if retailers do not offer our new products we will
not be able to grow as planned. An outcome of our “Right for Me” marketing
approach is the introduction of additional versions of our products. Retailers
may be reluctant to stock unproven products, or products that sell at higher
prices, but more slowly. Retailers may also choose to place less emphasis on
software as a category within their stores. In addition, it may be costlier
for us to market and sell some of our higher priced products due to our need to
convey the more customer-specific value of the products to customers rather
than communicating more generalized benefits. This may require us to develop
other marketing programs that supplement our traditional in-store promotional
efforts to sell these products to customers causing our margins to shrink. If
retail distribution proves an ineffective channel for certain of our new
offerings it could adversely impact our growth, revenue and profitability.

If our manufacturing and distribution suppliers execute poorly our business
will be harmed.

We have chosen to outsource the manufacturing and distribution of many of our
desktop software products to a small number of third party providers and we use
a single vendor to produce and distribute our check and business forms supplies
products. Although our reliance on a small number of suppliers, or a single
supplier, provides us with efficiencies and enhanced bargaining power, poor
performance by or lack of effective communication with these parties can
significantly harm our business. This risk is amplified by the fact that we
carry very little inventory and rely on just-in-time manufacturing processes.
We have experienced problems with our suppliers in the past. For example,
during fiscal 2004 one of our suppliers was unable to fulfill orders for some
of our software products for a number of days due to operational difficulties
and communication errors. Although together we were able to mitigate the
impact of that delay with minimal disruption to our business, if we experience
longer delays, delays during a peak demand period or significant quality issues
our business will be significantly harmed.

Failure of our information technology systems or those of our service providers
could adversely affect our future operating results.

We rely on a variety of internal technology systems and technology systems
maintained by our outside manufacturing and distribution suppliers to take and
fulfill customer orders, handle customer service requests, host our Web-based
activities, support internal operations, and store customer and company data.
These systems could be damaged or interrupted, preventing us or our service
providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or otherwise
interrupting our business. In addition, these systems could suffer security
breaches, causing company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed.
Any of these occurrences could adversely impact our operations. We have
experienced system challenges in the past. For example, during fiscal 2004
some of our non-critical systems were interrupted due to computer viruses that
caused loss of productivity and added expense. We also experience computer
server failures from time to time. To prevent interruptions we must
continually upgrade our systems and processes to ensure that we have adequate
recoverability – both of which are costly and time consuming. While we and our
outside service partners have backup systems for certain aspects of our
operations, not all systems upon which we rely are fully redundant and disaster
recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.

Possession and use of personal customer information by our businesses presents
risks and expenses that could harm our business.

A number of our businesses possess personal customer information. Possession
and use of this information in conducting our business subjects us to
regulatory burdens and potential lawsuits. We have incurred – and will
continue to incur – significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and
security standards and protocols and there is a trend toward greater regulation
of privacy. For example, regulations like the recently created federal “Do Not
Call List,” and actions by Internet service providers to limit communications
with their subscribers may impede our ability to communicate with our customers
and increase our compliance costs. Because our businesses rely heavily on
direct marketing, any limitations on our ability to communicate with our
customers could harm our financial results. In the past we have experienced
lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues and we could face
similar suits in the future. A major breach of customer privacy or security by
Intuit, or even another company, could have serious negative consequences for
our businesses, including direct damages that we may be



required to pay as a result of a breach by us, reduced customer demand for our
services and additional regulation by federal or state agencies. Although we
have sophisticated network security, internal control measures, and physical
security procedures to safeguard customer information, there can be no
assurance that a data security breach or theft will not occur resulting in harm
to our business and results of operations.

If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors
may exploit our innovations, which could weaken our competitive position and
reduce our revenues.

Our success depends upon our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination
of copyright, trade secret, trademark, patent, confidentiality procedures and
licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. As
part of our confidentiality procedures, we generally enter into non-disclosure
agreements with our employees, contractors, distributors and corporate partners
and into license agreements with respect to our software, documentation and
other proprietary information. Effectively creating and protecting our
proprietary rights is expensive and may require us to engage in expensive and
distracting litigation. Despite these precautions, third parties could copy or
otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization.
Because we outsource significant aspects of our product development,
manufacturing and distribution we are at risk that confidential portions of our
intellectual property could become public by lapses in security by our
contractors. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the
future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted
material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value
of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. It is also possible that
other companies could successfully challenge the validity or scope of our
patents and that our patent portfolio, which is relatively small, may not
provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage. Ultimately, our attempts
to secure legal protection for our proprietary rights may not be adequate and
our competitors could independently develop similar technologies, duplicate our
products, or design around patents and other intellectual property rights. If
our intellectual property protection proves inadequate we could lose our
competitive advantage and our financial results will suffer.

We expect copying and misuse of our intellectual property to be a persistent
problem causing lost revenue and increased expenses.

Our intellectual property rights are among our most valuable assets. Policing
unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult, expensive, and time
consuming. Current U.S. laws that prohibit copying give us only limited
practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries
provide very little protection. We may not be able to prevent misappropriation
of our technology. For example, we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of
our software being sold through online auction sites and other online
marketplaces. In addition, efforts to protect our intellectual property may be
misunderstood and perceived negatively by our customers. For example, during
2003 we employed technology to prohibit unauthorized sharing of our TurboTax
products. These efforts were not effectively communicated causing a negative
reaction by some of our customers who misunderstood our actions. Although we
continue to evaluate technology solutions to piracy, and we continue to
increase our civil and criminal enforcement efforts, we expect piracy to be a
persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses.

We do not own all of the software, other technologies and content used in our
products and services.

Many of our products are designed to include intellectual property owned by
third parties. We believe we have all of the necessary licenses from third
parties to use and distribute third party technology and content that we do not
own that is used in our current products and services. From time to time we
may be required to renegotiate with these third parties – or negotiate with new
third parties – to include their technology or content in our existing
products, in new versions of our existing products or in wholly new products.
We may not be able to negotiate or renegotiate licenses on reasonable terms, or
at all. If we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use or continue to
use third-party technology or content in our products and services, we may not
be able to sell the affected products, which would in turn have a negative
impact on our revenue and operating results.

We may unintentionally infringe the intellectual property rights of others,
which could expose us to substantial damages or restrict our business
operations.

As the number of our products and services increases and their features and
content continue to expand, and as we acquire technology through acquisitions
or licenses, we may increasingly become subject to infringement claims by third
parties. We expect that software products in general will increasingly be
subject to these claims as the number



of products and competitors increase, the functionality of products overlap and
as the patenting of software functionality continues to grow. From time to
time, we have received communications from third parties in which the claimant
alleges that a product or service we offer infringes the claimant’s
intellectual property rights. Occasionally these communications result in
lawsuits. In many of these cases, it is difficult to assess the extent to which
the intellectual property right that the claimant asserts is valid or the
extent to which we have any material exposure. The receipt of a notice
alleging infringement may require us to obtain a costly opinion of counsel to
prevent an allegation of intentional infringement. Future claims could present
an exposure of uncertain magnitude. Existing or future infringement claims or
lawsuits against us, whether valid or not, may be time consuming and expensive
to defend and be distracting to our developers and management. Intellectual
property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the
following: cease selling, incorporating or using products or services that
incorporate the challenged intellectual property; obtain a license from the
holder of the infringed intellectual property, which may not be available on
commercially favorable terms or at all; or redesign our software products or
services, possibly in a manner that reduces their commercial appeal. Any of
these actions may cause material harm to our business and financial results.

Our acquisition activity could disrupt our ongoing business and may present
risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions.

We have acquired and may continue to acquire companies, products and
technologies that complement our strategic direction. For example, over the
last three fiscal years we have acquired the stock or assets of eight
companies. These acquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties,
including:

•

inability to successfully integrate the acquired technology and
operations into our business and maintain uniform standards, controls,
policies, and procedures;

•

distraction of management’s attention away from normal business operations;

•

challenges retaining the key employees of the acquired operation;

•

insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed;

•

expenses associated with the acquisition; and

•

unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process,
including product quality issues and legal contingencies.

Acquisitions are inherently risky, we can not be certain that our previous or
future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect
the conduct, operating results or financial condition of our business. We have
generally paid cash for our recent acquisitions. If we issue common stock or
other equity related purchase rights as consideration in an acquisition,
current shareholders’ percentage ownership and earnings per share may become
diluted.

If we fail to operate our outsourced payroll business effectively our revenue
and profitability will be harmed.

Our payroll business handles a significant amount of dollar and transaction
volume. Due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle effective
processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are
handled appropriately. Despite our efforts, it is possible that we may make
errors or that funds may be misappropriated. In addition to any direct damages
and fines that any such problems would create, which could be substantial, the
loss of customer confidence in our accuracy and controls would seriously harm
our business. Our payroll business has grown largely through acquisitions and
our systems are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult
to scale. We must constantly continue to upgrade our systems and processes to
ensure that we process customer data in an accurate, reliable and timely
manner. These upgrades must also meet the various regulatory deadlines
associated with employer-related payroll activities. Any failure of our
systems or processes in critical switch-over times, such as in January when
many businesses elect to change payroll service providers, would be detrimental
to our business. If we failed to timely deliver any of our payroll products,
it could cause our current and prospective customers to choose a competitor’s
product for that year’s payroll and not to purchase Intuit products in the
future. To generate sustained growth in our payroll business we must
successfully develop and manage a more proactive inside and field sales
operation. If these efforts are not successful our revenue growth and
profitability will decline.



Interest income attributable to payroll customer deposits may fluctuate or be
eliminated causing our revenue and profitability to decline.

We currently earn revenue from interest earned on customer deposits that we
hold pending payment of funds to taxing authorities or to customers’ employees.
If interest rates decline, or there are regulatory changes that diminish the
amount of time that we are required or permitted to hold such funds our
interest revenue will decline.

We face a number of risks in our merchant card processing business that could
result in a reduction in our revenues and profits.

Our merchant card processing service business is subject to the following
risks:

•

if merchants for whom we process credit card transactions are
unable to pay refunds due to their customers in connection with
disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions we may be required to pay
those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of the customer
reserves we have established to make such payments;

•

we will not be able to conduct our business if the bank sponsors
and card payment processors and other service providers that we rely on
to process bankcard transactions terminate their relationships with us
and we are not able to secure or successfully migrate our business
elsewhere;

•

we could be required to stop providing payment processing services
for Visa and MasterCard if we or our bank sponsors fail to adhere to
the standards of the Visa and MasterCard credit card associations;

•

we depend on independent sales organizations that do not serve us
exclusively to acquire and retain merchant accounts;

•

our profit margins will be reduced if for competitive reasons we
cannot increase our fees at times when Visa and MasterCard increase the
fees that we pay to process merchant transactions through their
systems;

•

unauthorized disclosure of merchant and cardholder data, whether
through breach of our computer systems or otherwise, could expose us to
protracted and costly litigation; and

•

we may encounter difficulties scaling our business systems to
support our growth as we continue to migrate users of our QuickBooks
Merchant Account Services from third-party service providers to our own
systems.

Should any of these risks be realized our business could be harmed and our
financial results will suffer.

Increased state filing mandates could significantly increase our costs.

We are required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in
order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing
services. Changes in state-imposed requirements by one or more of the states,
including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards,
could significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our
customers and could prevent us from delivering a quality product to our
customers in a timely manner.

We may be unable to attract and retain key personnel.

Much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of
skilled personnel, including members of our executive team, and those in
technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the
software and services industries are in high demand and competition for their
talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley and San Diego, California,
where the majority of our employees are located. Although we strive to be an
employer of choice, we may not be able to continue to successfully attract and
retain key personnel which would cause our business to suffer.

If actual product returns exceed returns reserves, or if customer rebates
exceed historical amounts, our revenue would be lower.

We ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than
we expect them to sell, in order to reduce the risk that distributors or
retailers will run out of products. This is particularly true for our Consumer
Tax products, which have a short selling season and for which returns occur
primarily in our fourth fiscal quarter. Like



most software companies, we have historically accepted significant product
returns. We establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our
financial statements, based on estimated future returns of products. We
closely monitor levels of product sales and inventory in the retail channel in
an effort to maintain reserves that are adequate to cover expected returns. In
the past, returns have not generally exceeded these reserves. However, if we
do experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves, it would
result in lower net revenue. In addition, our policy of recognizing revenue
from distributors and retailers upon delivery of product for non-consignment
sales is predicated upon our ability to reasonably estimate returns. If we do
not continue to demonstrate our ability to estimate returns then our revenue
recognition policy for these types of sales may no longer be appropriate. We
also offer customer rebates as part of our selling efforts and establish
reserves for payment of rebates. Historically a percentage of customers do not
submit requests for their rebates. If a greater number of eligible customers
seek rebates than for which we have provided reserves, our margins will be
adversely affected. For example, if rebate redemptions for our QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken products were to increase by 1%, it would result in a decrease
of approximately $1 million in our revenue.

Our insurance policies are costly, may be inadequate and potentially expose us
to unrecoverable risks.

Insurance availability, coverage terms and pricing continue to vary with market
conditions. We endeavor to obtain appropriate insurance coverage for insurable
risks that we identify, however, we may fail to correctly anticipate or
quantify insurable risks, we may not be able to obtain appropriate insurance
coverage, and insurers may not respond as we intend to cover insurable events
that may occur. We have observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance
markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional corporate insurance. Such
conditions have resulted in higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles,
and lower coverage limits. For some risks, because of cost or availability,
the Company does not have insurance coverage. For these reasons, the Company
is retaining a greater portion of its insurable risks than it has in the past
at relatively greater cost.

If we are required to account for options under our employee stock plans as a
compensation expense, it would significantly reduce our net income and earnings
per share.

Although we are not currently required to record any compensation expense in
connection with option grants to employees that have an exercise price at or
above fair market value, it is possible that future accounting pronouncements
will require us to treat all employee stock options as a compensation expense.
The increased compensation expense would significantly reduce our net income
and earnings per share under generally accepted accounting principles.

We are frequently a party to litigation that is costly to defend and is a
distraction to our business.

Due to our financial position and the large number of customers that we serve
we are often forced to defend litigation. For example we are currently being
sued in three actions for claims related to our election to stop supporting
certain of our older product offerings. Although we believe that these cases
have no merit and we are defending the matters vigorously, defending such
matters is distracting to management and expensive for Intuit. Although we
often seek insurance coverage for litigation defense costs, there is no
assurance that our defense costs, which can be substantial, will be covered in
all cases. In addition, by its nature, litigation is unpredictable and we may
not prevail even in cases where we strongly believe a plaintiff’s case has no
valid claims. If we do not prevail in litigation we may be required to pay
substantial monetary damages or alter our business operations. Regardless of
the outcome, litigation is expensive and distracting and may reduce our income.

Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results.

Our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by
unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and
liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition,
we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the
Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the
likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine
the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that
the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect
on its operating results and financial condition.



Our stock price may be volatile.

Our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of
variations between our actual and anticipated financial results and as a result
of our announcements and those of our competitors. In addition, the stock
market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected
the market price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated
to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, as well as
general economic and political conditions, may materially adversely affect the
market price of our stock in the future.

If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be
able to detect fraud or report our financial results accurately, which could
harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.

Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial
reports and to detect and prevent fraud. We periodically assess our system of
internal controls, and the internal controls of service providers upon which we
rely, to review their effectiveness and identify potential areas of
improvement. These assessments may conclude that enhancements, modifications
or changes to our system of internal controls are necessary. In addition, from
time to time we acquire businesses, many of which have limited infrastructure
and systems of internal controls. Performing assessments of internal controls,
implementing necessary changes, and maintaining an effective internal controls
process is expensive and requires considerable management attention,
particularly in the case of newly acquired entities. Internal control systems
are designed in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events,
and all such systems, however well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are
met. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there
can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals
under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. If we fail to
implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls or prevent
fraud, we could suffer losses, could be subject to costly litigation, investors
could lose confidence in our reported financial information and our brand and
operating results could be harmed, which could have a negative effect on the
trading price of our common stock.

We must comply with recently enacted legislation known as SOX 404.
Specifically, we and our independent registered public accounting firm must
certify the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting at July
31, 2005. Identification of material weaknesses in internal controls over
financial reporting by us or our independent registered public accounting firm
could adversely affect our competitive position in our business, especially our
outsourced payroll business, and the market price for our common stock.

Business interruptions could adversely affect our future operating results.

Several of our major business operations are subject to interruption by
earthquake, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts,
and other events beyond our control. The majority of our research and
development activities, our corporate headquarters, our principal information
technology systems, and other critical business operations are located near
major seismic faults. We do not carry earthquake insurance for direct
quake-related losses. Our operating results and financial condition could be
materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other
natural or manmade disaster.

Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This Report contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking
statements include our statements regarding the following: our belief that we
can deliver solid revenue and profit growth; our expectations regarding our
product development efforts noted in the last paragraph of the section entitled

“Product Development,”

our belief that our distributor relationships will
increase growth opportunities in our higher-end offerings; our belief that our
current real estate leases are sufficient to meet our current and near-term
needs; our expectations regarding our use of cash generated in our business;
the assumptions underlying our Critical Accounting Policies, including our
estimates regarding product rebate and return reserves; our belief that revenue
growth for our products is slowing due to market maturation; our plans to
mitigate slowing revenue by developing and introducing new products and
services; our plan to sell our Intuit Public Sector Solutions business; our
belief that our income tax valuation allowance is sufficient; our expectation
that we may use cash for future acquisitions of technology and businesses;



and our expectation that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs
for the next 12 months.

We caution investors that forward-looking statements are only predictions based
on our current expectations about future events and are not guarantees of
future performance. Our actual results, performance or achievements could
differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking
statements due to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to
predict. These risks and uncertainties include the following: the impact of
intense competition in our business; difficulty in developing and introducing
new products and services effectively; failure of customers to adopt our new
products as expected; difficulties with suppliers and distribution channels;
challenges associated with upgrading and integrating our information systems;
unanticipated increases in customer rebate and return rates; significant
impairment charges due to past acquisitions; we may be unable to sell our
Intuit Public Sector Solutions business; and taxing authorities may challenge
our tax positions. In addition, the risks and uncertainties that are discussed
in this Item 7 under the caption

“Risks That Could Affect Future Results”

may
also impact these forward-looking statements. We encourage you to read that
section carefully along with the other information provided in this Report and
in our other filings with the SEC before deciding to invest in our stock or to
maintain or change your investment. We undertake no obligation to revise or
update any forward-looking statement for any reason, except as required by law.



ITEM 7A

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Short-Term Investment Portfolio

We do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of short-term
investments and funds held for payroll customers. Our short-term investments
and funds held for payroll customers consist of instruments that meet quality
standards consistent with our investment policy. This policy specifies that,
except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities
issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market or cash
management funds, we diversify our holdings by limiting our short-term
investments and funds held for payroll customers with any individual issuer.

The following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term
investments at July 31, 2004 by stated maturity. The table is classified by the
original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents and
short-term investments that are part of funds held for payroll customers on our
balance sheet. As of July 31, 2004 the interest rate earned on our money market
accounts is 0.90% and the interest rate earned on our short-term investments is
1.22%.

Interest Rate Risk

Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of short-term investments and funds held
for payroll customers are subject to market risk due to changes in interest
rates. Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash
equivalents, short-term investments and funds held for payroll customers and
the value of those investments. Should interest rates increase by 10% from the
levels of July 31, 2004, the value of our short-term investments and funds held
for payroll customers would decline by approximately $0.9 million. Should
interest rates increase by 100 basis points from the levels of July 31, 2004,
the value of our short-term investments and funds held for payroll customers
would decline by approximately $5.9 million.

Impact of Foreign Currency Rate Changes

Since we translate foreign currencies (primarily Canadian dollars and British
pounds) into U.S dollars for financial reporting purposes, currency
fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results. The historical impact
of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial. We believe that our
exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily
because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial
obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies. There was a nominal
currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions for fiscal 2002.
Due primarily to the effect of the weakening U.S. dollar on intercompany
balances with our Canadian subsidiary, we recorded foreign currency exchange
gains of $5.4 million in fiscal 2003 and $3.1 million in fiscal 2004. Although
the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been
immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency
fluctuations will not be significant in the future, there can be no guarantee
that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future. As
of July 31, 2004, we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP,

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intuit Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intuit Inc. as
of July 31, 2003 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended July 31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of Intuit’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Intuit Inc. at
July 31, 2003 and 2004, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2004, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

As disclosed in Note 1 and Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements, on
August 1, 2002 Intuit Inc. changed its method of accounting for goodwill and
other purchased intangible assets.

INTUIT INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of
Intuit and its wholly owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated all significant
intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. We have reclassified
certain other amounts previously reported in our financial statements to
conform to the current presentation. As discussed in Note 9, we accounted for
the July 2002 sale of our Quicken Loans mortgage business and the February 2003
sale of our Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, as discontinued operations.
Accordingly, we have reclassified our financial statements for all periods
prior to the sales to reflect Quicken Loans and Intuit KK as discontinued
operations. Unless noted otherwise, discussions in these notes pertain to our
continuing operations.

Use of Estimates

We make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
financial statements and the disclosures made in the accompanying notes. For
example, we use estimates in determining the appropriate levels of reserves for
product returns and rebates, the collectibility of accounts receivable, the
appropriate levels of various accruals, the amount of our worldwide tax
provision and the realizability of deferred tax assets. We also use estimates
in determining the remaining economic lives and carrying values of purchased
intangible assets (including goodwill), property and equipment and other
long-lived assets. In addition, we use assumptions when employing the
Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options
granted for pro forma disclosures. See Note 1, “

Stock-Based Incentive
Programs

.” Despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and use
reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ from our estimates.

Net Revenue

We derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products, license fees,
product support, professional services, outsourced payroll services,
transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any
combination of these items. We recognize revenue for software products and
related services in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants’ Statement of Position, or SOP, 97-2, “

Software Revenue
Recognition

,” as modified by SOP 98-9. For other offerings, we follow Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

“Revenue Recognition

.” We recognize revenue when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or
performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is
probable.

In some situations, we receive advance payments from our customers. We also
offer multiple element arrangements to our customers. We defer revenue
associated with these advance payments and the fair value of undelivered
elements until we ship the products or perform the services. Deferred revenue
consisted of the following at the dates indicated:

40,665

$

178,840

$

223,380

In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue No. 01-9, “

Accounting for Consideration Given by a
Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendor’s Product

,” we account for
cash consideration (such as sales incentives) that we give to our customers or
resellers as a
reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless we receive a
benefit that we can identify and for which we can reasonably estimate the fair
value.



Product Revenue

We recognize revenue from the sale of our packaged software products
and supplies when we ship the products or, in the case of certain agreements,
when products are delivered to retailers. We sell some of our QuickBooks,
Consumer Tax and Quicken products on consignment to a limited number of
resellers. We recognize revenue for these consignment transactions only when
the end-user sale has occurred.

We reduce product revenue from distributors and retailers for estimated returns
that are based on historical returns experience and other factors such as the
volume and price mix of products in the retail channel, return rates for prior
releases of the product, trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that
might impact customer demand for our products (including the competitive
environment and the timing of new releases of our product). We also reduce
product revenue for the estimated redemption of rebates on certain current
product sales. Our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer sales
incentive rebates are based on distributors’ and retailers’ actual performance
against the terms and conditions of rebate programs, which we typically
establish annually. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on
the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program, actual
sales during the promotion, the amount of redemptions received and historical
redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program.

Service Revenue

We recognize revenue from outsourced payroll processing and payroll
tax filing services as the services are performed, provided we have no other
remaining obligations to these customers. We generally require customers to
remit payroll tax funds to us in advance of the applicable payroll due date via
electronic funds transfer. We include in total net revenue the interest earned
on invested balances resulting from timing differences between when we collect
these funds from customers and when we remit the funds to outside parties.

We offer several technical support plans and recognize support revenue over the
life of the plans. Service revenue also includes Web services such as TurboTax
for the Web and electronic tax filing services in both our Consumer Tax and
Professional Tax segments. Service revenue for electronic payment processing
services that we provide to merchants is recorded net of interchange fees
charged by credit card associations because we do not control these fees.
Finally, service revenue includes revenue from consulting and training
services, primarily in our Intuit-Branded Small Business segment. We generally
recognize revenue as these services are performed, provided that we have no
other remaining obligations to these customers and that the services performed
are not essential to the functionality of delivered products and services.

Other Revenue

Other revenue consists primarily of revenue from revenue-sharing
arrangements with third-party service providers and from online advertising
agreements. We recognize transaction fees from revenue-sharing arrangements as
end-user sales are reported to us by these partners. We typically recognize
revenue from online advertising agreements as the lesser of when the
advertisements are published or pro rata based on the contractual time period.

Multiple Element Arrangements

We enter into certain revenue arrangements for which we are obligated
to deliver multiple products and/or services (multiple elements). For these
arrangements, which generally include software products, we allocate and defer
revenue for the undelivered elements based on their vendor-specific objective
evidence, or VSOE, of fair value. VSOE is generally the price charged when that
element is sold separately.

In situations where VSOE exists for all elements (delivered and undelivered),
we allocate the total revenue to be earned under the arrangement among the
various elements, based on their relative fair value. For transactions where
VSOE exists only for the undelivered elements, we defer the full fair value of
the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total
arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue.
If VSOE does not exist for undelivered items that are services, then we
recognize the entire arrangement fee ratably over the remaining service period.
If VSOE does not exist for undelivered elements that are specified products or
features, we defer revenue until the
earlier of the delivery of all elements or the point at which we determine VSOE
for these undelivered elements.

We recognize revenue related to the delivered products or services only if: (1)
the above revenue recognition criteria are met; (2) any undelivered products or
services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered products and
services; (3) payment for the delivered products or services is not contingent
upon delivery of the remaining



products or services; and (4) we have an
enforceable claim to receive the amount due in the event that we do not deliver
the undelivered products or services.

For arrangements where undelivered services are essential to the functionality
of delivered software, we recognize both the product license revenues and
service revenues under the percentage of completion contract method in
accordance with the provisions of SOP 81-1, “

Accounting for Performance of
Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts

.” To date, license and
service revenues recognized pursuant to SOP 81-1 have not been significant.

Shipping and Handling

We record the amounts we charge our customers for the shipping and handling of
our software products as product revenue and we record the related costs as
cost of product revenue on our statement of operations. Product revenue from
shipping and handling is not significant.

Customer Service and Technical Support

Customer service and technical support costs include the costs associated with
performing order processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and
through Web sites, e-mail and other electronic means, and providing free
technical support assistance to customers. In connection with the sale of
certain products, we provide a limited amount of free technical support
assistance to customers. We do not defer the recognition of any revenue
associated with sales of these products, since the cost of providing this free
technical support is insignificant. The technical support is provided within
one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product
enhancements are minimal and infrequent. We accrue the estimated cost of
providing this free support upon product shipment.

Software Development Costs

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, 86, “

Accounting for Costs
of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or otherwise Marketed

,” requires
companies to expense software development costs as they incur them until
technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are
capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. To
date, our software has been available for general release concurrent with the
establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, we have not
capitalized any development costs. SFAS 2, “

Accounting for Research and
Development Costs

,” establishes accounting and reporting standards for research
and development. In accordance with SFAS 2, costs we incur to enhance our
existing products or after the general release of the service using the product
are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and
development costs on our statement of operations.

We capitalize costs related to computer software developed or obtained for
internal use in accordance with SOP 98-1, “

Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use

.” Software obtained for
internal use has generally been enterprise-level business and finance software
that we customize to meet our specific operational needs. Costs incurred in the
application development phase are capitalized and amortized over their useful
lives, generally three to five years. We have not sold, leased or licensed
software developed for internal use to our customers and we have no intention
of doing so in the future.

Advertising

We expense advertising costs as we incur them. We recorded advertising expense
of approximately $28.9 million in fiscal 2002, $31.6 million in fiscal 2003 and
$43.1 million in fiscal 2004.

Foreign Currency

The functional currency of all our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency.
Assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated at the
exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue, costs and expenses are
translated at average rates of exchange in effect during the year. We report
translation gains and losses as a separate component of stockholders’ equity.
We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions on
our statement of operations. We recorded net gains from foreign exchange
transactions of $0.1 million in fiscal 2002, $5.4 million in fiscal 2003 and
$3.1 million in fiscal 2004.



Per Share Computations

We compute basic income or loss per share using the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. We compute diluted income or loss
per share using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common
equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common equivalent shares
consist of the shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options under the
treasury stock method and vested restricted stock awards. In loss periods,
basic and diluted loss per share are identical since the effect of common
equivalent shares is anti-dilutive and therefore excluded.

Our diluted net income per share computations for fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004
included 6.1 million, 5.7 million and 4.6 million common equivalent shares. Our
diluted net income per share computations for these periods did not include the
effect of options to purchase 8.3 million, 7.0 million and 7.8 million shares
of common stock because the option exercise prices were greater than the
average market price of our common stock.

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

We consider highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less
at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist
primarily of money market funds in all periods presented. Short-term
investments consist of available-for-sale debt securities that we carry at fair
value. We use the specific identification method to compute gains and losses on
short-term investments. We include unrealized gains and losses on short-term
investments, net of tax, in stockholders’ equity. Available-for-sale debt
securities are classified as current assets based upon our intent and ability
to use any and all of these securities as necessary to satisfy the significant
short-term liquidity requirements that may arise from the highly seasonal and
cyclical nature of our businesses. Because of our significant business
seasonality, stock repurchase programs and acquisition opportunities, cash flow
requirements may fluctuate dramatically from quarter to quarter and require us
to use a significant amount of the short-term investments held as
available-for-sale securities. See Note 2.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are not interest
bearing. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for
potentially uncollectible receivables. We review our accounts receivable by
aging category to identify specific customers with known disputes or
collectibility issues. In determining the amount of the reserve, we make
judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing
credit evaluations. We also consider our historical level of credit losses and
current economic trends that might impact the level of future credit losses.

Funds Held for Payroll Customers and Payroll Customer Fund Deposits

Funds held for payroll customers represent cash held on behalf of our payroll
customers that is invested in cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments. Payroll customer fund deposits consist primarily of payroll taxes
we owe on behalf of our payroll customers.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. We
calculate depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, which range from three to 30 years. We amortize leasehold
improvements using the straight-line method over the lesser of their estimated
useful lives or remaining lease terms.

Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

We record goodwill when the purchase price of net tangible and intangible
assets we acquire exceeds their fair value. In fiscal 2002 we generally
amortized goodwill on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from three to
five years. However, in accordance with SFAS 142, “

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

,”
we did not amortize goodwill for acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001,
and effective August 1, 2002 we no longer amortized goodwill for acquisitions
completed before July 1, 2001. We amortize the cost of identified intangible
assets on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from two to seven years.



We regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values of our
long-lived assets are impaired. In accordance with SFAS 142, we review goodwill
and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives for impairment at
least annually in our fourth fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event
occurs indicating the potential for impairment. In accordance with SFAS 144,
“

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

,” we review
intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other long-lived assets
when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. In our reviews,
we look for facts or circumstances, either internal or external, indicating
that we may not recover the carrying value of the asset. We measure impairment
losses related to long-lived assets based on the amount by which the carrying
amounts of these assets exceed their fair values. Our measurement of fair value
is generally based on a blend of an analysis of the present value of estimated
future discounted cash flows and a comparison of revenue and operating income
multiples for companies of similar industry and/or size. Our analysis is based
on available information and reasonable and supportable assumptions and
projections. The discounted cash flow analysis considers the likelihood of
possible outcomes and is based on our best estimate of projected future cash
flows. If necessary, we perform subsequent calculations to measure the amount
of the impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying value over the fair
value of the impaired assets.

Stock-Based Incentive Programs

We provide equity incentives to our employees and to our Board members. We
apply the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles of Accounting
Principles Board, or APB, Opinion No. 25, “

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees

,” in accounting for stock-based incentives. Accordingly, we are not
required to record compensation expense when stock options are granted to
eligible participants as long as the exercise price is not less than the fair
market value of the stock when the option is granted. We are also not required
to record compensation expense in connection with our Employee Stock Purchase
Plan as long as the purchase price of the stock is not less than 85% of the
lower of the fair market value of the stock at the beginning of each offering
period or at the end of each purchase period.

In October 1995 the FASB issued SFAS 123, “

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

,” and in December 2002 the FASB issued SFAS 148, “

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure

.” Although these
pronouncements allow us to continue to follow the APB 25 guidelines and not
record compensation expense for most employee stock-based awards, we are
required to disclose our pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss
per share as if we had adopted SFAS 123 and SFAS 148. The pro forma impact of
applying SFAS 123 and SFAS 148 in fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004 does not
necessarily represent the pro forma impact in future years.

On March 31, 2004, the FASB issued its exposure draft, “

Share-Based Payment

,”
which is a proposed amendment to SFAS 123. The exposure draft would require all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options
and purchases under employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized in the
statement of operations based on their fair values. The FASB expects to issue a
final standard late in 2004 that would be effective for public companies for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2004. We have not yet assessed the
impact of adopting this new standard.

To determine the pro forma impact of applying SFAS 123, we estimate the fair
value of our options using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model
was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have
no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. This model also requires
the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility. Our stock options have characteristics significantly different from
those of traded options, and changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimates.



Assumptions used for the valuation model are set forth below. Prior to the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we based the volatility factor for stock options
on the historical volatility of our stock over the most recent five-year
period. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we based the
volatility factor for stock options on the historical volatility of our stock
over the most recent three-year period, which is approximately equal to the
average expected life of our options.

The following table illustrates the effect on our net income and net income per
share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to
stock-based incentives using the Black Scholes valuation model. For purposes of
this reconciliation, we add back to previously reported net income all
stock-based incentive expense we have recorded that relates to acquisitions. We
then deduct the pro forma stock-based incentive expense determined under the
fair value method for all awards including those that relate to acquisitions.
The pro forma stock-based incentive expense has no impact on our cash flow. In
the future, we may elect or be required to use a different valuation model,
which could result in a significantly different impact on our pro forma net
income or loss.

Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers and Suppliers

We operate in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing.
Significant technological changes, shifting customer requirements, the
emergence of competitive products or services with new capabilities and other
factors could negatively impact our operating results.

We are also subject to risks related to changes in the values of our
significant balance of short-term investments and funds held for payroll
customers. Our portfolio of short-term investments consists of
investment-grade securities



and our funds held for payroll customers consist of
cash and cash equivalents and investment-grade securities. Except for direct
obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of
the United States government, and money market or cash management funds, we
diversify our short-term investments by limiting our holdings with any
individual issuer.

We sell a significant portion of our products through third-party retailers and
distributors. As a result, we face risks related to the collectibility of our
accounts receivable. To appropriately manage this risk, we perform ongoing
evaluations of customer credit and limit the amount of credit extended as we
deem appropriate but generally do not require collateral. We maintain reserves
for estimated credit losses and these losses have historically been within our
expectations. However, since we cannot necessarily predict future changes in
the financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves
will continue to be adequate.

We sell a significant proportion of our software products directly to many
retailers rather than through a few major distributors. No distributor or
individual retailer accounted for 10% or more of total net revenue in fiscal
2002, 2003 or 2004, nor did any customer account for 10% or more of accounts
receivable at July 31, 2003 or July 31, 2004. Amounts due from Rock Acquisition
Corporation under certain licensing and distribution agreements comprised 10.8%
of accounts receivable at July 31, 2003 and 10.3% of accounts receivable at
July 31, 2004. See Note 9.

We rely on three third-party vendors to perform the manufacturing and
distribution functions for our primary desktop software products. We also have
a key single-source vendor for our financial supplies business that prints and
fulfills orders for all of our checks and most other products for that
business. While we believe that relying heavily on key vendors improves the
efficiency and reliability of our business operations, relying on any one
vendor for a significant aspect of our business can have a significant negative
impact on our revenue and profitability if that vendor fails to perform at
acceptable service levels for any reason, including financial difficulties of
the vendor.

2.  Short-Term Investments and Funds Held for Payroll Customers

As discussed in Note 1, “

Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers
and Suppliers

,” our portfolio of short-term investments consists of
investment-grade securities and our funds held for payroll customers consist of
cash and cash equivalents and investment-grade securities. Except for direct

We periodically review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment
is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other
potential valuation concerns. At July 31, 2004, we believe that the
investments that we hold are not other-than-temporarily impaired. While
certain available-for-sale debt securities have fair values that are below
cost, we believe that it is probable that principal and interest
will be collected in accordance with contractual terms, and that the decline in
market value is due to changes in interest rates and not due to increased
credit risk.

Capital in progress consists primarily of costs related to internal use
software projects. As discussed in Note 1, “

Software Development Costs

,” we
capitalize costs related to the development of computer software for internal
use in accordance with SOP 98-1. We capitalized internal use software costs
totaling $19.9 million in fiscal 2002, $43.0 million in fiscal 2003 and $65.9
million in fiscal 2004. These amounts included capitalized labor costs of $12.9
million in fiscal 2002, $23.0 million in fiscal 2003 and $21.7 million in
fiscal 2004. Costs related to internal use software projects are included in
the capital in progress category of property and equipment until project
completion, at which time they are transferred to the computer
software category and amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful
lives, generally three to five years.



4.  Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

As discussed in Note 1, “

Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other
Long-Lived Assets

,” we adopted SFAS 142 on August 1, 2002. As a result,
goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests. Most
other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their estimated useful
lives. If the non-amortization provisions of SFAS 142 had been in effect from
the beginning of fiscal 2002, net income from continuing operations would have
been $135.8 million and net income would have been $222.3 million in fiscal
2002. Diluted net income from continuing operations would have been $0.62 per
share and diluted net income would have been $1.02 per share in that fiscal
year.

Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment during fiscal
2004 were as follows. Our reportable segments are described in Note 11.

purchased intangible assets is charged primarily to amortization of purchased
software in cost of revenue and to acquisition-related charges in operating
expenses on our statement of operations. Future acquisitions could cause these
amounts to increase. In addition, if impairment events occur they could
accelerate the timing of charges.

As discussed in Note 1, we regularly perform reviews to determine if the
carrying values of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets may be
impaired. We look for the existence of facts and circumstances, either internal
or external, which indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be
recovered.

Fiscal 2002

During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, events and circumstances indicated
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets that we received in connection
with our acquisitions of an Internet-based advertising business from Venture
Finance Software Corp. in August 2000 (part of our Other Businesses segment)
and the Site Solutions business that we acquired from Boston Light Corp. in
August 1999 (part of our Intuit-Branded Small Business segment).

Indicators of impairment for our Internet-based advertising business included a
steep decline in demand for online advertising reflecting the industry-wide
decline in Internet advertising spending, as well as management’s assessment
that revenues and profitability would continue to decline in the future based
on analyses and forecasts completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2002.
The primary indicator of impairment for our Site Solutions business was
management’s decision to transition the customer base of Site Solutions and
collaborate with a third party to provide the website building service. This
collaboration, which began in the second quarter of fiscal 2002, eliminated our
use of technology purchased from Boston Light.

In each case, we measured the impairment loss based on the amount by which the
carrying amount of the assets exceeded their fair value based on lower
projected profits and decreases in cash flow. Our measurement of fair value
was based on an analysis of the future discounted cash flows as discussed in
Note 1. Based on our analyses, in the



second quarter of fiscal 2002 we recorded charges of $22.6 million to reduce the carrying value of the assets associated
with our Internet-based advertising business to zero, and a charge of $4.7
million to reduce the carrying value of assets relating to our Site Solutions
business to zero.

Fiscal 2004

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, events and circumstances indicated
impairment of goodwill that we recorded in connection with our acquisition of
Intuit Public Sector Solutions, or IPSS, in May 2002 (part of our
Intuit-Branded Small Business segment). The primary indicator of impairment was
the fact that actual sales levels did not meet initial projections.

We measured the impairment loss based on the amount by which the carrying
amount of goodwill exceeded the fair value based on lower projected profits and
decreases in cash flow. Our measurement of fair value was based on a blend of
an analysis of the future discounted cash flows and a comparison of revenue and
operating income multiples for companies of similar industry and/or size as
discussed in Note 1. Based on our analysis, in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004 we recorded a charge of $18.7 million to reduce the carrying value of the
goodwill to $10.9 million.

In August 2004 management formally approved a plan to sell IPSS. This
subsidiary will be presented as discontinued operations beginning in fiscal
2005.



5.

Comprehensive Net Income (Loss)

SFAS 130, “

Reporting Comprehensive Income

,” establishes standards for reporting
and displaying comprehensive net income (loss) and its components in
stockholders’ equity. SFAS 130 requires the components of other comprehensive
income (loss), such as changes in the fair value of available-for-sale
securities and foreign translation adjustments, to be added to our net income
(loss) to arrive at comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income
(loss) items have no impact on our net income (loss) as presented on our
statement of operations.

Deferred Compensation

When we assume unvested stock options in connection with acquisitions, we
record deferred stock-based compensation as a reduction of stockholders’
equity. The amount recorded is equal to the difference between the exercise
price of the unvested options and the fair market value of Intuit stock as of
the closing date of the acquisition. When we grant restricted stock to
employees that is subject to vesting, we also record deferred stock-based
compensation equal to the difference between the purchase price and the fair
market value of the stock at the date of grant. Deferred stock-based
compensation is amortized straight-line over the vesting term of these options
and restricted stock awards.

Acquisitions

The acquisitions described below have been accounted for as purchase
transactions and, accordingly, the results of operations and financial position
of the acquired businesses are included in Intuit’s financial statements from
the date of acquisition. We allocate the difference between the purchase price
and the net book value of acquired tangible assets between identified
intangible assets and goodwill. Identified intangible assets consist of
customer lists, purchased technology, trade names and logos, and covenants not
to compete.

Fiscal 2002

In November 2001 we acquired substantially all of the assets of OMware, Inc.
for $35.5 million or 924,973 shares of Intuit common stock, approximately $2.1
million in the assumption of debt and bridge loans and up to $8 million in
Intuit common stock to be issued contingent upon the achievement of future
performance objectives by the business unit. OMware was branded as Intuit
Construction Business Solutions and became part of our Intuit-Branded Small
Business segment. ICBS provides business management software solutions for
construction companies. We allocated approximately $8.5 million of the
purchase price to identified intangible assets and recorded the excess purchase
price of $27.1 million as goodwill. The identified intangible assets are being
amortized over five years.

In May 2002 we purchased all of the outstanding stock of The Flagship Group for
approximately $23.3 million or 455,259 shares of Intuit common stock, the
assumption of $4.7 million in debt and $3.3 million in cash. Flagship was the
parent company of American Fundware, Inc., which was branded as Intuit Public
Sector Solutions and became part of our Intuit-Branded Small Business segment.
IPSS offers financial accounting solutions for nonprofit organizations,
universities and government agencies. In connection with the agreement, we also
assumed Flagship’s outstanding employee stock options for 1,204,000 shares of
Flagship common stock, which were converted into options to purchase 130,316
shares of Intuit common stock. We allocated approximately $4.2 million of the
purchase price to identified intangible assets and recorded the excess purchase
price of $29.6 million as goodwill. The identified intangible assets are being
amortized over terms ranging from three to 12 years.

In June 2002 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of CBS Employer Services,
Inc. for approximately $75.3 million in cash and $3.2 million or 73,795 shares
of Intuit common stock. CBS is a provider of full-service outsourced payroll
functions for small businesses and became part of our Intuit-Branded Small
Business segment. In connection with the agreement, we also assumed CBS’s
outstanding employee stock options for 665,504 shares of CBS common stock,
which were converted into options to purchase 193,891 shares of Intuit common
stock. We allocated approximately $9.3 million of the purchase price to
identified intangible assets and recorded the excess purchase price of $74.8
million as goodwill. The identified intangible assets are being amortized over
terms ranging



from five to six years. In fiscal 2003 we reduced the goodwill related to this
acquisition by $2.6 million to reflect revisions to our restructuring plan and
other acquisition-related adjustments.

In July 2002 we purchased all of the outstanding stock of Management Reports,
Inc. for approximately $92.2 million in cash. MRI was branded as Intuit Real
Estate Solutions and became part of our Intuit-Branded Small Business segment.
Intuit Real Estate Solutions provides business management software solutions
for residential, commercial and corporate property managers. We allocated
approximately $14.0 million of the purchase price to identified intangible
assets and recorded the excess purchase price of $73.4 million as goodwill. The
identified intangible assets are being amortized over terms ranging from five
to seven years.

In July 2002 we acquired substantially all of the assets of Eclipse, Inc. for
approximately $88.3 million in cash. Eclipse was branded as Intuit Distribution
Management Solutions and became part of our Intuit-Branded Small Business
segment. IDMS provides business management software solutions for wholesale
durable goods distributors. We allocated approximately $35.8 million of the
purchase price to identified intangible assets and recorded the excess purchase
price of $41.4 million as goodwill. The identified intangible assets are being
amortized over terms ranging from one to seven years.

If we had completed all of our fiscal 2002 acquisitions on August 1, 2001,
unaudited net revenue for fiscal 2002 would have been $1.41 billion. Due
primarily to the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets for these
acquisitions, we would have reported an unaudited net loss from continuing
operations of $0.4 million while unaudited net income would have been $86.1
million in that fiscal year. Unaudited diluted net income per share from
continuing operations would have been zero and unaudited diluted net income per
share would have been $0.40 per share in fiscal 2002.

Fiscal 2003

In September 2002 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Blue Ocean
Software, Inc. for approximately $177.3 million in cash. We paid $16.5 million
of the purchase price into a third-party escrow account. This amount was paid
in fiscal 2004 in accordance with the terms of the escrow agreement. Blue Ocean
offers software solutions that help businesses manage their information
technology resources and assets. We acquired this company as part of our Right
for Me strategy to offer a wider range of business solutions for small
businesses. Blue Ocean was branded as Intuit Information Technology Solutions
and became part of our Intuit-Branded Small Business segment. We allocated
approximately $13.2 million of the purchase price to purchased technology and
$7.8 million to in-process research and development, which was charged to
expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. We recorded the excess purchase
price of $150.8 million as goodwill. The purchased technology is being
amortized over six years. Blue Ocean’s results of operations for periods prior
to the date of acquisition were not material when compared with our
consolidated results.

In the past, we marketed and sold our Premier Payroll Service jointly with
Wells Fargo Bank. In February 2003 we acquired for $29.2 million in cash the
rights to brand and market the offering directly to Premier Payroll Service
customers who currently use Intuit’s service. As a result of this agreement, we
no longer pay royalties to Wells Fargo on Premier Payroll Service revenue. We
recorded the purchase price as a purchased intangible asset and are amortizing
it on a straight-line basis to cost of service revenue over five years, the
estimated useful life of the customer base. Total accumulated amortization for
this asset was $2.7 million at July 31, 2003 and $8.5 million at July 31, 2004.

In July 2003 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Income Dynamics, Inc.
for approximately $10.0 million or 224,589 shares of Intuit common stock and
$0.3 million in cash. Income Dynamics offers software that provides tools for
taxpayers to determine the fair market value of items donated to charities.
Income Dynamics became part of our Consumer Tax segment. We allocated
approximately $3.2 million of the purchase price to identified intangible
assets and recorded the excess purchase price of $7.9 million as goodwill. The
identified intangible assets are being amortized over terms ranging from two to
five years. Income Dynamics’ results of operations for periods prior to the
date of acquisition were not material when compared with our consolidated
results.



Fiscal 2004

In October 2003 we acquired all of the membership interests of Innovative
Merchant Solutions LLC and a related entity doing business as Innovative
Gateway Solutions (together, IMS) for an aggregate purchase price of
approximately $116.7 million in cash. Of the total purchase price, $86.3
million was paid to the members of IMS and $30.4 million was deposited into a
third-party escrow account at closing. Of the cash deposited into escrow, $10.4
million is payable to former IMS members in January 2005 and the remaining
$20.0 million will be paid to former IMS members from escrow in installments of
$12.0 million and $8.0 million in October 2004 and October 2005 upon the
satisfaction of certain operating contingencies.

IMS offers a full range of merchant services to small businesses nationwide,
including credit and debit card processing services. We acquired IMS as part of
our Right for Me strategy to offer a wider range of business solutions for
small businesses. IMS became part of our QuickBooks-Related segment. On a
preliminary basis, we allocated approximately $17.3 million of the IMS purchase
price to identified intangible assets and recorded the excess purchase price of
$98.4 million as goodwill. We do not expect that any adjustments to the
purchase price or the purchase price allocation will be material. The
identified intangible assets are being amortized over terms ranging from two to
four years. IMS’s results of operations for periods prior to the date of
acquisition were not material when compared with our consolidated results.

Deferred stock compensation is recorded in stockholders’ equity and is
being amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options using the
straight-line method. Until July 31, 2002, goodwill was amortized over
estimated useful lives that ranged from three to five years. We adopted SFAS
142 on August 1, 2002 and as a result no longer amortize goodwill. We amortize
most other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which range
from two to seven years. See Note 1 and Note 4.

Divestitures

In March 2002 we paid $12.0 million to terminate our remaining $20.3 million
obligation under an interactive services agreement related to our Quicken Bill
Manager business. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $8.3 million and related tax
expense of $2.7 million in fiscal 2002 in connection with the termination of
this agreement.

9.

Discontinued Operations

Quicken Loans

In July 2002 we sold 87.5% of our Quicken Loans mortgage business to Rock
Acquisition Corporation and recorded a pre-tax gain of $23.3 million on the
transaction. We retained a 12.5% non-voting equity interest in Rock, which we
accounted for on a cost basis. In October 2002, we sold our minority interest
in Rock to Rock’s majority shareholders and recorded a $5.6 million gain on the
transaction. As part of the original sale transaction, we also agreed to
provide a line of credit of up to $375.0 million to fund mortgage loans for a
transitional period of up to six months. The line was repaid in full in January
2003.

We accounted for the sale of Quicken Loans as discontinued operations in
accordance with APB Opinion No. 30. The net assets, operating results and cash
flows of Quicken Loans have therefore been segregated from continuing
operations on our balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of
cash flows for all periods prior to the sale. In fiscal 2002 Quicken Loans net
revenue was $189.2 million and Quicken Loans income before income taxes was
$73.6 million.

Concurrent with the sale, Rock licensed the right to use our Quicken Loans
trademark for its residential home loan and home equity loan products. We will
receive a minimum royalty of $1.75 million a year for five years under the
licensing agreement. We also entered into a five-year distribution agreement
with Rock through which it will provide mortgage services on Quicken.com. In
July 2004 we amended the distribution agreement to reduce the minimum fees over
the life of the agreement by $1.75 million. We will receive minimum fees of
$0.75 million a year for two years, $0.5 million for the third year and no
minimum fees for the fourth and fifth years under the distribution agreement.
The royalties from the licensing agreement and the fees from the distribution
agreement are recorded as earned and included in interest and other income on
our statement of operations.

We recorded royalties under the trademark licensing agreement of $9.3 million
in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004. We recorded fees under the distribution
agreement of $0.8 million in fiscal 2003 and $0.9 million in fiscal 2004. Fees
due from Rock under these agreements totaled $9.5 million at July 31, 2003 and
July 31, 2004 and were included in accounts receivable on our balance sheet.



Intuit KK

In February 2003 we sold all of the outstanding stock of our wholly owned
Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, to a private equity investment firm located in
Japan for approximately $79.0 million. Intuit KK was part of our Other
Businesses segment. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, “

Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

,” we accounted for the sale
as discontinued operations. The net assets, operating results and cash flows of
Intuit KK have therefore been segregated from continuing operations on our
balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of cash flows for all
periods prior to the sale. Intuit KK net revenue was $46.1 million in fiscal
2002 and $26.6 million in fiscal 2003. Intuit KK income before income taxes was
$14.4 million in fiscal 2002 and $5.6 million in fiscal 2003. We recorded a
gain on disposal of discontinued operations of $71.0 million, net of income
taxes of $5.1 million, in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.

10.

Loss on Impairment of Long-Lived Asset

In connection with the sale of our Quicken Bill Manager business in May 2001,
we acquired a $27.0 million long-term asset related to future consideration
from Princeton eCom. Quicken Bill Manager was part of our Other Businesses
segment. During fiscal 2002, events and circumstances indicated impairment of
this asset. These indicators included the deterioration of Princeton eCom’s
financial position and the decreased likelihood that it would receive future
funding. Based on our analysis we determined that the fair value of this asset
was impaired and recorded a charge of $27.0 million in fiscal 2002 to reduce
its carrying value to zero.

11.

Industry Segment and Geographic Information

SFAS 131, “

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information

,” establishes standards for the way in which public companies
disclose certain information about operating segments in their financial
reports. Consistent with SFAS 131, we have defined five reportable segments,
described below, based on factors such as how we manage our operations and how
our chief operating decision maker views results. We define the chief operating
decision maker as the office of the chief executive officer, our chief
financial officer and our Board of Directors.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we revised our reportable segments to
reflect the way we currently manage and view our business. We combined our
fiscal 2003 QuickBooks segment with the businesses from our fiscal 2003 Small
Business Products and Services segment that relate to and support QuickBooks to
form the fiscal 2004 segment called QuickBooks-Related. We also combined our
outsourced payroll and information technology businesses with our fiscal 2003
Vertical Business Management Solutions segment to form the fiscal 2004 segment
called Intuit-Branded Small Business. We made no changes to our Consumer Tax,
Professional Tax and Other Businesses segments. We have reclassified previously
reported fiscal 2003 and 2002 segment results to be consistent with the fiscal
2004 presentation.

We reclassified a total of $28.1 million for certain fiscal 2003
electronic filing revenue in our Consumer Tax and Professional Tax segments
from product revenue to service revenue to be consistent with our fiscal 2004
presentation. Total fiscal 2003 revenue for each of these segments did not
change as a result of these reclassifications.

QuickBooks-Related product revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks desktop
software products; QuickBooks Do-It-Yourself Payroll, or DIY, which offers
payroll tax tables, forms and electronic tax payment and filing on a
subscription basis to small businesses that prepare their own payrolls; and
financial supplies such as paper checks, envelopes and invoices.
QuickBooks-Related service revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks Online
Edition, QuickBooks support plans and merchant services. Other revenue for this
segment consists primarily of royalties from small business online services.



Intuit-Branded Small Business product revenue is derived primarily from
business management software for information technology and four selected
industries: wholesale durable goods; residential, commercial and corporate
property management; construction; and nonprofit organizations, universities
and government agencies. In August 2004 management formally approved a plan to
sell our Intuit Public Sector Solutions business. Intuit-Branded Small Business
service revenue is derived from technical support, consulting and training
services for those software products and from outsourced payroll services.
Service revenue for this segment also includes interest earned on funds held
for payroll customers.

Consumer Tax product revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax federal and
state consumer desktop tax return preparation software. Consumer Tax service
revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax for the Web online tax return
preparation services and consumer electronic filing services.

Professional Tax product revenue is derived primarily from ProSeries and
Lacerte professional tax preparation software products. Professional Tax
service revenue consists of electronic filing and training services.

Other Businesses consist primarily of Quicken and Canada. Quicken product
revenue is derived primarily from Quicken desktop software products. Quicken
other revenue consists primarily of fees from consumer online transactions and
from Quicken-branded credit card and bill payment offerings that we provide
through our partners. We exited the online advertising business in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004. In Canada, product revenue is derived primarily from
localized versions of QuickBooks and Quicken as well as QuickTax and TaxWiz
consumer desktop tax return preparation software and ProFile professional tax
preparation products. Service revenue in Canada consists primarily of revenue
from software maintenance contracts sold with QuickBooks.

All reportable segments except Intuit-Branded Small Business and Other
Businesses operate solely in the United States. All segments sell primarily to
customers located in the United States. International total net revenue was
less than 5% of consolidated total net revenue for all periods presented.

Corporate includes costs such as corporate general and administrative expenses
that are not allocated to specific segments. Corporate also includes
reconciling items such as acquisition-related costs (which include
acquisition-related charges, impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible
assets, amortization of purchased software and charges for purchased research
and development), realized net gains or losses on marketable securities and
other investments, and interest and other income.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those
described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1. Except
for goodwill and purchased intangible assets, we do not generally track assets
by reportable segment and, consequently, we do not disclose assets by
reportable segment.



The following tables show our financial results by reportable segment for
fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004.

Reserve for Vacant Facilities

During fiscal 2002, we concluded that we would not occupy two vacant leased
buildings in Mountain View, California and that we would be unable to recover a
substantial portion of our lease obligations by subleasing the vacant space. In
that period, we recorded a $13.2 million reserve that was equal to the
remaining future lease commitments for these facilities, net of estimated
future sublease income. During fiscal 2003, we decided that based on corporate
growth requirements and the current real estate market in the San Francisco Bay
Area, we would reoccupy one of the two vacant buildings and that the reserve
for the other vacant building should be increased to reflect our revised
estimate of future sublease income for that facility. We recorded a net
adjustment of $0.5 million to the reserve that, along with the reversal of
reserves related to various smaller facilities, resulted in a total credit for
vacant facilities of $1.1 million on our statement of operations in fiscal
2003. During fiscal 2004, based on the current real estate market in the San
Francisco Bay Area, we recorded a $0.7 million increase to the reserve for the
remaining Mountain View building to reflect our revised estimate of future
sublease income for that facility. Our actual future cash payments may exceed
the total Mountain View reserve balance at July 31, 2004 by a maximum of $1.9
million if we are unable to sublease the remaining reserved Mountain View
property. The lease related to this facility ends in fiscal 2010.

CBS Employer Services Acquisition Accrual

We acquired CBS Employer Services, Inc. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002.
See Note 7. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded a total accrual of
$26.4 million that included $21.6 million for purchase price deferrals and $4.8
million for restructuring and transaction costs. In fiscal 2003 we reduced the
restructuring accrual by $3.4 million and reduced the goodwill related to this
acquisition by the same amount to reflect revisions to our restructuring plan.

We have provided a valuation reserve related to the benefits of certain losses

we believe are unlikely to be realized. The valuation allowance decreased by
$4.7 million in fiscal 2002 and increased by $0.7 million in fiscal 2003.

At July 31, 2004, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $1.5 million and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $4.0 million. These net operating losses will expire at various
dates beginning in fiscal 2020 if not utilized. At July 31, 2004, we also had
various state tax credit carryforwards totaling approximately $14.8 million.
The state credit carryforwards have no expiration date. Utilization of the net
operating loss and credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual
limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of
net operating losses before utilization.

15.  Stockholders’ Equity

Stock Option Plans

Our 1993 Equity Incentive Plan terminated on January 18, 2002 when our
stockholders approved our 2002 Equity Incentive Plan to replace the 1993 Plan.
When the 1993 Plan terminated, all outstanding options under the 1993 Plan
remained in effect in accordance with their terms. There were 3,809,906 shares
available for grant under the 1993 Plan at its termination. We transferred
1,900,000 of these shares to our new 2002 Plan to be available for grant under
that plan. The remaining 1,909,906 shares ceased to be available for grant
under any of our equity compensation plans. Under the 1993 Plan, we were
permitted to grant incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock
awards, stock bonuses and performance awards to employees, directors,
consultants, and independent contractors of and advisors to Intuit. The
Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board of Directors
or its delegees determined who would receive grants, exercisability, exercise
price and other terms. The option exercise price was generally the fair market
value at the date of grant. The outstanding options generally vest over four
years based on continued service and expire after ten years.

Under our 2002 Equity Incentive Plan, we may grant incentive and non-qualified
stock options, restricted stock awards and stock bonuses to employees,
directors, consultants, and independent contractors of and advisors to Intuit.
The Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board of
Directors or its delegees determines who will receive grants, exercisability,
exercise price and other terms. The option exercise price is generally the fair
market value at the date of grant. During fiscal 2002 Intuit changed its
standard option vesting schedule for the 2002 Plan so that future options
granted generally become exercisable over a three-year period based on
continued service and expire seven years after the grant date. Prior to that
change, options vested over four years and expired ten years after the grant
date.

During fiscal 2003, we launched a mandatory share ownership program. Under this
program all senior vice presidents, the executive vice president and Board
members are required to hold a minimum of 3,000 shares by the later of May 2006
or three years from the date the individual becomes subject to the share
ownership program. The chief executive officer is required to hold 100,000
shares. To provide an incentive to the senior vice presidents and the executive
vice president, we implemented a matching unit award component to the share
ownership program. Under this matching unit program, for each two shares one of
these officers purchases during his or her three year compliance period, we
grant a matching unit award for one share, up to a maximum of 1,500 matching
unit awards. These matching unit awards are granted as stock bonus awards
under the 2002 Plan. These matching units vest as to 100% of the shares subject
to the stock bonus award four years after grant, or earlier on the officer’s
retirement, death or disability. We record deferred compensation expense for
these matching units based on the fair value of the



award at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense at the time the
matching units vest. We awarded a total of 2,849 matching units in fiscal 2003
and 3,424 matching units in fiscal 2004.

On two occasions we have granted restricted stock units to our chief executive
officer as stock bonus awards under the 2002 Plan. On July 30, 2003, we granted
425,000 restricted stock units and on July 31, 2004 we granted 25,000
restricted stock units. The 2003 award vests as to 255,000 shares on July 31,
2006 and as to an additional 85,000 shares on each of July 31, 2007 and July
31, 2008. The 2004 award vests as to 25,000 shares on July 31, 2007. We record
deferred compensation expense for these restricted stock units based on the
fair value of the award at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense
ratably over the vesting period.

On November 25, 1996, our stockholders approved our 1996 Directors Stock Option
Plan. This plan provides for non-qualified stock options for a specified number
of shares to be granted to all non-employee directors of Intuit. As of December
2002, Board members who serve on the Audit Committee, Compensation and
Organizational Development Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee
receive additional annual grants. The option exercise price equals the fair
market value at the date of grant. Most options are subject to vesting over
time based on continued service, with vesting periods ranging from one to four
years. All options expire after ten years.

On November 11, 1998, we adopted the 1998 Option Plan for Mergers and
Acquisitions. Under the 1998 Plan, we may grant non-qualified stock options to
individuals who we hire as a result of our acquisitions of or mergers with,
other companies. The 1998 Plan was designed to meet the “broadly based plans”
exemption from the stockholder approval requirement for stock option plans
under the Nasdaq Stock Market listing requirements at the time the plan was
adopted and, accordingly, has not been submitted to Intuit stockholders for
approval. Options under the 1998 Plan can only be granted to eligible
individuals within 18 months following the completion of the relevant
acquisition or merger. Options granted to officers hired as a result of a
merger or acquisition cannot exceed 45% of all shares reserved for grant under
the 1998 Plan. Options granted under the 1998 Plan cannot have an exercise
price that is less than the fair market value of Intuit’s common stock on the
date of grant. During fiscal 2002, Intuit changed its standard option vesting
schedule for the 1998 Plan so that future options granted generally become
exercisable over a three-year period based on continued service and expire
seven years after the grant date. Prior to that change, options generally
vested over four years and expired ten years after the grant date.

In addition, in several instances we have assumed the outstanding options of
companies that we acquired. Intuit granted no further options under the
acquired companies’ option plans after the date of acquisition. We assumed
options in connection with our acquisitions of The Flagship Group in May 2002
and CBS Employer Services, Inc. in June 2002.

Repurchased shares of our common stock are held as treasury shares until they
are reissued or retired. When we reissue treasury stock, if the proceeds from
the sale are more than the average price we paid to acquire the shares we
record an increase in additional paid-in capital. Conversely, if the proceeds
from the sale are less than the average price we paid to acquire the shares, we
record a decrease in additional paid-in capital to the extent of increases
previously recorded for similar transactions and a decrease in retained
earnings for any remaining amount.



Employee Stock Purchase Plan

On November 26, 1996, our stockholders adopted our Employee Stock Purchase Plan
under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The ESPP permits our eligible
employees to make payroll deductions to purchase our stock on regularly
scheduled purchase dates at a discount. Effective after the June 2003 purchase,
the ESPP has twelve-month rolling concurrent offering periods that are composed
of four three-month accrual periods at the end of which the employees may
purchase shares at a discount. The discount at which the employee will be able
to purchase shares under the ESPP will depend on the offering period in which
she or he is participating since each rolling twelve-month offering period will
be in its first, second, third or fourth three-month accrual period. The
purchase price will be 85% of the lower of the closing price for Intuit common
stock on the first day of the twelve-month offering period in which the
employee is participating or the last day of the three-month accrual period of
that offering period. Employees purchased 583,991 shares of Intuit common stock
in fiscal 2002, 476,454 shares in fiscal 2003 and 564,918 shares in fiscal 2004
under the ESPP. At July 31, 2004, there were 1,820,107 shares available for
issuance under this Plan.

16.  Benefit Plans

Executive Deferred Compensation Plan

Intuit adopted the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan effective March 15,
2002. The plan allows executives who meet minimum compensation requirements to
defer up to 50% of their salaries and up to 100% of their bonuses and
commissions. We have agreed to credit the participants’ contributions with
earnings that reflect the performance of certain independent investment funds.
We may also make discretionary employer contributions to participant accounts.
The timing, amounts and vesting schedules of employer contributions are at our
sole discretion. The benefits under this plan are unsecured and are general
assets of Intuit. Participants are generally eligible to receive payment of
their vested benefit at the end of their elected deferral period or after
termination of their employment with Intuit for any reason. Discretionary
company contributions and the related earnings vest completely upon the
participant’s disability, death or a change of control of Intuit. We made no
employer contributions to the plan for fiscal 2002, $0.2 million in employer
contributions to the plan in fiscal 2003 and $0.8 million in employer
contributions in fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2003 and 2004, we also entered into
several agreements in which we committed to make employer contributions on
behalf of certain executives provided that they remain employed at
Intuit on certain future dates. With the exception of one agreement which
provides for four year vesting on the employer contributions, all other
contributions are fully vested at the time of contribution. We held assets and
liabilities related to this plan of $5.7 million at July 31, 2003 and assets of
$12.1 million and liabilities of $13.2 million at July 31, 2004. Assets related
to this plan are in other assets and liabilities related to this plan are in
other current liabilities on our balance sheet. The plan liabilities include
accrued employer contributions not yet funded to the plan.


01(k)

Plan

Employees who participate in the Intuit 401(k) Plan may contribute up to 20% of
pre-tax salary to the plan, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations.
Intuit matches a specified portion of the employee contributions up to a
maximum amount per employee per year. The amount is subject to change on an
annual basis. At July 31, 2003 and 2004, the match was 75% up to $2,500.
Matching contributions were $8.4 million in fiscal 2002, $10.9 million in
fiscal 2003 and $10.1 million in fiscal 2004. Participating employees age 50 or
older may also make catch-up contributions. These contributions are not
matched.

17.  Stockholder Rights Plan

On April 29, 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan
designed to protect the long-term value of Intuit for its stockholders during
any future unsolicited acquisition attempt. In connection with the plan, the
Board declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share
of Intuit’s common stock outstanding on May 11, 1998 (the Record Date) and
further directed the issuance of one such right with respect to each share of
Intuit’s common stock that is issued after the Record Date, except in certain
circumstances. If a person or a group



(an Acquiring Person) acquires 20% or more of Intuit’s common stock, or
announces an intention to make a tender offer for Intuit’s common stock, the
consummation of which would result in a person or group becoming an Acquiring
Person, then the rights will be distributed (the Distribution Date). After the
Distribution Date, each right may be exercised for 1/3000th of a share of a
newly designated Series B Junior Participating Preferred stock. In January 2003
the Board amended the rights plan to change the exercise price for the rights
from $83.33 per 1/3 of 1/1000th share to $300.00 per 1/3 of 1/1000th share. The
preferred stock has been structured so that the value of 1/3000th of a share of
this preferred stock will approximate the value of one share of common stock.
The rights will expire on May 1, 2008. In July 2002 we adopted a policy that
requires an independent committee of our Board of Directors to review the
rights plan at least once every three years to consider whether maintaining the
rights plan continues to be in the best interests of Intuit and its
stockholders.

18.  Litigation

1) Muriel Siebert & Co., Inc. v. Intuit Inc., Index No. 03-602942, Supreme
Court of the State of New York, County of New York.

On September 17, 2003, plaintiff Muriel Siebert & Co., Inc. filed a complaint
against Intuit alleging various claims for breach of contract, breach of
express and implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing, breach of
fiduciary duty, misrepresentation and/or fraud, and promissory estoppel. The
allegations relate to Quicken Brokerage powered by Siebert, a strategic
alliance between the two companies. The complaint seeks compensatory, punitive,
and other damages. On September 22, 2003, Intuit filed an arbitration demand
against Siebert & Co., Inc. in San Jose, California seeking arbitration of all
claims asserted by both parties. The Apellate Division of the Supreme Court of
the State of New York court has stayed the matter while it determines whether
it will proceed in New York state court or in arbitration. Intuit believes this
lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend the litigation vigorously.

2) Intuit/Quicken Sunsetting Litigation, Master File No. 1-04-CV-016394,
Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara (Anthony Flannery v.
Intuit Inc., et al, Civil No. 1-04-CV-016394 and Daniel J. Mason v. Intuit Inc.
et al, Civil No. 1-04-CV-018345).

On or about March 19, 2004, plaintiff Anthony Flannery, on his behalf and on
behalf of a class of persons allegedly similarly situated, filed a complaint
against Intuit in Santa Clara Superior Court, alleging that Intuit’s retirement
of certain services and live technical support associated with its Quicken
1998, Quicken 1999 and Quicken 2000 products constituted a breach of express
and implied warranties and violated sections 17200 and 17500 of the California
Business and Professions Code, as well as the Consumer Legal Remedies Act
(“CLRA”). The complaint seeks certification as a class action, as well as
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, disgorgement of profits,
restitution, injunctive relief and attorney’s fees from Intuit.

On or about April 21, 2004, plaintiff Daniel Mason, on his behalf and on behalf
of a class of persons allegedly similarly situated, filed a complaint against
Intuit in Santa Clara Superior Court making allegations virtually identical to
those of Anthony Flannery. On July 14, 2004, the Court consolidated the two
cases pursuant to stipulation of the parties.

On July 29, 2004, plaintiffs filed a consolidated First Amended Complaint.
Intuit’s response to that Complaint is due on October 8, 2004. The parties
have only recently initiated discovery. No trial date is set. Intuit believes
this lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend the litigation vigorously.

3) Cynthia Belotti v. Intuit Inc., et al, Civil No. 1-04-CV-020277,
Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara.

On or about May 24, 2004, plaintiff Cynthia Belotti, on her behalf and on
behalf of a class of persons allegedly similarly situated, filed a complaint
against the Company in Santa Clara Superior Court, alleging that Intuit’s
retirement of certain add-on business services and live technical support
associated with its QuickBooks 2001 and QuickBooks 2002 products constituted a
breach of express and implied warranties and violated sections 17200 and 17500
of the California Business and Professions Code. The complaint sought
certification as a class action, as well as damages, disgorgement of profits,
restitution, injunctive relief and attorney’s fees from Intuit.



On or about July 13, 2004, plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint that added
Ental Precision Machining, Inc., as plaintiff; plaintiffs’ counsel has also
dismissed without prejudice all claims on behalf of Cynthia Belotti. Intuit’s
response to that Complaint is due on October 8, 2004. The parties have only
recently initiated discovery. No trial date is set. Intuit believes this
lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend the litigation vigorously.

Intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings, as well as demands,
claims and threatened litigation, that arise in the normal course of our
business, including assertions that we may be infringing patents or other
intellectual property rights of others. We currently believe that the ultimate
amount of liability, if any, for any pending claims of any type (either alone
or combined) will not materially affect our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. We also believe that we would be able to obtain any
necessary licenses or other rights to disputed intellectual property rights on
commercially reasonable terms. However, the ultimate outcome of any litigation
is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact
on Intuit because of defense costs, negative publicity, diversion of management
resources and other factors. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other
rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could
adversely affect our business.

19.  Related Party Transactions

Loans to Executive Officers and Other Employees

Prior to July 30, 2002, loans to executive officers were made generally in
connection with their relocation and purchase of a residence near their new
place of work. Consistent with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley
legislation enacted on July 30, 2002, we have not made or modified any loans to
executive officers since July 30, 2002 and we do not intend to make or modify
any loans to executive officers in the future. At July 31, 2004, no loans were
overdue and all interest payments were current in accordance with the terms of
the loan agreements.

During fiscal 2004, certain loan amounts became due within twelve months and
are thus being classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our
balance sheet. Loans to executive officers and other employees, including these
current amounts, were as follows at the dates indicated.

Of the total loans to executive officers at July 31, 2004, $9.4 million accrue
no interest for either the term of the note or for up to four years. The
remaining loans to executive officers at July 31, 2004 accrue interest at rates
equal to the applicable federal rates in effect at the time the loans were
made. Of the total outstanding loans to executive officers and other employees
at July 31, 2004, loans with a remaining principal balance of $16.0 million
were secured by real property. The loans outstanding at July 31, 2004 have
original terms that range from four to ten years.

Repurchases of Vested Restricted Stock



In March 2003 our chief executive officer vested in 37,500 shares of restricted
stock. To provide Mr. Bennett with the funds to pay the related payroll tax
withholding obligation we repurchased 17,532 shares of common stock from him at
$39.02 per share, the closing market price of Intuit stock on the date the
restricted stock vested. This repurchase was approved by our Board of
Directors.

In February 2004 our chief executive officer vested in 37,500 shares of
restricted stock. To provide Mr. Bennett with the funds to pay the related
payroll tax withholding obligations we repurchased 17,157 shares of common
stock from him at $44.64 per share, the closing market price of Intuit stock on
the date the restricted stock vested. This repurchase was approved by our Board
of Directors.

20.  Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

The following tables contain selected quarterly financial data for fiscal years
2003 and 2004. We accounted for the February 2003 sale of our Japanese
subsidiary, Intuit KK, as discontinued operations and as a result the operating
results of Intuit KK have been segregated from continuing operations in our
financial statements and in these tables. See Note 9.
