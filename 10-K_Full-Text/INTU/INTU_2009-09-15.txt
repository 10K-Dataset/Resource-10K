ITEM 1

BUSINESS

CORPORATE BACKGROUND

General

Intuit Inc. is a leading provider of business and financial management solutions for small and
medium-sized businesses, consumers, accounting professionals and financial institutions. Our
flagship products and services, including QuickBooks, Quicken and TurboTax, simplify small business
management and payroll processing, personal finance, and tax preparation and filing. ProSeries and
Lacerte are Intuit’s leading tax preparation offerings for professional accountants. Our financial
institutions division, anchored by Digital Insight, provides online banking services that help
banks and credit unions serve consumers and businesses with innovative solutions.

We had revenue of $3.2 billion in our fiscal year ended July 31, 2009, and had approximately
7,800 employees in major offices in the United States, Canada, India, the United Kingdom and other

Intuit was incorporated in California in March 1984. We reincorporated in Delaware and completed

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Intuit’s Mission

We seek to be a premier innovative growth company that empowers individuals and businesses to
achieve their dreams.

Our customers include small and medium-sized businesses, consumers, accounting professionals and
financial institutions. We help them solve important business and financial management problems,
such as running a small business, paying bills and income taxes, or balancing a checkbook. We
believe our innovative products and services simplify the lives of millions, while helping them
save and make money.

Emerging technology and market trends are changing the way people live and work, and the way we
help customers. We’re connecting those customers to our solutions and with each other in ways that
add more value to our products



and services. And we’re taking a global view as well, creating solutions for customers whose
personal and professional lives often transcend geographic borders.

Our Business Portfolio

We organize our portfolio of businesses into four principal categories — Small Business Group, Tax,
Financial Institutions and Other Businesses. These categories include seven financial reporting
segments.

Small Business Group:

This category includes three segments — Financial Management Solutions,
formerly known as QuickBooks; Employee Management Solutions, formerly known as Payroll; and
Payments Solutions, formerly known as Payments.

•

Our Financial Management Solutions segment includes QuickBooks financial and business
management software and services, technical support, financial supplies, and Web site
design and hosting services for small and medium-sized businesses.

•

Our Employee Management Solutions segment provides payroll products and services for
small businesses.

•

Our Payments Solutions segment provides merchant services for small businesses,
including credit and debit card processing, electronic check conversion and automated
clearing house services.

Tax:

This category includes two segments — Consumer Tax and Accounting Professionals.

•

Our Consumer Tax segment includes TurboTax income tax preparation products and services
for consumers and small businesses.

•

Our Accounting Professionals segment includes Lacerte and ProSeries professional tax
products and services. This segment also includes QuickBooks Premier Accountant Edition and
the QuickBooks ProAdvisor Program for accounting professionals.

Financial Institutions:

This segment consists primarily of outsourced online services for banks and
credit unions provided by our Digital Insight business. It includes our online banking and bill-pay
services as well as our Personal FinanceWorks and Small Business FinanceWorks offerings, which
provide comprehensive online financial management solutions for consumers and small businesses.

Other Businesses:

This segment includes Quicken personal finance products and services, Intuit Real
Estate Solutions, and our businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom.

Our Growth Strategy

Our core growth strategy remains unchanged: To be in growth businesses, high-profit businesses and
attractive new markets with large unmet or underserved needs that we can solve well.

We adapt our approach to meet changing demographics, technology and market trends. Our Connected
Services strategy, announced in fiscal year 2008, reflects a world where people and businesses are
increasingly connected, whether through desktop, laptop or handheld devices. With this expanded
connectivity, people expect access to services any time, any place. By implementing this strategy,
we intend to create customer delight by offering easy-to-use connected services that solve
customers’ problems while building durable competitive advantage.

Nearly 50 million people use our QuickBooks, payroll, payments, TurboTax, Digital Insight and
Quicken products and services. This positions us to succeed by connecting these people to our
services and to each other. We do this in three different ways:

•

Connecting customers directly to our online services:

We host services such as
QuickBooks Online, online payroll services for small businesses, Web site services for
small businesses, TurboTax Online, and online banking services for financial institutions.
Sometimes referred to as Software as a Service, or SaaS, these offerings are designed to
deliver clear benefits and value to customers.

•

Connecting our services to our software:

We offer services, such as small business
payroll and merchant services, that can be connected with software, such as QuickBooks.
This can create powerful solutions that we believe give us a competitive advantage.

•

Connecting people to people

: We are increasingly using our products as a platform to
connect people to each other and to us, allowing them to share information and solve
problems together. For example, our TurboTax Live Community allows participants to submit and answer each other’s questions
while preparing their income tax returns.



We have made significant progress in this connected services environment. More than 56% of our $3.2
billion in fiscal 2009 revenue came from connected services.

To compete in this connected world, our strategy is to take advantage of three emerging technology
and market trends:

•

Social:

Linked to businesses and each other in a connected world, people shape product
development, share their expertise and influence opinion like never before. Customers can
share advice with each other by using the online forums available in each of our major
products. In a social world, people connect and contribute to our product offerings.

•

Mobile:

As technology moves from the desktop to the palmtop, we are focusing on mobile
services that deliver “in the pocket” — any place at any time that’s convenient for
customers. For example, Intuit GoPayment helps small businesses improve sales and cash
flow by accepting credit card payments on their mobile phones.

•

Global:

As geographic borders become less important to businesses, we are working to
help customers take advantage of a global marketplace and find new customers in new
markets.

Summary

As our strategy evolves, we remain committed to developing innovative products and services that
are so convenient and easy to use that customers actively recommend them to others. We call these
customers promoters — people who create positive word-of-mouth by promoting our brand to others.
For more than 25 years we’ve worked to solve their important business and financial management
problems. Looking ahead, we will also work to help them solve each other’s problems, connecting
people to people and to solutions.

“Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”

in Item 7 and Note 15 to the financial
statements in Item 8.

Financial Management Solutions (formerly known as QuickBooks)

QuickBooks Software

. Our QuickBooks product line brings bookkeeping capabilities and business
management tools to small and medium-sized business users in an easy-to-use design that does not
require them to be familiar with debit and credit accounting. We offer a range of products to suit
the needs of different types of businesses. Our desktop software products include QuickBooks Simple
Start, which provides accounting functionality suitable for very small, less complex businesses and
is offered in both free and paid versions; QuickBooks Pro and QuickBooks Pro for Mac, which provide
accounting functionality suitable for slightly larger businesses; QuickBooks Premier,



which provides small businesses with advanced accounting functionality and business planning tools;
and QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions, designed for larger businesses. Our Premier and Enterprise
products also come in a range of industry-specific editions, including Manufacturing, Wholesale and
Distribution, Retail, Non-Profit, Contractors, and Professional Services. In addition, we offer a
Web-based version of QuickBooks called QuickBooks Online that is suitable for multiple users
working in various locations and offered in both free and paid versions.

QuickBooks Technical Support

. We offer several technical support options to our QuickBooks
customers. These include support plans that are sold separately and priced based on the length of
the plan. We also offer a free self-help information section on our QuickBooks.com Web site and
free access to the QuickBooks Community, an online forum where QuickBooks users can share
information with each other.

Web Services for Small Businesses.

We offer services to small businesses that help them establish
a presence on the Web, maintain and promote their Web sites, and sell or market their products
online.

Financial Supplies

. We offer a range of financial supplies designed for small businesses and
individuals that use QuickBooks and Quicken. These include paper checks, envelopes, invoices and
deposit slips. In addition, we offer business identity services that include business cards and
stationery. We also offer tax forms, tax return presentation folders and other supplies for
professional tax preparers. Our customers can personalize many products to incorporate their logos
and use a variety of color, font and design options.

QuickBase.

Our QuickBase offering is a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform based on a robust
database that allows business users to select ready-made online workgroup applications or create
custom solutions for their businesses. The most common solutions include project collaboration,
sales team management and employee management. QuickBase customers pay a monthly or annual
subscription fee that varies based on the number of users and the amount of data and file storage
they need.

Intuit Developer Network

. The Intuit Developer Network is an initiative that encourages
third-party software developers to build applications that exchange data with QuickBooks and other
Intuit products by giving them access to certain application programming interfaces. The Intuit
Developer Network has launched the Intuit Partner Platform, which allows developers to sell online
applications to Intuit’s customers. Developers can choose to build on Intuit’s platform or any
platform they choose, but all applications must integrate with the platform in specific ways.
Developers who register with the Intuit Developer Network have access to the latest QuickBooks
software development kit, the Intuit Partner Platform, QuickBooks software downloads, and member
benefits such as marketing tools, developer forums and one-on-one engineering support. At the end
of fiscal 2009, approximately 325 third-party applications were available for QuickBooks and other
Intuit products at

www.marketplace.intuit.com.

Employee Management Solutions (formerly known as Payroll)

QuickBooks Payroll is a family of products sold on a subscription basis to small businesses that
use QuickBooks and prepare their own payroll or want some assistance with preparing their payroll.
It is also sold to accountants who use QuickBooks and help their clients manage their payrolls. The
product family includes QuickBooks Basic Payroll, which provides payroll tax tables and payroll
reports; QuickBooks Enhanced Payroll, which provides payroll tax tables, payroll reports, federal
and state payroll tax forms, workers’ compensation tracking, and eFile & Pay for federal and state
payroll taxes; QuickBooks Enhanced Payroll for Accountants, which has several accountant-specific
features in addition to the features in QuickBooks Enhanced Payroll; and QuickBooks Online Payroll,
for use with QuickBooks Online. We also offer QuickBooks Assisted Payroll, through which we provide
the back-end aspects of payroll processing, including tax payments and filings, for customers who
process their payrolls using QuickBooks. Direct deposit is available with each of these offerings
for an additional fee. Intuit Online Payroll provides small business payroll services on a
subscription basis that do not require customers to use QuickBooks. This offering includes online
payroll tax calculation, payroll reports, direct deposit, electronic payment of federal and state
payroll taxes, and federal and state payroll tax forms. In July 2009 we acquired PayCycle, Inc., a
provider of online payroll services to small businesses that we plan to integrate with our existing
payroll offerings during fiscal 2010.



Payments Solutions

Merchant Services.

We offer a full range of merchant services to small businesses that include
credit card, debit card, electronic benefits, and gift card processing services; check
verification, check guarantee, and electronic check conversion, including automated clearing house
(ACH) and Check21 capabilities; and Web-based transaction processing services for online merchants.
In addition to transaction processing services, we provide a full range of support for our clients
that includes customer service, merchant and consumer collections, chargeback and retrieval
support, and fraud and loss prevention screening.

QuickBooks Point of Sale Solutions

. In fiscal 2009 we transferred our Point of Sale offerings from
our Financial Management Solutions segment to our Payments Solutions segment to align this product
group more closely with the customers they serve. We offer Basic, Pro and Multi-Store versions of
QuickBooks Point of Sale, which help retailers process sales using barcodes, track inventory and
customer purchases, and integrate with QuickBooks. We also offer Cash Register Plus, an entry level
product for small retail businesses that helps them manage detailed sales data, track customers,
and manage daily tasks more efficiently. We sell these software products with or without the
accompanying hardware.

Consumer Tax

Our TurboTax products and services are designed to enable individuals and small business owners to
prepare and file their own federal and state personal and small business income tax returns quickly
and accurately. They are designed to be easy to use, yet sophisticated enough for complex tax
returns.

Tax Return Preparation Offerings

. For the 2008 tax season we offered a range of software products
and services that included desktop and online versions of TurboTax Basic, for simple returns;
TurboTax Deluxe, for taxpayers who itemize deductions; TurboTax Premier, for taxpayers who own
investments or rental property; and TurboTax Home and Business, for small business owners. We also
offered TurboTax Business desktop software for larger businesses and TurboTax Free Edition online
for the simplest returns. These offerings are subject to change for the 2009 tax season. TurboTax
Live Community is an online forum where participants can learn from and share information with
other users while preparing their income tax returns.

Electronic Filing and Other Services

. Through our electronic filing center, our desktop and online
tax preparation customers can electronically file their federal income tax returns, as well as
state returns in all states that support electronic filing. For the 2008 tax year our online tax
services were offered through the Web sites of nearly 2,800 financial institutions, electronic
retailers and other merchants.

Intuit Tax Freedom Project

. Under the Intuit Tax Freedom Project, we provide online federal and
state income tax return preparation and electronic filing services at no charge to eligible
taxpayers. In fiscal 2009 we provided approximately 1.4 million free federal returns under this
initiative. We are a member of the Free File Alliance, a consortium of private sector companies
that has entered into an agreement with the federal government to provide free online federal tax
preparation and filing services to eligible taxpayers. See also

“Competition — Consumer Tax”

later
in this Item 1.

Accounting Professionals

Our Accounting Professionals segment provides software and services for accountants and tax
preparers in public practice. These include offerings that help professional accountants and tax
preparers provide accounting, payroll, tax planning and tax compliance services to their individual
and business clients, and that help them manage their own practices more effectively.

Tax Offerings

. Our tax software product lines for accounting professionals are Lacerte and
ProSeries. Lacerte software is designed for full-service accounting firms that prepare the most
complex returns. We offer two versions of our ProSeries software: ProSeries Professional Edition,
designed for year-round tax practices that prepare moderately complex tax returns; and ProSeries
Basic Edition, designed for the needs of smaller and seasonal tax practices. Accounting
professionals license these tax products for a flat fee for unlimited use, or use them to print or
electronically file tax returns on a “pay-per-return” basis. Accountants and tax preparers using
Lacerte and ProSeries can file their clients’ tax returns using our electronic filing services.



Accounting Offerings

. Our accounting offering for professionals, QuickBooks Premier Accountant
Edition, provides the tools and file-sharing capabilities needed to efficiently complete
bookkeeping, trial balance, write-up, and financial reporting tasks. Our QuickBooks ProAdvisor
Program is a subscription-based membership that provides QuickBooks and QuickBooks Payroll software
for professional accountants, technical support, training, product certification, access to
marketing tools and discounts on products purchased on behalf of clients.

Financial Institutions

Our Digital Insight business provides outsourced online banking offerings that are hosted in our
data centers and delivered as on-demand services to small and medium-sized financial institutions.
No single financial institution accounted for more than 10% of this segment’s total net revenue in
fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007.

Consumer Banking.

We offer Internet banking services that financial institutions make available to
their retail customers. These services include the ability to view transaction history, account
balances, check images and statements; funds transfer between accounts; inter-institutional
transfers; bill payment and bill presentment; and Personal FinanceWorks, our comprehensive online
personal financial management solution.

Business Banking.

We also offer Internet banking services that financial institutions make
available to their business customers. These services include features similar to those of our
consumer offering as well as lockbox reporting; payroll direct deposit; wire and inter-account fund
transfers; account reconciliations; foreign exchange trade; and Small Business FinanceWorks, our
comprehensive online business financial management solution.

Other Businesses

Quicken.

Our Quicken line of desktop software products helps users organize, understand and manage
their personal finances. Quicken allows customers to reconcile bank accounts, pay bills, record
credit card and other transactions, and track investments, mortgages and other assets and
liabilities. Quicken also allows customers to flag their tax-related financial transactions and
download that information into our TurboTax consumer tax return preparation software. We offer
Quicken Starter Edition and Quicken Deluxe as well as Quicken Premier, which offers more robust
investment and tax planning tools; Quicken Home and Business, which allows customers to manage both
personal and small business finances in one application; and Quicken for Mac. We also offer Quicken
Online, which brings customer bank account, credit card and bill payment information together on
the Internet under a single password, and Quicken Mobile, which allows Quicken customers with
iPhones to manage their personal finances through their iPhones.

Intuit Real Estate Solutions

. Our Intuit Real Estate Solutions business offers software and
related technical support, consulting and training services for residential, commercial and
corporate property managers. In addition to its domestic operations, this business has operations
in several international locations.

Canada and the United Kingdom.

In Canada, we offer versions of QuickBooks that we have
“localized,” that is, customized to meet the unique needs of customers in that specific
international location. These include QuickBooks software offerings, payroll offerings and service
plans. We also offer QuickTax consumer tax return preparation software, professional tax
preparation products and services, and localized versions of Quicken in Canada. In the United
Kingdom, we offer localized versions of QuickBooks and QuickBooks Payroll, including products and
services sold in partnership with banks.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

Since the markets for software and related services are characterized by rapid technological
change, shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements, a
continuous high level of investment is required to innovate and quickly develop new products and
services as well as enhance existing offerings. Our product development efforts are becoming more
important than ever as we pursue our Connected Services strategy, which reflects a world where
people and businesses are increasingly connected by technology and expect access to services at any
time in any place.



We develop the majority of our products and services internally. We have a number of United States
patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. We
also supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring or licensing products and technology
from third parties, and establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our
offerings more rapidly. We expect to expand our third party technology relationships as we continue
to pursue our Connected Services strategy.

Our
traditional core desktop software products – QuickBooks, TurboTax, Lacerte, ProSeries and
Quicken — tend to have predictable annual development and product release cycles. We also develop
innovative new offerings such as Intuit GoPayment and Quicken Mobile for which development cycles
can be more rapid. Developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique
challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate tax law
and tax form changes within a rigid timetable. The development timing for our payroll, merchant
services, and financial institutions offerings varies with business needs and regulatory
requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each
particular project.

In our Financial Institutions business, we have developed interfaces with the systems of many of
the major providers of core processing software and services to financial institutions. These
system interfaces allow us to access a financial institution’s host system to provide end users
access to their account data. In addition to developing new interfaces, we continue to enhance our
many existing interfaces in order to deliver more robust connectivity and increase operating
efficiencies.

We continue to make substantial investments in research and development, and we expect to focus our
future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services and on
developing new products and services that will offer increased ease of use, be customized for
specific customer categories, be Web-integrated or Web-based, and feature improved integration with
other Intuit and third party products and services and with our internal information systems. We
also expect to continue to focus significant research and development efforts on ongoing projects
to update the technology platforms for several of our products. Our research and development
expenses were $566.2 million or 18% of total net revenue in fiscal 2009, $605.8 million or 20% of
total net revenue in fiscal 2008, and $472.5 million or 17% of total net revenue in fiscal 2007.

SEASONALITY

Our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Accounting Professionals offerings are highly seasonal. Some of
our other offerings are also seasonal, but to a lesser extent. Revenue from our QuickBooks software
products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters. Sales of income tax
preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from November through
April. In our Consumer Tax business, a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later
in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of TurboTax Online, for which revenue is
recognized upon printing or electronic filing of a tax return. The seasonality of our Consumer Tax
and Accounting Professionals revenue is also affected by the timing of the availability of tax
forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return
submissions. Delays in the availability of tax forms or the ability of taxing agencies to receive
submissions can cause revenue to shift from our second fiscal quarter to our third fiscal quarter.
These seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second
quarter ending January 31 and third quarter ending April 30. We typically report losses in our
first quarter ending October 31 and fourth quarter ending July 31, when revenue from our tax
businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels. In
addition, the timing and composition of new customer offerings that include both product and
service elements can materially shift revenue between quarters. We believe the seasonality of our
revenue is likely to continue in the future.



MARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS

Markets

Our primary target customers are small and medium-sized businesses, consumers, accounting
professionals, and small and medium-sized financial institutions. The markets in which we compete
have always been characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent
new product introductions and enhancements by competitors. Over the past several years, the
widespread availability of the Internet has accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the
way that customers learn about and purchase products and services. Real-time, personalized online
shopping experiences are rapidly becoming the standard. In addition, many customers now begin their
shopping process in one channel and ultimately make their purchase in a different channel. This
drives the need to create integrated multi-channel shop and buy experiences. Market and industry
changes are quickly rendering existing products and services obsolete, so our success depends on
our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models, updated competitive
strategies, new or enhanced products and services, alternative distribution methods and other
changes in the way we do business.

Our target customers for online banking services are small and medium-sized financial institutions
seeking an outsourced solution that allows them to compete with the larger national banks in their
market. We also provide online financial management solutions to financial institution customers of
core processors.

Marketing Programs

To sell our products and services to small and medium-sized businesses, consumers and accounting
professionals, we use a variety of marketing programs to generate software orders, stimulate demand
and generally maintain and increase customer awareness of our products and services. These programs
include Web marketing, including purchasing key words from major search engine companies;
direct-response mail and email campaigns; telephone solicitations; newspaper, magazine, billboard,
radio and television advertising; and promotional offers that we coordinate with major retailers.
We also use workflow-integrated in-product discovery in some of our software products to market
other related products and services, including third-party products and services. In our Financial
Institutions business, our marketing efforts are primarily focused on identifying potential
financial institution clients and marketing our services to consumer and small business end users
in cooperation with our financial institution clients.

Sales and Distribution Channels

Multi-Channel Shop and Buy Experiences.

Our consumer and small and medium-sized business customers
increasingly use the Internet to research both online and desktop products and services. Some
customers buy and use our products and services entirely online. Others purchase desktop products
and services using the Internet. Still others prefer to make their final decision at a retail
location. We coordinate our Web sites, promotions and retail displays in support of this integrated
multi-channel shop and buy model.

Direct Sales Channel

. We sell many of our products and services for small and medium-sized
businesses, consumers and accounting professionals directly to our customers through our Web sites
and call centers. Telesales continues to be an effective channel for serving customers that want
live help selecting the products and services that are right for their needs.

In our Financial Institutions business, we sell our products and services to financial institutions
using a direct sales model and, to a lesser but increasing extent, in cooperation with core
processing partners. Our typical sales cycle is approximately six to twelve months for new
financial institutions and four to six months for add-on sales to existing customers.

Retail Channel

. We sell our QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken desktop software as well as our
QuickBooks Payroll and Intuit Online Payroll services and merchant credit card payment processing
services at retail in the United States. We sell these products and services directly and through
distributors to office supply superstores, warehouse clubs, consumer electronics retailers, general
mass merchandisers, online retailers, and catalogers. In Canada and other international markets we
also rely on distributors and other third parties who sell products into the



retail channel. The retail channel provides broad customer reach through retailer-sponsored
advertising and exposure to retail foot traffic. This channel also gives us the opportunity to
communicate our product and service lineup and messages through multiple touch points and allows us
to serve our customers at relatively modest cost.

Other Channels.

We have strategies to address the alliance partner, solution provider and personal
computer hardware manufacturer channels. Revenue from these channels is currently less significant
than revenue from our direct and retail channels, but it is growing. We sell our consumer and small
business products and services through selected alliance partners, primarily banks, credit unions,
and securities and investment firms. These alliance partners help us reach new customers at the
point of transaction and drive growth and market share by extending our online reach. Solution
providers combine our products and services with value-added marketing, sales and technical
expertise to deliver a complete solution at the local level. Relationships with selected personal
computer hardware manufacturers help us attract new customers for our core software offerings.

In our Financial Institutions business, we have joint marketing arrangements with several core
processing vendors. They include Fiserv, Inc., Open Solutions, Inc., Fidelity Information Services,
Inc., Metavante Corporation and Computer Services Inc. To deliver bill payment and bill presentment
services to our financial institution customers, we also maintain value-added reseller
relationships with major providers such as Metavante Corporation and CheckFree Corporation (part of
Fiserv).

COMPETITION

Overview

We face intense competition in all of our businesses, both domestically and internationally.
Competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve, particularly small business,
consumer tax and online banking, have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this
trend to continue. Some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial, technical
and marketing resources than we do. In addition, the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new
companies enter markets in which we compete. This is particularly true for online products and
services, where the barriers to entry are lower than they are for desktop software products and
services. To attract customers, many online competitors are offering free or low-priced entry-level
products which we must take into account in our pricing strategies.

Our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology solutions similar to
ours. However, for many of our products and services, other important competitive alternatives for
customers are third party service providers such as professional accountants and seasonal assisted
tax preparation businesses. Manual tools and processes, or general-purpose software, are also
important competitive alternatives. Many of our new customers previously used pencil and paper or
software such as word processors and spreadsheets, rather than competitors’ software and services,
to perform financial tasks. We believe that there is a long-term trend away from manual methods and
toward the use of both desktop and online software to accomplish these tasks that will continue to
provide growth opportunities.

Competition Specific to Business Segments

Small Business Group.

Our QuickBooks desktop product is the leading small business financial
management software at retail. Our small business products and services face competitive challenges
from companies such as NetSuite Inc. and The Sage Group plc, that offer software and associated
services that directly target small business customers. Increasingly, our small business products
and services also face competition from free or low cost online accounting offerings as well as
free online banking and bill payment services offered by financial institutions and others. In our
payroll business we compete directly with Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP), Paychex and many
other companies with payroll offerings. In our merchant services business we also compete directly
with large financial institutions such as Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America and with
many independent sales organizations, including First Data Corporation, Elavon, Global Payments and
FIS-Certegy.

Consumer Tax

. In the private sector we face intense competition from H&R Block, which provides
assisted tax preparation services in its stores and a competing software offering called TaxCut,
and from several other tax preparation service providers and online offerings, including 2nd Story
Software’s TaxACT. These competing offerings subject us to significant price pressure.



We also face competitive challenges in our Consumer Tax business from publicly funded government
entities that offer electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual
taxpayers. We are a member of the Free File Alliance, a consortium of private sector companies that
has entered into an agreement with the federal government. Under this agreement, the member
companies provide online federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to eligible federal
taxpayers, and the federal government has agreed not to provide a competing service. Approximately
20 states have also adopted Free File Alliance public-private agreements while approximately 20
other states offer some form of direct government tax preparation and filing services free to
qualified taxpayers. We continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to
advance the goals of the Free File Alliance policy initiative and to support successful
public-private partnerships. However, future administrative, regulatory or legislative activity in
this area could harm our Consumer Tax business.

Accounting Professionals.

Our ProSeries professional tax offerings face competition from CCH’s ATX
and TaxWise offerings. Our Lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from
competitively-priced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with non-tax
functionality. These include CCH’s ProSystems fx Office Suite and Thomson Reuters’ CS Professional
Suite and GoSystems Tax. We also face growing competition from online tax and accounting offerings,
which may be marketed more effectively or have lower pricing than our offerings for accounting
professionals.

Financial Institutions.

The market for Internet banking services is highly competitive. In the
area of consumer Internet banking, a number of companies offer outsourced online banking services
to financial institutions, including: Online Resources, S1 Corporation and FundsXpress (a
subsidiary of First Data Corporation). In addition, several companies whose primary offerings are
core processing or bill payment processing services also provide online banking services. These
companies include Fiserv, Inc., Open Solutions, Inc., Fidelity Information Services, Inc., Jack
Henry and Metavante Corporation. In addition, many of these firms offer our products through a
referral or reseller arrangement with us. We also compete for new customers with relatively recent
entrants into the online financial management solutions market. As we negotiate service contract
renewals with current customers, competitive pressures may require us to make concessions on
pricing and other material terms to convince these customers to remain with us.

Competitive Factors

We believe the most important competitive factors for our core software products — QuickBooks,
TurboTax, Lacerte, ProSeries and Quicken – are ease of use, product features, size of the installed
customer base, brand name recognition, value proposition, cost, and product and support quality.
Access to distribution channels is also important for our QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken
products. In addition, support from accounting professionals and the ability for customers to
upgrade within product families as their businesses grow are significant competitive factors for
our QuickBooks products. Productivity is also an important competitive factor for the full-service
accounting firms to which we market our Lacerte products. We believe we compete effectively on
these factors as our QuickBooks, TurboTax, and Quicken products are the leading products in the
retail sales channel for their respective categories.

For our service offerings such as small business payroll, merchant payment processing services and
outsourced online banking, features and ease of use, the integration of these products with related
software, brand name recognition, effective distribution, quality of support, cost and scalability
of operations are important competitive factors.

CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT

We provide customer service and technical support by telephone, e-mail, online chat, online
communities, and our customer service and technical support Web sites. We have full-time and
outsourced customer service and technical support staffs. We supplement these staffs with seasonal
employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes, such as during the tax
return filing season or following a major product launch. We outsource to several firms
domestically and internationally. Most of our internationally outsourced consumer and small
business customer service and technical support personnel are currently located in India and the
Philippines.



We offer free self-help information through our technical support Web sites for our QuickBooks,
TurboTax, Accounting Professionals and Quicken software products. Customers use our Web sites to
find answers to commonly asked questions and check on the status of orders. Under certain support
plans, customers can also use our Web sites to receive product updates electronically. Support
alternatives and fees vary by product. We also sponsor online user communities, such as Intuit
Community for small businesses and accounting professionals and TurboTax Live Community, where
customers can share knowledge and product advice with each other.

MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION

Desktop Software and Supplies

The main steps involved in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing compact discs (CDs),
printing boxes and related materials, and assembling and shipping the final products.

For retail manufacturing, we have an agreement with Arvato Digital Services, Inc. (ADiS), a
division of Bertelsmann AG, under which ADiS provides a majority of the manufacturing volume for
our launches of QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken, as well as for day-to-day replenishment after
product launches. ADiS has operations in multiple locations that can provide redundancy if
necessary. We also have an agreement with JVC America Inc. under which JVC provides secondary
outsourced manufacturing volume for these launches and for day-to-day replenishment.

For retail distribution, we have an agreement with ADiS under which ADiS handles all logistics
services. Our retail product launches are operationally complex. Our model for product delivery for
retail launches and replenishment is a hybrid of direct to store deliveries and shipments to
central warehouse locations. This allows improved inventory management by our retailers. We also
ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through distributors.

ADiS also provides most of the manufacturing volume and distribution services for our direct
desktop software orders. We have an exclusive agreement with Harland Clarke, a division of M&F
Worldwide Corporation, to fulfill orders for all of our printed checks and most other products for
our financial supplies business.

We have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has historically not been a
significant problem for us.

Prior to major product releases for our core desktop software products we tend to have significant
levels of backlog, but at other times backlog is minimal and we typically ship products within a
few days of receiving an order. Because of this fluctuation in backlog, we believe that backlog is
not a reliable predictor of our future core desktop software sales.

Internet-Based Products and Services

Intuit’s data centers house most of the systems, networks and databases required to operate and
deliver our Internet-based products and services. These include QuickBooks Online, online payroll
services, merchant payment processing services, Web site hosting services for small businesses,
TurboTax Online, consumer and professional electronic tax filing services, Digital Insight
outsourced online banking services, and Quicken Online. Through our data centers, we connect
customers to our products and services and store customer and business information. As our
businesses continue to move toward delivering more online products and services in conjunction with
our Connected Services strategy, our infrastructure will become even more critical in the future.
Currently we have a number of data centers primarily located in the western United States. Over
time we expect to transition to fewer data centers in more geographically diverse locations. In
fiscal 2008 and 2009 we built a new data center in Washington state that we began occupying in the
second half of fiscal 2009. We expect this data center to support the hosting and high availability
requirements of many of our existing and future connected services offerings.



PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION AND TRANSACTIONS

We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations and to financial
institution requirements relating to the privacy and security of customer and employee personal
information. We are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to the Internet, behavioral
tracking, telemarketing, email activities and credit reporting. Additional laws in all of these
areas are likely to be passed in the future, which could result in significant limitations on or
changes to the ways in which we can collect, use, store or transmit the personal information of our
customers or employees, communicate with our customers, and deliver products and services, or may
significantly increase our compliance costs. If our business expands to new industry segments and
new uses of data that are regulated for privacy and security, or to countries outside the United
States that have strict data protections laws, our compliance requirements and costs will increase.

Through a Master Privacy Policy Framework designed to be consistent with globally recognized
privacy principles, we comply with United States federal and other country guidelines and practices
to help ensure that customers and employees are aware of, and can control, how we use information
about them. Our primary Web sites, such as QuickBooks.com and TurboTax.com, have been certified by
TRUSTe, an independent organization that operates a Web site privacy certification program
representing industry standard practices to address users’ and regulators’ concerns about online
privacy. We also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices, as
well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal
information. We participate in industry groups whose purpose is to influence public policy and
industry best practices for privacy and security.

To address security concerns, we use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the
information customers give to us from loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration. Whenever customers
transmit sensitive information, such as a credit card number or tax return data, to us through one
of our Web sites we use industry standards to encrypt the data as it is transmitted to us. We work
to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially
available computer security products as well as internally developed security procedures and
practices.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

The financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation.
Our financial institution customers, which include commercial banks and credit unions, operate in
markets that are subject to rigorous regulatory oversight and supervision. The compliance of our
products and services with these requirements depends on a variety of factors including the
particular functionality, the interactive design and the charter or license of the financial
institution. Our financial services customers must independently assess and determine what is
required of them under these regulations and are responsible for ensuring that our systems and the
design of their Web sites conform to their regulatory obligations.

Our Digital Insight subsidiary is not directly subject to federal or state regulations specifically
applicable to financial institutions such as banks and credit unions. However, as a provider of
services to financial institutions, our Digital Insight subsidiary is examined by the Federal
Financial Institution Examination Council under the Information Technology examination guidelines.
Although we believe we are not subject to direct supervision by federal and state banking agencies
with regard to other regulations, we have from time to time agreed to examinations of our business
and operations by these agencies.

Our Consumer Tax and Accounting Professionals businesses are also subject to federal and state
government requirements, including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns, the
provision of tax preparer assistance and the use and disclosure of customer information. In
addition, we offer certain other products and services, such as small business payroll, which are
subject to special regulatory requirements. As we expand our financial institutions, tax and small
business products and services, we may become subject to additional government regulation. New laws
or regulations may be adopted in these areas that could impose significant limitations on our
business and increase our cost of compliance. We continually analyze new business opportunities,
both domestically and internationally, and new businesses that we pursue may require additional
costs for regulatory compliance.



We are subject to federal and state laws and government regulations concerning employee safety and
health and environmental matters. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the
Environmental Protection Agency, and other federal and state agencies have the authority to put
regulations in place that may have an impact on our operations.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Our success depends on our proprietary technology embodied in our offerings. We protect this
proprietary technology by relying on a variety of intellectual property mechanisms, including
copyright, patent, trade secret and trademark laws, restrictions on disclosure and other methods.
For example, we regularly file applications for patents, copyrights and trademarks and service
marks in order to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business. We
currently hold a small but growing patent portfolio. We also have a number of registered trademarks
that include Intuit, QuickBooks, TurboTax, Lacerte, ProSeries, Digital Insight and Quicken. We have
registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the United States and, depending on the
relevance of each brand to other markets, in many foreign countries. Most registrations can be
renewed perpetually at 10-year intervals. We also license intellectual property from third parties
for use in our products.

Although our portfolio of patents is growing, the patents that have been issued to us could be
determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every
jurisdiction. In addition, third parties have asserted and may, in the future, assert infringement
claims against us. These claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary
rights or a finding of infringement against us along with an assessment of damages. Litigation,
even if without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management
attention. In addition, third party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially
acceptable terms, or at all.

EMPLOYEES

As of July 31, 2009, we had approximately 7,800 employees in major offices in the United States,
Canada, India, the United Kingdom and other locations. We believe our future success and growth
will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business.
We do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and we believe
employee relations are generally good. Although we have employment-related agreements with a number
of key employees, these agreements do not guarantee continued service. We believe we offer
competitive compensation and a good working environment. We were named one of

Fortune

magazine’s
“100 Best Companies to Work For” in each of the last eight years. However, we face intense
competition for qualified employees, and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and
retention.



ITEM 1A

RISK FACTORS

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. All statements in this report,
other than statements that are purely historical, are forward-looking statements. Words such as
“expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “forecast,” “estimate,” “seek,” and similar
expressions also identify forward-looking statements. In this report, forward-looking statements
include, without limitation, the following:

We caution investors that forward-looking statements are only predictions based on our current
expectations about future events and are not guarantees of future performance. We encourage you to
read carefully all information provided in this report and in our other filings with the SEC before
deciding to invest in our stock or to maintain or change your investment. These forward-looking
statements are based on information as of the filing date of this Annual Report, and we undertake
no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statement for any reason.

Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors
that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking
statements. These factors include the following:

We face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results.

We face intense competition in all of our businesses, and we expect competition to remain intense
in the future. The number, resources and sophistication of the companies with whom we compete have
increased as we continue to expand our product and service offerings. Our competitors, whether new
or well-established, may introduce superior products and services, reduce prices, gain better
access to distribution



channels, have greater technical, marketing and other resources, have
greater name recognition, have larger installed bases of customers, have well-established
relationships with our current and potential customers, advertise aggressively or beat us to market
with new products and services. We also face intensified competition from providers of free online
and desktop accounting, tax, banking and other financial services. In order to compete, we have
also introduced free offerings in several categories, but we may not be able to attract customers
or effectively monetize all of these offerings, and customers who have formerly paid for Intuit’s
products and services may elect to use free offerings instead. These competitive factors may
diminish our revenue and profitability, and harm our ability to acquire and retain customers.

Our consumer tax business faces significant competition from both the public and private sector.
In the public sector we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing software
or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to
taxpayers. These or similar programs may be introduced or expanded in the future, which may cause
us to lose customers and revenue. Although the Free File Alliance has kept the federal government
from being a direct competitor to Intuit’s tax offerings, it has fostered additional online
competition and may cause us to lose significant revenue opportunities. In addition, taxpayers who
formerly have paid for Intuit’s products may elect to use Intuit’s or our competitors’ free federal
service instead. The current agreement with the Free File Alliance is scheduled to expire in
October 2009. Although we are in negotiations with the IRS and other members of the Free File
Alliance to renew this agreement there is no guarantee an agreement will be reached prior to its
termination. If the IRS chose not to renew this agreement or terminated the agreement and elected
to provide government software and electronic filing services to taxpayers at no charge, or if the
federal government significantly altered the Free File Alliance or required the provision of
government tax filing services directly to taxpayers, our revenue and profits may suffer. See the
discussion on the Free File Alliance in Item 1,

“Business — Competition.”

We anticipate that
governmental encroachment may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the
foreseeable future.

Future revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change and successfully
introduce new and enhanced products and services.

The Software as a Service (SaaS) and desktop software industries are characterized by rapidly
changing technology, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions. As we
continue to grow our SaaS and other offerings, we must continue to innovate and develop new
products and features to meet changing customer needs and attract and retain talented software
developers. We need to continue to develop our skills, tools and capabilities to capitalize on
existing and emerging technologies. We are currently in the process of updating the software
platforms related to a number of our offerings. If we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen
difficulties in upgrading our systems and architecture, we may not be able to develop new offerings
and enhancements that we need to remain competitive.

A number of our businesses also derive a significant amount of their revenue from one-time upfront
license fees and rely on customer upgrades and service offerings to generate a significant portion
of their revenues. In addition, our consumer and professional tax businesses depend significantly
on revenue from customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing
software and services. As our existing products mature, encouraging customers to purchase product
upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality
that have meaningful incremental value. If we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the
value of new or upgraded products or services to our customers, our revenues may be harmed.

In some cases, we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on products
or services that do not ultimately succeed in their markets. We have encountered difficulty in
launching new products and services in the past. If we misjudge customer needs in the future, our
new products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed.



As our product and service offerings become more complex our revenue streams may become less
predictable

.

Our expanding range of products and services, including services delivered online, generates more
varied revenue streams than our traditional desktop software businesses, and the accounting
policies that apply to revenue from our newer offerings are complex. For example, as we offer
online services bundled with other products, we may be required to defer a higher percentage of our
product revenue into future fiscal periods. In addition, as we offer more services on a
subscription basis, we recognize revenue from those services over the periods in which the services
are provided. This may result in significant shifts of revenue from quarter to quarter, or from one
fiscal year to the next, and may make our revenues less predictable.

Business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair
the availability of our products and services, which may damage our reputation and harm our future
financial results.

As we continue to grow our online services, we become more dependent on the continuing operation
and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external
service providers. Any damage to or failure of our systems may result in interruptions in our
service, which may reduce our revenues and profits, cause us to lose customers and damage our
brand. In particular, any prolonged interruptions in our online tax preparation or electronic
filing services, or in any electronic filing systems operating by the government, at any time
during the tax season may result in lost customers, additional refunds of customer charges,
negative publicity and increased operating costs, any of which may significantly harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Although we have implemented practices designed to
maintain the availability of our online products and services and mitigate the harm of any
unplanned interruptions, we do not have complete redundancy for all of our systems, and our
disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. Despite our efforts to maintain
continuous and reliable server operations, we occasionally experience unplanned outages or
technical difficulties. Due to our evolving business needs, in fiscal 2008 and 2009 we built a new
data center in Washington state to support our longer term hosting requirements. We began occupying
this data center in the second half of fiscal 2009. If we do not execute the transition to the new
data center in an effective manner, we may experience unplanned service disruptions or unforeseen
increases in cost which may harm our operating results and our business. We do not maintain
real-time back-up of all our data, and in the event of significant system disruption, particularly
during peak tax filing season, we may experience loss of data or processing capabilities, which may
cause us to lose customers and may materially harm our reputation and our operating results.

Our business operations, data centers, information technology and communications systems are
vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, malicious attacks, fire, power loss,
telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, terrorist
attacks and other events beyond our control. The majority of our research and development
activities, our corporate headquarters, our principal information technology systems, and other
critical business operations are located near major seismic faults. We do not carry earthquake
insurance for direct quake-related losses. Our future financial results may be materially harmed in
the event of a major earthquake or other natural or man-made disaster.

We rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers, distributors and
service providers to take and fulfill customer orders, handle customer service requests and host
certain online activities. Any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems may
prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause company
and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed. Our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand
our network security and other information systems may be costly, and problems with the design or
implementation of system enhancements may harm our business and our results of operations.

The recent global economic downturn may harm our business and financial condition.

The recent global economic downturn has caused disruptions and extreme volatility in global
financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy, and has impacted consumer and
small business spending. These macroeconomic developments may continue to negatively affect our
business and financial condition. Many customers may delay or reduce technology purchases. This
may result in reductions in sales of our products, slower adoption of new technologies and upgrades
to existing technologies and increased price competition. Decreased consumer spending levels may
also reduce credit and debit card transaction processing volumes causing reductions



in our payments revenue. Weakness in the end-user market may negatively affect the cash flow of
our distributors and resellers who may, in turn, delay paying their obligations to us, which may
increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to
these customers. If economic or other factors cause financial institutions to fail or
macro-economic factors affecting banks, credit unions, mortgage lenders and other financial
institutions lead to cost-cutting efforts, we may lose current or potential customers or achieve
less revenue per customer and our revenues may suffer. Continued consolidation of the banking and
financial services industry, whether due to failures of financial institutions or other factors,
may result in a smaller market for our products and services and may cause us to lose relationships
with key customers. Any of these events may likely harm our business and our future financial
results.

The nature of our products necessitates timely product launches and if we experience significant
product quality problems or delays, it may harm our revenue, earnings and reputation.

All of our tax products and many of our non-tax products have rigid development timetables that
increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays. Our tax preparation
software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate
unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels
of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing
deadline. Due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which
we operate, our products sometimes contain “bugs” that may unexpectedly interfere with the
operation of the software. When we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code,
distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage
existing product inventory in our distribution channels. If we encounter development challenges or
discover errors in our products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product
launch date. Any major defects or launch delays may lead to loss of customers and revenue,
negative publicity, customer and employee dissatisfaction, reduced retailer shelf space and
promotions, and increased operating expenses, such as inventory replacement costs, legal fees or
payments resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due
solely to calculation errors in our consumer tax preparation products.

Our hosting, collection, use and retention of personal customer information create risk that may
harm our business.

A number of our businesses collect, use and retain large amounts of personal customer information,
including credit card numbers, tax return information, bank account numbers and passwords, personal
and business financial data, social security numbers and other payroll information. We may also
develop new business models that use personal information, or data derived from personal
information, in innovative and novel ways. In addition, we collect and maintain personal
information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business. Some of this personal customer
and employee information is held and some transactions are executed by third parties. In addition,
as many of our products and services are Web based, the amount of data we store for our users on
our servers (including personal information) has been increasing. We and our vendors use
commercially available security technologies to protect transactions and personal information. We
use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information. However, a
third party may be able to circumvent these security and business measures, and errors in the
storage, use or transmission of personal information may result in a breach of customer or employee
privacy or theft of assets, which may require notification under applicable data privacy
regulations. We employ contractors, temporary and seasonal employees who may have access to the
personal information of customers and employees or who may execute transactions in the normal
course of their duties. While we conduct necessary and appropriate background checks of these
individuals and limit access to systems and data, it is possible that one or more of these
individuals may circumvent these controls, resulting in a security breach.

The ability to execute transactions and the possession and use of personal information in
conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require
notification to customers or employees of a security breach, restrict our use of personal
information and hinder our ability to acquire new customers or market to existing customers. As our
business continues to expand to new industry segments that may be more highly regulated for privacy
and data security, and to countries outside the U.S. that have more strict data protection laws,
our compliance requirements and costs may increase. We have incurred — and may continue to incur -
significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed
by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations.



In the past we have experienced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues and we
may face similar suits in the future. A major breach of our security measures or those of third
parties that execute transactions or hold and manage personal information may have serious negative
consequences for our businesses, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced customer
demand for our services, harm to our reputation and brands, further regulation and oversight by
federal or state agencies, and loss of our ability to provide financial transaction services or
accept and process customer credit card orders or tax returns. From time to time, we detect, or
receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected,
vulnerabilities in our servers, our software or third-party software components that are
distributed with our products. The existence of vulnerabilities, even if they do not result in a
security breach, may harm customer confidence and require substantial resources to address, and we
may not be able to discover or remediate such security vulnerabilities before they are exploited.
If hackers were able to circumvent our security measures, we may lose personal information.
Although we have sophisticated network and application security, internal control measures, and
physical security procedures to safeguard our systems, there can be no assurance that a security
breach, loss or theft of personal information will not occur, which may harm our business, customer
reputation and future financial results and may require us to expend significant resources to
address these problems, including notification under data privacy regulations.

Our reliance on a limited number of manufacturing and distribution suppliers may harm our business.

We have chosen to outsource the majority of the manufacturing and distribution for many of our
desktop software products to a single third party provider and we use a single vendor to produce
and distribute our check and business forms supplies products. Although our reliance on single
suppliers provides us with efficiencies and enhanced bargaining power, poor performance by these
suppliers may significantly harm our business. This risk is amplified by the fact that we carry
very little inventory and rely on just-in-time manufacturing processes. In particular, the loss of
our manufacturing partner for retail may be disruptive to our business and may cause delay in a
product launch. We seek to mitigate this risk by managing our second tier vendors and maintaining
contingency plans. If we experience delays during a peak demand period or significant quality
issues our business may be significantly harmed.

Our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and our quarterly results fluctuate significantly.

Several of our businesses are highly seasonal causing significant quarterly fluctuations in our
financial results. Revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and third
fiscal quarters ending January 31 and April 30 due to our tax businesses contributing most of their
revenue during those quarters and the timing of the release of our small business software products
and upgrades. We experience lower revenues, and significant operating losses, in the first and
fourth quarters ending October 31 and July 31. Our financial results may also fluctuate from
quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors, including changes in product sales
mix that affect average selling prices; product release dates; the timing of delivery of federal
and state tax forms; the timing of our discontinuance of support for older product offerings;
changes to our bundling strategy, such as the inclusion of upgrades with certain offerings; changes
to how we communicate the availability of new functionality in the future (any of which may impact
the pattern of revenue recognition); and the timing of acquisitions, divestitures, and goodwill and
purchased intangible asset impairment charges.

If we are unable to develop and maintain critical third party business relationships, the business
may be adversely affected.

Our growth is dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue
to develop and maintain new relationships. We rely on various business partners, including third
party service providers, vendors, licensing partners, development partners, and licensees, among
others, in many areas of our business. The failure of these third parties to provide adequate
services and technologies, or the failure of the third parties to adequately maintain or update
their services and technologies, could result in a disruption to our business operations.
Alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms
or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner or vendor.

In the financial institutions business, we rely on core processors and other third parties to
enable our online banking and bill pay services. Consolidation among core processors or between
core processors and online banking and bill-pay providers may create larger or
vertically-integrated competitors that may have stronger relationships with our current or
potential financial institutions clients. If these core processors fail to support any of the
functionality in



our products and services or significantly raise their prices, we may lose customers and our
financial results may suffer.

Because we depend on a small number of larger retailers and distributors, changes in these
relationships may harm our business.

We sell most of our desktop software products through our retail distribution channel and a
relatively small number of larger retailers and distributors generate a significant portion of our
sales volume. Our principal retailers have significant bargaining leverage due to their size and
available resources. Historically, some retailers have elected to offer our tax products
exclusively, but we cannot guarantee that these exclusive relationships will continue in the
future. Any change in principal business terms, loss of exclusivity, major disruption or
termination of a relationship with these resellers, including due to bankruptcy of the resellers,
may result in a significant decline in our revenues and earnings. The sourcing decisions, product
display locations and promotional activities that retailers undertake may greatly impact the sales
of our products. Changes in our pricing, product offerings or features, or concerns by retailers
about our direct sales efforts, may cause retailers or distributors to reduce their efforts to
promote our products, eliminate any exclusive placements, or stop selling our products altogether.
If any of our retailers or distributors experience financial difficulties we may be unable to
collect amounts that we are owed. At January 31, 2009, in the midst of the 2008 consumer tax
season, amounts due from our 10 largest retailers and distributors represented approximately 51% of
total gross accounts receivable.

Increased government regulation of our businesses may harm our operating results.

The tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state
governments. New legislation, regulation, public policy considerations or litigation by the
government or private entities may result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry,
restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge, or
otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our tax businesses or offer our tax products and
services. This in turn may increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities.

We are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to
successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services. Changes in state-imposed
requirements by one or more of the states, including the required use of specific technologies or
technology standards, may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our
customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner.

Our financial institutions business provides services to banks, credit unions and other
institutions that are subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation. As a result,
our financial institution customers require that our products and services comply with the
regulations applicable to these customers. If we are unable to comply with these regulations, we
may incur significant costs and penalties, face litigation or governmental proceedings, and lose
our ability to sell to these customers. Any of these adverse events may harm our future financial
results and our reputation.

In addition, as we seek to grow our business, we may expand into more highly-regulated businesses
or countries, which may require increased investment in compliance and auditing functions or new
technologies in order to meet regulatory standards. Government authorities may enact other laws,
rules or regulations that place new burdens or restrictions on our business or determine that our
operations are directly subject to existing rules or regulations, such as requirements related to
data collection, use, transmission, retention and processing, which may make our business more
costly, less efficient or impossible to conduct, and may require us to modify our current or future
products or services, which may harm our future financial results.

Expansion of our operations in international markets exposes us to operational and compliance
risks.

As we continue to grow our business internationally we face increased risk which may harm our
business and financial condition. We have limited experience with operations outside the U.S. and
our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally requires management
attention and resources and is subject to a number of risks, including difficulties in managing
varying foreign operations, political or social unrest or economic instability, foreign currency
restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations, higher costs associated with doing business
internationally and potentially adverse tax consequences. Also, compliance with complex foreign
and U.S. laws and



regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in
international jurisdictions and may expose us or our employees to fines and penalties.

If we encounter problems with our third-party customer service and technical support providers our
business and future financial results may be harmed.

We outsource a substantial portion of our customer service and technical support activities to
domestic and international third-party service providers, including service providers in India and
the Philippines, and we expect to continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future. This
strategy provides us with lower operating costs and greater flexibility, but also presents risks to
our business, including the following:

We are exposed to risks associated with credit card and payment fraud and with credit card
processing.

In our payments processing service business if merchants for whom we process payment transactions
are unable to pay refunds due to their customers in connection with disputed or fraudulent merchant
transactions, we may be required to pay those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of the
customer reserves we have established to make such payments.

We are subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, as in
effect from time to time. Failure to comply with these rules or requirements may subject us to
fines and higher transaction fees or cause us to lose our ability to accept credit card payments
from our customers, resulting in harm to our business and future financial results.

If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may exploit our
innovations, which may weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue and earnings.

Our success depends upon our proprietary technology embodied in our offerings. We protect this
proprietary technology by relying on a combination of copyright, trade secret, trademark, patent,
confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements. Although we seek to obtain patent protection
for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of those innovations. Given
the cost of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to patent certain innovations that later
turn out to be important. There is also the possibility that, despite our efforts, the scope of
protection may be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable. It
is possible that other companies may successfully challenge the validity or scope of our patents
and that our patent portfolio, which is relatively small, may not provide us with adequate
protection. Ultimately, our attempts to secure legal protection for our proprietary rights may not
be adequate and our competitors may independently develop similar technologies, duplicate our
products, or design around patents and other intellectual property rights. If our intellectual
property protection proves inadequate we may lose our competitive advantage and our future
financial results may suffer.

Third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights may cause us to incur significant
legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products.

As the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these
products further overlap, and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, we may
become increasingly subject to infringement



claims, including patent, copyright, and trademark infringement claims. Litigation may be
necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent rights of others. We have received
allegations of patent infringement claims in the past and may receive more claims in the future
based on allegations that our products infringe upon patents held by third parties. Some of these
claims are the subject of pending litigation against us and against some of our OEM customers.
These claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no
relevant product revenues of their own, and against whom our own patents may provide little or no
deterrence. The ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, any
such claim, with or without merit, may be time consuming to defend, result in costly litigation,
divert management’s time and attention from our business, require us to stop selling, delay
shipping or redesign our products, or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing
fees, or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers. Our
failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual
property claims may harm our business.

We expect copying and misuse of our intellectual property to be a persistent problem which may
cause lost revenue and increased expenses.

Policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult, expensive, and time consuming.
Current U.S. laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software
piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection. We frequently
encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online marketplaces. In addition,
efforts to protect our intellectual property may be misunderstood and perceived negatively by our
customers. Although we continue to evaluate and put in place technology solutions to attempt to
lessen the impact of piracy and engage in efforts to educate consumers and public policy leaders on
these issues and cooperate with industry groups in their efforts to combat piracy, we expect piracy
to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses.

Our use of third party intellectual property in our products and services may harm our business.

Many of our products and services include intellectual property of third parties, which we license
under agreements that must be renewed or renegotiated from time to time. We may not be able to
obtain licenses to these third party technologies or content on reasonable terms, or at all. If we
are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use this intellectual property in our products and
services, we may not be able to sell the affected products, which may in turn harm our future
financial results.

Some of our offerings include third-party software that is licensed under so-called “open source”
licenses, some of which may include a requirement that, under certain circumstances, we make
available, or grant licenses to, any modifications or derivative works we create based upon the
open source software. Although we have established internal review and approval processes to
mitigate these risks, we may not be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval
prior to use in our products. Many of the risks associated with usage of open source may not be
eliminated, and may, if not properly addressed, harm our business.

Our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business, may involve increased
expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions.

We have acquired and may continue to acquire companies, products and technologies that complement
our strategic direction. Acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:



Acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky. Our transactions may not be successful and
may, in some cases, harm our operating results or financial condition. If we use debt to fund
acquisitions or for other purposes, our interest expense and leverage may increase significantly.
If we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition, current shareholders’ percentage
ownership and earnings per share may be diluted.

We have issued $1 billion in a debt offering and may incur other debt in the future, which may
adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.

In fiscal 2007 we issued $1 billion in senior unsecured notes. We have also entered into a $500
million five-year revolving credit facility. Although we have no current plans to request any
advances under this credit facility, we may use the proceeds of any future borrowing for general
corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business.

This debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other
things:

•

increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive
pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash from operations
to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow
available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions; and

•

limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our
business and our industry.

Our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our
ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness,
and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with
these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, our long-term
non-convertible debt includes covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain
liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the
covenants under our long-term debt or our revolving credit facility and do not obtain a waiver from
the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding indebtedness may be declared
immediately due and payable.

In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and
liquidity of both our debt and equity securities. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other
negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility may
increase. In addition, any downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain
additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing.

We are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services.

The law relating to the liability of online services companies for information carried on or
disseminated through their services is often unsettled. Claims may be made against online services
companies under both U.S. and foreign law for defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence,
copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the
materials disseminated through their services. Certain of our services include content generated
by users. Although this content is not generated by us, claims of defamation or other injury may
be made against us for that content. Any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability may
harm our business.

If actual product returns exceed returns reserves our future financial results may be harmed.

We ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to
sell, in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers may run out of products. This is
particularly true for our Consumer Tax products, which have a short selling season and for which
returns occur primarily in our fiscal third and fourth quarters. Like many software companies that
sell their products through distributors and retailers, we have historically accepted significant
product returns. We establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial
statements based on estimated returns and we closely monitor product sales and inventory in the
retail channel in an effort to maintain adequate reserves. In the past, returns have not differed
significantly from these reserves. However, if we experience actual returns that significantly
exceed reserves, it may result in lower net revenue.



Acquisition-related costs and impairment charges may cause significant fluctuation in our net
income.

Our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses, including amortization and impairment of
purchased intangible assets, charges for in-process research and development, and impairment of
goodwill. Total acquisition-related costs in these categories were approximately $103 million in
fiscal 2009, $92 million in fiscal 2008, and $51 million in fiscal 2007. Although under current
accounting rules goodwill is not amortized, we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill
already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions. We test the impairment of
goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment
arise. The timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in
our fourth fiscal quarter that may not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods. At July 31,
2009, we had $1.8 billion in goodwill and $293.0 million in net purchased intangible assets on our
balance sheet, both of which may be subject to impairment charges in the future. New acquisitions,
and any impairment of the value of purchased assets, may have a significant negative impact on our
future financial results.

Our investments in auction rate securities are subject to risks that may cause losses and affect
the liquidity of these investments.

At July 31, 2009, we held a total of $244.5 million in municipal auction rate securities that we
valued at par. We classified $150.9 million of these securities as short-term investments and
$93.6 million of these securities as long-term investments on our balance sheet at that date. Due
to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets, in February 2008 auctions began failing
for the municipal auction rate securities we held. Regularly scheduled auctions for these
securities have generally continued to fail since that time. We will not be able to liquidate
these investments and realize their full carrying value unless successful auctions occur, a buyer
is found outside of the auction process, the issuer calls the security, the issuer repays principal
over time from cash flows prior to final maturity, or the security matures according to contractual
terms ranging from one to 38 years. We believe the fair values of the municipal auction rate
securities we hold are approximately equal to their par values. However, if the issuers of these
securities are unable to call the securities or successfully close future auctions and their credit
ratings are lowered, we may be required to record future impairment charges related to these
investments, which would harm our results of operations. If we are unable to find alternate means
to liquidate these investments, we may not realize the value of the investments until the final
maturity of the underlying securities.

In November 2008 we accepted an offer from UBS AG (UBS), one of the broker-dealers of our municipal
auction rate securities, that gives us the option to sell to UBS a total of $140.9 million in
municipal auction rate securities at par value at any time during a two-year period beginning June
30, 2010. The offer also gives UBS the discretion to buy any or all of these municipal auction
rate securities from us at par value at any time. To date UBS has not purchased any of these
securities from us. Even with this option, we may not realize the value of these investments until
after June 30, 2010. We continue to have counter-party risk associated with UBS.

If we fail to process transactions effectively our revenue and earnings may be harmed.

Our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis,
especially in our payroll and payments businesses. Due to the size and volume of transactions that
we handle, effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are
handled appropriately. Despite our efforts, it is possible that we may make errors or that funds
may be misappropriated due to fraud involving our offerings. In addition to any direct damages and
fines that any such problems may create, which may be substantial, the loss of customer confidence
in our accuracy and controls may seriously harm our business. The systems supporting our business
are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult to scale. If we are unable to
effectively manage our systems and processes, we may be unable to process customer data in an
accurate, reliable and timely manner, which may harm our business.

Because competition for our key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the
highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth.

Much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel,
including members of our executive team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions.
Experienced personnel in the software and services industries are in high demand and competition
for their talents is intense, especially in



California, where the majority of our employees are located. Although we strive to be an employer
of choice, we may not be able to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel which
may cause our business to suffer.

We are frequently a party to litigation that is costly to defend and consumes the time of our
management.

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct
of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims may arise in the future. Results of
legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Defending litigation consumes the time of
our management and is expensive for Intuit. Even though we often seek insurance coverage for
litigation defense costs, there is no assurance that our defense costs, which may be substantial,
will be covered in all cases. In addition, by its nature, litigation is unpredictable and we may
not prevail even in cases where we strongly believe a plaintiff’s case has no valid claims. If we
do not prevail in litigation we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages or alter our
business operations. Regardless of the outcome, litigation is expensive and consumes the time of
our management and may ultimately harm our future financial results.

Unanticipated changes in our tax rates may affect our future financial results.

Our future effective tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in
the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their
interpretation. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax
returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the
likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our
provision for income taxes. There may be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous
examinations will not have an adverse effect on our future financial results.

Our business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands.

Developing and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance
of our existing and future products and services and is an important element in attracting new
customers. We believe that brand recognition will increase as competition in our markets develops.
Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to activities by our employees or agents
may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands. Damage to our reputation and loss of
brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and thus have an adverse effect on our
future financial results, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and
restore the value of the brands.

ITEM 3

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened
litigation, that arise in the normal course of our business, including assertions that we may be
infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others. We currently believe that the
ultimate amount of liability, if any, for any pending claims of any type (either alone or combined)
will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The
ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, litigation can have an
adverse impact on Intuit because of defense costs, negative publicity, diversion of management
resources and other factors. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation
arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business.

ITEM 6

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following tables show Intuit’s selected financial information for the past five fiscal years.
The comparability of the information is affected by a variety of factors, including acquisitions
and divestitures of businesses, issuance of debt, share-based compensation expense, amortization of
purchased intangible assets, and repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs.

On July 6, 2006 we implemented a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend. All
share and per share figures in the selected financial data below reflect this stock split.

We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment,”

on
August 1, 2005 using the modified prospective transition method. Because we elected to use the
modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated to include
share-based compensation expense for stock options or our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

In February 2007 we acquired Digital Insight Corporation for a total purchase price of
approximately $1.34 billion. In December 2007 we acquired Homestead Technologies Inc. for total
consideration of approximately $170 million and in February 2008 we acquired Electronic Clearing
House, Inc. for a total purchase price of approximately $131 million. In July 2009 we acquired
PayCycle, Inc. for a total purchase price of approximately $169 million. Accordingly, we have
included the results of operations for these companies in our consolidated results of operations
from their respective dates of acquisition. During fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 we transitioned
certain outsourced payroll customers in connection with a sale of assets to Automatic Data
Processing, Inc. (ADP). In addition, we sold our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions business
in fiscal 2008, our Intuit Information Technology Solutions business in fiscal 2006, and our Intuit
Public Sector Solutions business in fiscal 2005. We accounted for these three businesses as
discontinued operations and, accordingly, we have reclassified the selected financial data for all
periods presented to reflect them as such. To better understand the information in the tables,
investors should read

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations”

in Item 7, and the financial statements and related notes in Item 8.

ITEM 7

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A)
includes the following sections:

•

Executive Overview that discusses at a high level our operating results and some of the
trends that affect our business.

•

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates that we believe are important to
understanding the assumptions and judgments underlying our financial statements.

•

Results of Operations that includes a more detailed discussion of our revenue and
expenses.

•

Liquidity and Capital Resources which discusses key aspects of our statements of cash
flows, changes in our balance sheets and our financial commitments.

You should note that this MD&A discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks
and uncertainties. Please see the section entitled

“Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors”

at
the beginning of Item 1A for important information to consider when evaluating such statements.

You should read this MD&A in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in Item 8.
In February 2007 we completed the acquisition of Digital Insight Corporation for a total purchase
price of approximately $1.34 billion. In December 2007 we acquired Homestead Technologies Inc. for
total consideration of approximately $170 million and in February 2008 we acquired Electronic
Clearing House, Inc. (ECHO) for a total purchase price of approximately $131 million. In July 2009
we acquired PayCycle, Inc. for a total purchase price of approximately $169 million. Accordingly,
we have included the results of operations for these companies in our consolidated results of
operations from their respective dates of acquisition. During fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 we
transitioned certain outsourced payroll customers in connection with a sale of assets to Automatic
Data Processing, Inc. (ADP). We have also reclassified our financial statements for all periods
presented to reflect our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions business as discontinued
operations. See

“Results of Operations — Dispositions and Discontinued Operations”

later in this
Item 7 for more information. Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion pertains only to our
continuing operations.

In fiscal 2009 we reclassified segment results for all periods presented to reflect the continued
evolution of our business. We no longer combine results for our Payroll business with results for
our Payments business because management currently views these businesses separately. We also
changed the name of our QuickBooks segment to Financial Management Solutions, our new Payroll
segment to Employee Management Solutions, and our new Payments segment to Payments Solutions. We
transferred revenue for our Point of Sale offerings from our Financial Management Solutions segment
to our Payments Solutions segment to align this product group more closely with the customers they
serve. Total Point of Sale revenue was less than $40 million for all periods presented. We also
reclassified certain retail sales expenses from common expenses to segment income or loss,
consistent with how management now views these expenses. These expenses were less than $25 million
for all periods presented.

Executive Overview

This overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that
affect our business. We believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to
understand our financial results for fiscal 2009 as well as our future prospects. This summary is
not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion
and analysis provided elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Overview of Financial Results

Total net revenue for fiscal 2009 was $3.2 billion, an increase of 4% compared with fiscal 2008.
The fiscal 2009 revenue increase was due to revenue growth in our Consumer Tax, Payments Solutions,
Employee Management Solutions, Accounting Professionals and Financial Institutions segments,
partially offset by revenue decreases in our Other Businesses and Financial Management Solutions
segments. Consumer Tax revenue increased $67.0 million or 7% due to growth in TurboTax Online
units, which more than offset a decrease in TurboTax desktop units.



Operating income from continuing operations of $682.1 million for fiscal 2009 increased $31.3
million or 5% compared with fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2009 revenue grew $111.5 million and total costs
and expenses increased $80.2 million. Total costs and expenses for fiscal 2009 increased due to our
fiscal 2008 acquisitions of Homestead and ECHO; higher advertising and other marketing expenses to
support the launch and subsequent promotion of TurboTax and QuickBooks 2009; higher depreciation
expense for investments in our infrastructure; higher share-based compensation expense; and a
charge for the historical use of certain technology licensing rights. Decreases in total costs and
expenses due to lower performance incentive payouts as well as other compensation and benefit
savings due to lower staffing and lower severance charges partially offset these increases.

Net income from continuing operations of $447.0 million for fiscal 2009 decreased $3.8 million or
1% compared with fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2008 we recorded a pre-tax gain of $51.6 million on the
sale of certain outsourced payroll assets; there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2009. In
addition, interest income decreased in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due to the impact of
lower interest rates that more than offset the impact of higher invested balances.

Due to the foregoing factors, diluted net income per share from continuing operations of $1.35 in
fiscal 2009 increased 2% compared with $1.33 in fiscal 2008.

In July 2009 we acquired PayCycle, Inc. for a total purchase price of approximately $169 million.
PayCycle is a provider of online payroll services to small businesses and became part of our
Employee Management Solutions segment.

We ended fiscal 2009 with cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $1.3 billion, an increase
of $519.2 million from July 31, 2008. Cash, cash equivalents and investments at July 31, 2009
included $150.9 in municipal auction rate securities. We did not classify any of the municipal
auction rate securities we held at July 31, 2008 as cash, cash equivalents and investments. At
July 31, 2009 and 2008, we also held $93.6 million and $285.3 million in municipal auction rate
securities that we classified as long-term investments on our balance sheet. See

“Liquidity and
Capital Resources — Auction Rate Securities,”

later in this Item 7 for more information. In fiscal
2009 we generated $812.4 million in cash from continuing operations and $183.6 million from the
issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. During the same period we used $300.2 million
in cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs,
$182.5 million for capital expenditures, and $187.4 million for acquisitions of businesses
(primarily PayCycle) and intangible assets. At July 31, 2009, we had authorization from our Board
of Directors to expend up to an additional $299.8 million for stock repurchases through May 15,
2011.

On September 11, 2009 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Mint Software Inc., a provider of
online personal finance management services. The cash transaction is valued at approximately
$170 million, including the assumption of Mint outstanding stock options. Mint will
become part of our Other Businesses segment. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and
customary closing conditions. We expect the transaction to close before the end of calendar 2009.

Seasonality

Our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Accounting Professionals offerings are highly seasonal. Some of
our other offerings are also seasonal, but to a lesser extent. Revenue from our QuickBooks software
products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters. Sales of income tax
preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from November through
April. In our Consumer Tax business, a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later
in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of TurboTax Online, for which revenue is
recognized upon printing or electronic filing of a tax return. The seasonality of our Consumer Tax
and Accounting Professionals revenue is also affected by the timing of the availability of tax
forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return
submissions. Delays in the availability of tax forms or the ability of taxing agencies to receive
submissions can cause revenue to shift from our second fiscal quarter to our third fiscal quarter.
These seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second
quarter ending January 31 and third quarter ending April 30. We typically report losses in our
first quarter ending October 31 and fourth quarter ending July 31, when revenue from our tax
businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels. In
addition, the timing and composition of new



customer offerings that include both product and service elements can materially shift revenue
between quarters. We believe the seasonality of our revenue is likely to continue in the future.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a
significant impact on our net revenue, operating income or loss and net income or loss, as well as
on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. We believe that the estimates,
assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest
potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting
policies. Senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting
policies and their disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Audit Committee of our
Board of Directors.

Revenue Recognition

We derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products, license fees, software
subscriptions, product support, hosting services, payroll services, merchant services, professional
services, transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of
these items. We follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue. For
additional information, see

“Revenue Recognition”

in Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8.
We generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered
the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is
probable. However, determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often
involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of
revenue we report. For example, for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and
judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver, to
determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products
and services, to determine whether vendor-specific evidence of fair value exists for each
undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered. If we were
to change any of these assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material increase or decrease in
the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. Amounts for fees collected or invoiced
and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance
sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are
satisfied.

In connection with the sale of certain products, we provide a limited amount of free technical
support assistance to customers. We do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with
sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant.
The technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is
recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent. We accrue the estimated cost
of providing this free support upon product shipment.

Return and Rebate Reserves

As part of our revenue recognition policy, we estimate future product returns and rebate payments
and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates. Our return
policy allows distributors and retailers, subject to contractual limitations, to return purchased
products. Product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of excess
and obsolete products. In determining our product returns reserves, we consider the volume and
price mix of products in the retail channel, historical return rates for prior releases of the
product, trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our
products (including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products). We
fully reserve for excess and obsolete products in the distribution channels.

Our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and end-user rebates.
Our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors’
and retailers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs, which we
typically establish annually. Our reserves for end-user rebates are estimated based on the terms
and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program, actual sales during the promotion and
historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program.

In the past, actual returns and rebates have not differed significantly from the reserves that we
have established. However, actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently
uncertain. If we were to change our



assumptions and estimates, our revenue reserves would change, which would impact the net revenue we
report. If actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have
established, the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue. Conversely, if actual
returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves, this would increase our future
reported revenue. For example, if we had increased our fiscal 2009 returns reserves by 1% of
non-consignment sales to retailers for QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken, our total net revenue for
fiscal 2009 would have been about $3.0 million lower.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. The accounts
receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid. In
determining the amount of the reserve, we consider our historical level of credit losses. We also
make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit
evaluations, and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in
the future. Our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses. However,
since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we
cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. If actual credit losses are
significantly greater than the reserve we have established, that would increase our general and
administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income. Conversely, if actual credit losses are
significantly less than our reserve, this would eventually decrease our general and administrative
expenses and increase our reported net income.

Fair Value of Investments

We estimate the fair value of our available-for-sale securities each quarter. These investments
consist of cash equivalents, municipal bonds, U.S. agency securities, corporate notes and municipal
auction rate securities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset
or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. When
identical or similar assets are traded in active markets, the level of judgment required to
estimate their fair value is relatively low. This is generally true for our cash equivalents,
municipal bonds, U.S. agency securities and corporate notes. However, significant judgment is
required to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities when observable inputs are not
available. For example, we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our
municipal auction rate securities because we have determined that the market for those securities
is inactive. We based this determination on the fact that due to a decrease in liquidity in the
global credit markets, regularly scheduled auctions for the municipal auction rate securities we
hold have generally failed since February 2008. Some of the key inputs to our discounted cash flow
model are inherently uncertain. The key inputs include projected future interest rates; the likely
timing of principal repayments; the probability of full repayment; publicly available pricing data
for recently issued similar securities that are not subject to auctions; and the impact of the
reduced liquidity for auction rate securities. At July 31, 2009, we held a total of $244.5 million
in municipal auction rate securities.

We record unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale securities in other comprehensive
income in the equity section of our balance sheet until the security is sold or we determine that
the decrease in fair value is other-than-temporary. We consider a number of factors in determining
whether to recognize an impairment charge, including the reason for the decrease in fair value, the
severity of the decrease in fair value, the length of time that the fair value has been less than
the cost basis of the security, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and
whether we intend to sell or may be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery of
our cost basis. Changes in our estimates of the fair values of our available-for-sale securities
may result in material increases or decreases in our net income in the period in which the change
occurs.

Business Combinations — Purchase Accounting

Under the purchase method of accounting, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to
the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their
estimated fair values. We record the excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values as
goodwill. We engage third-party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These valuations require us to make significant estimates
and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing
purchased technology, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash
flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and
updated projections of the underlying



business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these
values, we could experience impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives
of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization
expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could
be accelerated or slowed.

Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets — Impairment Assessments

We estimate the fair value of purchased intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have
finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value
of the asset may not be recoverable. We test for potential impairment of goodwill and other
intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or
whenever indicators of impairment arise. The timing of the annual test may result in charges to our
statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen
in prior periods.

In order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash
flow model (known as the income approach) and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses (known as the market approach). The income
approach requires us to use a number of assumptions, including market factors specific to the
business, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over
an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that
considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. We evaluate
cash flows at the reporting unit level and the number of reporting units that we have identified
may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and more
integrated operations following acquisitions. Although the assumptions we use in our discounted
cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans
and forecasts, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash
flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. When using the
market approach, we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in
similar businesses. We base our judgments on factors such as size, growth rates, profitability,
risk, and return on investment. We also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue,
operating income, and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own
businesses. We had a total of $1.8 billion in goodwill on our balance sheet at July 31, 2009. See
Note 4 to the financial statements in Item 8 for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment.

In order to estimate the fair value of purchased intangible assets and other long-lived assets that
have finite useful lives, we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets. The
key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of
estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate
of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money.
Significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the
relative risk of achieving those cash flows. We also make judgments about the remaining useful
lives of purchased intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite lives. We had a
total of $293.0 million in net purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet at July 31, 2009.

Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often
subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as
industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our
internal forecasts. For example, if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or
if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be
indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units, we may be required
to record future impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets. Impairment
charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our
balance sheet.

Accounting for Share-Based Compensation Plans

At July 31, 2009, there was $240.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which
we will amortize to expense in the future. Total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted
for future changes in estimated forfeitures. We expect to recognize that cost over a weighted
average vesting period of 2.1 years.



We use a lattice binomial model and the assumptions shown in Note 12 to the financial statements in
Item 8 to estimate the fair value of stock options granted. We estimate the expected term of
options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model. We estimate the
volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly
traded one-year and two-year options on our common stock. Our decision to use implied volatility
was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment
that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical
volatility. We base the risk-free interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the
implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity U.S. Treasury issues with
equivalent remaining terms. We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not
anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected
dividend yield of zero in our option valuation model. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant
and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based
compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. We amortize the fair value of
options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are
generally the vesting periods. We may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation
model in the future, which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss
per share. We value restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method. We amortize the value
of restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the restriction period.

Legal Contingencies

We are subject to certain legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation
that arise in the normal course of our business. We review the status of each significant matter
quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or
legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a
liability and an expense for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the
determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable.
Our accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information
becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation
and may revise our estimates. Potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of
potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of
operations.

Income Taxes — Estimates of Effective Tax Rates, Deferred Taxes and Valuation Allowance

When we prepare our financial statements, we estimate our income taxes based on the various
jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our
worldwide income tax provision. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with
uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of
our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdiction. We
estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing
treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred
tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood
that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not
likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase
this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of
operations.

At July 31, 2009, we had net deferred tax assets of $128.7 million which included a valuation
allowance of $5.7 million for certain state net operating loss carryforwards. We recorded the
valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our
deferred tax assets before they expire. The valuation allowance is based on our estimates of
taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax
assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for
a valuation allowance, we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to
take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in
the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax
provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase.

We recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first
step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining
if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position
will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes.
For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is
to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely



of being realized upon settlement. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax
positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations are based
upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law,
correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit
issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in
material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the
change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.

Total net revenue increased $111.5 million or 4% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008.
Consumer Tax segment revenue increased $67.0 million or 7% in fiscal 2009 due to 36% growth in
TurboTax Online units, which more than offset an 11% decrease in TurboTax desktop units. Payments
Solutions segment revenue increased $37.4 million or 15% in fiscal 2009 due to growth in the core
merchant services customer base and revenue from ECHO, partially offset by a decline in transaction
processing volume per customer. Employee Management Solutions segment revenue increased $27.9
million or 8% in fiscal 2009 due to the realization of the full effect of pricing changes made in
fiscal 2008. Accounting Professionals segment revenue increased $25.1 million or 8% in fiscal 2009
due to price increases and Financial Institutions revenue increased $12.5 million or 4% due to
growth in Internet banking and bill-pay end users, partially offset by a decline in revenue per end
user. Revenue in our Other Businesses segment decreased $45.1 million or 14% in fiscal 2009 and
revenue in our Financial Management Solutions segment decreased $13.3 million or 2%. We believe
that fiscal 2009 revenue in these two segments was affected by slower small business and consumer
spending. See

“Total Net Revenue by Business Segment”

later in this Item 7 for more information.

Operating income from continuing operations for fiscal 2009 increased $31.3 million or 5% compared
with fiscal 2008. The increase in operating income was due to $111.5 million in higher revenue
partially offset by $80.2 million in higher costs and expenses. In fiscal 2009 total costs and
expenses increased about $49 million due to our fiscal 2008 acquisitions of Homestead and ECHO;
about $31 million due to higher advertising and other marketing expenses to support the launch and
subsequent promotion of TurboTax 2008 and QuickBooks 2009; about $27 million due to higher
depreciation expense for investments in our infrastructure; about $20 million due to higher
share-based compensation expense; and $12.6 million due to a charge for the historical use of
certain technology licensing rights. These increases in total costs and expenses were partially
offset by decreases of about $45 million due to lower performance incentive payouts and about $33
million in compensation and benefit savings due to lower staffing levels and lower severance
related charges in fiscal 2009. See

“Cost of Revenue”

and

“Operating Expenses”

later in this Item 7
for more information.

Net income from continuing operations decreased $3.8 million or 1% in fiscal 2009 compared with
fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2008 we recorded a pre-tax gain of $51.6 million on the sale of certain
outsourced payroll assets; there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2009. See

“Dispositions
and Discontinued Operations”

later in this Item 7 for more information. In addition, interest and
other income decreased $25.0 million in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The impact of lower
interest rates more than offset the impact of higher average invested balances and resulted in
$18.5 million lower interest income. Due to certain discrete tax items, our effective tax rate for
fiscal



2009 was 31%. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was 35%. See

“Income Taxes”

later in this Item
7 for more information about our effective tax rates for these periods.

Due to the foregoing factors, diluted net income per share from continuing operations of $1.35 in
fiscal 2009 increased 2% compared with $1.33 in fiscal 2008.

Total Net Revenue by Business Segment

The table below and the discussion of total net revenue that follows it are organized in accordance
with our seven reportable business segments. See Note 15 to the financial statements in Item 8 for
descriptions of product revenue and service and other revenue for each segment.

We have reclassified segment results for all periods presented to reflect the continued evolution
of our business. We no longer combine results for our Payroll operating segment with results for
our Payments operating segment because management currently views these businesses separately. We
also changed the name of our QuickBooks segment to Financial Management Solutions, our new Payroll
segment to Employee Management Solutions, and our new Payments segment to Payments Solutions. We
transferred revenue for our Point of Sale offerings from our Financial Management Solutions segment
to our Payments Solutions segment to align this product group more closely with the customers they
serve. Total Point of Sale revenue was less than $40 million for all periods presented. We also
reclassified certain retail sales expenses from common expenses to segment income or loss,
consistent with how management now views these expenses. These expenses were less than $25 million
for all periods presented.

Financial Management Solutions (formerly known as QuickBooks)

Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008.

Financial Management Solutions total net revenue decreased
$13.3 million or 2% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Excluding revenue from Homestead,
which we acquired in December 2007, Financial Management Solutions total net revenue decreased 6%
in fiscal 2009. Total QuickBooks software unit sales, including activations of our free Simple
Start offering, were up 6% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Revenue per QuickBooks unit
was lower in fiscal 2009 due to price promotion programs in some of our sales channels. QuickBooks
Online subscriptions grew 11% and active QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions customers were up 12% in
fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008.

Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007

. Financial Management Solutions total net revenue increased
$40.9 million or 7% in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Excluding revenue from Homestead,
which we acquired in December 2007, Financial Management Solutions total net revenue increased 5%
in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Total QuickBooks software unit sales, including
activations of our free Simple Start offering, were up slightly in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal
2007. Revenue growth in fiscal 2008 was driven by a 14% increase in QuickBooks Online subscribers,
a 22% increase in the number of active QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions customers, and 8% growth in
revenue from secondary products and services sold in conjunction with QuickBooks software units.

Employee Management Solutions (formerly known as Payroll)

Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008.

Employee Management Solutions total net revenue increased
$27.9 million or 8% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due predominantly to the realization
of the full effect in fiscal 2009 of pricing changes made in fiscal 2008. PayCycle, which we
acquired in July 2009, had a negligible effect on fiscal 2009 Employee Management Solutions
revenue.

Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007.

Employee Management Solutions total net revenue decreased
$11.4 million or 3% in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 as we completed the transition of
portions of our Complete Payroll and Premier Payroll Services customer base in connection with a
sale of assets to ADP. We estimate that revenue growth in this segment in fiscal 2008 compared with
fiscal 2007 would have been approximately 9% when adjusted for the impact of the sale of those
payroll customers.

Payments Solutions

Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008.

Payments Solutions total net revenue increased $37.4 million
or 15% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Revenue in fiscal 2009 increased due to 14% growth
in our core merchant services customer base and revenue from ECHO, which we acquired in February
2008. Transaction volume per customer was down about 8% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008,
reflecting an overall reduction in consumer spending associated with the current economic
environment. Excluding revenue from ECHO, Payments Solutions segment revenue increased
approximately 8% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008.

Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007.

Payments Solutions total net revenue increased $50.2
million or 25% in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due to 18% growth in our core merchant
services customer base and revenue from ECHO, which we acquired in February 2008. We estimate that
revenue growth in our Payments Solutions segment in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 would
have been approximately 17% when adjusted for the impact of our acquisition of ECHO.

Consumer Tax

Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008.

Consumer Tax total net revenue increased $67.0 million or 7%
in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The fiscal 2009 revenue increase was due to 36% growth in
federal TurboTax Online units, which more than offset an 11% decrease in federal TurboTax desktop
units. We included federal
electronic filing services with our TurboTax desktop software for the first time in the 2008 tax
year. Net of related price increases, we estimate that this decision resulted in a reduction of
about $25 million in Consumer Tax revenue for fiscal 2009.



Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007.

Consumer Tax total net revenue increased $116.5 million or
14% in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. The fiscal 2008 revenue increase was due to 17%
growth in total federal TurboTax units, which was driven by 37% growth in TurboTax Online units.
TurboTax desktop units were flat in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007.

Accounting Professionals

Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008.

Accounting Professionals total net revenue increased $25.1
million or 8% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due to price increases.

Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007.

Accounting Professionals total net revenue increased $12.5
million or 4% in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. We discontinued our ProSeries Express
product line in fiscal 2008, which we estimate resulted in a loss of five percentage points of
growth for the Accounting Professionals segment in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007.

Financial Institutions

Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008.

Financial Institutions total net revenue increased $12.5
million or 4% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Internet banking end users increased 3% and
bill-pay end users were up 20% in fiscal 2009. Lower revenue per user partially offset growth in
the Internet banking and bill-pay customer bases.

Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007.

Financial Institutions total net revenue increased $148.2
million to $298.6 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due mainly to revenue from
Digital Insight, which we acquired in February 2007. In fiscal 2008 Internet banking end users grew
10% and bill-pay end users grew 16%.

Other Businesses

Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008.

Other Businesses total net revenue decreased $45.1 million
or 14% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Quicken sales were down 15% in fiscal 2009 due to
the overall reduction in consumer spending. In addition, the stronger U.S. dollar contributed to a
decline in Canadian revenue and revenue from our business in the UK, lowering Other Businesses
segment revenue growth by approximately seven percentage points in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal
2008.

Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007.

Other Businesses total net revenue increased $41.2 million
or 14% in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008 revenue from our businesses in
Canada and the United Kingdom increased 28%, revenue from our Intuit Real Estate Solutions business
grew 17%, and Quicken revenue was flat compared with fiscal 2007. The weaker U.S. dollar
contributed to Canadian revenue growth, accounting for approximately five percentage points of
Other Businesses segment revenue growth in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007.

Our cost of revenue has three components: (1) cost of product revenue, which includes the
direct costs of manufacturing and shipping our desktop software products; (2) cost of service and
other revenue, which reflects direct costs associated with providing services, including data
center costs related to delivering Internet-based services, and costs associated with revenue
sharing and online transactions revenue; and (3) amortization of purchased intangible assets, which
represents the cost of amortizing developed technologies that we have obtained through acquisitions
over their useful lives.

Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008.

Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue
increased slightly to 11% in fiscal 2009 from 10% in fiscal 2008 due to product mix. Cost of
service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue decreased slightly to 25% in
fiscal 2009 from 26% in fiscal 2008 due to an increase of $122.2 million in revenue from TurboTax
Online and consumer electronic tax filing services, which have relatively lower costs of service
revenue compared with our other service offerings. Partially offsetting this benefit, fiscal 2009
cost of service and other revenue included a $12.6 million charge for the historical use of certain
technology licensing rights that we acquired in May 2009.

Amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due
primarily to the amortization of Homestead and ECHO purchased intangible assets, which we acquired
in fiscal 2008.

Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007.

Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue
decreased to 10% in fiscal 2008 from 12% in fiscal 2007 due to cost efficiencies achieved for our
QuickBooks 2008 and Consumer Tax product lines. Cost of service and other revenue as a percentage
of service and other revenue increased slightly to 26% in fiscal 2008 from 25% in fiscal 2007. The
impact of our acquisition of Digital Insight, which has relatively higher costs of service revenue,
was partially offset by the impact of $105.6 million growth in revenue from TurboTax Online and
consumer electronic tax filing services, which have relatively lower costs of service revenue
compared with our other service offerings.

Amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due
primarily to the amortization of Digital Insight purchased intangible assets, which we acquired in
February 2007.

Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008.

Total operating expenses as a percentage of total net
revenue decreased to 57% in fiscal 2009 from 59% in fiscal 2008 due to $111.5 million higher
revenue partially offset by $27.6 million higher total operating expenses in fiscal 2009. Total
operating expenses in fiscal 2009 included an increase of about $32 million for the operating
expenses of acquired businesses; an increase of about $31 million for advertising and other
marketing expenses to support the launch and subsequent promotion of TurboTax 2008 and QuickBooks
2009; an increase of about $27 million due to higher depreciation expense for investments in our
infrastructure; and an
increase of about $18 million due to higher share-based compensation expense. Share-based
compensation expense was higher in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due to our broad use of
restricted stock units in addition to stock options. These increases were partially offset by
decreases of about $45 million due to lower performance



incentive payouts and about $33 million in
compensation and benefit savings due to lower staffing levels and lower severance related charges
in fiscal 2009.

Acquisition-related charges increased in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 primarily due to the
amortization of Homestead and ECHO purchased intangible assets, which we acquired in fiscal 2008.

Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007.

Total operating expenses as a percentage of total net
revenue increased to 59% in fiscal 2008 from 57% in fiscal 2007. Total operating expenses in
dollars increased about $270 million in fiscal 2008, approximately $109 million of which was due to
our acquisitions of Digital Insight, Homestead and ECHO and approximately $37 million of which was
due to higher share-based compensation expense. Share-based compensation expense was higher in
fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due to our broad use of restricted stock units in addition to
stock options. We also recorded a $23 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2008 in connection with a reallocation of resources to key growth businesses.

Including Digital Insight, Homestead, ECHO, share-based compensation expense and the restructuring
charge, about half of the increase in total operating expenses in dollars for fiscal 2008 was due
to higher research and development expenses. During this period, we continued to invest in research
and development for existing offerings as well as for new offerings. Almost 45% of the fiscal 2008
increase in total operating expenses in dollars was due to higher selling and marketing expenses.
Of the total increase in selling and marketing expenses in dollars for this period about a third
was due to our acquisition of Digital Insight, whose selling costs are relatively higher compared
with our other businesses because they sell their services to financial institutions through a
direct sales force. About 20% of the fiscal 2008 increase in selling and marketing expenses in
dollars was due to higher advertising and other marketing expenses to support our Consumer Tax
offerings. Excluding the impact of the increase in share-based compensation expense, general and
administrative expenses declined about $5 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007.

Acquisition-related charges increased in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 primarily due to the
amortization of Digital Insight purchased intangible assets, which we acquired in February 2007.

Segment Operating Income (Loss)

Segment operating income or loss is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating
expenses. Segment expenses do not include certain costs, such as corporate selling and marketing,
product development, and general and administrative expenses and share-based compensation expenses,
which are not allocated to specific segments. These unallocated costs totaled $516.8 million in
fiscal 2009, $543.0 million in fiscal 2008 and $486.4 million in fiscal 2007. Segment expenses also
do not include amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges. See
Note 15 to the financial statements in Item 8 for reconciliations of total segment operating income
to operating income from continuing operations for each fiscal year presented.

Financial Management Solutions (formerly known as QuickBooks)

Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008.

Financial Management Solutions segment operating income as a
percentage of related revenue decreased to 20% in fiscal 2009 from 29% in fiscal 2008. Financial
Management Solutions revenue was $13.3 million lower in fiscal 2009 while total costs and expenses
increased. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $41 million in fiscal 2009,
including about $13 million due to our fiscal 2008 acquisition of Homestead and about $15 million
due to higher advertising and other marketing expenses to support the launch and subsequent
promotion of QuickBooks 2009. Product development expenses increased approximately $7 million in
fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008.

Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007.

Financial Management Solutions segment operating income as
a percentage of related revenue decreased to 29% in fiscal 2008 from 31% in fiscal 2007. Financial
Management Solutions revenue grew $40.9 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007, including
revenue from Homestead. Cost of revenue increased approximately $4 million as cost efficiencies
achieved for our QuickBooks 2008 product line partially offset higher costs associated with
QuickBooks services. Including Homestead, selling and marketing expenses increased approximately
$17 million, product development expenses increased approximately $15 million and general and
administrative expenses increased approximately $5 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal
2007.

Employee Management Solutions (formerly known as Payroll)

Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008.

Employee Management Solutions segment operating income as a
percentage of related revenue increased to 57% in fiscal 2009 from 49% in fiscal 2008. Segment
revenue grew $27.9 million in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 while costs and expenses
decreased approximately $13 million due to about $22 million in lower Small Business Group common
cost allocations partially offset by about $9 million in charges for asset write-downs and
consolidation of workforces that resulted from our July 2009 acquisition of PayCycle.

Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007.

Employee Management Solutions segment operating income as a
percentage of related revenue increased to 49% in fiscal 2008 from 47% in fiscal 2007. Segment
revenue decreased $11.4 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2008 we
continued to transition certain full service payroll customers, which have relatively higher costs
of revenue, to ADP. Higher gross margins in fiscal 2008 were partially offset by higher expenses,
including an increase of approximately $6 million for product development expenses.

Payments Solutions

Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008.

Payments Solutions segment operating income as a percentage
of related revenue decreased to 11% in fiscal 2009 from 17% in fiscal 2008. Segment revenue grew
$37.4 million in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 while costs and expenses increased about $49
million. In fiscal 2009 total segment expense increased about $15 million due to our February 2008
acquisition of ECHO; about $11 million due to higher cost of revenue in the core merchant services
business; about $7 million due to higher sales and marketing expenses in the core merchant services
business; about $4 million due to higher product development expenses in the core merchant services
business; and about $4 million due to higher depreciation from infrastructure investments.

Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007.

Payments Solutions segment operating income as a percentage
of related revenue decreased to 17% in fiscal 2008 from 25% in fiscal 2007. Segment revenue
increased $50.2 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 while costs and expenses increased
about $16 million due to our February 2007 acquisition of ECHO and about $10 million for
infrastructure and lease termination costs.

Consumer Tax

Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008.

Consumer Tax segment operating income as a percentage of
related revenue was flat at 63% in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. The $67.0 million growth in
Consumer Tax revenue in fiscal
2009 was partially offset by an increase of about $16 million in advertising and other marketing
expenses to support



the launch and subsequent promotion of TurboTax 2008 and an increase of about
$7 million in research and development expenses.

Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007.

Consumer Tax segment operating income as a percentage of
related revenue increased slightly to 63% in fiscal 2008 from 62% in fiscal 2007. The $116.5
million growth in Consumer Tax revenue in fiscal 2008 was partially offset by higher expenses,
including increases of approximately $25 million for selling and marketing expenses (including
higher radio, television and online advertising expenses as well as higher direct marketing
expenses) and approximately $12 million for product development expenses. Lower cost of revenue
partially offset the increases in selling and marketing expenses and product development expenses.

Accounting Professionals

Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008.

Accounting Professionals segment operating income as a
percentage of related revenue increased to 53% in fiscal 2009 from 50% in fiscal 2008. Accounting
Professionals revenue increased $25.1 million while costs and expenses were relatively stable in
fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008.

Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007.

Accounting Professionals segment operating income as a
percentage of related revenue increased slightly to 50% in fiscal 2008 from 49% in fiscal 2007.
Accounting Professionals revenue increased $12.5 million while costs and expenses were relatively
stable in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007.

Financial Institutions

Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008.

Financial Institutions segment operating income as a
percentage of related revenue increased to 22% in fiscal 2009 from 19% in fiscal 2008. Financial
Institutions revenue increased $12.5 million while costs and expenses were relatively stable in
fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008.

Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007.

Financial Institutions segment operating income as a
percentage of related revenue decreased to 19% in fiscal 2008 from 26% in fiscal 2007. The fiscal
2008 decrease in segment operating income was due to our February 2007 acquisition of Digital
Insight, which has higher costs and expenses, including relatively higher costs of service revenue
and higher selling expenses, than the Intuit financial institutions business that existed prior to
the acquisition.

Other Businesses

Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008.

Other Businesses segment operating income as a percentage of
related revenue decreased to 23% in fiscal 2009 from 30% in fiscal 2008 due to the decrease in
segment revenue in fiscal 2009. While revenue from our businesses in Canada and the UK was lower in
fiscal 2009 by approximately $23 million due to the stronger U.S. dollar, total costs and expenses
for this segment were also lower by approximately $13 million due to the impact of foreign exchange
rates.

Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007.

Other Businesses segment operating income as a percentage
of related revenue decreased to 30% in fiscal 2008 from 33% in fiscal 2007. About a quarter of the
$41.2 million in fiscal 2008 revenue growth in this segment came from our Intuit Real Estate
Solutions business, which sells its products and services through a direct sales force and
therefore has a higher cost structure than the other businesses in this segment. While revenue from
our business in Canada was higher in fiscal 2008 due in part to the weaker U.S. dollar, total costs
and expenses for this business also increased due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. In
addition, fiscal 2008 selling and marketing expenses in our business in Canada increased in support
of our latest QuickBooks and consumer tax offerings.

Non-Operating Income and Expenses

Interest Expense

In March 2007 we issued $1 billion in senior notes. Interest expense of $51.2 million for fiscal
2009, $52.3 million for fiscal 2008 and $27.1 million for fiscal 2007 consisted primarily of
interest on $500 million in principal amount
of the senior notes at 5.40% and interest on $500 million in principal amount of the senior notes
at 5.75%. The



senior notes are due in March 2012 and March 2017 and are redeemable by Intuit at any
time, subject to a make-whole premium. See Note 9 to the financial statements in Item 8 for more
information.

Interest and other income consists primarily of interest income. The impact of lower interest rates
more than offset the impact of higher average invested balances and resulted in lower interest
income in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Lower interest rates and lower average invested
balances resulted in lower interest income in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. We record
gains and losses associated with executive deferred compensation plan assets in interest and other
income and gains and losses associated with the related liabilities in operating expense. The
amounts recorded in operating expense generally offset the amounts recorded in interest and other
income. Total interest and other income for all periods presented included royalties and fees from
trademark license and distribution agreements that we entered into when we sold our Quicken Loans
mortgage business in July 2002.

Income Taxes

Effective Tax Rate

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was approximately 31%. Excluding discrete tax benefits
primarily related to a favorable agreement we entered into with a tax authority and the retroactive
reinstatement of the federal research and experimentation credit, our effective tax rate for that
period was approximately 35% and did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of
35%. State income taxes were partially offset primarily by the benefit we received from federal and
state research and experimentation credits, the domestic production activities deduction, and tax
exempt interest income.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was 35% and did not differ significantly from the federal
statutory rate of 35%. State income taxes were offset primarily by the benefit we received from tax
exempt interest income, the domestic production activities deduction, and federal and state
research and experimentation credits.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 was 36% and did not differ significantly from the federal
statutory rate of 35%. State income taxes were partially offset by the benefit we received from tax
exempt interest income, federal and state research and experimentation credits and the domestic
production activities deduction. In addition, in fiscal 2007 we benefited from the retroactive
extension of the federal research and experimentation credit.

In January 2009 we entered into a favorable agreement with a state tax authority with respect to
certain tax years including years ended prior to fiscal 2009. As a result of this agreement, we
recorded a discrete tax benefit of $18.0 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009.

In October 2008 changes in federal tax law resulted in the reinstatement of the federal research
and experimentation credit through December 31, 2009 that was retroactive to January 1, 2008. In
December 2006 changes in federal tax law resulted in the reinstatement of the federal research and
experimentation credit through December 31, 2007 that was retroactive to January 1, 2006. We
recorded discrete tax benefits of approximately $6.9 million and $3.7 million
for the retroactive amounts related to fiscal years 2008 and 2006 during the twelve months ended
July 31, 2009 and 2007.



See Note 11 to the financial statements in Item 8 for more information about our effective tax
rates.

Tax Carryforwards

We acquired PayCycle in fiscal 2009 and ECHO and Homestead in fiscal 2008. See Note 6 to the
financial statements in Item 8. These companies had federal net operating loss carryforwards at
their respective dates of acquisition that totaled approximately $126 million. We have recorded the
tax effects of these carryforwards, which together totaled approximately $44 million, as deferred
tax assets at the respective dates of acquisition. The carryforwards do not result in an income tax
provision benefit, but they reduce income taxes payable and cash paid for income taxes as we
utilize them. At July 31, 2009, we had total federal net operating loss carryforwards of $104.0
million that will expire starting in fiscal 2019.

Net Deferred Tax Assets

At July 31, 2009, we had net deferred tax assets of $128.7 million which included a valuation
allowance of $5.7 million for certain state net operating loss carryforwards. We recorded the
valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our
deferred tax assets before they expire. While we believe our current valuation allowance is
sufficient, we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into
account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. We assess the need for an
adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. The assessment is based on our
estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the
periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. See Note 11 to the financial
statements in Item 8 for more information.

Dispositions and Discontinued Operations

During fiscal 2008 and 2007 we sold the assets and businesses described below. See Note 7 to the
financial statements in Item 8 for a more complete description of these dispositions and
discontinued operations and for a summary of the impact that discontinued operations have had on
our statements of operations for those fiscal years.

Intuit Distribution Management Solutions Discontinued Operations

In August 2007 we sold our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions (IDMS) business for
approximately $100 million in cash and recorded a net gain on disposal of $27.5 million. IDMS was
part of our Other Businesses segment. We have accounted for IDMS as a discontinued operation and
segregated its operating results from continuing operations in our statements of operations for all
periods prior to the sale. Revenue from IDMS was $1.9 million in fiscal 2008 and $52.0 million in
fiscal 2007.

Sale of Outsourced Payroll Assets

In March 2007 we sold certain assets related to our Complete Payroll and Premier Payroll Service
businesses to ADP. The final purchase price was contingent upon the number of customers that
transitioned to ADP pursuant to the purchase agreement over a period of approximately one year from
the date of sale. We recorded pre-tax gains of $51.6 million in fiscal 2008 and $31.7 million in
fiscal 2007 in our statement of operations for customers who transitioned to ADP during those
periods. We received a total purchase price of $93.6 million and recorded a total pre-tax gain of
$83.2 million from the inception of this transaction through its completion in the third quarter of
fiscal 2008. The assets were part of our Employee Management Solutions segment.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Overview

At July 31, 2009, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.3 billion, an increase of
$519.2 million from July 31, 2008 due to the factors described in

“Statements of Cash Flows”

below.
Cash, cash equivalents and
investments at July 31, 2009 included $150.9 in municipal auction rate securities. We did not
classify any of the municipal auction rate securities we held at July 31, 2008 as cash, cash
equivalents and investments. At July 31,



2009 and 2008, we also held $93.6 million and $285.3
million in municipal auction rate securities that we classified as long-term investments on our
balance sheet. See

“Auction Rate Securities”

below for more information. Our primary source of
liquidity has been cash from operations, which entails the collection of accounts receivable for
products and services. Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs,
selling and marketing activities, capital projects, acquisitions of businesses, debt service costs
and repurchases of common stock.

In March 2007 we issued five-year and ten-year senior unsecured notes totaling $1 billion in
connection with our acquisition of Digital Insight. We also have a $500 million unsecured revolving
line of credit facility that is described later in this Item 7. To date we have not borrowed under
the facility.

Auction Rate Securities

At July 31, 2009, we held a total of $244.5 million in municipal auction rate securities. Based on
the maturities of the underlying securities and the put option described below, we classified
$150.9 million of these securities as short-term investments and $93.6 million of these securities
as long-term investments on our balance sheet at that date. All of the municipal auction rate
securities we held at July 31, 2009 were rated A or better by the major credit rating agencies and
86% were collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education. These
securities are long-term debt instruments that are intended to provide liquidity through a Dutch
auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals, typically
every 35 days. Due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets, in February 2008
auctions began failing for the municipal auction rate securities we held. Regularly scheduled
auctions for these securities have generally continued to fail since that time. When these auctions
initially failed, higher interest rates for many of the securities went into effect in accordance
with the terms of the prospectus for each security. As of July 31, 2009, we had received all
interest payments in accordance with the contractual terms of these securities. During fiscal 2009
issuers redeemed at par value $40.8 million of municipal auction rate securities that we held.

In August 2008 the broker-dealers for our municipal auction rate securities announced settlements
under which they may provide liquidity solutions, or purchase, the auction rate securities held by
their institutional clients. On November 4, 2008 we accepted an offer from UBS AG (UBS), one of the
broker-dealers for our municipal auction rate securities, that gives us the option to sell UBS a
total of $140.9 million in municipal auction rate securities at par value at any time during a
two-year period beginning June 30, 2010. The offer also gives UBS the discretion to buy any or all
of these municipal auction rate securities from us at par value at any time. To date UBS has not
purchased any of these securities from us. We currently intend to exercise our option to sell UBS
all of these municipal auction rate securities at par value in accordance with the terms of the
offer within the next twelve months. We continue to have counter-party risk associated with UBS.

Based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash, we do not believe that
the reduction in liquidity of our municipal auction rate securities will have a material impact on
our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs.

Operating Activities

During fiscal 2009 we generated $812.4 million in cash from our continuing operations. This
included net income from continuing operations of $447.0 million, adjustments for depreciation and
amortization of $274.7 million, and an adjustment for share-based compensation of $132.8 million.
Depreciation expense increased in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due in part to depreciation
for a new data center that we began occupying in the second half of fiscal 2009. Share-based
compensation increased in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due to our broad use of restricted
stock units in addition to stock options.

During fiscal 2008 we generated $830.2 million in cash from our continuing operations. This
included net income from continuing operations of $477.5 million, adjustments for depreciation and
amortization of $216.5 million, and an adjustment for share-based compensation of $113.3 million.
Depreciation expense increased in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due in part to the
amortization of leasehold improvements for new office facilities that we occupied in early fiscal
2008. Amortization expense increased in the same period primarily due to our February 2007
acquisition of Digital Insight. Share-based compensation increased in fiscal 2008 compared with
fiscal 2007 due to our broad use of restricted stock units in addition to stock options.

During fiscal 2007 we generated $726.8 million in cash from our continuing operations. This
included net income from continuing operations of $441.1 million, adjustments for depreciation and
amortization of $158.6 million, and an adjustment for share-based compensation of $77.3 million.
Amortization expense increased in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to our February 2007
acquisition of Digital Insight.

Investing Activities

Investing activities used $432.4 million in cash during fiscal 2009, including $187.4 million for
the acquisition of businesses (primarily PayCycle) and intangible assets, $182.5 million for
capital expenditures and $66.7 million for



net purchases of investments. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 included investments in a new
data center which we began occupying in the second half of fiscal 2009.

Investing activities used $86.1 million in cash during fiscal 2008, including $264.5 million for
acquisitions of businesses (primarily Homestead and ECHO) and $306.1 million for capital
expenditures, partially offset by the receipt of $347.9 million from sales of investments and the
receipt of $132.0 million from the sale of our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions business
and certain outsourced payroll assets. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 included investments in
a new data center and expansion of office capacity to support the expected growth in our business.

Investing activities used $1.4 billion in cash during fiscal 2007, including $1.3 billion for the
acquisition of Digital Insight and $153.2 million for capital expenditures.

Financing Activities

We used $110.3 million in cash for financing activities during fiscal 2009, including $300.2
million for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by
$183.6 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. At July 31, 2009, we
had authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to an additional $299.8 million for
stock repurchases through May 15, 2011.

We used $586.5 million in cash for financing activities during fiscal 2008, including $800 million
for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by $196.9
million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.

Financing activities provided $733.9 million during fiscal 2007, including $1 billion from the
issuance of senior notes and $211.4 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock
plans, partially offset by the use of $506.8 million for the repurchase of common stock under our
stock repurchase programs.

Stock Repurchase Programs

Our Board of Directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of
common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. During fiscal 2009, 2008 and
2007 we repurchased 10.9 million, 27.2 million and 17.1 million shares of our common stock for
$300.2 million, $800.0 million and $506.6 million under our repurchase programs. At July 31, 2009,
we had authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to an additional $299.8 million for
stock repurchases through May 15, 2011.

Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility

On March 22, 2007 we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for a $500
million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on March 22, 2012. Advances under the
credit facility will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Citibank’s
base rate or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.18% to
0.575% based on our senior debt credit ratings. The applicable interest rate will be increased by
0.05% for any period in which the total principal amount of advances and letters of credit under
the credit facility exceeds $250 million. The agreement includes covenants that require us to
maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 and a ratio of annual EBITDA to interest
payable of not less than 3.00 to 1.00. We may use amounts borrowed under this credit facility for
general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business. To date we have
not borrowed under the credit facility. We monitor counterparty risk associated with the
institutional lenders that are providing the credit facility. We currently believe that the credit
facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it.

Acquisition of Mint Software Inc.

On September 11, 2009 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Mint Software Inc., a provider of
online personal finance management services. The cash transaction is valued at approximately
$170 million, including the assumption of Mint outstanding stock options. Mint will
become part of our Other Businesses segment. The



transaction is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. We expect the
transaction to close before the end of calendar 2009.

Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements

We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing
strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. We may decide to use cash and cash
equivalents, investments, and our revolving line of credit facility to fund such activities in the
future.

Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents,
investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal
working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments and
other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. As
discussed above in this Item 7 under

“Auction Rate Securities,”

we do not believe that the
reduction in the liquidity of our municipal auction rate securities will have a material impact on
our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

At July 31, 2009, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in
Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.

estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, if any.



Innovative Merchant Solutions Loan and Buyout Commitments

In April 2005 our wholly owned subsidiary, Innovative Merchant Solutions (IMS), became a member of
Superior Bankcard Services, LLC (SBS), a newly formed entity that acquires merchant accounts for
IMS. In connection with the formation of this entity IMS agreed to provide to SBS revolving loans
in an amount of up to $40.0 million under the terms of a credit agreement. The credit agreement
expires in July 2013, although certain events, such as a sale of SBS, could trigger earlier
termination. Amounts outstanding under the agreement at July 31, 2009 totaled $6.8 million at
interest rates of 4.3% to 5.0%. Amounts outstanding under the agreement at July 31, 2008 totaled
$8.5 million at interest rates of 6.0% to 8.5%. There are no scheduled repayments on the
outstanding loan balance. All unpaid principal amounts and the related accrued interest are due and
payable in full at the loan expiration date.

The operating agreement of SBS outlines a process for minority members and IMS to negotiate a
buyout of the minority member interests. This process began in July 2009. If the parties are not
able to reach agreement, the SBS operating agreement provides for a possible sale of SBS to a third
party.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

For a description of recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact of these
pronouncements on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, see Note 1 to the
financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



ITEM 7A

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Investment Portfolio

There has been significant deterioration and instability in the financial markets during fiscal
2009. This period of extraordinary disruption and readjustment in the financial markets exposes us
to additional investment risk. The value and liquidity of the securities in which we invest could
deteriorate rapidly and the issuers of these securities could be subject to credit rating
downgrades. In light of the current market conditions and these additional risks, we actively
monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest. We
believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in
highly-rated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments. While we believe we take
prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated
because of market circumstances that are outside our control.

Our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our
investment policy. This policy specifies that, except for direct obligations of the United States
government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market funds,
we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer. We do not hold
derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments.

See Note 10 to the financial statements in Item 8,

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources,”

in Item 7; and

“Risk Factors”

in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of market events
that have affected the liquidity of certain municipal auction rate securities that we held at July
31, 2009.

The following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt
securities as of July 31, 2009 by stated maturity. The table is classified by the original maturity
date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents, which consist primarily of money market
funds. At July 31, 2009, the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our money market
accounts was 0.57% and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments
was 1.20%.

Interest Rate Risk

Our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates.
Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and
the value of those investments. Should the Federal Reserve Target Rate increase by 25 basis points
from the level of July 31, 2009, the value of our investments would decrease by approximately $0.9
million. Should the Federal Reserve Target Rate increase by 100 basis points from the level of July
31, 2009, the value of our investments would decrease by approximately $3.6 million.

We are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our $500 million
revolving credit facility. Advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are
equal to Citibank’s base rate or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that
ranges from 0.18% to 0.575% based on our senior debt credit ratings. Consequently, our interest
expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to
borrow any amounts under the credit facility. At July 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under
the credit facility.



On March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2012 and
$500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017. Since these senior notes bear
interest at fixed rates, they are not subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates.

Impact of Foreign Currency Rate Changes

The functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are the local currencies. We
translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on
the balance sheet date. We translate their revenue, costs and expenses at the average rates of
exchange in effect during the period. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’
equity section of our balance sheets. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign
exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations.

Since we translate foreign currencies (primarily Canadian dollars, British pounds, Indian rupees
and Singapore dollars) into U.S dollars for financial reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can
have an impact on our financial results. The historical impact of currency fluctuations has
generally been immaterial. We believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is
not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their
financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies. Although the impact of currency
fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that
for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future, there can
be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future. As of
July 31, 2009 we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP,

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intuit Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intuit Inc. as of July 31, 2009 and
2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2009. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) 2. These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of Intuit Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Intuit Inc. at July 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended July 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set
forth therein.

As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, effective August 1, 2007, the
Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No 109

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), Intuit Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2009,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated September 15, 2009
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP,

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intuit Inc.

We have audited Intuit Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2009, based
on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Intuit Inc.’s management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Intuit Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of July 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the fiscal 2009 consolidated financial statements of Intuit Inc. and our
report dated September 15, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Management Solutions (IDMS) discontinued operations were not material for any period presented, we
have not segregated the cash flows of that business on these statements of cash flows. We have
presented the effect of the gain on disposal of IDMS on the statement of cash flows for the twelve
months ended July 31, 2008. See Note 7 to the financial statements.

See accompanying notes.



INTUIT INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

Intuit Inc. provides business and financial management solutions for small and medium-sized
businesses, consumers, accounting professionals and financial institutions. Our flagship products
and services, including QuickBooks, Quicken and TurboTax, simplify small business management and
payroll processing, personal finance, and tax preparation and filing. ProSeries and Lacerte are
Intuit’s tax preparation offerings for professional accountants. Our financial institutions
division, anchored by Digital Insight, provides outsourced online banking services to banks and
credit unions. Incorporated in 1984 and headquartered in Mountain View, California, we sell our
products and services primarily in the United States.

Basis of Presentation

These consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Intuit and its wholly
owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated all significant intercompany balances and transactions in
consolidation. We have reclassified certain amounts previously reported in our financial statements
to conform to the current presentation, including amounts related to discontinued operations and
reportable segments.

These consolidated financial statements also include the financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of Superior Bankcard Services, LLC (SBS), an entity formed in April 2005 that
acquires merchant accounts for our Innovative Merchant Solutions (IMS) business. IMS provides
merchant services to small businesses that include credit card, debit card and other payment
processing services. At July 31, 2009 and 2008, SBS had total assets of $10.3 million and $12.8
million. SBS had total revenue of $14.8 million, $17.6 million and $13.5 million for the twelve
months ended July 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. We are allocated 51% of the earnings and losses of this
entity and 100% of the losses in excess of the minority interest capital balances. We therefore
eliminate the portion of the SBS financial results that pertain to the minority interests on a
separate line in our statements of operations and on our balance sheets. The operating agreement of
SBS outlines a process for minority members and IMS to negotiate a buyout of the minority members’
interests. This process began in July 2009. If the parties are not able to reach agreement, the SBS
operating agreement provides for a possible sale of SBS to a third party. See Note 9.

In February 2007 we acquired Digital Insight Corporation for a total purchase price of
approximately $1.34 billion. In December 2007 we acquired Homestead Technologies Inc. for total
consideration of approximately $170 million and in February 2008 we acquired Electronic Clearing
House, Inc. for a total purchase price of approximately $131 million. In July 2009 we acquired
PayCycle, Inc. for a total purchase price of approximately $169 million. Accordingly, we have
included the results of operations for these companies in our consolidated results of operations
from their respective dates of acquisition. See Note 6.

As discussed in Note 7, in August 2007 we sold our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions (IDMS)
business. Accordingly, we have reclassified our financial statements for all periods prior to the
sales to reflect IDMS as discontinued operations. Unless noted otherwise, discussions in these
notes pertain to our continuing operations.

In May 2009 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 165, “

Subsequent Events,”

which establishes general accounting
standards and disclosure for subsequent events. We adopted SFAS 165 during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2009. In accordance with SFAS 165, we have evaluated subsequent events through the date and
time these financial statements were issued on September 15, 2009.



Seasonality

Our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Accounting Professionals offerings are highly seasonal. Some of
our other offerings are also seasonal, but to a lesser extent. Revenue from our QuickBooks software
products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters. Sales of income tax
preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from November through
April. These seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second
quarter ending January 31 and third quarter ending April 30. We typically report losses in our
first quarter ending October 31 and fourth quarter ending July 31, when revenue from our tax
businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels. In
addition, the timing and composition of new customer offerings that include both product and
service elements can materially shift revenue between quarters.

Use of Estimates

We make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
the disclosures made in the accompanying notes. For example, we use estimates in determining the
appropriate levels of reserves for product returns and rebates, the collectibility of accounts
receivable, the appropriate levels of various accruals, the amount of our worldwide tax provision
and the realizability of deferred tax assets. We also use estimates in determining the remaining
economic lives and carrying values of purchased intangible assets, property and equipment, and
other long-lived assets. In addition, we use assumptions to estimate the fair value of reporting
units, share-based compensation and illiquid municipal auction rate securities. Despite our
intention to establish accurate estimates and use reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ
from our estimates.

Revenue Recognition

We derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products, license fees, software
subscriptions, product support, hosting services, payroll services, merchant services, professional
services, transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of
these items. We recognize revenue for software products and related services in accordance with the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, “

Software
Revenue Recognition

,” as modified by SOP 98-9. For other offerings, we follow Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 104,

“Revenue Recognition

.” We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or
determinable and collectibility is probable.

In some situations, we receive advance payments from our customers. We defer revenue associated
with these advance payments and the relative fair value of undelivered elements under multiple
element arrangements until we ship the products or perform the services.

In accordance with the FASB’s Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 01-9, “

Accounting for
Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendor’s Product

,” we account
for cash consideration (such as sales incentives) that we give to our customers or resellers as a
reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless we receive a benefit that we can
identify and for which we can reasonably estimate the fair value.

Product Revenue

We recognize revenue from the sale of our packaged software products and supplies when legal title
transfers, which is generally when our customers download products from the Web, when we ship the
products or, in the case of certain agreements, when products are delivered to retailers. We sell
some of our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Quicken products on consignment to certain retailers. We
recognize revenue for these consignment transactions only when the end-user sale has occurred. For
products that are sold on a subscription basis and include periodic updates, we recognize revenue
ratably over the contractual time period. We record revenue net of our sales tax obligations.

We recognize product revenue in accordance with SFAS 48,

“Revenue Recognition When Right of Return
Exists.”

We reduce product revenue from distributors and retailers for estimated returns that are
based on historical returns experience and other factors, such as the volume and price mix of
products in the retail channel, return rates for prior releases of the product, trends in retailer
inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products (including the
competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our product). We also reduce
product revenue for the estimated redemption of rebates on certain current product sales. Our
estimated reserves for



distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates are based on distributors’
and retailers’ actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs. Our reserves
for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional
rebate program, actual sales during the promotion and historical redemption trends by product and
by type of promotional program.

Service Revenue

We recognize revenue from payroll processing and payroll tax filing services as the services are
performed, provided we have no other remaining obligations to these customers. We generally require
customers to remit payroll tax funds to us in advance of the applicable payroll due date via
electronic funds transfer. We include in total net revenue the interest earned on invested balances
resulting from timing differences between when we collect these funds from customers and when we
remit the funds to outside parties.

We offer several technical support plans and recognize support revenue over the life of the plans.
Service revenue also includes Web services such as QuickBooks Online and TurboTax Online, and
electronic tax filing services in both our Consumer Tax and Accounting Professionals segments.
Service revenue for electronic payment processing services that we provide to merchants is recorded
net of interchange fees charged by credit card associations because we do not control these fees.
Finally, service revenue includes revenue from consulting and training services, primarily in our
Intuit Real Estate Solutions business. We generally recognize revenue as these services are
performed, provided that we have no other remaining obligations to these customers and that the
services performed are not essential to the functionality of delivered products and services.

We recognize revenue from our outsourced online banking services for financial institutions, for
which we host our customers’ Internet banking and business banking applications, in two ways.
Revenue earned for upfront fees for implementation services is recognized ratably over the greater
of the initial life of the customer contract or the estimated life of the customer service
relationship, which is approximately seven years. Revenue and amounts billed for recurring monthly
services are earned as services are performed.

Other Revenue

Other revenue consists primarily of revenue from revenue-sharing arrangements with third-party
service providers. We recognize transaction fees from revenue-sharing arrangements as end-user
sales are reported to us by these partners.

Multiple Element Arrangements

We enter into certain revenue arrangements for which we are obligated to deliver multiple products
and/or services (multiple elements). For these arrangements, which generally include software
products, we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered elements based on their vendor-specific
objective evidence of fair value (VSOE). VSOE is the price charged when that element is sold
separately.

In situations where VSOE exists for all elements (delivered and undelivered), we allocate the total
revenue to be earned under the arrangement among the various elements, based on their relative fair
value. For arrangements where VSOE exists only for the undelivered elements, we defer the full fair
value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee
and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue. If VSOE does not exist for an
undelivered service element, we recognize the revenue from the entire arrangement as the services
are delivered. If VSOE does not exist for undelivered elements that are specified products or
features, we defer revenue until the earlier of the delivery of all elements or the point at which
we determine VSOE for these undelivered elements.

We recognize revenue related to the delivered products or services only if: (1) the above revenue
recognition criteria are met; (2) any undelivered products or services are not essential to the
functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) payment for the delivered products or
services is not contingent upon delivery of the remaining products or services; and (4) we have an
enforceable claim to receive the amount due in the event that we do not deliver the undelivered
products or services.



Shipping and Handling

We record the amounts we charge our customers for the shipping and handling of our software
products as product revenue and we record the related costs as cost of product revenue in our
statements of operations. Product revenue from shipping and handling was less than 2% of total
product revenue for the twelve months ended July 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Customer Service and Technical Support

We include the costs of providing customer service under paid technical support contracts on the
cost of service and other revenue line in our statements of operations. We include customer service
and free technical support costs on the sales and marketing expense line in our statements of
operations. Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing
order processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through Web sites, e-mail and other
electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance to customers. In connection with
the sale of certain products, we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to
customers. We do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products,
since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant. The technical support is
generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product
enhancements are minimal and infrequent. We accrue the estimated cost of providing this free
support upon product shipment.

Software Development Costs

We expense software development costs as we incur them until technological feasibility has been
established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general
release to customers. To date, our software has been available for general release concurrent with
the establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, we have not capitalized any
development costs. Costs we incur to enhance our existing products or after the general release of
the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research
and development costs in our statements of operations.

Internal Use Software

We capitalize costs related to computer software obtained or developed for internal use. Software
obtained for internal use has generally been enterprise-level business and finance software that we
customize to meet our specific operational needs. Software developed for internal use has generally
been used to deliver hosted services to our customers. Costs incurred in the application
development phase are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives, which are generally three
to five years.

Advertising

We expense advertising costs as we incur them. We recorded advertising expense of approximately
$141.5 million, $120.6 million and $94.9 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2009, 2008
and 2007.

Leases

We review all leases for capital or operating classification at their inception. We use our
incremental borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification and define the initial lease
term to include the construction build-out period but to exclude lease extension periods. We
conduct our operations primarily under operating leases. For leases that contain rent escalations,
we record the total rent payable during the lease term, as defined above, on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease. We record the difference between the rents paid and the straight-line
rent in a deferred rent account in other current liabilities or other long-term obligations, as
appropriate, on our balance sheets.

We record landlord allowances as deferred rent liabilities in other current liabilities or other
long-term obligations, as appropriate, on our balance sheets. We record landlord cash incentives as
operating activity on our statements of cash flows. We record other landlord allowances as non-cash
investing and financing activities on our statements of cash flows. We classify the amortization of
landlord allowances as a reduction of occupancy expense in our statements of operations.



Capitalization of Interest Expense

We capitalize interest on capital projects, including facilities build-out projects and internal
use computer software projects. Capitalization commences with the first expenditure for the project
and continues until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We
amortize capitalized interest to depreciation expense using the straight-line method over the same
lives as the related assets. Capitalized interest was less than $10 million for the twelve months
ended July 31, 2009, 2008 or 2007.

Foreign Currency

The functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are the local currencies. We
translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on
the balance sheet date. We translate their revenue, costs and expenses at the average rates of
exchange in effect during the period. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders’
equity section of our balance sheets. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign
exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations.

Income Taxes

When we prepare our financial statements, we estimate our income taxes based on the various
jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our
worldwide income tax provision. We estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary
differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes.
These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our balance
sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the
extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we
establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a
corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations.

We review the need for a valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able
to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. The valuation allowance analysis is
based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods
over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable
income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for the periods presented, we could be
required to record a valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that
we may be unable to realize. An increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact,
which could be material, on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we
record the increase.

We recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first
step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining
if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position
will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes.
For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is
to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized
upon settlement. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. We evaluate
our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations are based upon a number of
factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax
authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the
recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or
decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a
material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.

Per Share Computations

We compute basic net income or loss per share using the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. We compute diluted net income per share using the weighted average
number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.
Dilutive potential common shares consist of the shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options
and upon the vesting of restricted stock units (RSUs) under the treasury stock method. In loss
periods, basic net loss per share and diluted net loss per share are identical since the effect of
potential common shares is anti-dilutive and therefore excluded.

We include stock options with combined exercise prices, unrecognized compensation expense and tax
benefits that are less than the average market price for our common stock, and RSUs with combined
unrecognized compensation



expense and tax benefits that are less than the average market price for
our common stock, in the calculation of diluted net income per share. We exclude stock options with
combined exercise prices, unrecognized compensation expense and tax benefits that are greater than
the average market price for our common stock, and RSUs with combined unrecognized compensation
expense and tax benefits that are greater than the average market price for our common stock, from
the calculation of diluted net income per share because their effect is anti-dilutive. Under the
treasury stock method, the amount that must be paid to exercise stock options, the amount of
compensation expense for future service that we have not yet recognized for stock options and RSUs,
and the amount of tax benefits that will be recorded in additional paid-in capital when the awards
become deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.

The following table presents the composition of shares used in the computation of basic and diluted
net income per share for the periods indicated.

Cash Equivalents and Investments

We consider highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of
purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of AAA-rated money market funds
in all periods presented. Investments consist of available-for-sale investment-grade debt
securities that we carry at fair value. Investments at July 31, 2009 also consist of certain
municipal auction rate securities carried at fair value that either mature within the next year or
are subject to the put option described in Note 10. Long-term investments consist primarily of the
remaining municipal auction rate securities that we carry at fair value. Due to a decrease in
liquidity in the global credit markets, we estimate the fair values of these municipal auction rate
securities based on a discounted cash flow model that we prepare. See Note 10 for more information.
Except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the
United States government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our
holdings with any individual issuer.

We use the specific identification method to compute gains and losses on investments. We include
unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of tax, in the stockholders’ equity section of our
balance sheets. We generally classify available-for-sale debt securities as current assets based
upon our ability and intent to use any and all of these securities as necessary to satisfy the
significant short-term liquidity requirements that may arise from the highly seasonal nature of our
businesses. Because of our significant business seasonality, stock repurchase programs and
acquisition opportunities, cash flow requirements may fluctuate dramatically from quarter to
quarter and require us to use a significant amount of the investments we hold as available-for-sale
securities.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are not interest bearing. We maintain
an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. We review
our accounts receivable by aging category to identify significant customers or invoices with known
disputes or collectibility issues. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, we provide
reserves based on the age of the receivable. In determining the amount of the reserve, we make
judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations.
We also consider our historical level of credit losses and current economic trends that might
impact the level of future credit losses. When we determine that amounts are uncollectible we write
them off against the allowance.

Funds Held for Customers and Customer Fund Deposits

Funds held for customers represent cash held on behalf of our customers that is invested in cash
and cash equivalents. Customer fund deposits consist of amounts we owe on behalf of our customers,
such as direct deposit payroll funds and payroll taxes.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. We calculate
depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which
range from two to 30 years. We amortize leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over
the lesser of their estimated useful lives or remaining lease terms. We include the amortization of
assets that are recorded under capital leases in depreciation expense.

Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

Goodwill

We record goodwill when the purchase price of net tangible and intangible assets we acquire in a
business combination exceeds their fair value. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have
indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but we test them for impairment annually during our
fourth fiscal quarter and whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying
value of the asset may not be recoverable.

For goodwill, we perform a two-step impairment test. In the first step, we compare the fair value
of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Our reporting units are consistent with the
reportable segments described in Note 15. We determine the estimated fair value of each reporting
unit based on a weighted combination of income and market
approaches. Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on
the present value



of future cash flows. We use a number of assumptions in our discounted cash flow
model, including market factors specific to the business, the amount and timing of estimated future
cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates
for the business, and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows
and the time value of money. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value of each
reporting unit based on market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for comparable
publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. If the estimated fair value of the
reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not
impaired and no further analysis is required.

If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair
value of the unit, we perform the second step of the impairment test. In this step we allocate the
fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of
that unit, as if we had just acquired the reporting unit in a business combination. The excess of
the fair value of the reporting unit over the total amount allocated to the assets and liabilities
represents the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill
exceeds its implied fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. We
recorded no goodwill impairment charges for the twelve months ended July 31, 2009, 2008 or 2007.

Purchased Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

We generally record purchased intangible assets that have finite useful lives, such as purchased
technology, in connection with business combinations. We amortize the cost of purchased intangible
assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from two to nine
years. We review intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other long-lived assets
whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not
be recoverable. We estimate the fair value of assets that have finite useful lives based on the
present value of future cash flows for those assets. If the carrying value of an asset with a
finite life exceeds its estimated fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the
difference. We recorded no impairment charges for purchased intangible assets for the twelve months
ended July 31, 2009, 2008 or 2007.

Share-Based Compensation Plans

We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using a lattice binomial model and a multiple
option award approach. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record
share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. We amortize the
fair value of stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the
awards, which are generally the vesting periods. We value restricted stock units using the
intrinsic value method. We amortize the value of restricted stock units on a straight-line basis
over the restriction period. See Note 12 for a description of our share-based employee compensation
plans and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of share-based employee compensation.

Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers and Suppliers

We operate in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Significant technological
changes, shifting customer needs, the emergence of competitive products or services with new
capabilities and other factors could negatively impact our operating results.

We are also subject to risks related to changes in the values of our significant balance of
investments. Our portfolio of investments consists of investment-grade securities. Except for
direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United
States government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings
with any individual issuer.

We sell a significant portion of our products through third-party retailers and distributors. As a
result, we face risks related to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. For example, at
January 31, 2009, in the midst of the 2008 consumer tax season, amounts due from our 10 largest
retailers and distributors represented approximately 51% of total gross accounts receivable. To
appropriately manage this risk, we perform ongoing evaluations of customer credit and limit the
amount of credit extended as we deem appropriate but generally do not require collateral. We
maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have historically been within our
expectations. However, since we cannot necessarily predict future changes in the financial
stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. No
customer accounted for 10% or more of total net
revenue for the twelve months ended July 31, 2009, 2008 or 2007, nor did any customer account for
10% or more of accounts receivable at July 31, 2009 or 2008.



We rely primarily on one third-party vendor to perform the manufacturing and distribution functions
for our retail desktop software products. We also have a key single-source vendor that prints and
fulfills orders for all of our checks and most other products for our financial supplies business.
While we believe that relying heavily on key vendors improves the efficiency and reliability of our
business operations, relying on any one vendor for a significant aspect of our business can have a
significant negative impact on our revenue and profitability if that vendor fails to perform at
acceptable service levels for any reason, including financial difficulties of the vendor.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS 141 (revised 2007),

“Business Combinations”

In December 2007 the FASB issued SFAS 141 (revised 2007), “

Business Combinations.”

SFAS 141R will
significantly change the accounting for business combinations in a number of areas, including the
measurement of assets and liabilities acquired and the treatment of contingent consideration,
contingencies, acquisition costs, in-process research and development and restructuring costs. In
addition, under SFAS 141R, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income
tax uncertainties in a business combination after the measurement period will affect the income tax
provision. SFAS 141R is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or
after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2008, which
means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2009. Early adoption is
prohibited. We are in the process of evaluating this standard and therefore have not yet determined
the impact that the adoption of SFAS 141R will have on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

SFAS 160,

“Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements”

In December 2007 the FASB issued SFAS 160, “

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements,

” which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling (minority)
interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective for
business arrangements entered into in fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, which
means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2009. Early adoption is
prohibited. We are in the process of evaluating this standard and therefore have not yet determined
the impact that the adoption of SFAS 160 will have on our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

FSP SFAS 157-2,

“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”

In February 2008 the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 157-2,

“Effective Date of FASB Statement
No. 157.”

FSP SFAS 157-2 partially defers the effective date of SFAS 157 for one year for
non-financial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair
value in an entity’s financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). SFAS 157
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. In accordance with FSP SFAS 157-2, we have delayed the implementation of the
provisions of SFAS 157 related to the fair value of goodwill, other intangible assets and
non-financial long-lived assets until our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2009. We are in the
process of evaluating these portions of the standard and therefore have not yet determined the
impact that their adoption will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

FSP SFAS 142-3, “

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets”

In April 2008 the FASB issued FSP SFAS 142-3, “

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
Assets.”

FSP SFAS 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or
extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS
142, “

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

This new staff position is intended to improve the
consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142 and the period
of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS 141R

.

FSP SFAS 142-3
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, which means that it will be
effective for our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2009. We are in the process of evaluating this
staff position and
therefore have not yet determined the impact that adoption of FSP SFAS 142-3 will have on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



FSP SFAS 141R-1, “

Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business
Combination That Arise from Contingencies”

In April 2009 the FASB issued FSP SFAS 141R-1, “

Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities
Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies.”

FSP SFAS 141R-1 amends SFAS 141R
to require assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from
contingencies to be recognized at fair value, as determined in accordance with SFAS 157, if the
acquisition-date fair value can be reasonably determined. If the acquisition-date fair value cannot
be reasonably determined, then the future settlement amount would be measured in accordance with
existing accounting rules. FSP SFAS 141R-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2008, which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2009. We
are in the process of evaluating this staff position and therefore have not yet determined the
impact that adoption of FSP SFAS 141R-1 will have on our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

April 2009 FSPs on Fair Value of Financial Instruments

In April 2009 the FASB issued FSP SFAS 157-4,

“Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of
Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That
Are Not Orderly.”

FSP SFAS 157-4 amends SFAS 157 to provide additional guidance on estimating fair
value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased
in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability.

In April 2009 the FASB issued FSP SFAS 107-1 and APB 28-1, “

Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of
Financial Instruments”

(FSP SFAS 107-1). FSP SFAS 107-1 extends the disclosure requirements of SFAS
107,

“Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments”

to interim financial statements.

In April 2009 the FASB issued FSP SFAS 115-2 and SFAS 124-2,

“Recognition and Presentation of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairments”

(FSP SFAS 115-2). FSP SFAS 115-2 provides new criteria for
determining whether an impairment of a debt security is temporary and recorded in other
comprehensive income in the equity section of the balance sheet or other-than-temporary and
recorded as a loss on the statement of operations.

On May 1, 2009 we adopted FSP SFAS 157-4, FSP SFAS 107-1 and FSP SFAS 115-2. The adoption of these
standards had no significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

SFAS 168,

“The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and Hierarchy of Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles”

In June 2009 the FASB issued SFAS 168, “

The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and Hierarchy of
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.”

SFAS 168 defines the new hierarchy for U.S. GAAP and
explains how the FASB will use its Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) as the sole source for
all authoritative guidance. The Codification will be effective for all reporting periods that end
after September 15, 2009, which means it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning August 1,
2009. We expect that the adoption of this standard will have no significant impact on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

ASU 2009-05,

“Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value”

In August 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-05, “

Measuring Liabilities at
Fair Value

” (ASU 2009-05). This update provides amendments to ASC Topic 820, “

Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosure

” for the fair value measurement of liabilities when a quoted price in
an active market is not available. ASU 2009-05 is effective for reporting periods beginning after
August 28, 2009, which means that it will be effective for our second quarter beginning November 1,
2009. We are in the process of evaluating this update and therefore have not yet determined the
impact that adoption of ASU 2009-05 will have on our financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

We periodically review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is
other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation
concerns. We believe that the investments that we held at July 31, 2009 were not
other-than-temporarily impaired. While certain available-for-sale debt securities have fair values
that are below cost, we do not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not
that we will be required to sell them before recovery at par. The unrealized losses at July 31,
2009 are due to changes in interest rates, including market credit spreads, and not due to
increased credit risks associated with the specific securities.

We include realized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities in interest and
other income in our statements of operations. Gross realized gains and losses on our
available-for-sale debt securities were as follows for the periods indicated. We have realized no
gains or losses on the municipal auction rate securities described in Note 10.

Capital in progress consists primarily of costs related to internal use software projects and
facilities construction projects. The decrease in the balance of total capital in progress between
July 31, 2008 and July 31, 2009 relates primarily to construction costs for our new data center in
Washington state, which we began occupying in the second half of fiscal 2009. As discussed in Note
1, “

Software Development Costs

,” we capitalize costs related to the development of computer
software for internal use. We capitalized internal use software costs totaling $51.6 million, $44.2
million and $48.3 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. These amounts
included capitalized labor costs of $16.6 million, $16.1 million and $13.2 million in those
periods. Costs related to internal use software projects are included in the capital in progress
category of property and equipment until project completion, at which time they are transferred to
the computer software category and amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives,
which are generally three to five years.

4. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

Goodwill

As discussed in Note 1, “

Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

,” under
current accounting rules goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests.
Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment during the twelve months ended July
31, 2009 and 2008 were as shown in the following table. Our reportable segments are described in
Note 15.

The increase in goodwill in our Financial Management Solutions segment during the twelve
months ended July 31, 2008 was due to the acquisition of Homestead Technologies Inc.
The increase in goodwill in our Payments Solutions segment during that period was due to the
acquisition of Electronic Clearing House, Inc. (ECHO). The increase in goodwill in our Employee
Management Solutions segment during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009 was due to the
acquisition of PayCycle, Inc. See Note 6.

Purchased Intangible Assets

The following table shows the cost, accumulated amortization and weighted average life in years for
our purchased intangible assets at the dates indicated. The increases in the cost of purchased
intangible assets during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009 were primarily due to our
acquisitions of certain technology licensing rights and PayCycle. See Note 6 for more information
about our acquisition of PayCycle. In May 2009 we acquired certain technology licensing rights for
cash payments with a present value of $89.2 million. We determined that approximately $76.6 million
of this amount was related to future licensing rights and recorded intangible assets for that
amount. We determined that the remaining cost of $12.6 million was related to the historical use of
licensing rights and recorded that amount as a charge to cost of revenue in our statement of
operations for the twelve months ended July 31, 2009.

5. Comprehensive Net Income

We add components of other comprehensive income, such as changes in the fair value of
available-for-sale debt securities and foreign currency translation adjustments, to our net income
to arrive at comprehensive net income. Other comprehensive income items have no impact on our net
income as presented in our statements of operations.

The components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, were as follows for
the periods indicated. The realized gain on derivative instruments relates to two interest rate
swaps that we entered into in December 2006 and settled in March 2007 in connection with the senior
notes described in Note 9. We are amortizing the realized gain to interest expense over the term of
the related notes.

6. Acquisitions

PayCycle, Inc.

On July 23, 2009 we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of PayCycle, Inc.
for a total purchase price of approximately $169 million, including the fair value of certain assumed stock
options. PayCycle is a provider of online payroll solutions to small businesses and became part of
our Employee Management Solutions segment. We acquired PayCycle to expand our online payroll
offerings in support of our Connected Services strategy.

Under the purchase method of accounting we allocated the total purchase price to the tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair
values on the date of acquisition. We estimated the fair values with the assistance of a third
party appraisal firm. The fair values assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired were
based on estimates and assumptions determined by management. We recorded the excess of purchase
price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill. Using information available at the time the
acquisition closed, we allocated approximately $5 million of the purchase price to tangible assets
and liabilities and approximately $42 million of the purchase price to identified intangible
assets. We recorded the excess purchase price of approximately $122 million as goodwill, none of
which is deductible for income tax purposes. We may adjust the preliminary purchase price
allocation after obtaining more information about asset valuations and liabilities assumed. The
identified intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted average life of seven years.

We have included PayCycle’s results of operations in our consolidated results of operations from
the date of acquisition. PayCycle’s results of operations for periods prior to the date of
acquisition were not material when compared with our consolidated results of operations.

Electronic Clearing House, Inc.

On February 29, 2008 we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Electronic Clearing
House, Inc. (ECHO) for a total purchase price of approximately $131 million in cash. ECHO is a
provider of electronic payment processing services to small businesses and became part of our
Payments Solutions segment. We acquired ECHO in order to expand our merchant services capabilities.

Under the purchase method of accounting we allocated the total purchase price to the tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair
values on the date of acquisition. We estimated the fair values with the assistance of a third
party appraisal firm. The fair values assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired were
based on estimates and assumptions determined by management. We recorded the excess of purchase
price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill. Using information available at the time the
acquisition closed, we allocated approximately $6 million of the purchase price to tangible assets
and liabilities and approximately $44 million of the purchase price to identified intangible
assets. We recorded the excess purchase price of approximately $81 million as goodwill, none of
which is deductible for income tax purposes. The identified intangible assets are being amortized
over a weighted average life of eight years.

We have included ECHO’s results of operations in our consolidated results of operations from the
date of acquisition. ECHO’s results of operations for periods prior to the date of acquisition were
not material when compared with our consolidated results of operations.

Homestead Technologies Inc.

On December 18, 2007 we acquired Homestead Technologies Inc., including all of its
outstanding equity interests, for total consideration of approximately $170 million on a fully
diluted basis. The total consideration was comprised of the purchase price of $146 million (which
included the fair value of vested stock options assumed) plus the $24 million fair value of
unvested stock options and restricted stock units assumed. Homestead is a provider of Web site
design and hosting services to small businesses and became part of our Financial Management
Solutions segment. We acquired Homestead as part of our strategy to help small businesses acquire
and serve customers through the Internet.



Under the purchase method of accounting we allocated the total purchase price to the tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair
values on the date of acquisition. We estimated the fair values with the assistance of a third
party appraisal firm. The fair values assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired were
based on estimates and assumptions determined by management. We recorded the excess of purchase
price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill. Using information available at the time the
acquisition closed, we allocated approximately $14 million of the purchase price to tangible assets
and liabilities and approximately $22 million of the purchase price to identified intangible
assets. We recorded the excess purchase price of approximately $110 million as goodwill, none of
which is deductible for income tax purposes. In the third quarter of fiscal 2008 we recorded an $11
million increase to tangible assets and a corresponding decrease to goodwill. The increase in the
tangible assets was the result of a determination made after we obtained additional information
regarding the realizability of certain deferred tax assets not previously recorded. The identified
intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted average life of five years.

We have included Homestead’s results of operations in our consolidated results of operations from
the date of acquisition. Homestead’s results of operations for periods prior to the date of
acquisition were not material when compared with our consolidated results of operations.

Digital Insight Corporation

In February 2007 we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Digital Insight Corporation, a
provider of outsourced online banking services to banks and credit unions, for a total purchase
price of approximately $1.34 billion including the value of vested options assumed. The unaudited
financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations of Intuit
and Digital Insight on a pro forma basis, as though the companies had been combined as of the
beginning of the period presented. The pro forma financial information is presented for
informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been
achieved if the acquisition and the issuance of $1 billion of related senior notes (see Note 9) had
taken place at the beginning of each of the periods presented. The pro forma financial information
for all periods presented also includes adjustments to share-based compensation expense for stock
options assumed, adjustments to depreciation expense for acquired property and equipment,
amortization charges for acquired intangible assets, adjustments to interest income, and related
tax effects.

The pro forma financial information for the twelve months ended July 31, 2007 combines our results
for that period, which include the results of Digital Insight subsequent to February 6, 2007, the
date of acquisition, and the historical results for Digital Insight for the six months ended
December 31, 2006.

7. Dispositions and Discontinued Operations

Intuit Distribution Management Solutions Discontinued Operations

In August 2007 we sold our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions (IDMS) business for
approximately $100 million in cash and recorded a net gain on disposal of $27.5 million, which
included $41.8 million for goodwill. The decision to sell IDMS was a result of management’s desire
to focus resources on Intuit’s core products and services. IDMS was part of our Other Businesses
segment.

We determined that IDMS became a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. We
have therefore segregated the operating results of IDMS from continuing operations in our
statements of operations for all periods prior to the sale. Revenue from IDMS was $1.9 million in
fiscal 2008 and $52.0 million in fiscal 2007. Net loss from IDMS was $0.8 million in fiscal 2008
and $2.3 million in fiscal 2007. Because IDMS operating cash flows were not material for any period
presented, we have not segregated them from continuing operations on our statements of cash flows.
We have presented the effect of the gain on disposal of IDMS on our statement of cash flows for the
twelve months ended July 31, 2008.

Sale of Outsourced Payroll Assets

In March 2007 we sold certain assets related to our Complete Payroll and Premier Payroll Service
businesses to Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP). The final purchase price was contingent upon
the number of customers that transitioned to ADP pursuant to the purchase agreement over a period
of approximately one year from the date of sale. In the twelve months ended July 31, 2008 and 2007
we recorded pre-tax gains of $51.6 million and $31.7 million on our statement of operations for
customers who transitioned to ADP during those periods. We received a total purchase price of $93.6
million and recorded a total pre-tax gain of $83.2 million from the inception of this transaction
through its completion in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. The assets were part of our Employee
Management Solutions segment.

We have not accounted for this transaction as a discontinued operation because the operations and
cash flows of the assets could not be clearly distinguished, operationally or for financial
reporting purposes, from the rest of our outsourced payroll business.

8. Current Liabilities

Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility

On March 22, 2007 we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for a $500
million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on March 22, 2012. Advances under the
credit facility will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Citibank’s
base rate or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.18% to
0.575% based on our senior debt credit ratings. The applicable interest rate will be increased by
0.05% for any period in which the total principal amount of advances and letters of credit under
the credit facility exceeds $250 million. The agreement includes covenants that require us to
maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 and a ratio of annual EBITDA to interest
payable of not less than 3.00 to 1.00. We were in compliance with these covenants at July 31, 2009.
We may use amounts borrowed under this credit facility for general corporate purposes or for future
acquisitions or expansion of our business. To date we have not borrowed under this credit facility.

9. Long-Term Obligations and Commitments

Senior Unsecured Notes

On March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2012 and
$500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017 (together, the Notes), for a
total principal amount of $1 billion. The Notes are redeemable by Intuit at any time, subject to a
make-whole premium. The Notes include covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our
facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances. We
paid $55.8 million and $56.2 million in cash for interest on the Notes during the twelve months
ended July 31, 2009 and 2008. Based on the trading prices of the Notes at July 31, 2009 and 2008
and the interest rates we could obtain for other borrowings with similar terms at those dates, the
estimated fair value of the Notes at those dates was approximately $1,000.9 million and $964.7
million.

through July 31, 2009.

Innovative Merchant Solutions Loan and Buyout Commitments

In April 2005 our wholly owned subsidiary, Innovative Merchant Solutions (IMS), became a member of
Superior Bankcard Services, LLC (SBS), a newly formed entity that acquires merchant accounts for
IMS. Our consolidated financial statements include the financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of SBS, after elimination of all significant intercompany balances and transactions,
including amounts outstanding under the credit agreement described below. See Note 1. In connection
with the formation of this entity IMS agreed to provide to SBS revolving loans in an amount of up
to $40.0 million under the terms of a credit agreement. The credit agreement expires in July 2013,
although certain events, such as a sale of SBS, can trigger earlier termination. Amounts
outstanding under this agreement at July 31, 2009 totaled $6.8 million at interest rates of 4.3% to
5.0%. Amounts outstanding under this agreement at July 31, 2008 totaled $8.5 million at interest
rates of 6.0% to 8.5%. There are no scheduled repayments on the outstanding loan balance. All
unpaid principal amounts and the related accrued interest are due and payable in full at the loan
expiration date.

The operating agreement of SBS outlines a process for minority members and IMS to negotiate a
buyout of the minority members’ interests. This process began in July 2009. If the parties are not
able to reach agreement, the SBS operating agreement provides for a possible sale of SBS to a third
party.



Operating Leases

We lease office facilities and equipment under various operating lease agreements. Our facilities
leases generally provide for periodic rent increases and many contain escalation clauses and
renewal options. Certain leases require us to pay property taxes, insurance and routine
maintenance. Annual minimum commitments under all of these leases are shown in the table below.

Purchase Obligations

At July 31, 2009, we had unconditional purchase obligations of approximately $78.7 million. These
unconditional purchase obligations represent agreements to purchase products and services that are
enforceable, legally binding, and specify terms that include fixed or minimum quantities to be
purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payments.
The largest of these commitments totaled $42.4 million and relates to future outsourced payment
fulfillment and bill management services to financial institutions that contract with our Digital
Insight business for Internet banking services. This commitment expires in October 2011.

10. Fair Value Measurements

On August 1, 2008 we adopted SFAS 157,

“Fair Value Measurements,”

for financial assets and
financial liabilities and for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities that we recognize
or disclose at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually). As of the date of adoption,
these consisted of cash equivalents, available-for-sale debt securities and long-term debt. In
accordance with FSP 157-2, “

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157,

” we have not yet adopted the
provisions of SFAS 157 that relate to non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities that we do
not recognize or disclose at fair value on a recurring basis. These include reporting units
measured at fair value in a goodwill impairment test and non-financial assets acquired and
liabilities assumed in a business combination.

SFAS 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid
to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset
or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. SFAS
157 establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure that is based on the extent and level of
judgment used to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities.

•

Level 1

uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities. Our Level 1 assets consist of cash equivalents, including funds held
for customers, that are invested primarily in AAA-rated money market funds.

•

Level 2

uses inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are either
directly or indirectly observable through correlation with market data. These include
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets
that are not active; and inputs to valuation models or other pricing methodologies that do
not require significant judgment



because the inputs used in the model, such as interest
rates and volatility, can be corroborated by readily observable market data. Our Level 2
assets consist of municipal bonds, U.S. agency securities and corporate notes that we
classify as available-for-sale securities. Our Level 2 liabilities consist of long-term
debt that is model priced by third parties using observable inputs.

•

Level 3

uses one or more significant inputs that are unobservable and supported by
little or no market activity, and that reflect the use of significant management judgment.
Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined
using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques,
and significant management judgment or estimation. Our Level 3 assets consist of municipal
auction rate securities.

The following table presents financial assets and financial liabilities that we measured at fair
value on a recurring basis at July 31, 2009. We have classified these assets and liabilities in
accordance with the fair value hierarchy set forth in SFAS 157. In instances where the inputs used
to measure the fair value of an asset or liability fall into more than one level of the fair value
hierarchy, we have classified them based on the lowest level input that is significant to the
determination of the fair value.

Financial assets whose fair values we measure using Level 3 inputs consisted of municipal auction
rate securities. We classified $150.9 million of these securities as short-term investments and
$93.6 million as long-term investments on our balance sheet at July 31, 2009. At that date all of
the municipal auction rate securities we held were rated A or better by the major credit rating
agencies and 86% were collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of
Education. These securities are long-term debt instruments that are intended to provide liquidity
through a Dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined
intervals, typically every 35 days. Due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets, in
February 2008 auctions began failing for the municipal auction rate securities we held. Regularly
scheduled auctions for these securities have generally continued to fail since that time. When
these auctions initially failed, higher interest rates for many of the securities went into effect
in accordance with the terms of the prospectus for each security. As of July 31, 2009, we had
received all interest payments in accordance with the contractual terms of these securities.

We estimated the fair values of the municipal auction rate securities we held at July 31, 2009
based on a discounted cash flow model that we prepared. Key inputs to our discounted cash flow
model included the projected future interest rates; the likely timing of principal repayments; the
probability of full repayment considering guarantees by the U.S. Department of Education of the
underlying student loans or insurance by other third parties; publicly available pricing data for
recently issued student loan backed securities that are not subject to auctions; and the impact of
the reduced liquidity for auction rate securities. The following table presents information about
significant inputs to our discounted cash flow model at the dates shown:

Using our discounted cash flow model we determined that the fair values of the municipal auction
rate securities we held at July 31, 2009 were approximately equal to their par values. As a result,
we recorded no decrease in the fair values of those securities for the twelve months then ended. We
do not intend to sell our municipal auction rate securities and it is not more likely than not that
we will be required to sell them before recovery at par. Based on the maturities of the underlying
securities and the put option described below, we classified $150.9 million of these securities as
short-term investments and $93.6 million as long-term investments on our balance sheet at July 31,
2009.

In August 2008 the broker-dealers for our municipal auction rate securities announced settlements
under which they may provide liquidity solutions, or purchase, the auction rate securities held by
their institutional clients. On November 4, 2008 we accepted an offer from UBS AG (UBS), one of the
broker-dealers for our municipal auction rate securities, that gives us the option to sell UBS a
total of $140.9 million in municipal auction rate securities at par value at any time during a
two-year period beginning June 30, 2010. The put option also gives UBS the discretion to buy any or
all of these securities from us at par value at any time. To date UBS has not purchased any of
these securities from us. We chose not to elect the fair value option under SFAS 159 for the put
option at the time we accepted the UBS offer. We accounted for the put option at its cost of zero
on November 4, 2008, the date that we entered into the agreement, because we considered the value
of the securities subject to the put option to be substantially equal to their par values at that
date. The put option is considered to be a separate and freestanding financial instrument between
UBS and Intuit because it is non-transferable and could not be attached to the related auction rate
securities if they were to be sold to a third party. Since the put option is freestanding, we did
not consider the option when estimating the fair value of the UBS auction rate securities we held
at July 31, 2009. We currently intend to exercise our option to sell UBS all of these municipal
auction rate securities at par value in accordance with the terms of the offer within the next
twelve months.

Based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash, we do not believe that
the reduction in liquidity of our municipal auction rate securities will have a material impact on
our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs.

In January 2009 we entered into a favorable agreement with a state tax authority with respect to
certain tax years including years ended prior to fiscal 2009. As a result of this agreement, we
recorded a discrete tax benefit of $18.0 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009.

In October 2008 changes in federal tax law resulted in the reinstatement of the federal research
and experimentation credit through December 31, 2009 that was retroactive to January 1, 2008. In
December 2006 changes in federal tax law resulted in the reinstatement of the federal research and
experimentation credit through December 31, 2007 that was retroactive to January 1, 2006. We
recorded discrete tax benefits of approximately $6.9 million and $3.7 million for the retroactive
amounts related to fiscal years 2008 and 2006 during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009 and
2007.

Excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises are credited to stockholders’ equity.
The reductions of income taxes payable resulting from the exercise of employee stock options and
other employee stock programs that were credited to stockholders’ equity were approximately $18.5
million, $38.2 million and $56.1 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

We have provided a valuation allowance related to the benefits of certain state net operating loss
carryforwards that we believe are unlikely to be realized. The valuation allowance increased by
$5.7 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009. The increase was due primarily to the
impact of California legislation which was enacted during fiscal 2009 and is effective for fiscal
2012. The legislation reduced expected sources of future California taxable income during the
carryforward periods of such losses.

We acquired PayCycle, Inc. in fiscal 2009 and Electronic Clearing House, Inc. and Homestead
Technologies Inc. in fiscal 2008. These companies had federal net operating loss carryforwards at
their respective dates of acquisition that totaled approximately $126 million. The tax effects of
these federal net operating loss carryforwards totaled approximately $44 million. We recorded the
tax effects of these carryforwards as deferred tax assets at the respective dates of acquisition.
These carryforwards do not result in an income tax provision benefit, but they reduce income taxes
payable and cash paid for income taxes as we utilize them.

At July 31, 2009, we had total federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $104
million that will expire starting in fiscal 2019. Utilization of the net operating losses is
subject to annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating
losses before utilization.

At July 31, 2009, we had various state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for which we
have recorded a deferred tax asset of $8.1 million and a valuation allowance of $5.7 million. The
state net operating losses will



expire starting in fiscal 2014. Utilization of the net operating
losses is subject to annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net
operating losses before utilization.

Gross unrecognized tax benefits, ending balance

$

$

44,843

The total amount of our unrecognized tax benefits at July 31, 2009 was $40.2 million. Net of
related deferred tax assets, unrecognized tax benefits were $33.4 million at that date. If we were
to recognize these net benefits, our income tax expense would reflect a favorable net impact of
$27.9 million and stockholders’ equity would increase $5.5 million. We do not believe that it is
reasonably possible that there will be a significant increase or decrease in unrecognized tax
benefits over the next 12 months.

We file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax returns. Our major tax jurisdictions are U.S.
federal and the State of California. For U.S. federal tax returns we are generally no longer
subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal 2005. For California tax returns we are
generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal 2003.

We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for
income taxes. At July 31, 2009, we had accrued $2.8 million for the payment of interest and $2.5
million for the payment of penalties. At July 31, 2008, we had accrued $4.9 million for the payment
of interest and had no accruals for the payment of penalties. The amounts of interest and penalties
recognized during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009 and 2008 were not significant.



12. Stockholders’ Equity

Stock Repurchase Programs

Intuit’s Board of Directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of
common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. Under these programs, we
repurchased 10.9 million shares of our common stock for $300.2 million during the twelve months
ended July 31, 2009; 27.2 million shares of our common stock for $800.0 million during the twelve
months ended July 31, 2008; and 17.1 million shares of our common stock for $506.6 million during
the twelve months ended July 31, 2007. At July 31, 2009, we had authorization from our Board of
Directors to expend up to an additional $299.8 million for stock repurchases through May 15, 2011.

Repurchased shares of our common stock are held as treasury shares until they are reissued or
retired. When we reissue treasury stock, if the proceeds from the sale are more than the average
price we paid to acquire the shares we record an increase in additional paid-in capital.
Conversely, if the proceeds from the sale are less than the average price we paid to acquire the
shares, we record a decrease in additional paid-in capital to the extent of increases previously
recorded for similar transactions and a decrease in retained earnings for any remaining amount.

Description of 2005 Equity Incentive Plan

Our stockholders approved our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan on December 9, 2004. Under the 2005 Plan,
we are permitted to grant incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards,
restricted stock units (RSUs), stock appreciation rights and stock bonus awards to our employees,
non-employee directors and consultants. The 2005 Plan provides for the automatic grant of stock
options to non-employee directors according to a formula in the plan document. For other awards,
the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors or its
delegates determine who will receive grants, when those grants will be exercisable, their exercise
price and other terms. Our stockholders have approved amendments to the 2005 Plan to permit the
issuance of up to 56,000,000 shares under the 2005 Plan. At July 31, 2009, there were 8,086,217
shares available for grant under this plan. Up to 50% of equity awards granted each year under the
2005 Plan may have an exercise or purchase price per share that is less than full fair market value
on the date of grant. All stock options granted to date under the 2005 Plan have exercise prices
equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant. All RSUs are considered to be
granted at less than the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant because they have no
exercise price. Stock options granted under the 2005 Plan typically vest over three years based on
continued service and have a seven year term. RSUs granted under the 2005 Plan typically vest over
three years.

Description of Employee Stock Purchase Plan

On November 26, 1996 our stockholders adopted our Employee Stock Purchase Plan under Section 423 of
the Internal Revenue Code. The ESPP permits our eligible employees to make payroll deductions to
purchase our stock on regularly scheduled purchase dates at a discount. Our stockholders have
approved amendments to the ESPP to permit the issuance of up to 13,800,000 shares under the ESPP,
which expires on July 27, 2015. The length of the offering periods under the ESPP is three months
and shares are purchased at 85% of the lower of the closing price for Intuit common stock on the
first day or the last day of the offering period in which the employee is participating.

Under the ESPP, employees purchased 1,368,005 shares of Intuit common stock during the twelve
months ended July 31, 2009;1,164,977 shares during the twelve months ended July 31, 2008; and
1,099,757 shares during the twelve months ended July 31, 2007. At July 31, 2009, there were 741,355
shares available for issuance under this plan.

Determining Fair Value

Valuation and Amortization Method.

We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using a
lattice binomial model and a multiple option award approach. Our stock options have various
restrictions, including vesting provisions and restrictions on transfer, and are often exercised
prior to their contractual maturity. We believe that lattice binomial models are more capable of
incorporating the features of our stock options than closed-form models such as the Black Scholes
model. The use of a lattice binomial model requires the use of extensive actual employee exercise
behavior and a number of complex assumptions including the expected volatility of our stock price
over the term of the options, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. We amortize the fair
value of options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which
are generally the vesting periods. We value restricted stock units using the intrinsic value
method. We amortize the value of restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the
restriction period.

Expected Term

. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that they are
expected to be outstanding and is a derived output of the lattice binomial model. The expected term
of stock options is impacted by all of the underlying assumptions and calibration of our model. The
lattice binomial model assumes that option exercise behavior is a function of the option’s
remaining vested life and the extent to which the market price of our common stock exceeds the
option exercise price. The lattice binomial model estimates the probability of exercise as a
function of these two variables based on the history of exercises and cancellations on all past
option grants made by us.

Expected Volatility

. We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on
the implied volatility of one-year and two-year publicly traded options on our common stock. Our
decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on
our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock
price trends than historical volatility.

Risk-Free Interest Rate.

We base the risk-free interest rate that we use in our option valuation
model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity U.S. Treasury
issues with equivalent remaining terms.



Dividends.

We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate
paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend
yield of zero in our option valuation model.

Forfeitures.

We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent
periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate
pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards
that are expected to vest.

We used the following assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock options granted and shares
purchased under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan for the periods indicated:

We define in-the-money options at July 31, 2009 as options that had exercise prices that were
lower than the $29.70 market price of our common stock at that date. The aggregate intrinsic value
of options outstanding at July 31, 2009 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price
of the underlying options and the market price of our common stock for the shares that were
in-the-money at that date. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the twelve
months ended July 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $79.4 million, $96.9 million and $154.5 million,
determined as of the date of exercise.

We recorded $62.7 million, $57.4 million and $50.9 million in share-based compensation expense for
stock options and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan in continuing operations for the twelve months
ended July 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. The total tax benefit related to this share-based compensation
expense for those periods was $21.5 million, $20.2 million and $17.9 million.

At July 31, 2009, there was $108.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested
stock options which we will amortize to expense in the future. Unrecognized compensation cost will
be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures. We expect to recognize that cost over a
weighted average vesting period of 2.3 years.

We received $169.3 million, $176.3 million and $185.7 million in cash from option exercises under
all share-based payment arrangements for the twelve months ended July 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. The
actual tax benefits that we realized related to tax deductions for non-qualified option exercises
and disqualifying dispositions under all share-based payment arrangements totaled $32.0 million,
$38.3 million and $58.7 million for those periods.

Due to our ongoing program of repurchasing our common stock on the open market, at July 31, 2009 we
had 107.3 million treasury shares. We satisfy option exercises and RSU vesting from this pool of
treasury shares.

and $25.4 million in share-based compensation expense for RSUs in continuing operations for the
twelve months ended July 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. The total tax benefit related to this RSU
compensation expense was $25.9 million, $24.7 million and $6.4 million for those periods.

At July 31, 2009, there was $131.9 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested
RSUs which we will amortize to expense in the future. Unrecognized compensation cost will be
adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures. We expect to recognize that cost over a
weighted average vesting period of 1.8 years.

The actual tax benefits that we realized for tax deductions for RSUs during the twelve months ended
July 31, 2009 and 2008 totaled $14.5 million and $3.1 million. The actual tax benefits that we
realized for tax deductions for RSUs during the twelve months ended July 31, 2007 were nominal.

13. Benefit Plans

Executive Deferred Compensation Plan

In December 2004 we adopted our 2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, which became effective
January 1, 2005. We adopted the 2005 Plan to meet the requirements for deferred compensation under
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan provides that executives who meet minimum
compensation requirements are eligible to defer up to 75% of their salaries, bonuses and
commissions. We have agreed to credit the participants’ contributions with earnings that reflect
the performance of certain independent investment funds. We may also make discretionary employer
contributions to participant accounts in certain circumstances. The timing, amounts and vesting
schedules of employer contributions are at the sole discretion of the Compensation and
Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors or its delegate. The benefits under
this plan are unsecured.
Participants are generally eligible to receive payment of their vested benefit at the end of their
elected deferral



period or after termination of their employment with Intuit for any reason or at a
later date to comply with the restrictions of Section 409A. Discretionary company contributions and
the related earnings vest completely upon the participant’s disability, death or a change of
control of Intuit. We made employer contributions to the plan of less than $1 million during the
twelve months ended July 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

We held assets of $38.5 million and liabilities of $36.7 million related to this plan at July 31,
2009. We held assets of $37.4 million and liabilities of $38.2 million related to this plan at July
31, 2008. Assets related to this plan are in other long-term assets and liabilities related to this
plan are in other current liabilities on our balance sheets. The plan liabilities include accrued
employer contributions not yet funded to the plan.

401(k) Plan

Employees who participate in the Intuit Inc. 401(k) Plan may contribute up to 20% of pre-tax salary
to the plan, subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The plan allows Intuit to
make matching contributions. During the twelve months ended July 31, 2009 we matched employee
contributions at 150% for the first $1,000 of salary contributed by the employee, plus up to 75% of
the next six percent of salary, subject to IRS limitations, up to a maximum matching contribution
of $10,000. Fifty percent of matching contributions vest after two years of service by the employee
and 100% of matching contributions vest after three years of service. Participating employees who
are age 50 or older may also make catch-up contributions, which are not matched. Matching
contributions were $34.7 million, $34.2 million and $27.5 million for the twelve months ended July
31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

14. Litigation

Intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened
litigation, that arise in the normal course of our business, including assertions that we may be
infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others. We currently believe that the
ultimate amount of liability, if any, for any pending claims of any type (either alone or combined)
will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The
ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, litigation can have an
adverse impact on Intuit because of defense costs, negative publicity, diversion of management
resources and other factors. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation
arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business.

15. Industry Segment and Geographic Information

We have defined seven reportable segments, described below, based on factors such as how we manage
our operations and how our chief operating decision maker views results. We define the chief
operating decision maker as our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Our chief
operating decision maker organizes and manages our business primarily on the basis of product and
service offerings. We have reclassified segment results for all periods presented to reflect the
continued evolution of our business. We no longer combine results for our Payroll operating segment
with results for our Payments operating segment because our chief operating decision maker
currently views these businesses separately. We also changed the name of our QuickBooks segment to
Financial Management Solutions, our new Payroll segment to Employee Management Solutions, and our
new Payments segment to Payments Solutions.

Financial Management Solutions product revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks desktop
software products and financial supplies such as paper checks, envelopes, invoices, business cards
and business stationery. Financial Management Solutions service and other revenue is derived
primarily from QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks support plans, Web site design and hosting services
for small businesses, and royalties from small business online services.

Employee Management Solutions product revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks Payroll, a
family of products sold on a subscription basis offering payroll tax tables, federal and state
payroll tax forms, and electronic tax payment and filing to small businesses that prepare their own
payrolls. Employee Management Solutions service



and other revenue is derived from small business payroll services. Service and other revenue for
this segment also includes interest earned on funds held for customers.

Payments Solutions service revenue is derived primarily from merchant services for small businesses
that include credit card, debit card and gift card processing services; check verification, check
guarantee and electronic check conversion, including automated clearing house (ACH) and Check21
capabilities; and Web-based transaction processing services for online merchants. Service and other
revenue for this segment also includes interest earned on funds held for customers.

Consumer Tax product revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax federal and state consumer and
small business desktop tax return preparation software. Consumer Tax service and other revenue is
derived primarily from TurboTax Online tax return preparation services and electronic tax filing
services.

Accounting Professionals product revenue is derived primarily from ProSeries and Lacerte
professional tax preparation software products and from QuickBooks Premier Accountant Edition and
ProAdvisor Program for professional accountants. Accounting Professionals service and other revenue
is derived primarily from electronic tax filing services, bank product transmission services and
training services.

Financial Institutions service and other revenue is derived primarily from outsourced online
banking software products that are hosted in our data centers and delivered as on-demand service
offerings to banks and credit unions by our Digital Insight business.

Other Businesses consist primarily of Quicken, Intuit Real Estate Solutions (IRES), and our
business in Canada. Quicken product revenue is derived primarily from Quicken desktop software
products. Quicken service and other revenue is derived primarily from Quicken Online and fees from
consumer online transactions. IRES product revenue is derived primarily from property management
software licenses. Service and other revenue in our IRES business consists primarily of revenue
from support plans, hosting services and professional services. In Canada, product revenue is
derived primarily from localized versions of QuickBooks and Quicken as well as consumer desktop tax
return preparation software and professional tax preparation products. Service and other revenue in
Canada consists primarily of revenue from payroll services and QuickBooks support plans.

Our Financial Management Solutions, Employee Management Solutions, Payments Solutions, Consumer
Tax, Accounting Professionals and Financial Institutions segments operate primarily in the United
States. All of our segments sell primarily to customers located in the United States. International
total net revenue was less than 5% of consolidated total net revenue for all periods presented.

We include expenses such as corporate selling and marketing, product development, and general and
administrative expenses and share-based compensation expenses that are not allocated to specific
segments in unallocated corporate items. Unallocated corporate items also include amortization of
purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges.

The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary
of significant accounting policies in Note 1. Except for goodwill and purchased intangible assets,
we do not generally track assets by reportable segment and, consequently, we do not disclose total
assets by reportable segment. See Note 4 for goodwill by reportable segment.



The following tables show our financial results by reportable segment for the twelve months ended
July 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. We have reclassified segment results for all periods presented to
reflect the continued evolution of our business. In addition to the changes to the segments
discussed above, we transferred revenue for our Point of Sale offerings from our Financial
Management Solutions segment to our Payments Solutions segment to align this product group more
closely with the customers they serve. Point of Sale revenue was less than $40 million for all
periods presented. We also reclassified certain retail sales expenses from common expenses to
segment income or loss, consistent with how our chief operating decision maker now views these
expenses. These expenses were less than $25 million for all periods presented.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures, Intuit’s Chief
Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) have concluded that as of the end of the
period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K our disclosure controls and procedures as defined
under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) were effective to provide reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission
and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2009 based on the guidelines established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of this evaluation, our management has concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July 31, 2009 to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. We reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the Audit Committee
of Intuit’s Board of Directors.

Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, independently assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2009. Ernst & Young
has issued an attestation report concurring with management’s assessment, which is included in Part
II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

During our most recent fiscal quarter, there has not occurred any change in our internal control
over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
