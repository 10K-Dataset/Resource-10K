BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Intuit’s Mission: Revolutionizing
Financial and Business Management

Our mission is to revolutionize how people manage
their financial lives, and how small businesses and accounting
professionals manage their businesses. Our goal is to create
changes so profound customers wouldn’t dream of going back
to their old ways of keeping their books, doing their taxes or
managing their personal finances. Intuit is a leading provider
of small business, tax preparation and personal finance software
products and services that simplify complex financial tasks for
small businesses, consumers and accounting professionals. Our
principal products and services include: small business
accounting and business management solutions, including our
QuickBooks® line of products and services as well as our
Intuit® line of industry-specific business management
solutions; TurboTax® consumer tax products and services;
ProSeries® and Lacerte® professional tax products and
services; and Quicken® personal finance products and
services. Details about our products and services are provided
in “Products and Services,” below.



Company Growth Strategy

Intuit has a tradition of successful
customer-driven innovation, using technology to address complex
customer problems and develop solutions to make things easier.
By applying strategic and operational rigor to this foundation,
we believe we can accelerate our customer-driven innovation, and
deliver stronger revenue and profit growth.

There are three key fundamentals that support our
growth strategy:

•

We deliberately choose to be in businesses where
    we have, or we believe we can achieve, the strategic and durable
    advantage to produce long-term profitable growth.

•

Within these businesses, we create new growth by
    identifying large, underserved portions of the market, and
    delivering customer-driven, innovative solutions to address
    these unmet customer needs.

•

By applying strategic and operational rigor, we
    can execute well to capitalize on these multiple, large growth
    opportunities.

By being both disciplined and innovative, we can
improve execution and deliver more — for example, by
tightening development cycles, we can introduce more products
faster. The new products drive stronger growth and give
customers a broader range of offerings to best meet their needs.

“Right for Me” Product
Strategy

We strive to deliver a range of products and
services that can provide a compelling, “Right for Me”
customer proposition for a wide range of customers with
differing needs. Specifically, in September 2001, we announced
our “Right for My Business” strategy to better address
the small business management market opportunity and to expand
our target customer segment to include larger small businesses
with up to 250 employees. Our goal is to offer the right
solution for each small business in our targeted markets. We
have two primary methods of providing products and services that
address the varying needs of different types of small
businesses: solutions that are expansions of, or that integrate
with, our QuickBooks line of small business products; and
standalone business management solutions that operate
independently of our current QuickBooks products. Here are the
key elements of our Right for My Business strategy:



organizations, universities and government
    agencies; commercial and residential property managers; and
    wholesale durable goods distributors.

Our Right for Me strategy is also reshaping our
tax and personal finance businesses. In fiscal 2002, we took the
first steps in a multi-year implementation of our Right for Me
strategy in these areas, when we launched a higher-end consumer
tax product, TurboTax Premier, to address the unique needs of
investors and rental property owners. The implementation of this
strategy is continuing in fiscal 2003, starting with the August
2002 launch of Quicken Premier, which offers more robust
investment and tax planning tools. In September 2002, we
announced plans to provide three new versions of TurboTax in
fiscal 2003 — TurboTax Retirement Planning Edition,
TurboTax Investor Edition, and TurboTax en Español.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

Intuit offers products and services in seven
business segments: Small Business, Employer Services, Consumer
Tax, Professional Accounting Solutions, Personal Finance, Global
Business and Small Business Verticals and Other. Our primary
products and services are described below. In fiscal 2002 we
combined the operations of our Small Business and Personal
Finance divisions to leverage their business and operational
synergies, but we continue to view the results of the businesses
separately for reporting purposes. For financial information
about these businesses, see “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” and Note 14 of the financial statements. For a
description of principal risks associated with these businesses,
see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Risks that Could
Affect Future Results.” We sold our Quicken Loans mortgage
business in July 2002. We accounted for Quicken Loans as a
discontinued operation and, as a result, it is not discussed
below. See Note 11 of the financial statements.

Small Business

QuickBooks Software and
Services.

Our QuickBooks product line
brings extensive bookkeeping capabilities, as well as business
management tools, to small business users in an easy-to-use
design that does not require customers to be familiar with
debit/credit accounting. We offer a range of products to suit
the needs of different types of small businesses, including
QuickBooks Basic, which provides accounting functionality
suitable for smaller, less complex businesses; QuickBooks Pro,
which supports up to five multiple simultaneous users;
QuickBooks Premier, for small businesses needing more advanced
accounting functionality; QuickBooks Premier: Accountant
Edition, customized for accounting professionals with multiple
QuickBooks clients; QuickBooks Point of Sale, which is designed
for retail businesses; and QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions
Business Management Software, for businesses with up to
250 employees. As part of our Right for My Business
strategy, we expect to launch a number of additional versions of
QuickBooks during fiscal 2003 and beyond. Our more recent
QuickBooks products offer a variety of optional business
management services for an additional fee, including QuickBooks
Online Billing, which allows small businesses to bill and
receive customer payments electronically; QuickBooks Merchant
Account Service, which enables small businesses to accept credit
card payments from their customers; and QuickBooks Credit Check
Services, which gives small businesses access to credit reports
designed specifically for small businesses. We also offer a
variety of technical support plans to our QuickBooks customers
through QuickBooks Service Solutions. Customers have a choice of
different support plans at different prices depending on the
response time they require.

Financial Supplies.

We offer a range of financial supplies, such as paper checks,
envelopes, invoices, deposit slips, stationery, business cards
and holiday greeting cards, designed for small businesses and
individuals. We also offer tax forms, tax return presentation
folders and other similar items for professional tax preparers.
Our customers can personalize many products to incorporate their
logos and use a variety of color, font and design options.

Information Technology Management Solutions.

In September 2002 we completed the
acquisition of Blue Ocean Software, Inc., a leading provider of
software solutions that help businesses manage their information
technology resources and assets. Functionality includes PC
inventory management, incident



tracking, knowledge base resolution tools,
software delivery and asset tracking. The acquisition is a
significant step in our effort to expand our business solutions
beyond accounting.

Employer Services

Our Employer Services business provides solutions
to help small business owners better manage key tasks relating
to their employees. Our current Employer Services offerings
consist primarily of payroll solutions, and we currently provide
three different payroll offerings. Our QuickBooks Do-It-Yourself
Payroll (formerly Basic Payroll) consists of current payroll tax
tables that are provided on a subscription basis to small
businesses that need current tables to prepare their own
payrolls. Our QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service (formerly
Deluxe Payroll) is an online payroll service that handles the
back-end aspects of payroll processing, including tax payments
and filings. It is integrated with QuickBooks, which minimizes
customer data entry. Our Intuit Payroll Services —
Complete Payroll provides traditional, full service payroll
processing, tax payment and check delivery services. It
encompasses our former Premier Payroll Service, as well as CBS
Payroll, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002.
The acquisition of CBS Payroll significantly enhances our
ability to expand and acquire customers for our full-service
payroll offering. In September 2002, we announced plans to
provide integration between our Complete Payroll service and
QuickBooks, which we believe will offer a more attractive
full-service payroll solution for QuickBooks customers.

Consumer Tax

Desktop Consumer Tax
Software.

Our TurboTax desktop
products are designed to enable individuals and small business
owners to prepare their own federal and state personal and
business income tax returns easily, quickly and accurately. Our
consumer tax products are designed to be easy to use, yet
sophisticated enough for complicated tax returns. We offer basic
and deluxe versions of the product, and in fiscal 2002, we
introduced TurboTax Premier, which addresses the unique tax
needs of investors and rental property owners. Our innovative
Instant Data Entry feature enables taxpayers to import data
directly into their tax returns from Form W-2s (wages),
Form 1098s (mortgage interest) and Form 1099s (interest,
dividends and stock transactions) from more than 45
participating financial institutions and payroll service
companies. This feature saves significant time and increases
accuracy.

Web-Based Consumer Tax Preparation and
Electronic Filing Services.

TurboTax
for the Web is an interactive tax preparation service that
enables individual taxpayers to prepare their federal and state
income tax returns entirely online. This service allows us to
reach a different segment of consumer tax customers than those
who use our desktop products; a significant number of TurboTax
for the Web customers in fiscal 2000 through fiscal 2002 had not
used tax preparation software before. We offer basic, deluxe and
premium versions of the service that have functionality similar
to that of our desktop products. Through our electronic filing
center, customers of our desktop and Web-based tax preparation
software can electronically file their federal tax returns, as
well as state returns in all states that support electronic
filing. During fiscal 2002, we were the exclusive provider of
online tax preparation services on the Yahoo!® Finance Tax
Center, and our online tax services were also offered through
the websites of more than 1,100 financial institutions,
electronic retailers and other merchants.

Under the Intuit Tax Freedom Project, a
philanthropic public service initiative of the Intuit Financial
Freedom Foundation, we provide online tax preparation and
electronic filing services at no charge to lower-income federal
and state tax filers.

Professional Accounting
Solutions

Our ProSeries and Lacerte tax preparation
products are designed for tax professionals who prepare tax
returns for their individual and business clients. Customers can
elect to license professional tax products for a flat fee for
unlimited annual use or to use them on a
“pay-per-return” basis. ProSeries and Lacerte
customers can file their customers’ tax returns through our
electronic filing services. Our other professional accounting
solutions include EasyACCT® Professional Accounting Series
products, which allow



accountants to create financial statements and
prepare tax forms (such as W-2s and 940s) for their clients;
Lacerte Tax Planner, which helps tax professionals provide tax
planning services to their clients; and
IntuitAdvisor

SM

, a collection of subscription-based
membership and communication programs, product certifications,
an informational Web site and Web-based tools to help tax
accounting and financial professionals manage and grow their
businesses more effectively.

Personal Finance

Quicken Software.

Our Quicken line of desktop software products helps users
organize, understand and manage their personal finances. Quicken
allows customers to reconcile bank accounts, record credit card
and other transactions, write checks, and track investments,
mortgages and other assets and liabilities. Many customers use
Quicken products to manage their home-based businesses. We offer
basic and deluxe versions of the product, and in August 2002, we
introduced our Quicken Premier product, which offers more robust
investment and tax planning tools.

Quicken.com and Other Online Services.

We provide a range of online services
that help consumers manage their financial lives.
Quicken.com

TM

is our primary personal finance Web
site. It enables customers to automate financial management
tasks and make better financial decisions by giving them
software tools, resources and objective information about a
variety of personal finance topics, including investing,
mortgages, insurance, taxes, banking and retirement, in a single
online destination. In September 2002, we launched Quicken
Brokerage powered by Siebert, an online and telephone-based
securities brokerage service for Quicken and Quicken.com
customers made available through an exclusive strategic alliance
with Siebert Financial Corp., the holding company for Muriel
Siebert & Co. Inc. Other online services we offer include
bill payment and online banking services thorough the Quicken
desktop product, as well as a Quicken credit card. Quicken
and/or Quicken.com customers can also link directly to
third-party providers of other services, such as insurance and
mortgages. We do not currently charge customers a fee to access
most features on Quicken.com, but we receive revenue from
financial institutions and other companies that advertise and/or
sell their products or services through links from Quicken.com.

Global Business

We have business operations in Canada and Japan,
and we also serve markets across Europe, Southeast Asia and
other selected locations. We have established third-party
relationships with local companies in certain countries to help
us better address specific markets. In all international markets
except Canada and Europe, we focus primarily on small business
products.

Canada and United
Kingdom.

In Canada, we offer localized
versions of QuickBooks and Quicken; the MYOB accounting product
line, which we acquired during fiscal 2002;
QuickTax

TM

consumer tax products;
ProFile

TM

Financial Application Suite professional
tax products; and Quicken.ca

SM

, a personal finance
Web site with content similar to Quicken.com. In the United
Kingdom, we also offer localized versions of QuickBooks and
Quicken, as well as the TaxCalc

TM

consumer tax return
product, which we acquired in fiscal 2002.

Japan.

The principal
product we offer in Japan, is Yayoi®, a small business
accounting product that addresses the mid-sized companies
segment of the small business market in Japan. Sales of Yayoi
products also generate recurring revenue from ongoing support
contracts that are sold with the software. During fiscal 2002,
we discontinued our Japanese version of QuickBooks.

Other Locations.

We
offer localized versions of QuickBooks and Quicken products in
selected European markets through local distributors and agents.
We also offer localized versions of QuickBooks and Quicken
products in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Singapore
through a development, marketing and distribution arrangement
with Australia-based Reckon Limited.



Small Business Verticals and
Other

As part of our Right For My Business strategy, we
have acquired several companies that enable us to provide
accounting and business management solutions to customers in
selected industries, which we refer to as “verticals.”
These new businesses, which we report as a single business
segment, include the following: Intuit Construction Business
Solutions (formerly OMware, Inc.), which provides business
management solutions for the construction industry; Intuit
Public Sector Solutions (formerly American Fundware), which
offers accounting and business management software solutions for
nonprofit organizations, universities and government agencies;
Intuit MRI Real Estate Solutions (formerly Management Reports,
Inc.), which provides business management software solutions for
commercial and residential property managers; and Intuit Eclipse
Distribution Management Solutions (formerly Eclipse, Inc.),
which offers business management software for the wholesale
durable goods industry.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

Historically, our desktop software products have
tended to have a fairly predictable, structured development
cycle of about a year, with annual releases. For our small
business desktop products, we now supplement annual releases of
our core QuickBooks products with ongoing releases of products
that address the specialized requirements of selected vertical
industries, as well as products for larger or more complex
businesses. The development cycles for our service offerings are
less predictable and are generally much shorter than for our
desktop products. The development of tax preparation software
presents a unique challenge because of the demanding development
cycle required to incorporate annual tax law and tax form
changes each year. For a description of other risks and
challenges we face relating to our product development, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Risks That Could
Affect Future Results.”

During the past few years, we have devoted
significant resources to developing new products and services,
including QuickBooks Premier, QuickBooks Premier: Accountant
Edition, QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions Business Management
Software, the Intuit Developer Network and the Instant Data
Entry feature of our TurboTax products and services. We
supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring
strategically important products and technology from third
parties, or establishing other relationships that enable us to
expand our business more rapidly. For example, during fiscal
2002, we acquired four companies that provide small business
management products in vertical industries, we worked closely
with a third party technology provider to develop our QuickBooks
Point of Sale software, and we formed an exclusive strategic
alliance with Siebert Financial Corp. to offer brokerage
services to consumers.

We also devote resources to improving our
existing products and services. For our desktop software
products, our recent development efforts have focused on
creating an easier end-to-end customer experience, as well as
adding new features. We also incorporate technology in our
products and services to address customer concerns about privacy
and security while minimizing the impact on performance and ease
of use. In addition, we have focused in recent years on
developing technology that helps reduce unlicensed use of some
of our tax products. Our fiscal 2002 professional tax products,
as well as consumer tax products in Canada, contained product
activation technology that restricted sharing of the products.
In September 2002, we announced that federal tax versions of
TurboTax desktop products for Windows for the 2002 tax season
will include product activation technology that will prevent a
customer from using a single copy of TurboTax to print or e-file
a tax return from more than one personal computer.

During the past few years, we have made a number
of improvements to our product development process. We now team
technical support and product development personnel, so that we
can anticipate feature usability and support issues early in the
development process. By enhancing the design process for our
QuickBooks 2002 products, we improved product quality and
significantly lowered our customer service and technical support
call volume. We have made other changes that have allowed us to
shorten the development cycle, which is enabling us to launch
new products more quickly.



Our research and development expenses were
$165.9 million in fiscal 2000, $203.7 million in
fiscal 2001 and $203.5 million in fiscal 2002. During
fiscal 2002, we significantly increased research and development
spending in some of our highest-growth businesses —
small business, consumer tax and professional accounting
solutions — but these increases were offset by
significant decreases in spending in less strategic areas and
discontinued businesses. Over the next few years, we expect that
our research and development efforts will be focused on
developing new products and services to address customer needs
in our more broadly defined market segments and adding
complementary products and services to drive additional,
recurring revenue from our core products, such as additional
products and services for our small business customers. We
strive to maintain a balance between relatively low-risk
investments that address existing customer needs, and
investments in more innovative but higher-risk projects with
potentially greater returns.

MARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION

Markets

Recently, we have expanded both the markets that
we serve, as well as the products and services that we offer in
our target markets. Historically, our target markets were
individuals and small businesses with less than 20 employees. We
continue to serve those markets with products and services such
as QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken. In addition to these
markets, we are now targeting small businesses with up to
250 employees. We are addressing this new customer segment
with a number of new products and services under the umbrella of
our Right for My Business strategy. We are introducing
industry-specific solutions to meet the specialized requirements
of small businesses in selected vertical industries by
developing industry-specific version of QuickBooks, and
acquiring companies that offer business management solutions to
small businesses in selected vertical markets. In addition, we
recently introduced new versions of QuickBooks for companies
that, due to their larger size or complexity, have more
demanding accounting needs. We have also introduced business
solutions that go beyond accounting software to address a wider
range of business management challenges that small businesses
face. We expect to continue expanding in these directions over
the next several years. See “Business Overview —
“Right for Me” Product Strategy” and
“Products and Services,” above, for more details about
our product and service offerings.

Many of the markets in which we compete are
characterized by rapidly changing customer demands, continuous
technological changes and improvements, shifting industry
standards and frequent new product introductions by competitors.
Market and industry changes can quickly render existing products
and services obsolete, so our success depends on our ability to
respond rapidly to these changes with new or enhanced products
and services, new business models, alternative distribution
methods, different competitive strategies and other changes to
the way we do business.

Distribution Channels

Over the past year we have been expanding our
distribution channels to accommodate the recent expansion of
both the markets we serve and the range of products and services
we offer.

Direct Sales Channel.

For our core desktop software products
(QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken), we use various direct sales
campaigns, including mail and telephone solicitations,
direct-response newspaper and magazine advertising, and
television and radio advertising, to generate software orders,
stimulate retail demand and generally maintain and increase
consumer awareness of our products. Direct marketing campaigns
are one of the most effective ways to encourage existing
customers to purchase additional products and services,
including software upgrades. Direct sales made up a significant
portion of our total desktop software revenue in fiscal 2002, as
they often generate significantly higher revenue per unit than
retail sales, particularly for our small business and tax
products.

Many of our direct customers choose to order
and/or take delivery of products electronically through our Web
sites. Electronic ordering and delivery are generally more
convenient for customers and more cost-efficient for Intuit.
Electronic delivery has been a particularly effective method of
distribution for our



TurboTax state tax preparation products and for
product updates for our professional tax products. During fiscal
2002, products ordered and/or delivered electronically accounted
for a growing percentage of our direct sales revenue for our
core desktop software, and we expect this trend to continue in
fiscal 2003.

Our direct sales efforts have historically
focused on generating sales of relatively inexpensive,
off-the-shelf products to existing customers. Our service
offerings, as well as our more sophisticated, higher-priced
software products, require a more robust approach to direct
sales than desktop software. As we have expanded our services
offerings and introduced more high-end software products and
business management solutions over the past year, we have been
enhancing our direct sales capabilities to support revenue
growth in these new areas, as well as in our core desktop
software. We are investing in technology to consolidate and
improve our management of customer contact data and order
management tools across business divisions. Process excellence
initiatives in fiscal 2002 have resulted in improvements in lead
generation and order management, as well as more consultative
selling by our customer service personnel. In addition, we have
expanded our direct sales staff and broadened its role to
include more extensive and personalized contact with existing
and potential customers. In particular, some of the new products
and services we now offer as a result of recent acquisitions are
sold primarily through direct field sales organizations. As a
result of all of these efforts, we expect that direct sales will
become an increasingly important source of revenue over the next
few years.

Retail Distribution Channel.

We market our QuickBooks, TurboTax and
Quicken desktop software in North America primarily through
traditional retail software outlets, computer superstores,
office supply superstores, warehouse clubs and general mass
merchandisers. In international markets, we also rely on
distributors, value-added resellers and other third parties, who
sell products into the retail channel. In fiscal 2002 we began
distributing our TurboTax products through Safeway Inc., one of
the largest food and drug retailers in North America. This
enabled us to reach a significant number of new customers. We
expect to continue expanding our retail distribution locations
to reach more new customers in fiscal 2003.

We continue to benefit from strong relationships
with a number of major retailers, which allows us to minimize
our dependency on any specific retailer. We are reducing our
dependency on distributors as we ship more of our products
directly to individual retail locations. See “Manufacturing
and Distribution.” However, the recent slowdown in consumer
demand for software has resulted in software becoming a less
important category for retailers. As a result of this trend, we
have faced challenges in ensuring good product placement within
retail stores. See “Competition” and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Risks That Could
Affect Future Results.”

We ship more products to our retailers than we
expect them to sell in order to reduce the risk that they will
run out of products. This is particularly true for our tax
products. As a result, we often experience significant levels of
product returns from the retail channel after the end of the tax
season — during the fourth quarter as well as the
first quarter of the following fiscal year. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Risks That Could
Affect Future Results.”

As we execute on our Right for My Business
strategy, we are starting to offer more complex, higher-priced
software products than our traditional retail software products.
It is not yet clear whether the retail channel will be an
effective distribution channel for some of these higher-end
offerings.

OEM Channel.

We have
existing relationships with a number of personal computer
“original equipment manufacturers,” or OEMs, including
Dell Computer Corporation, Apple Computer Inc. and
Hewlett-Packard, that enable us to generate sales of our core
desktop software products in two ways. First, certain OEMs
“pre-bundle” new-user versions of certain desktop
software products on the computer systems that the OEMs sell to
their customers. Although these pre-bundled OEM sales sometimes
generate little revenue or initial profit for Intuit (due to the
low prices that the OEMs may pay for the products and slow sales
in their own businesses), they are a good source of new
customers and future revenues. The second source of revenue from
the OEM channel is “after-market” programs, in which
customers who are purchasing computers can select and purchase
software products at the same time.



Third-Party “Value-Added”
Distribution Arrangements.

As we
execute on our Right for My Business strategy, we are
supplementing our direct sales capabilities and our retail
distribution relationships with selected third-party
distribution arrangements. We believe these relationships will
enhance the growth opportunities for our expanded and higher-end
product and service offerings by allowing us to benefit from the
value-added marketing and sales expertise of these third
parties. We currently have arrangements with third parties who
have specialized expertise in marketing, selling and providing
post-sale implementation services for the vertical business
management solutions offered by our Construction Business
Solutions and Public Sector Solutions businesses, which we
acquired during fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2003 and beyond, we
expect to expand our network of third-party relationships, to
help increase revenue for some of our existing higher-end
product and service offerings, as well as for additional
products and service we anticipate offering as we execute our
Right for My Business strategy.

COMPETITION

Overview

We face intense competition in almost all of our
business areas, both domestically and globally. Some of our
existing competitors have significantly greater financial,
technical and marketing resources than we do. As we implement
our Right For My Business strategy we face increased competitive
threats from larger companies in bigger markets than we have
historically faced. In addition, the competitive landscape can
shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we
compete. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risks
That Could Affect Future Results.”

For our TurboTax, Quicken and lower-end
QuickBooks desktop software, we believe the most important
competitive factors are product features, ease of use, size of
the installed customer base, brand name recognition, price,
product and support quality and access to distribution channels.
We believe we compete effectively on most of these factors, as
our three principal desktop software products are the leading
products in the retail sales channel for their respective
categories. For most of our products and services other than
desktop software, we believe the most important competitive
factors are features and ease of use, brand name recognition,
speed in getting new products and services to market, and the
ability to distribute them effectively (through online methods
or through retailers, third party resellers and direct
distribution). For our service offerings, service reliability
and scalability of operations are also important factors. We
believe we compete effectively on these factors.

Our most obvious competition comes from other
companies that offer technology solutions similar to ours. These
competitors are described below. However, for many of our
products and services, the primary competitive alternatives for
customers are manual tools and processes, or general purpose
software. A significant portion of our new customers are people
who have used pencil and paper or software such as word
processors and spreadsheets, rather than competitors’
software and services, to perform financial tasks. For example:
many taxpayers prepared their tax returns manually; a large
number of small businesses used spreadsheets to keep their book
and they processed their payroll using spreadsheets and
manually-written checks; and most of our personal finance
customers tracked their finances with spreadsheets, manually or
not at all before purchasing Quicken.

Small Business, Employer Services and Small
Business Verticals

Competitors for our small business accounting and
business management offerings include companies such as
Peachtree Software (which is owned by The Sage Group PLC), MYOB
Group, Microsoft Corp. and the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants’ CPA2Biz subsidiary. Microsoft recently
acquired a provider of integrated software solutions for small
and medium-sized businesses, and Microsoft Great Plains recently
acquired QuickSell retail point-of-sale applications. Another
factor in the competitive environment is the increasing number
of alliances between professional tax preparers and providers of
small business software and services that aim to capitalize on
accountant-facilitated sales of small business products and
services to their clients. In addition to established
competitors, other potential competitors



have expressed significant interest in providing
accounting and other products and services to small businesses.
As we expand the depth and breadth of our small business
offerings, we face additional competition from others who are
already offering industry-specific small business solutions, and
business management tools and services for larger small
businesses.

Our financial supplies business competes with a
number of business forms companies, including New England
Business Service and Deluxe Business Systems, as well as with
printing services offered by franchises such as Kinko’s and
large office supply retailers such as Office Depot and Staples.
Other competitors include direct mail check printers, banks and
a number of smaller-scale Internet-based printing companies. In
addition, our QuickBooks products include some features (such as
customizable invoicing) that compete with our supplies products.
Online bill payment services and online payroll services with
direct deposit capabilities also offer competitive alternatives
to printed checks. Significant competitive factors for the
supplies business include ordering convenience, methods of
reaching customers, product quality, speed of delivery and
price. We believe our convenient access to our large QuickBooks
and Quicken customer bases is a significant competitive
advantage for us.

Our payroll services compete directly with
traditional payroll service providers as well as Web-based
service providers. Significant competitive factors include
distribution channels, a highly fragmented market including
financial institutions that are developing or promoting their
own payroll services, and offerings by non-traditional
competitors such as Microsoft’s bCentral. We face direct
competition in our Intuit Payroll Services — Complete
Payroll business from traditional payroll services offered by a
number of companies, including Paychex and ADP. Our QuickBooks
Assisted Payroll service competes directly with companies
offering Web-based payroll services, and indirectly with
companies offering other payroll solutions. Peachtree and others
also offer tax table subscription services that compete directly
with our QuickBooks Do-it-Yourself Payroll offering.

Consumer Tax

Competition in the consumer tax preparation
market is intense. Our major domestic competitor for both
desktop and Web-based consumer tax software continues to be
H&R Block, the makers of TaxCut software. However, Microsoft
offered a competitive product for one season (our fiscal 2000),
and new competitors may enter these markets in the future. We
also compete for customers with professional tax preparers,
particularly those with franchise operations. Web-based tax
preparation is still a relatively new service, and we expect the
competitive landscape to evolve as more competitors enter the
market and others consolidate. We also face potential
competitive challenges from electronic tax preparation and
filing services offered by state governments. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Risks That Could
Affect Future Results.”

Professional Accounting
Solutions

The professional tax preparation software
marketplace has many competitors. Our largest competitors in the
U.S. are CCH Incorporated, with its ProSystem fx product
line, and RIA, with its Creative Solutions and GoSystem
offerings. In the past, the professional tax market has been
highly fragmented, but it has experienced some consolidation in
recent years.

Personal Finance

In desktop personal finance software, the
Microsoft Money product is our primary domestic competition. We
also face competition from Web-based personal finance tracking
and management tools that are available at no cost to consumers.
There are many competitors for our other personal finance
products and services. For example, our Quicken.com site
competes for traffic, and advertising and sponsorship sales,
with online financial publishers, the financial areas on
numerous online services such as Yahoo! and financially-oriented
Web sites such as Microsoft’s Money Central. Our online
brokerage offering through Siebert Financial Corp. competes with
numerous other brokerage services. However, we believe that the
ability of Quicken customers to integrate brokerage transaction
data into their Quicken records gives us a



competitive advantage over other brokerage
offerings. Some portals and financial institutions also provide
service offerings such as Web-based bill presentment and payment
that compete with services we offer. We also face competition
from financial institutions that offer their own financial
software and Web sites.

Global Business

In Canada, we face competition from a number of
companies in the small business arena, including Computer
Associates International, Inc. The primary competitor in Canada
for our consumer tax business is Taxamatic, Inc., the makers of
TAXWIZ, and the primary competitor for our professional tax
business is CCH Canadian Limited. In Japan, our primary
competitors in the small business accounting arena are OBC, PCA
and Sorimachi. In Europe, we face competition from The Sage
Group PLC (based in the United Kingdom), Bhuldata (Wiso),
Microsoft and Microsoft Great Plains in the small business
market, as well as competition from Web-based accounting
products. Our primary global competitor in the personal finance
arena is Microsoft.

CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TECHNICAL
SUPPORT

We provide customer service and technical support
by telephone, online chat, fax, e-mail, and our customer service
and technical support Web sites. We have full-time customer
service and technical support staffs, which we occasionally
supplement with seasonal employees and outsourcing during
periods of peak call volumes, such as during the tax return
filing season, or following a major product launch.

During the past few years, we have focused on
developing support capabilities that can supplement, or in some
situations replace, telephone service and support. For example,
customers can use our Web sites to find answers to commonly
asked questions, check on the status of a product order and
receive bug fixes electronically. Alternative service and
support methods are less expensive for us and are often more
efficient and effective for customers as well. We have completed
a number of Six Sigma/ Process Excellence projects in our
customer service and technical support operations to improve our
call capacity forecasting, develop more flexible approaches to
staffing and reduce support call volumes and handling times. We
may also consider outsourcing a greater portion of our customer
service and technical support operations. We believe these
projects are critical to our ongoing efforts to provide better
service to customers at the same or lower cost.

We generally charge customers for technical
support, but we do not charge for product defect issues or
self-help support through our technical support Web sites.
Support alternatives and fees vary widely by product, from
self-help to chat, to phone support, to onsite installation.
Customers generally have a choice of different support
alternatives at different prices depending on the response time
they require.

Despite our efforts to adequately staff and equip
our customer service and technical support operations, we cannot
always respond promptly to customer requests for assistance.
When we experience customer service and support problems, they
can adversely affect customer relationships and our financial
results. Our Right For My Business strategy presents additional
technical support challenges as we increase the number and
complexity of the products we offer. In addition, we expect most
of our growth over the next several years to come from our small
business and tax products, which typically require more live
technical support than personal finance products. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Risks That Could
Affect Future Results.”

MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION

Desktop Software

The major steps involved in manufacturing desktop
software are duplicating CDs and floppy disks, printing boxes
and related materials, and assembling and shipping the final
products. We have a manufacturing agreement with Modus Media
International, Inc. under which Modus provides substantially all
outsourced manufacturing related to our retail and direct
launches of QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken, as well as



for day-to-day retail order fulfillment after
product launches. Modus has operations in multiple locations to
provide redundancy. We recently entered into an agreement with
Sony Disc Manufacturing under which Sony provides some of the
components Modus uses to manufacture our products. We expect
this arrangement will result in lower manufacturing costs and
shorter manufacturing cycle times. We also have an in-house
facility that handles the manufacturing and shipping for most
direct sales orders.

We have multiple sources for all of our raw
materials and availability has not been a problem for us in the
past. Over the past few years we have taken steps to streamline
our packaging and reduce our inventory and scrap costs, to
generate greater profitability in our core desktop software
businesses.

Our retail product launches have become
operationally more complex over the past few years. We have
evolved from shipping to a few hundred distribution centers
(with distributors delivering products to individual retail
locations) to a “direct to storefront” model in which
we ship products directly to almost 10,000 individual
retail locations. This allows us to be more responsive to the
needs of our retail accounts. We have an agreement with Ingram
Micro Logistics under which Ingram handles all logistics,
fulfillment and similar functions for our retail sales. During
the past year we have focused on better operational rigor at
various points in our supply chain. As a result, we have
significantly increased our on-time shipments, and significantly
reduced our aggregate channel inventory levels. We have also
reduced our dependency on distributors or on any individual
retail account. One distributor, Ingram Micro Inc., accounted
for 10% of total net revenue in fiscal 2000. No retailer
accounted for 10% or more of our total net revenue during
the past three fiscal years, and no distributor met this
threshold in fiscal 2001 or 2002.

We believe that using these three vendors (Modus
Media, Sony and Ingram Micro Logistics) to handle essentially
all manufacturing and distribution, respectively, for our three
primary retail product launches improves the efficiency and
reliability of our product launches, and enables us to move more
quickly to the direct-to-storefront model preferred by many of
our retailers. It also allows us to better manage inventory
levels. However, exclusive reliance on one vendor for specific
functions can have severe negative consequences on our business,
revenue and operating results if a vendor fails to perform for
any reason. Accordingly, we continue to evaluate other vendors
in order to increase efficiencies and facilitate contingency
planning. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risks
That Could Affect Future Results.”

Prior to major product releases, we tend to have
significant levels of backlog, but at other times backlog is
minimal and we normally ship products within a few days of
receiving an order. Because of this fluctuation in backlog, we
believe that backlog is not a reliable predictor of our future
desktop software sales.

Internet-based Products and
Services

Intuit’s data centers house most of the
systems, networks and databases required to operate and deliver
our Internet-based products and services, such as TurboTax for
the Web, electronic tax filing, QuickBooks Assisted Payroll and
Quicken.com. Through our data centers, we connect customers to
products and services, and we store the vast amount of data that
represents the content on our Web sites. Our data centers
consist of approximately 2,200 servers and
400 databases located primarily in three locations. In an
effort to reduce unavailability, or “down time” for
our Internet-based products and services, we generally follow
industry-standard practices for creating a fault-tolerant
environment, but we do not have complete redundancy. Despite our
efforts to maintain continuous and reliable server operations,
like all providers of Internet-based products and services, we
occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical
difficulties. See “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Risks That Could Affect Future
Results.”

PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF CUSTOMER
INFORMATION

Customers are concerned about the privacy and
security of information they provide to product and services
providers. This concern applies to information they provide in
connection with Internet-based products and services, as well as
information they provide through more traditional channels, such
as



product registration cards. Primarily because of
the financial nature of the information customers provide to us,
we are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations
relating to privacy and security, including laws and regulations
that require us to disclose certain information to customers. We
are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to
telemarketing activities. Additional laws of this type are
likely to be passed in the future, which could result in
significant increased compliance costs for us. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Risks That Could
Affect Future Results.”

We have established guidelines and practices to
help ensure that customers are aware of, and can control, how we
use information about them. All publicly-accessible,
Intuit-owned and operated Web sites at which customer data is
collected (including Quicken.com, QuickBooks.com and
TurboTax.com) have been certified by TRUSTe, an independent,
non-profit privacy organization that operates a Web site
certification program to alleviate users’ concerns about
online privacy. Each of our Web sites, as well as our software
products, has a privacy statement providing notice to customers
of our privacy practices, as well as providing them the
opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their
data.

To address security concerns, we use
industry-standard security safeguards to help protect the
information customers give to us from loss, misuse and
unauthorized alteration. Whenever customers transmit sensitive
information, such as a credit card number or tax return data, to
us through our Web site, we provide them access to our servers
that allow encryption of the information as it is transmitted to
us. We work to protect personally identifiable information
stored on the Web site’s servers from unauthorized access
using commercially available computer security products, such as
firewalls, as well as internally developed security procedures
and practices.

We believe privacy and security issues pose a
significant risk to Intuit and other companies, especially
companies doing business over the Internet. Although we have
made significant efforts to address customer concerns through
our business practices, during the past few years we have faced
lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues. Our
response to these allegations has been that we do not share any
personally identifiable information except as disclosed in our
privacy policies. A major breach of customer privacy or
security, even by another company, could have serious
consequences for our businesses. See “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Risks That Could Affect Future
Results” and “Legal Proceedings.”

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

We offer several products and services that are
subject to special regulatory requirements. For example, the
brokerage-related services that Intuit offers through Quicken
Brokerage powered by Siebert are provided in part by an Intuit
subsidiary that is registered as a securities broker and is
subject to certain federal and state broker-dealer regulations.
In addition, some of the investment-related features in our
products and services are offered by an Intuit subsidiary that
is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC and is
subject to some state regulatory laws as well. As we expand the
depth and breadth of our small business offerings, we may become
subject to additional government regulation, particularly in the
areas of retirement planning and other employer services. We
continually analyze new business opportunities, and new
businesses that we pursue may require additional costs for
regulatory compliance.

Current government regulation poses a number of
risks to us, including potential liability to customers and/or
penalties and sanctions by government regulators. Future
regulation could hamper the growth of our businesses. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Risks That Could
Affect Future Results.”

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We rely on a combination of copyright, patent,
trademark and trade secret laws, and employee and third-party
nondisclosure and license agreements to protect our software
products and other proprietary technology. While our proprietary
technology is important, we believe our success depends more
heavily on



the innovation and technical skills of our
employees. We do not own all of the software and other
technologies used in our products and services, but we have the
licenses from third parties that we believe are necessary and
appropriate for using that technology in our current products.

We consider our principal trademarks (including
Intuit, QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken) to be important assets
and have registered these and other trademarks and service marks
in the U.S. and many foreign countries. The initial duration of
trademark registrations varies from country to country and is
10 years in the U.S. Most registrations can be renewed
perpetually at 10-year intervals.

We face a number of risks relating to our
intellectual property, including persistent unauthorized use,
and unauthorized copying or “piracy,” of our desktop
software products. Although we have recently begun to
incorporate technology in certain desktop software products to
reduce unauthorized use, we expect piracy to be a persistent
problem. We also face the risk of third parties claiming that
our products or services infringe their intellectual property
rights, and we face risks to the value of our brands when we
grant trademark licenses to third parties. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Risks That Could
Affect Future Results.”

EMPLOYEES

As of August 31, 2002, we had approximately
6,500 employees, located primarily in the United States,
Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom. We believe our future
success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and
retain qualified employees in all areas of our business. We do
not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our
employees, and we believe employee relations are generally good.
Although we have employment-related agreements with a number of
key employees, these agreements do not guarantee continued
service. We believe we offer competitive compensation and a good
working environment. We were selected as one of

Fortune

magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work
For” in April 2002. However, we face intense competition
for qualified employees, and we expect to face continuing
challenges in recruiting and retention.

ITEM 2

PROPERTIES

Our principal offices and corporate headquarters
are located in Mountain View, California. Our Mountain View
facilities consist of approximately 500,000 square feet
under leases that have expiration dates ranging from 2003 to
2010. We maintain a number of leased facilities in San Diego,
California, consisting of approximately 385,000 square
feet. We use these facilities for general office space, a data
center and a manufacturing and distribution center. The
San Diego leases have expiration dates ranging from 2003
through 2007. We lease approximately 140,000 square feet in
Tucson, Arizona, where our primary customer call center is
located, under a lease that expires in 2009. In Plano, Texas we
lease approximately 165,000 square feet of space under a
lease that expires in 2011, with two five-year renewal options.
Our Professional Accounting Services group is headquartered in
Plano, and we also have a data center there. In Reno, Nevada,
the headquarters for our Employer Services business, we lease
approximately 140,000 square feet under leases that have
expiration dates ranging from 2002 to 2009. Our four Small
Business Verticals are headquartered in Santa Rosa,
California; Denver, Colorado; Shelton, Connecticut; and
Beachwood, Ohio. We also lease or own facilities in a number of
other domestic locations, including Waltham, Massachusetts; Fort
Worth, Texas; New York, New York; and
Washington, D.C. We also lease or own facilities in Canada,
Japan and the United Kingdom. We believe our facilities are
adequate for our current and near-term needs, and that we will
be able to locate additional facilities as needed. See
Note 16 of the financial statements for more information
about our lease commitments.

ITEM 3

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On March 3, 2000, a class action lawsuit,
Bruce v. Intuit Inc., was filed in the United States
District Court, Central District of California, Eastern
Division. Two virtually identical lawsuits were later filed:
Rubin v. Intuit Inc., was filed on March 8, 2000 in
the United States District Court, Southern District of



New York and Newby v. Intuit Inc. was
filed on April 27, 2000, in the United States District
Court, Central District of California, Eastern Division. The
Bruce and Newby lawsuits were consolidated into one lawsuit, In
re Intuit Privacy Litigation, filed on July 28, 2000 in the
United States District Court, Central District of California,
Eastern Division. Following Intuit’s successful motion to
dismiss several of the claims, an amended complaint was filed on
May 2, 2001. A similar lawsuit, Almanza v. Intuit Inc.
was filed on March 22, 2000 in the Superior Court of the
State of California, San Bernardino County, Rancho Cucamonga
Division. An amended complaint in the Almanza suit was filed on
October 26, 2000. These purported class actions alleged
violations of various federal and California statutes and common
law claims for invasion of privacy based upon the alleged
intentional disclosure to third parties of personal and private
customer information entered at Intuit’s Quicken.com Web
site. The complaints sought injunctive relief, orders to
disgorge profits related to the alleged acts, and statutory and
other damages. In August 2001, Intuit and the plaintiffs’
counsel in all of the cases except Rubin reached an agreement in
principle to resolve the cases, subject to court approval, based
on terms that are not material to Intuit. The Rubin case was
dismissed on November 19, 2001.

Intuit is subject to other routine legal
proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened
litigation, that arise in the normal course of our business. We
currently believe that the ultimate amount of liability, if any,
for any pending claims of any type (either alone or combined)
will not materially affect our financial position, results of
operations or liquidity. However, the ultimate outcome of any
litigation is uncertain, and either unfavorable or favorable
outcomes could have a material negative impact. Regardless of
outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on Intuit because
of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other
factors.

future earnings for use in our business, and do not anticipate
paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

Recent Sales of Unregistered
Securities

In June 2002, we issued a total of 73,795 shares
of our common stock to three former stockholders of CBS Employer
Services, Inc. (the parent company of CBS Payroll) in
connection with our acquisition of that company. We issued
0.0466352 shares of Intuit common stock plus $10.5580184 in cash

ITEM 6

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following table shows selected consolidated
financial information for Intuit for the past five fiscal years.
The comparability of the information is affected by a variety of
factors, including acquisitions and dispositions of businesses
and gains and losses related to marketable securities and other
investments. In fiscal 2002, we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage
business and accounted for the sale as discontinued operations.
To better understand the information in the table, investors
should read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in
Item 7, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes
in Item 8.

FIVE-YEAR SUMMARY

(a)

This pro forma data relates to accounting for
    derivative instruments and is different from our company pro
    forma results, which are shown in Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations.” We adopted Statement
    of Financial Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities” in fiscal 2001 and recognized the cumulative
    effect of the change in how we accounted for options to purchase
    shares of



S1 Corporation as of August 1, 2000.
    Pro forma data presents our net income and diluted net income
    per share for fiscal 1999 and 2000 as if we had adopted
    SFAS 133 at the beginning of fiscal 1999. In accordance
    with SFAS 133, we included unrealized gains and losses on the S1
    options in our fiscal 2001 and 2002 reported results until we
    sold them in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Intuit did not
    have any derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities
    prior to fiscal 1999. See Note 1 of the financial
    statements,

“Change in Accounting Principle.”



ITEM 7

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

NOTE: For a more complete understanding of our
financial condition and results of operations, and some of the
risks that could affect future results, see “Risks That
Could Affect Future Results” in this Item 7. This
section should also be read in conjunction with the Consolidated
Financial Statements and related Notes in Item 8. As
discussed below, we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage business and
accounted for the sale as discontinued operations. Unless
otherwise noted, the following discussion pertains only to our
continuing operations.

Results of Operations

Three-Year Total Net Revenue and Net Income
(Loss) Trends

The following table shows trends in our total net
revenue and net income (loss) for the past three years. Net
income (loss) is shown in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), and also on
an unaudited company pro forma basis. We present this company
pro forma financial information as a supplement to, but not a
substitute for, GAAP information, in order to provide investors
with an alternative way of assessing our results. Company pro
forma information is different from certain pro forma figures
required to be presented in our consolidated financial
statements and notes.



Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income (Loss) to
Pro Forma Net Income

The following table presents the reconciliation
of GAAP net income (loss) to unaudited company pro forma
net income for the periods shown. Company pro forma information
is prepared using the same consistent method from quarter to
quarter and year to year. Company pro forma net income excludes
acquisition-related charges, such as amortization of goodwill
and intangibles and impairment charges, and amortization of
purchased software and charges for purchased research and
development. It also excludes loss on impairment of long-lived
asset, gains and losses from marketable securities and other
investments, net gains and losses on divestitures, discontinued
operations, the cumulative effect of an accounting change (see
Note 1 of the financial statements) and the tax effects of
these transactions.

Overview

Intuit’s mission is to revolutionize how
people manage their financial lives, and how small businesses
and accounting professionals manage their businesses. Our goal
is to create changes so profound customers wouldn’t dream
of going back to their old ways of keeping their books, doing
their taxes or managing their personal finances. Intuit is a
leading provider of small business, tax preparation and personal
finance software products and services that simplify complex
financial tasks for small businesses, consumers and accounting
professionals. Our principal products and services include:
small business accounting and business management solutions,
including our QuickBooks® line of products and services as
well as our Intuit® line of industry-specific business
management solutions; TurboTax® consumer tax products and
services; ProSeries® and Lacerte® professional tax
products and services; and Quicken® personal finance
products and services.

The business models for many of our products and
services provide us with significant profit leverage, for three
primary reasons. First, these businesses have relatively high
fixed costs and low variable costs, so as we increase units
sold, we generate more profit per incremental unit sold. Second,
as we offer products and services with greater functionality, we
can increase prices to reflect the greater value that we deliver
to customers. Third, as customers move to some of our higher-end
products and services, the better product and service mix is
resulting in more revenue and profit per customer.

Our tax businesses are highly seasonal. Sales of
tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated
in the period from November through April. These seasonal
patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest
during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and
April 30. We



typically report losses in our first and fourth
quarters ending October 31 and July 31 when revenue
from our tax businesses are minimal, but operating expenses to
develop new products and services continue at relatively
consistent levels.

Acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and
assets have had a significant impact on the comparability of our
results year over year. During the past three years, we have
completed several acquisitions and dispositions. In fiscal 2002,
we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage business and accounted for
the sale as discontinued operations. See Notes 9, 10
and 11 of the financial statements. The impairment of
goodwill and other intangibles received in connection with
acquisitions has also had a significant impact on our operating
results. During fiscal 2001 and 2002, we recorded charges of
$78.7 million and $27.3 million for impairment of
goodwill and intangible assets. Total goodwill amortization
expense, including impairments, was $139.5 million in
fiscal 2001 and $122.6 million in fiscal 2002. We adopted
Statement of Financial Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142
on August 1, 2002. The adoption of this standard will
eliminate the amortization of goodwill commencing with the first
quarter of fiscal 2003. However, it is possible that in the
future we may incur impairment charges related to existing
goodwill, as well as to goodwill arising out of future
acquisitions. See Notes 1 and 5 of the financial statements for
more information regarding our goodwill and intangible assets
and the impact of impairment charges on our reported net income.

Gains and losses related to marketable securities
and other investments have had a significant impact on the
comparability of our yearly results as well. All of our
marketable securities and long-term investments are holdings in
high technology companies that have been extremely volatile
since we purchased them. In fiscal 2001 and 2002, the market
prices of a number of these companies’ securities declined
substantially from our initial investment due to the economic
downturn in the high technology industry. During fiscal 2001 and
2002, we recorded charges of $68.8 million and
$9.5 million for other-than-temporary declines in the value
of our available-for-sale marketable securities and other
investments, and a charge of $40.0 million during fiscal
2001 relating to the decline in the valuation of our trading
securities. See Note 3 of the financial statements for more
information regarding our investments in marketable securities
and the impact of our trading securities on our reported net
income.

Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing our financial statements, we make
estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant
impact on our net revenue, operating income and net income, as
well as on the value of certain assets on our balance sheet. We
believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved
in the accounting policies described below have the greatest
potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider
these to be our critical accounting policies. See Note 1 of the
financial statements for more information about these critical
accounting policies, as well as descriptions of other
significant accounting policies.

•

Net Revenue — Return and Rebate
    Reserves.

As part of our revenue
    recognition policy, we estimate future product returns and
    rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue based on
    these estimates. Product returns by distributors and retailers
    principally relate to the return of obsolete products. Our
    return policy allows distributors and retailers, subject to
    certain contractual limitations, to return purchased products.
    For product returns reserves, we consider the volume and price
    mix of products in the retail channel, trends in retailer
    inventory, economic trends that might impact customer demand for
    our products (including the competitive environment and the
    timing of new releases of our products) and other factors. We
    fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels.

Our rebate reserves include distributor and
retailer sales incentive rebates and end-user rebates. Our
estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive
rebates are based on distributors’ and retailers’
actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate
programs, which are typically entered into annually. Our
reserves for end-user rebates are estimated based on the terms
and conditions of the specific promotional program, actual sales
during the promotion, the amount of redemptions received,
historical redemption trends by product and by type of
promotional program and the economic value of the rebate.





a valuation allowance. When we establish a
    valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting
    period, we must record a tax expense in our statement of
    operations.

Management must make significant judgments to
determine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax
assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be
recorded against our net deferred tax asset. Our net deferred
tax asset as of July 31, 2002 was $244.4 million, net
of the valuation allowance of $9.3 million. We recorded the
valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we
will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets
(consisting primarily of certain net operating losses carried
forward by our international subsidiaries and certain state
capital loss carryforwards) before they expire. The valuation
allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the
jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our
deferred tax assets will be recoverable. While we have
considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and
feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the
valuation allowance, we cannot assure that we will not be
required to increase the valuation allowance to take into
account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to
realize. If we increase the valuation allowance, it could have a
material adverse impact on our income tax provision and net
income in the period in which we make the increase. See
Note 20 of the financial statements.



Total Net Revenue

The table below shows total net revenue and
percentage of total net revenue for each of our business
segments for fiscal years 2000, 2001 and 2002. We have
reclassified prior year information to conform to the current
year financial presentation for comparability. See Note 14
of the financial statements for additional information about our
business segments.

NM is a non-meaningful comparison.



Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001.

Total net revenue for fiscal 2002 was
$1,358.3 million, compared to $1,148.4 million in
fiscal 2001, representing an increase of 18%. The fiscal 2002
increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth of 31% in
our Employer Services segment, 29% in our Consumer Tax segment
and 20% in our Professional Accounting Solutions segments. Net
revenue from our Small Business segment increased 14% due to
growth in Quickbooks-related products. Personal Finance net
revenue declined 9% in fiscal 2002, reflecting a decrease in
Internet advertising revenue and lower sales of Quicken due to
the continuing overall decline in the personal finance desktop
software category.

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal
2000.

Total net revenue for fiscal
2001 was $1,148.4 million, compared to
$1,037.3 million in fiscal 2000, representing an increase
of 11%. Our Consumer Tax segment had a strong year with an
increase of 26% that was driven by Web-based tax return
preparation and electronic tax return filing services revenue,
which more than doubled from fiscal 2000. The revenue growth
also reflected a 57% increase in our Employer Services segment.
Growth in these segments was partially offset by a 16% decline
in the Personal Finance segment. Personal Finance was adversely
affected by the declining demand for Internet advertising as
well as by lower sales of Quicken due to an overall decline in
the personal finance desktop software category.

Total Net Revenue by Business
Segment

The following net revenue discussion is
categorized by our business segments, which reflect how we
manage our operations and how our chief operating decision maker
views results. The net revenue impact of the fiscal 2001
acquisition of Tax and Accounting Software Corporation is
discussed below under Professional Accounting Solutions. No
other acquisitions have had a material impact on net revenue in
the periods presented.

Small Business

Small Business product revenue is derived
primarily from QuickBooks desktop software products and
financial supplies. Small Business services revenue is derived
primarily from QuickBooks Service Solutions, our fee for support
plan. Our Small Business Verticals businesses are managed
separately from the Small Business segment, so their revenue is
included in the Small Business Verticals and Other segment below.

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal
2001.

Small Business total net revenue
increased 14% in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. Total
QuickBooks-related revenue (which includes QuickBooks desktop
software products, QuickBooks support plans, QuickBooks Internet
Gateway and QuickBooks Online Edition) was 11% higher while
QuickBooks desktop product revenue alone grew 19%. The increase
in QuickBooks desktop product revenue reflected higher average
selling prices driven primarily by the November 2001 launch of
our higher-priced QuickBooks Premier products, as well as 12%
higher unit sales. The volume increase was driven by strong
upgrade sales, which we believe were due in part to our decision
to discontinue technical support and tax table services during
calendar 2002 for customers using certain older versions of
QuickBooks. We believe that the availability of a range of third
party offerings from the Intuit Developer Network to QuickBooks
2002 customers may also have contributed to the stronger upgrade
sales. Fiscal 2002 QuickBooks-related revenue growth also
reflected strong results from QuickBooks Service Solutions. In
August 2001, we began offering several higher-end support plans,
which resulted in significantly higher average selling prices
that more than offset declines in volume compared to fiscal
2001. Revenue growth in QuickBooks-related products and services
was partially offset by a decline in QuickBooks Internet Gateway
revenue. Revenue for this business decreased due to a sharp
decline in upfront fees received from Internet Gateway
participants, as well as a decrease in transaction-based fees
that reflects lower customer demand for Internet Gateway
services and fewer services being offered. Financial supplies
revenue increased modestly during the year.

We expect continued growth in our Small Business
segment in fiscal 2003. We expect QuickBooks-related revenue to
increase due to the fiscal 2002 introduction of products with
more advanced functionality such as QuickBooks Premier,
QuickBooks Premier: Accountant Edition and QuickBooks Enterprise
Solutions



Business Management Software, which have
significantly higher selling prices than our other QuickBooks
products.

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal
2000.

For fiscal 2001, total net
revenue for the Small Business segment increased 6% over fiscal
2000. Revenue from QuickBooks desktop products remained
relatively flat. While average selling prices increased for the
year, unit sales declined 17%. This was attributable to a
decline in the rate at which existing QuickBooks customers
upgraded to newer QuickBooks products, as well as to a lower
acquisition rate of new users. Product revenue from our
financial supplies and services revenue from our QuickBooks
Internet Gateway and QuickBooks Service Solutions increased in
fiscal 2001.

Employer Services

Employer Services product revenue is derived
primarily from our QuickBooks Do-It-Yourself Payroll (formerly
Basic Payroll) offering. Employer Services services revenue is
derived primarily from our QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service
(formerly Deluxe Payroll) and Intuit Payroll
Services — Complete Payroll (formerly Premier Payroll).

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal
2001.

Employer Services total net
revenue increased 31% in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001,
reflecting 39% combined growth for the QuickBooks-branded
Do-It-Yourself Payroll and Assisted Payroll Service offerings,
with revenue for the Intuit Payroll Services —
Complete Payroll service roughly flat. Price increases accounted
for a significant portion of the Do-It-Yourself Payroll and
Assisted Payroll Service revenue growth, although the number of
customers for the combined offerings also increased by
approximately 12%.

We expect total net revenue to continue to
increase in our Employer Services business in fiscal 2003, due
in part to the acquisition of CBS Employer Services, Inc., a
provider of full-service outsourced payroll functions for small
businesses, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002.

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal
2000.

Employer Services total net
revenue increased 57% for fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000.
Increases in our average selling prices for both our
Do-It-Yourself Payroll offering and our Assisted Payroll Service
contributed to this growth. The higher average selling prices
resulted from price increases as well as a shift toward a mix of
higher-priced products. The number of customers for the combined
offerings also grew approximately 7%.

Consumer Tax

Consumer Tax product revenue is derived primarily
from TurboTax federal and state consumer desktop tax preparation
products. Consumer Tax services revenue is derived primarily
from TurboTax for the Web online tax preparation services and
electronic filing services.

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001.

Consumer Tax total net revenue
increased 29% in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. Revenue
from TurboTax desktop products was up 10%, due primarily to
higher average selling prices resulting from the introduction of
a higher-priced premium product. Revenue from TurboTax for the
Web was strong in fiscal 2002, reflecting a significant increase
in the mix of higher-end service offerings (TurboTax Premier) as
well as 84% unit growth. Electronic filing units and revenue
also contributed to the year-over-year growth. Overall, our
Consumer Tax customer base grew 19% in fiscal 2002.

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal
2000.

For fiscal 2001, Consumer Tax
total net revenue increased approximately 26% compared to fiscal
2000. The increase was due to a combination of higher average
selling prices resulting from price increases as well as
improved product mix and increased unit sales for both our
desktop products and Web-based tax preparation services. Our
Consumer Tax business also benefited from Microsoft’s
discontinuation of its desktop consumer tax preparation software
after the 1999 tax season which ended April 15, 2000. Our
Web-based tax preparation and electronic filing services also
experienced strong growth during fiscal 2001. Web-based tax
preparation revenue more than doubled from fiscal 2000 as a
result of increased prices as well as a 71% increase in unit
volume. In addition, our



electronic filing services revenue increased 53%.
Overall, our Consumer Tax customer base grew 14% in fiscal 2001.

We expect continued growth in our Consumer Tax
business in fiscal 2003 due to the continuing upward trend in
consumer use of the Web for tax return preparation and filing.
We also expect revenue growth as a result of product activation
features to be included in the tax year 2002 federal versions of
TurboTax desktop products for Windows®, which are designed
to reduce unauthorized sharing of those products.

Professional Accounting Solutions

Professional Accounting Solutions product revenue
is derived primarily from ProSeries and Lacerte professional tax
preparation products. Professional Accounting Solutions services
revenue is derived primarily from electronic filing and tax
advice services.

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal
2001.

Total net revenue from our
professional tax preparation products and services increased 20%
in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. Approximately
$21.0 million or 11% of the growth compared to fiscal 2001
resulted from our acquisition of Tax and Accounting Software
Corporation in April 2001. Higher revenue from electronic filing
services was also a significant factor in the increase. Our
fiscal 2002 introduction of product activation technology that
restricted sharing of professional tax products and higher
average selling prices for our ProSeries and Lacerte
unlimited-use products also contributed to the revenue growth.
Renewal rates for our existing customer base remained strong
during fiscal 2002.

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal
2000.

Total net revenue from our
professional tax preparation products and services increased 10%
in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000. This growth resulted
from higher average selling prices for both our ProSeries and
Lacerte unlimited-use products and unit growth for our pay-per
return customers. Renewal rates for our existing customer base
were strong during fiscal 2001.

We expect continued growth in our Professional
Accounting Solutions business in fiscal 2003 but we expect the
rate of growth to slow compared to fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2002
growth rates for this business were unusually high due to the
acquisition of TAASC in late fiscal 2001.

Personal Finance

Personal Finance product revenue is derived
primarily from Quicken desktop products. Personal Finance
services revenue is minimal. Other revenue consists of
Quicken.com advertising revenue and royalties for online
transactions.

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal
2001.

Personal Finance total net
revenue decreased 9% in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001, due
primarily to a 15% decline in revenue from Quicken desktop
products and a 38% decline in Quicken.com revenue. Solid growth
in our online transactions business partially offset these
declines. The decrease in Quicken revenue reflected the
continuing overall decline in the personal finance desktop
software category. Our share of retail units in this category
remained above 70% in fiscal 2002. The decrease in Quicken.com
advertising revenue reflected the industry-wide decline in
spending by purchasers of Internet advertising. We expect these
trends to continue in fiscal 2003.

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal
2000.

Total net revenue from the
Personal Finance segment decreased 16% in fiscal 2001 compared
to fiscal 2000. This decline in revenue was attributable in part
to a 27% decline in unit sales for our Quicken desktop
products and a 31% decline in our Quicken.com Internet
advertising revenues. Quicken revenue was down due to an overall
decline in the personal finance desktop software category.
Advertising revenue declined compared to the prior year due to
the overall economic environment which resulted in reduced
advertising spending by purchasers of Internet advertising. We
experienced continued growth in our online transactions
business, which partially offset these declines.



Global Business

Global Business product revenue is derived
primarily from QuickBooks, Quicken and QuickTax desktop software
products in Canada and Yayoi small business desktop accounting
products in Japan. Global Business services revenue primarily
consists of revenue from software maintenance contracts sold
with Yayoi software in Japan.

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal
2001.

Global Business total net
revenue increased 10% in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001.
Revenue from Canada increased 29% year over year. This reflected
strong tax season results for QuickTax, due in part to the
preliminary success of our efforts to reduce unauthorized
sharing of desktop software. Canadian tax revenue growth was
partially offset by modest revenue declines for QuickBooks and
Quicken. Revenue in Japan declined 12% compared to fiscal 2001.
Japan’s product revenue decreased 17%, due primarily to our
discontinuation of the QuickBooks product line in Japan in the
second quarter of fiscal 2002. Revenue from Yayoi products was
roughly flat compared to fiscal 2001. The overall decline in
Japan’s product revenue was partially offset by increased
revenue from Yayoi support contracts.

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal
2000.

Global Division total net
revenue for fiscal 2001 increased 4% compared to fiscal 2000.
This increase was primarily due to 39% overall revenue growth in
Canada, which was driven by 45% growth in QuickBooks revenue. In
addition, Canada experienced 14% growth in professional tax
revenue as a result of an acquisition we made early in fiscal
2001. Revenue in Japan increased due to higher retail sales of
our Yayoi small business accounting software. This was partially
offset by declining sales of QuickBooks in Japan as well as
decreased royalties and an adverse foreign exchange rate impact
that resulted in lower average selling prices in U.S. dollars.

Small Business Verticals and Other

As part of our Right for My Business strategy, in
fiscal 2002 we acquired several companies that enable us to
provide accounting and business management solutions to
customers in selected industries, which we refer to as
“verticals.” These new businesses, which we report as
a single business segment, include the following: Intuit
Construction Business Solutions (formerly OMware, Inc.), which
provides business management software for the construction
industry; Intuit Public Sector Solutions (formerly The Flagship
Group), which offers accounting and business management software
solutions for nonprofit organizations, universities, and
government agencies; Intuit MRI Real Estate Solutions (formerly
Management Reports, Inc.), which provides business management
software for commercial and residential property managers; and
Intuit Eclipse Distribution Management Solutions (formerly
Eclipse, Inc.), which offers business management software for
the wholesale durable goods industry.

Three of the four acquisitions were completed in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. As a result, total net
revenue from the Small Business Vertical and Other segment was
not significant in fiscal 2002 and consisted primarily of
revenue generated by OMware, Inc. There was no significant
revenue in this segment from sources other than the acquired
vertical businesses during fiscal 2002. Driving the growth of
the vertical businesses we have acquired so far, and acquiring
additional vertical businesses, are key business initiatives for
fiscal 2003. Therefore, we expect that we will continue to
report these businesses as a separate business segment in the
future.



Cost of Revenue

There are four components of our cost of revenue:
(1) cost of products, which includes the direct cost of
manufacturing and shipping desktop software products;
(2) cost of services, which reflects direct costs
associated with providing services, including data center costs
relating to delivering Internet-based services; (3) cost of
other revenue, which includes costs associated with generating
advertising and marketing and online transactions revenue; and
(4) amortization of purchased software, which represents
the cost of depreciating products we obtained through
acquisitions over their useful lives.

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001.

Cost of products as a percentage of
product revenue decreased slightly to 16% in fiscal 2002 from
17% in fiscal 2001. We lowered our per-unit materials,
manufacturing and shipping costs for our shrink-wrap software
products, resulting in significant cost savings. These savings
were nearly offset by increased costs associated with improving
our product distribution function. During the first quarter of
fiscal 2002, we established a new third-party retail
distribution relationship for our shrink-wrap software products.
This distribution relationship enables us to ship a larger
percentage of our products directly to individual retail stores
and allows us to provide inventory to our retail customers on a
more timely basis. By providing better service to our retailers,
we are reducing product returns and related costs. Because of
this and because we plan to continue redesigning the packaging
for many of our software products and further streamlining our
manufacturing processes, we expect cost of products as a
percentage of product revenue to decline in fiscal 2003.

Cost of services as a percentage of services
revenue decreased to 37% in fiscal 2002 from 46% in fiscal 2001.
This decrease was attributable primarily to our payroll and
Web-based tax businesses, which experienced significant revenue
growth with relatively fixed cost bases.

Cost of other revenue as a percentage of other
revenue increased to 39% in fiscal 2002 compared to 35% in
fiscal 2001. This increase was primarily due to increased data
center costs related to our Personal Finance segment’s
online transaction business, which experienced revenue growth in
fiscal 2002.

Amortization of purchased software decreased
slightly in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. This reflected
lower amortization expense in the second half of fiscal 2002
that resulted from a lower base of assets to be amortized. This
decline was partially offset by impairment charges for certain
purchased software assets that were recorded in the second
quarter of fiscal 2002, which caused the decrease in the base of
assets. See Note 5 of the financial statements.

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal
2000.

Cost of products as a percentage
of product revenue decreased to 17% for fiscal 2001 compared to
20% for fiscal 2000. The decline was primarily attributable to
lower excess and obsolete inventory expenses for all of our
product lines due to improved inventory management. Cost of
services as a percentage of services revenue decreased to 46%
for fiscal 2001 compared to 51% for fiscal 2000 due primarily to
revenue growth in our payroll business with a relatively fixed
cost base. This factor was partially offset by increased data
center costs related to our Personal Finance segment’s
online transactions businesses. Cost of other revenue as a
percentage of other revenue increased to 35% for fiscal 2001
compared to 34% for fiscal 2000 due to a significant decrease in
Internet advertising revenue with a relatively fixed cost base.



Operating Expenses

Customer Service and Technical
Support

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal
2001.

Customer service and technical
support expenses were 13% of total net revenue in fiscal 2002
and 2001. We improved our efficiency in fiscal 2002 by
increasing the proportion of customer service and technical
support we provide through less expensive methods such as Web
sites, online chat, email and other electronic means. We also
implemented a number of successful process excellence
initiatives that reduced costs while maintaining or increasing
service levels. However, these benefits were more than offset by
higher direct sales and support costs associated with converting
the customers of Tax Accounting and Software Company, a company
that we acquired in April 2001, to our ProSeries and Lacerte
professional tax products, and by increased demand for customer
service and technical support due to our growing customer base.
We expect customer service and technical support expenses to
decrease slightly as a percentage of total net revenue in fiscal
2003 as TAASC conversion costs gradually decline and as we
continue to benefit from lower cost, more scalable electronic
customer service and technical support delivery mechanisms.

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000.

Customer service and technical support
expenses were flat at 13% of total net revenue in fiscal 2001
and 2000. This reflected the benefit of providing an increased
proportion of customer service and technical support more
efficiently and less expensively through Web sites and other
electronic means, and from the expansion of QuickBooks Service
Solutions, our fee for support program for QuickBooks customers.
These improvements were offset by the April 2001 start of
support costs to convert customers of our newly acquired TAASC
business to our ProSeries and Lacerte professional tax products.

Selling and Marketing

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal
2001.

Selling and marketing expenses
were 21% of total net revenue in fiscal 2002, compared to 20% in
fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2002, selling and marketing expenses
increased as we expanded our small business marketing programs
to support the Right for My Business strategy announced in
September 2001. We also incurred incremental marketing expenses
for our Construction Business Solutions products, which we
acquired in November 2001. These increases were partially offset
by a decrease in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage
of total net revenue for our payroll business due to significant
revenue growth in that segment. We also donated
$8.0 million to The Intuit Foundation in fiscal 2002, which
will be used to benefit the community through contributions to
selected non-profit



organizations. We expect selling and marketing
expenses to continue to increase as a percentage of total net
revenue in fiscal 2003 as we expand marketing programs for our
new QuickBooks products as well as for the Right for My Business
products and services we recently introduced and those we expect
to introduce in fiscal 2003.

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal
2000.

Selling and marketing expenses
were 20% of total net revenue in fiscal 2001, compared to 21% in
fiscal 2000. During fiscal 2000 we experienced relatively higher
sales and marketing expenses in the first half of the year due
to aggressive marketing programs to expand our Internet-based
businesses and to respond to Microsoft’s TaxSaver consumer
tax offering. In fiscal 2001 our payroll business also
experienced relatively lower marketing expenditures as it
continued to benefit from the marketing value of the Intuit
brand.

Research and Development

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal
2001.

During fiscal 2002, we increased
research and development spending in some of our highest-growth
businesses — small business, consumer tax and
professional tax — by approximately 10%. In
particular, we continued to invest in our Right for My Business
strategy, including new QuickBooks Premier, Point of Sale and
Enterprise products launched in the second quarter of fiscal
2002, the Intuit Developer Network, and other new products that
we expect to introduce in fiscal 2003. At the same time, we
significantly decreased or stopped spending in less strategic
areas and discontinued product lines. We also benefited from
improvements in our development process that resulted in shorter
development times and higher quality for our new QuickBooks
products. The net result was that research and development
expenses in fiscal 2002 were flat in absolute dollars and
declined as a percentage of total net revenue to 15% of total
net revenue, compared to 18% in fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2003,
we expect to continue to make significant investments in
research and development, particularly for new small business
products and services.

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal
2000.

For fiscal 2001 research and
development expenses were 18% of total net revenue in 2001,
compared to 16% of total net revenue in fiscal 2000. In both
fiscal 2001 and 2000, we invested significant amounts in our
services businesses, mostly focused in our Small Business and
Employer Services segments. This included research and
development efforts for QuickBooks Online Edition, our
QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service (formerly Deluxe Payroll),
our QuickBase® information management tool and the Intuit
Developer Network.

General and Administrative

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal
2001.

General and administrative
expenses were 8% of total net revenue in fiscal 2002 and fiscal
2001. We experienced increased directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance costs and costs associated
with integrating our acquisitions of OMware, Inc. in November
2001 and EmployeeMatters, Inc. in December 2000. These increases
were offset by decreases in bad debt charges in fiscal 2002. We
had relatively high accounts receivable write-offs in fiscal
2001 due to the deteriorating financial condition of many
Internet companies with whom we did business. We expect general
and administrative expenses to increase as a percentage of total
net revenue in fiscal 2003 due to the costs of integrating our
fourth quarter fiscal 2002 acquisitions and other acquisitions
we expect to make in fiscal 2003, as well as to investments in
our internal audit function and process excellence
infrastructure. We also expect bad debt expense for fiscal 2003
to be somewhat higher than for fiscal 2002 because we
experienced unusually low levels of bad debt expense in fiscal
2002.

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal
2000.

General and administrative
expenses were 8% of total net revenue for fiscal 2001, compared
to 7% of total net revenue for fiscal 2000. During fiscal 2001,
we experienced an increase in our bad debt expense related to
the economic downturn in the high technology industry that
impacted many companies with whom we did business. Our general
and administrative expense for fiscal 2001 also included an
increase of $1.2 million in deferred compensation amortization
expense related to restricted stock we granted when we hired our
President and Chief Executive Officer in January 2000.



Charge for Purchased Research and
Development

In connection with certain acquisitions and with
the assistance of third-party appraisers, we determine the value
of in-process projects under development for which technological
feasibility has not been established. The value of the projects
is determined by estimating the costs to develop the in-process
technology into commercially feasible products, estimating the
net cash flows we believe would result from the products and
discounting these net cash flows back to their present value.
The resulting amount is recorded as a charge for purchased
research and development when we acquire certain new businesses.

In fiscal 2002, we recorded a charge of
$2.2 million for purchased research and development as a
result of our acquisition of Management Reports, Inc. (now
Intuit MRI Real Estate Solutions). In fiscal 2001, we
recorded a charge of $0.2 million for purchased research
and development when we acquired Tax Accounting and Software
Corporation. We recorded $1.3 million for purchased
research and development as a result of our Boston Light
Software Corporation and Hutchison Avenue Software Corporation
acquisitions in fiscal 2000.

Although we intend to continue to acquire
relatively mature businesses with products whose technological
feasibility has been demonstrated as part of our Right for My
Business Strategy, it is possible that we will incur additional
charges for purchased research and development in the future.

Charge for Vacant Facilities

During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we
concluded that we would not occupy two vacant leased buildings
in Mountain View, California and that we would be unable to
recover a substantial portion of our lease obligations by
subleasing the vacant space. As a result, we recorded a charge
of $13.2 million. See Note 13 of the financial
statements.

Acquisition-Related Charges

Acquisition-related charges include the
amortization of goodwill, purchased intangible assets and
deferred compensation expenses arising from acquisitions, and
impairment charges relating to certain acquired assets. See
Note 5 of the financial statements.

The FASB recently adopted a new standard for
accounting for goodwill acquired in a business combination. It
continues to require us to recognize goodwill as an asset
whenever we pay more for a business than the total of its net
tangible and intangible assets, but it does not permit us to
amortize goodwill, which we were previously required to do.
Under the new statement, we must separately test goodwill for
impairment using a fair-value-based approach on an annual basis
or more frequently if an event occurs indicating potential
impairment. The shift from an amortization approach to an
impairment approach applies to all acquisitions completed after
June 30, 2001. The additional goodwill amortization charge
for businesses we acquired after June 30, 2001 would have
been approximately $8.8 million in fiscal 2002 had this new
standard not been in place. We will adopt the remaining elements
of this new standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and
will therefore cease goodwill amortization for acquisitions we
made prior to July 1, 2001. However, it is possible that in
the future we may incur impairment charges related to the
goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future
acquisitions. In addition, we will continue to amortize most
purchased intangible assets and to assess those assets for
impairment as appropriate. In accordance with the new standard,
we transferred the balance of $1.9 million for assembled
workforce at August 1, 2002 to goodwill and will no longer
amortize that asset. See Note 1 of the financial statements.

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal
2001.

In fiscal 2002
acquisition-related charges were $181.6 million, compared
to $248.2 million in fiscal 2001. Acquisition-related
charges in fiscal 2002 included impairment charges totaling
$22.0 million that were related to our Internet-based
advertising business and our Site Solutions business. See
Notes 1 and 5 of the financial statements.
Acquisition-related charges in fiscal 2002 also reflected an
increase of $12.7 million in amortization of intangibles
associated with the acquisitions of EmployeeMatters, Inc. in
December 2000 and Tax Accounting and Software Corporation in



April 2001. Acquisition-related charges for
fiscal 2001 included impairment charges that totaled
$78.7 million.

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal
2000.

In fiscal 2001
acquisition-related charges were $248.2 million, compared
to $156.4 million in fiscal 2000. The increase was
primarily attributable to impairment charges totaling
$78.7 million that were recorded in the second half of
fiscal 2001. During our review for impairment, events and
circumstances indicated possible impairment of goodwill and
intangible assets related to our acquisitions of Venture Finance
Software Corp., SecureTax.com and Hutchison Avenue Software
Corporation. See Notes 1 and 5 of the financial statements.
Based on our analysis we recorded impairment charges of
$51.0 million, $26.0 million and $1.7 million
associated with VFSC, SecureTax and Hutchison, respectively.

Loss on Impairment of Long-lived
Asset

The fiscal 2002 loss on impairment of long-lived
asset related to the impairment of the asset we received from
the purchaser of our Quicken Bill Manager business in May 2001.
We regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values
of our long-lived assets are impaired. During the first quarter
of fiscal 2002, events and circumstances indicated impairment of
this asset. Based on our resulting analysis of the asset’s
fair value, we recorded a charge of $27.0 million to reduce
the carrying value of this asset to its estimated fair value of
zero, reflecting the deteriorating financial condition of the
purchasing company. See Note 12 of the financial statements.

Non-Operating Income and
Expenses

Interest and Other Income

In fiscal 2002, interest and other income
decreased to $32.9 million, compared to $57.3 million in
fiscal 2001 and $48.5 million in fiscal 2000. The decrease
during fiscal 2002 was due to a sharp decline in the interest we
earned on our cash and short-term investment balances in fiscal
2002, reflecting significant decreases in market interest rates
during the period. The increase during fiscal 2001 resulted from
higher average cash and short-term investment balances, due in
part to sales of marketable securities as well as more cash
generated from operations compared to fiscal 2000. The total
fiscal 2001 increase was partially offset by the effect of lower
market interest rates compared to fiscal 2000. Interest earned
on customer payroll deposits is reported as revenue for our
payroll business, and is not included in interest and other
income.

Gains (Losses) on Marketable Securities and
Other Investments, Net

As of July 31, 2002, we held marketable
securities and long-term investments in privately held companies
carried at $23.6 million on our balance sheet. This balance
was down from $109.4 million as of July 31, 2001 due
to sales and write-downs. We review the values of our
investments each quarter and make adjustments as appropriate.
See Notes 1 and 3 of the financial statements. The steep
decline in equity markets over the past few years has
significantly reduced the value of our marketable securities and
long-term investments. If the value of these remaining
securities continues to decline in the future, it would have a
negative impact on our financial results.

We considered our shares of Excite@Home and
724 Solutions common stock to be trading securities. As a
result, unrealized gains or losses due to market fluctuations in
these securities were included in our net income or loss on a
quarterly basis until we sold them in the first quarter of
fiscal 2002. We considered our other marketable securities to be
available-for-sale and did not reflect quarterly fluctuations in
their value in our net income or loss on a quarterly basis
unless we concluded that a decline in value was
other-than-temporary. See Note 3 of the financial
statements.

We recorded pre-tax net losses relating to
marketable securities and other investments of
$15.5 million in fiscal 2002 and $98.1 million in
fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2000, we recorded a pre-tax gain relating
to marketable securities and other investments of
$481.1 million. See Note 3 of the financial
statements. The



fiscal 2002 net loss included charges totaling
$9.5 million to write down certain long-term investments
for which the decline in fair value below carrying value was
other-than-temporary. Our fiscal 2001 net loss included charges
of $40.2 million to write down certain available-for-sale
securities for which the decline in fair value below carrying
value was other-than-temporary and $28.6 million to write
down certain long-term investments for which the decline in fair
value below carrying value was other-than-temporary. The fiscal
2000 net gain resulted primarily from our sales of Checkfree,
Signio (now VeriSign) and Homestore.com common stock.

Net Gains (Losses) on Divestitures

In March 2002, we paid $12.0 million to
terminate our $20.3 million obligation under an interactive
services agreement related to our Quicken Bill Manager business,
which we sold in May 2001. When we terminated the interactive
services agreement, we recorded a pre-tax gain of
$8.3 million. See Note 10 of the financial statements.
In the first quarter of fiscal 2002, we wrote off the
$27.0 million asset acquired from the purchaser of our
Quicken Bill Manager business to loss on impairment of
long-lived asset in our statement of operations. See
Note 12 of the financial statements.

During fiscal 2001 we recorded a pre-tax net loss
of $15.3 million resulting from our divestitures of
businesses. During the second quarter of fiscal 2001 we realized
a pre-tax net gain of $1.6 million for the sale of certain
assets of our wholly owned subsidiary, Intuit Insurance
Services, Inc., which operated our Quicken Insurance business.
The gain was more than offset by a pre-tax net loss of
$16.9 million for the sale of the technology assets of our
Quicken Bill Manager business in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2001. See Note 10 of the financial statements. Neither of
these divestitures represented discontinued operations.

Income Tax (Benefit) Provision

For fiscal 2002, we recorded an income tax
provision of $15.2 million on pre-tax income from
continuing operations of $84.9 million, resulting in an
effective tax rate of approximately 18%. For fiscal 2001, we
recorded an income tax benefit of $12.5 million on a
pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $130.6 million,
resulting in an effective rate of approximately 10%. For fiscal
2000, we recorded an income tax provision of $216.6 million
on pre-tax income of $538.7 million, resulting in an
effective tax rate of approximately 40%. Our effective tax rate
for fiscal 2002 differs from the federal statutory rate
primarily due to a tax benefit related to a divestiture that
became available during the year and tax-exempt interest income,
offset by non-deductible merger related charges. Our effective
tax rate for fiscal 2001 differs from the federal statutory rate
primarily due to the net effect of non-deductible merger and
divestiture related charges offset by the benefit we received
from tax-exempt interest income. Our effective tax rate for
fiscal 2000 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily
due to the net effect of non-deductible merger charges offset by
the benefit received from tax-exempt interest income.

As of July 31, 2002, we had net deferred tax
assets of $244.4 million, which included a valuation
allowance of $9.3 million for net operating loss
carryforwards relating to our international subsidiaries and
certain state capital loss carryforwards. The allowance reflects
management’s assessment that we may not receive the benefit
of certain loss carryforwards of our international subsidiaries
and capital loss carryforwards in certain state jurisdictions.
While we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient,
it may be necessary to increase this amount if it becomes more
likely that we will not realize a greater portion of the net
deferred tax assets. We assess the need for an adjustment to the
valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. See Note 20 of
the financial statements.

Discontinued Operations

We acquired the Quicken Loans business in
December 1999 in a transaction that was accounted for as a
pooling of interests. Accordingly, we did not record any
goodwill or other intangible assets.

On July 31, 2002, we sold our Quicken Loans
mortgage business segment and received consideration in the form
of a five-year interest bearing promissory note in the principal
amount of $23.3 million. This amount exceeded the net
shareholders’ equity of Quicken Loans by
$23.3 million. We accounted for the



sale as discontinued operations. In accordance
with APB No. 30, the operating results of Quicken Loans
have been segregated from continuing operations in our
statements of operations for fiscal years 2000, 2001 and 2002
and are shown on a single line captioned net income
(loss) from Quicken Loans discontinued operations. The sale
resulted in a pre-tax gain of $23.3 million in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2002. We did not record the tax benefit
related to the gain on the transaction because we cannot be
assured that we will realize the tax benefit. See Note 11
of the financial statements.

Concurrent with the sale, we signed an agreement
to license the Quicken Loans brand and a distribution agreement
under which the purchasing company will provide mortgage
services on Quicken.com. We will receive minimum royalties of
$1.8 million a year for the next five years under the
licensing agreement and minimum fees of $0.8 million a year
for the next five years under the distribution agreement.
Royalties and fees under these agreements will be recorded as
earned and included in other income on our statement of
operations.

Cumulative Effect of Accounting
Change

During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we
recorded a cumulative gain of $14.3 million, net of taxes,
as a result of a change in accounting principle when we adopted
SFAS 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.”

We recognized the cumulative
effect of the change in how we accounted for options to purchase
shares of S1 Corporation as of August 1, 2000. See
Note 1 of the financial statements. Subsequent fluctuations
in the fair value of these options were included in our net
income or net loss until we sold them in the first quarter of
fiscal 2002.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources

At July 31, 2002 our cash, cash equivalents
and short-term investments totaled $1,250.4 million, a
$36.8 million increase from July 31, 2001.

We generated $358.2 million in cash from our
operations during fiscal 2002. The primary components of cash
provided by operations were net income from continuing
operations of $69.8 million and adjustments made for
non-cash expenses, including acquisition-related charges and
amortization of purchased software of $194.0 million,
depreciation charges of $59.9 million and an impairment
loss on a long-lived asset of $27.0 million.

We used $25.6 million in cash for investing
activities during fiscal 2002. Our primary use of cash was for
business acquisitions, which totaled $278.3 million net of
cash we acquired. Our short-term investments decreased
$304.0 million during the fiscal year, with proceeds of
$3.15 billion from the sale upon maturity of certain
short-term investments partially offset by reinvestments of
$2.85 billion. As a result of our continued investment in
information systems and infrastructure, we also purchased
property and equipment of $42.6 million and capitalized
internal use software development projects of $21.3 million
in fiscal 2002.

We used $210.5 million in cash for our
financing activities in fiscal 2002. The primary component of
cash used was $318.4 million for the repurchase of treasury
stock through our stock repurchase program. See Note 17 of
the financial statements. This was partially offset by proceeds
of $133.6 million we received from the issuance of common
stock under employee stock plans.

In the normal course of business, we enter into
leases for new or expanded facilities in both domestic and
global locations. We also evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the
merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing
strategic relationships with and investing in other companies.
We may decide to use cash and cash equivalents to fund such
activities in the future.

In May 2001, Intuit’s Board of Directors
authorized the company to repurchase up to $500 million of
common stock over a three-year period. In July 2002, our Board
of Directors increased the authorized purchase amount by
$250 million. The stock repurchase program is intended to
help offset some of the dilution resulting from the issuance of
shares under Intuit’s employee stock plans. At
July 31, 2002, we had repurchased a total of
$326.8 million of common stock since the inception of the
program.



In connection with the sale of our Quicken Loans
mortgage business in July 2002, we have agreed to continue
providing to the purchasing company an interest-bearing line of
credit of up to $375.0 million to fund mortgage loans for a
transition period of up to six months. The line expires on
January 31, 2003. The line is secured by the related
mortgage loans and had an outstanding balance of
$245.6 million at July 31, 2002. See Note 11 of
the financial statements.

Loans to executive officers and other employees
totaled $12.9 million at July 31, 2001 and
$21.3 million at July 31, 2002. Loans to executive
officers are primarily relocation loans and none of these were
made or modified since July 31, 2002. Loans are generally
interest-bearing, secured by real property and have maturity
dates of up to 10 years. See Note 22 of the financial
statements.

We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments will be sufficient to meet anticipated
seasonal working capital and capital expenditure requirements
for at least the next twelve months.

The following table summarizes our contractual
obligations at July 31, 2002:

Restricted cash July 31, 2002 included
$5.8 million that we held in escrow in connection with our
fiscal 2002 acquisition of CBS Employer Services, Inc. The
escrow period expires in June 2003. Restricted cash also
included $5.5 million for rebates due our customers.

Other obligations at July 31, 2002 consisted
primarily of amounts we owe to former stockholders of CBS
Employer Services, Inc. in connection with Intuit’s
acquisition of that company in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2002. This contractual obligation is included in other current
liabilities on our balance sheet. See Notes 9 and 15 of the
financial statements.

Recent Pronouncements

On June 29, 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS 141,

“Business Combinations,”

and SFAS 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

SFAS 141 supercedes APB Opinion No. 16,

“Business Combinations,”

and eliminates the
pooling-of-interests method of accounting for business
combinations, thus requiring that all business combinations be
accounted for using the purchase method. In addition, in
applying the purchase method, SFAS 141 changes the criteria
for recognizing intangible assets other than goodwill and states
that the following criteria should be considered in determining
the classification of intangible assets: (1) whether the
intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights,
or (2) whether the intangible asset is separable or
dividable from the acquired entity and capable of being sold,
transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged. If neither criteria
is met, the intangible assets are classified as goodwill and are
not amortized. We have applied the requirements of SFAS 141
to all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001.

SFAS 142 supercedes APB Opinion No. 17,

“Intangible Assets,”

and provides that goodwill
and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life
will no longer be amortized. However, these assets must be
reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if
an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. The
shift from an amortization approach to an impairment approach
applies to all



acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001.
The additional goodwill amortization charge for businesses we
acquired subsequent to June 30, 2001 would have been
approximately $8.8 million in fiscal 2002 had this new
standard not been in place. Total goodwill amortization expense,
including impairments, was $139.5 million in fiscal 2001
and $122.6 million in fiscal 2002. We adopted the remaining
elements of this new standard in the first quarter of fiscal
2003 and therefore ceased goodwill amortization for acquisitions
made prior to July 1, 2001. However, it is possible that in
the future we may incur impairment charges related to the
goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future
acquisitions. In addition, we will continue to amortize most
purchased intangible assets and to assess those assets for
impairment as appropriate.

In connection with the transitional goodwill
impairment evaluation under SFAS 142, we will perform an
assessment of goodwill impairment as of August 1, 2002, the
date of adoption. To accomplish this, we will identify our
reporting units and determine the carrying value of each of them
by assigning the assets and liabilities, including existing
goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units as of
the date of adoption. We will then have up to six months from
the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each
reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit’s
carrying amount. To the extent that a reporting unit’s
carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an indication exists
that the reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired and we
must perform the second step of the transitional impairment
test. In the second step, we must compare the implied fair value
of the reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying amount,
both of which will be measured as of the date of adoption. The
implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is
determined by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to
all of its assets (recognized and unrecognized) and liabilities
in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance
with SFAS 141. This second step is required to be completed
as soon as possible, but no later than the end of the year of
adoption. Any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the
statement of operations.

As of the date of adoption of SFAS 142 on
August 1, 2002, we had an unamortized acquired intangible
assets balance of approximately $123.6 million, excluding
the balance of approximately $1.9 million for assembled
workforce reclassified to goodwill. As of that date, we also had
an unamortized goodwill balance of approximately
$430.8 million which included the amount of assembled
workforce reclassified to goodwill. These balances will be
subject to the transitional provisions of SFAS 141 and 142.
Transitional impairment losses that may be required to be
recognized upon adoption of SFAS 141 and 142 are
indeterminable at this time.

In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets,”

which applies to financial statements issued
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001.
SFAS 144 supersedes FASB Statement 121,

“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,”

and portions
of APB Opinion No. 30,

“Reporting the Results of
Operations.”

SFAS 144 provides a single accounting
model for long-lived assets we expect to dispose of and
significantly changes the criteria for classifying an asset as
held-for-sale. This classification is important because
held-for-sale assets are not depreciated and are stated at the
lower of fair value or carrying amount. SFAS 144 also
requires expected future operating losses from discontinued
operations to be displayed in the period(s) in which the losses
are actually incurred, rather than when the amount of the loss
is estimated, as presently required. We adopted SFAS 144
effective August 1, 2002 and do not expect the adoption of
SFAS 144 to have a material impact on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

In November 2001, the FASB’s Emerging Issues
Task Force released Issue No. 01-9,

“Accounting for
Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of
the Vendor’s Product,”

which applies to annual or
interim financial statement periods beginning after
December 15, 2001. The release provides that cash
consideration (including sales incentives) that we give to our
customers or resellers should be accounted for as a reduction of
revenue rather than as an operating expense unless we receive a
benefit that we can identify and reasonably estimate. We adopted
this new release beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2002.
The adoption of EITF Issue No. 01-9 did not have a material
impact on our total net revenue and as a result we did not
reclassify prior period financial statements.



In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146,

“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit and Disposal
Activities.”

This statement revises the accounting for
exit and disposal activities under EITF Issue No. 94-3,

“Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity.”

A formal
commitment to a plan to exit an activity or dispose of
long-lived assets will no longer be sufficient to record a
one-time charge for most exit and disposal costs. Instead,
companies will record exit or disposal costs when they are
incurred and can be measured at fair value, and will
subsequently adjust the recorded liability for changes in
estimated cash flows. The provisions of SFAS 146 are
effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities
initiated after December 31, 2002. Companies may not
restate previously issued financial statements for the effect of
the provisions of SFAS 146 and liabilities that a company
previously recorded under EITF Issue No. 94-3 are not
affected. We do not believe that the adoption of SFAS 146
will have a material impact on our financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.



RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT FUTURE
RESULTS

Company-Wide Factors That Could Affect
    Future Results

Our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal.
Seasonality and other factors cause significant quarterly and
annual fluctuations in our revenue and net
income.

Several of our businesses are
highly seasonal — particularly our tax businesses, but
also small business and personal finance to a lesser extent.
This causes significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial
results. Revenue and operating results are usually strongest
during the second and third fiscal quarters ending
January 31 and April 30. We experience lower revenues,
and often significant operating losses, in the first and fourth
quarters ending October 31 and July 31. Our financial
results can also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to
year due to a variety of factors, including changes in product
release dates, and the timing of acquisitions, dispositions,
goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges and gains and
losses related to marketable securities.

Fluctuations in interest rates can cause
significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in our net income,
earnings per share and asset values.

Recent declines in interest rates have
resulted in a significant decline in the interest income we
earned on our investment portfolio during recent reporting
periods, which has had a negative impact on our net income
(loss) and net income (loss) per share. Declining interest rates
can also reduce the value of our interest rate sensitive assets,
such as certain assets that relate to our payroll business. See
Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk” for more details.

Our recent acquisitions have presented
business integration challenges and we may not fully realize the
intended benefits of these acquisitions.

During the past few years, we have
completed numerous acquisitions, including five during fiscal
2002. These acquisitions have expanded our product and service
offerings, personnel and geographic locations. Integrating and
organizing acquired businesses creates challenges for our
operational, financial and management information systems, as
well as for our product development processes. We might not be
able to coordinate the diverse operating structures, policies
and practices of companies we have acquired or successfully
integrate the employees of the acquired companies into our
organization and culture, which could harm employee morale and
productivity. These difficulties may be increased by the various
geographic locations of our acquired businesses, which include
Colorado, Connecticut, Ohio and Texas. If we do not adequately
address issues presented by growth through acquisitions, we may
not fully realize the intended benefits (including financial
benefits) of these acquisitions.

We expect to continue to make acquisitions,
which could put a strain on our resources and adversely affect
our financial results.

A key component
of our Right for My Business strategy is to continue to expand
our product and service offerings, and we expect that a
significant portion of this expansion will result from
acquisitions. Integrating newly acquired organizations and
technologies into our business could put a strain on our
resources and be expensive and time consuming. In addition, we
may not succeed in integrating acquired businesses or
technologies and may not achieve anticipated financial benefits.
Our acquisition strategy and future acquisitions could also
result in the following risks:



•

The accounting treatment of acquisitions can
    result in significant acquisition-related accounting charges and
    expenses that would reduce our reported results of operations
    both at the time of the acquisition and in future periods.

•

Future acquisitions may require us to issue
    shares of our stock and stock options to owners of the acquired
    businesses, which would result in dilution to the equity
    interests of our stockholders.

Acquisition-related costs can cause
significant fluctuation in our net
income.

Our recent acquisitions have
resulted in significant expenses, including amortization of
purchased software (which is reflected in cost of revenue), as
well as charges for in-process research and development, and
amortization and impairment of goodwill, purchased intangibles
and deferred compensation (which are reflected in operating
expenses). Total acquisition-related costs in the categories
identified above were $166.5 million in fiscal 2000,
$263.4 million in fiscal 2001 (including charges of
$78.7 million to write down the long-lived intangible
assets related to three acquisitions), and $196.2 million
in fiscal 2002 (including charges of $27.3 million to write
down the long-lived intangible assets related to two
acquisitions). Additional acquisitions, and any additional
impairment of the value of purchased assets, could have a
significant negative impact on our future operating results.

Recent changes to Financial Accounting
Standards Board guidelines relating to accounting for goodwill
could make our acquisition-related charges less predictable in
any given reporting period.

The new
FASB standard for accounting for goodwill acquired in a business
combination applies to all acquisitions initiated after
June 30, 2001. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we
adopted the new standard for acquisitions we completed before
June 30, 2001. Under the new standard, we must continue to
recognize goodwill as an asset but will not amortize goodwill as
previously required. Instead, we must separately test goodwill
for impairment using a fair-value-based approach at least
annually and also when an event occurs indicating the potential
for impairment. As a result of this shift from an amortization
approach to an impairment approach, we will stop recording
charges for goodwill amortization. However, it is possible that
in the future, we may incur less frequent, but larger,
impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and
to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions as we continue to
expand our business. As of August 1, 2002, we had an
unamortized goodwill balance of approximately
$430.8 million, which included the amount of assembled
workforce reclassified to goodwill. These amounts could be
subject to impairment charges in the future.

If we are required to account for options
under our employee stock plans as a compensation expense, it
would significantly reduce our net income and earnings per
share.

There has been increasing
public debate about the proper accounting treatment for employee
stock options. Although we are not currently required to record
any compensation expense in connection with option grants that
have an exercise price at or above fair market value, it is
possible that future laws or regulations will require us to
treat all stock options as a compensation expense. Note 17
of the financial statements shows the impact that such a change
in accounting treatment would have had on our net income and
earnings per share if it had been in effect during the past
three fiscal years and if the compensation expense were
calculated as described in Note 17.

A general decline in economic conditions could
lead to reduced demand for our products and services.

The continuing downturn in general
economic conditions has led to reduced demand for a variety of
goods and services, including software and other technology
products. We believe the economic decline was partially
responsible for slower than expected growth in our Small
Business segment during fiscal 2001 and the first half of fiscal
2002. Although we experienced solid revenue growth in most of
our businesses during the second half of fiscal 2002, the future
economic environment remains uncertain. If conditions decline,
or fail to improve, in geographic areas that are significant to
us, such as the United States, Canada and Japan, we could see a
significant decrease in the overall demand for our products and
services that could harm our operating results.

If we do not continue to successfully develop
new products and services in a timely manner, our future
financial results will suffer.

We
believe that it is necessary to continually develop new products
and services and to improve existing products and services to
remain competitive in the markets we serve.



Failure to do so may give competitors
opportunities to improve their competitive position at our
expense and result in declines in our revenue and earnings.
However, developing and improving our products and services is a
complex process involving several risks. Hiring and retaining
highly qualified technical employees is critical to the success
of our development efforts, and we face intense competition for
these employees. Launches of products and services can be
delayed for a variety of reasons. New or improved products and
services may also have defects that hinder performance.
Third-party products we incorporate in, or use to build and
support, our products and services may also contain defects that
impair performance. These problems can be expensive to fix and
can also result in higher technical support costs and lost
customers. New products or features are sometimes built on top
of older architectures or infrastructures, which can take longer
to bring to market, make quality assurance and support more
difficult, and lead to complexity in supporting future
functionality.

The expansion of our product and service
offerings through internal growth and through recent and
anticipated acquisitions creates risks due to the number and
complexity of our revenue models and the operational
infrastructure required to support our expanded portfolio of
products and services.

The business
models for our expanding range of products and services rely on
more complex and varied revenue streams than our traditional
desktop software businesses. In particular, the revenue
recognition practices of several of the businesses we have
recently acquired are more complex than the revenue recognition
principles that apply to our existing products and services. We
expect this trend to continue with future acquisitions. As a
result of both acquisitions and internal growth, we expect to
continue expanding our product offerings to larger enterprises,
and we may begin to offer additional features and options as
part of multiple-element sales arrangements. These dynamics may
require us to defer a higher percentage of our product revenue
at the time of sale than we do for current products, which would
decrease revenue at the time products are shipped, but result in
more revenue in fiscal periods after shipment. In addition, many
of our newer businesses depend on a different operational
infrastructure than our desktop software businesses, and we must
continually develop, expand and modify our internal systems and
procedures — including call center, customer
management, order management, billing and other
systems — to support these businesses. In particular,
the success of our Internet-based services requires us to
maintain continuous and reliable operations at our data center.
Despite our efforts, like all providers of Internet-based
products and services, we occasionally experience unplanned
outages or technical difficulties. Lengthy and/or frequent
service outages — particularly for services that
customers consider time-sensitive — can result in
negative publicity, damage to our reputation and lost customers.

Despite our efforts to adequately staff and
equip our customer service and technical support operations, we
cannot always respond promptly to customer requests for
assistance.

We occasionally experience
customer service and support problems, including longer than
expected “hold” times when our staffing is inadequate
to handle higher than anticipated call volume, and a large
number of inquiries from customers checking on the status of
product orders when the timing of shipments fails to meet
customer expectations. This can adversely affect customer
relationships and our financial performance. In order to improve
our customer service and technical support, we must continue to
focus on eliminating underlying causes of service and support
calls through product improvements and better order fulfillment
processes, and on more accurately anticipating demand for
customer service and technical support.

We face risks relating to customer privacy and
security and increasing regulation, which could hinder the
growth of our businesses.

Despite our
efforts to address customer concerns about privacy and security,
these issues still pose a significant risk, and we have
experienced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy
issues. For example, during fiscal 2000 and fiscal 2001, there
were press articles criticizing our privacy and security
practices as they relate to the connectivity of our desktop
software to our Web sites. We have faced lawsuits and negative
press alleging that we improperly shared information about
customers with third-party “ad servers” for our Web
sites. A major breach of customer privacy or security by Intuit,
or even by another company, could have serious consequences for
our businesses, including reduced customer interest and/or
additional regulation by federal or state agencies. In addition,
the federal government has developed mandatory privacy and
security standards and protocols, and we have incurred
significant expenses to comply with these requirements.
Additional similar federal and state laws, and/or



laws that govern telemarketing activity, may be
passed in the future, and the cost of complying with additional
legislation could have a negative impact on our operating
results. If Internet use does not grow as a result of privacy or
security concerns, increasing regulation or for other reasons,
the growth of our Internet-based businesses would be hindered.

We face several risks relating to our retail
distribution channel.

We face ongoing
challenges in negotiating favorable terms (including financial
terms) with retailers, due in part to the recent trend of
declining importance of software as a retail category. In
addition, any termination or significant disruption of our
relationship with any of our major resellers could result in a
decline in our net revenue. Also, any financial difficulties of
our resellers could have an adverse effect on our operating
expenses if uncollectible amounts from them exceed the bad debt
reserves we have established.

We rely on third-party vendors to handle
substantially all outsourced aspects of manufacturing and
distribution for our primary retail desktop software products.

To manufacture and distribute our
primary retail products at the time of product launches and to
replenish products in the retail channel after the primary
launch, we have manufacturing relationships with Modus Media and
Sony, and a distribution arrangement with Ingram Micro
Logistics. While we believe that relying on only three
outsourcers for product launches and replenishment improves the
efficiency and reliability of these activities, relying on any
vendor for a significant aspect of our business can have severe
negative consequences if the vendor fails to perform at
acceptable service levels for any reason, including but not
limited to financial difficulties of the vendor.

Actual product returns may exceed returns
reserves, particularly for our consumer tax preparation
software.

We ship more desktop
software products to our distributors and retailers than we
expect them to sell, in order to reduce the risk that
distributors or retailers will run out of products. This is
particularly true for our consumer tax products, which have a
short selling season. Like most software companies, we have a
liberal product return policy and we have historically accepted
significant product returns. We establish reserves for product
returns in our financial statements, based on estimated future
returns of products. See “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Critical Accounting Policies —
Net Revenue — Return and Rebate Reserves.” We
closely monitor levels of product sales and inventory in the
retail channel in an effort to maintain reserves that are
adequate to cover expected returns. In the past, returns have
not generally exceeded these reserves. However, if we do
experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves, it
would result in lower net revenue.

We face existing and potential government
regulation in many of our businesses, which can increase our
costs and hinder the growth of our businesses.

We offer some regulated products and
services through separate subsidiary corporations. Establishing
and maintaining regulated subsidiaries can requires significant
financial, legal and management resources. If any regulated
subsidiary fails to comply with applicable regulations, it could
face liability to customers and/or penalties and sanctions by
government regulators. In addition, our Internet-based products
and services are available in many states and foreign countries.
As a result, we may be subject to regulation and/or taxation in
many additional jurisdictions, which could substantially slow
commercial use of the Internet and growth of our Internet-based
businesses.

Gains and losses related to marketable
securities and other investments can cause significant
fluctuations in our net income.

Our
investment activities have had a significant impact on our net
income. We recorded pre-tax net gains from marketable securities
and other investments of $481.1 million in fiscal 2000 and
pre-tax net losses of $98.1 million in fiscal 2001 and
$15.5 million in fiscal 2002. As of July 31, 2002, our
marketable securities balance was $16.8 million. Any
additional significant long-term declines in value of these
securities could reduce our net income in future periods.

Legal protection for our intellectual property
is not always effective to prevent unauthorized use or copying.

We rely on a combination of copyright,
patent, trademark and trade secret laws, and employee and
third-party nondisclosure and license agreements to protect our
software products and other proprietary technology. Current
U.S. laws that prohibit copying give us only limited
practical protection from software “pirates,” and the
laws of many other countries provide very little protection.
Policing unauthorized use of



our products is difficult, expensive and
time-consuming. Although we have begun to incorporate product
activation technology in some of our tax preparation products in
order to reduce unauthorized sharing of the products, we expect
that software piracy will continue to be a persistent problem
for our desktop software products. In addition, the Internet may
tend to increase, and provide new methods for, illegal copying
of the technology used in our desktop and Internet-based
products and services. We also face risks relating to our
licensing of our intellectual property to third parties. In
connection with our sale of our Quicken Loans mortgage business,
we licensed the use of the Quicken Loans and Quicken Mortgage
trademarks to the purchaser. If the purchaser violates the terms
of the trademark license, it could result in serious and
irreparable harm to Intuit’s reputation and the value of
its Quicken-related brands.

We do not own all of the software and other
technologies used in our products and services.

We have the licenses from third
parties that we believe are necessary for using technology that
we do not own in our current products and services. From time to
time we may be required to renegotiate with these third parties
to include their technology in our existing products, in new
versions of our current products or in new products. We may not
be able to renegotiate licenses on reasonable terms, or at all.

We may unintentionally infringe on the
intellectual property rights of others, which could expose us to
substantial damages or restrict our business operations.

As the number of our products and
services increases and their features and content continue to
expand, we may increasingly become subject to infringement
claims by third parties. Although we believe that we make
reasonable efforts to ensure that our products and services do
not violate the intellectual property rights of others, it is
possible that third parties still may claim infringement. From
time to time, we have received communications from third parties
in which the claimant alleges that a product or service we offer
infringes the claimant’s intellectual property rights.
Occasionally these communications result in lawsuits. In many of
these cases, it is difficult to assess the extent to which the
intellectual property that is being asserted is valid or the
extent to which we have any material exposure. Past claims have
not resulted in any significant litigation, settlement or
licensing expenses, but future claims could present an exposure
of uncertain magnitude. Existing or future infringement claims
or lawsuits against us, whether valid or not, may be time
consuming and expensive to defend. Intellectual property
litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the
following: cease selling, incorporating or using products or
services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;
obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual
property, which may not be available on commercially favorable
terms or at all; or redesign our software products or services,
possibly in a manner that reduces their commercial appeal. Any
of these actions may cause material harm to our business and
financial results.

Our ability to conduct business could be
impacted by a variety of factors, such as electrical power
interruptions, earthquakes, fires, terrorist activities and
other similar events.

Our business
operations depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation
of a large number of computer and communications hardware and
software systems. These systems are vulnerable to damage or
interruption from electrical power interruptions,
telecommunication failures, earthquakes, fires, floods,
terrorist activities and their aftermath, and other similar
events. Other unpredictable events could also impact our ability
to continue our business operations. For our Internet-based
services, system failures of our internal server operations or
those of various third-party service providers could result in
interruption in our services to our customers. Any significant
interruptions in our ability to conduct our business operations
could reduce our revenue and operating income. Our business
interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for the
impact of interruptions to our business operations.

Factors Relating to
Competition

We face competitive pressures in all of our
businesses, which can have a negative impact on our revenue,
profitability and market position.

There are formidable current and
potential competitors, including competition from
publicly-funded state government entities in the consumer tax
area. Accordingly, we expect competition to remain intense
during fiscal 2003 and beyond. In all our businesses, we face
continual risks that competitors will introduce better products
and services, reduce prices, gain better access to distribution
channels, increase advertising (including advertising targeted
at Intuit customers),



and release new products and services before we
do. Any of these competitive actions (particularly any prolonged
price competition) could result in lower net revenue and/or
lower profitability for Intuit. They could also affect our
ability to keep existing customers and acquire new customers.

In the small business and employer services
areas, we face a wide range of competitive risks that could
impact our financial results.

Our
small business products and services face current competition
from competitors’ desktop software, as well as from other
Web-based small business services products. Microsoft offers
several products and services targeted at similar size customers
as our high-end QuickBooks products, and has recently acquired
additional products and services that compete with our small
business offerings. Other competitors and potential competitors
have begun providing, or have expressed significant interest in
providing, accounting and business management products and
services to small businesses. As we implement our Right for My
Business strategy we face increased competitive threats from
larger companies in bigger markets than we have historically
faced. For example, we face direct competition in our Intuit
Payroll Services — Complete Payroll business from
traditional payroll services offered by a number of companies,
including Paychex and ADP. Our financial supplies business faces
ongoing pricing pressures from many of our competitors.

We face intense competitive pressures in our
consumer tax preparation software business, which can have a
negative impact on our revenue, profitability and market
position.

There are formidable current
and potential competitors in the private sector. We also face
competition from publicly-funded state government entities that
offer individual taxpayers electronic tax preparation and filing
services, at no cost to individual taxpayers. If state
governmental agencies were to be successful in their efforts to
develop consumer tax preparation and filing services and to gain
consumer acceptance of those services, it could have a
significant negative impact on our financial results in future
years. The federal government announced a proposal in August
2002 that would mitigate the risk of government encroachment in
federal tax preparation and filing services. The policy proposes
that, for at least the next three years, a number of private
sector companies, rather than the federal government, would
provide Web-based federal tax preparation and filing services at
no cost to lower income taxpayers and other underserved
taxpayers through voluntary public service initiatives such as
our Intuit Tax Freedom Project. Despite this positive
development, future administrative, regulatory or legislative
activity in this area could adversely impact Intuit and other
companies that provide tax preparation software and services.
Intuit is actively working with others in the private sector, as
well as with state government policy makers, to help clarify the
appropriate roles for government agencies and the private sector
in the electronic commerce marketplace.

Our personal finance products face aggressive
competition that could have a negative impact on revenue,
profitability and market position.

Our
Quicken products compete directly with Microsoft Money, which is
aggressively promoted and priced. We expect competitive
pressures for Quicken to continue, both from Microsoft Money and
from Web-based personal finance tracking and management tools
that are becoming increasingly available at no cost to
consumers. Competitive pressures can result in reduced revenue
and lower profitability for our Quicken product line. There are
many competitors for our Internet-based personal finance
products and services. However, the general downturn in Internet
and technology stocks since March 2000 has resulted in
significant consolidation, with fewer, but more financially
sound, competitors surviving. This could make it more difficult
for us to compete effectively.

Specific Factors Affecting Small
Business

It is too early to provide any assurance that
our Right for My Business strategy will generate substantial and
sustained revenue growth in the small business accounting and
business management segments.

A key
component of our Right for My Business strategy is to continue
to expand our small business accounting and management products
and services, through internal growth and from acquisitions. We
don’t expect that sales of our QuickBooks desktop products
alone will be adequate to meet our growth goals. We must
generate revenue from a wider range of market and customer
segments as well as from



new products and services. There are a number of
risks associated with the strategy, including the following:

•

Our strategy depends on our successfully
    completing acquisitions and integrating acquired companies,
    which presents a number of challenges as described above under
    “Company-Wide Factors That Could Affect Future
    Results.”

•

Our strategy is resulting in a dramatic increase
    in the number and complexity of the products and services that
    we offer. This is placing greater demands on our research and
    development, marketing and sales resources, as we must develop,
    market and sell both the new products and services as well as
    periodic enhancements to an expanding portfolio of products and
    services. This will also require us to continually develop,
    expand and modify our internal business operations systems and
    procedures to support new businesses, including our customer
    service and technical support call centers, and our customer
    management, order management, billing and other systems.

•

Many of the new products and services we are and
    will be offering are much more complex than our traditional core
    desktop software products and are being priced accordingly. They
    will therefore require a more consultative sales process, and a
    higher level of post-sales support. If we are not able to
    effectively adapt our marketing, sales, distribution and
    customer support functions to accommodate these changes, we will
    not succeed in generating significant or sustained revenue from
    these new businesses.

Our financial supplies business relies on two
key single-source vendors.

We have an
exclusive contract with John H. Harland Company to print and
fulfill supplies orders for all of our checks and most other
products for our financial supplies business. Harland fulfilled
orders for about 75% to 80% of our supplies revenue in fiscal
2000 and 2001, and about 85% of our supplies revenue in fiscal
2002. We believe that relying on one vendor improves customer
service and maximizes operational efficiencies for our supplies
business. However, if there are significant problems with
Harland’s performance, it could have a material negative
impact on sales of supplies and on Intuit’s business as a
whole. We also have a sole-source vendor that operates our
supplies sales website. If there are any significant problems
with this vendor’s performance, it could have a negative
impact on supplies revenue.

Specific Factors Affecting Employer
Services

Our employer services business faces a number
of risks that could have a negative impact on revenue and
profitability.

For our employer
services, we must be able to process customer data accurately,
reliably and in a timely manner in order to attract and retain
customers and avoid the costs associated with errors. For
example, if we make errors in providing accurate and timely
payroll information, cash deposits or tax return filings, we
face potential liability to customers, additional expense to
correct product errors and loss of customers. For our
Internet-based offerings (including QuickBooks Do-it-Yourself
Payroll and QuickBooks Assisted Payroll), we must also continue
to improve our operations to provide reliable connectivity to
our data centers to enable customers to transmit and receive
data. In order to generate sustained growth for our Intuit
Payroll Services — Complete Payroll, we will be
required to successfully develop and manage a more extensive and
proactive direct field sales operation, which is a different
distribution method than those we have historically relied on.
For future employer services we face the risk of potential
delays in technology development, as well as dependency on the
performance of third parties that may be key to our ability to
deliver certain services. We also face the risk that we may not
be able to successfully cross-sell employee administration
products and services to the existing base of QuickBooks
customers.

Specific Factors Affecting our Tax
Businesses

We face intense competitive pressures in our
consumer tax preparation software business, which can have a
negative impact on our revenue, profitability and market
position.

There are formidable current
and potential competitors in the private sector. We also face
competition from publicly funded state government entities If
state governmental agencies were to be successful in their
efforts to develop



consumer tax preparation and filing services and
to gain consumer acceptance of those services, it could have a
significant negative impact on our financial results in future
years. We expect competition to remain intense during fiscal
2003 and beyond.

If we fail to maintain reliable and responsive
service levels for our electronic tax offerings, we could lose
revenue and customers.

Our Web-based
tax preparation and electronic filing services must effectively
handle extremely heavy customer demand during the peak tax
season. We face significant challenges in maintaining high
service levels, particularly during peak volume service times.
For example, we experienced relatively brief unscheduled
interruptions in our electronic filing/and or tax preparation
services during fiscal 2000 and 2001, and we reached maximum
capacity for a short period on April 15, 2002. We do not
believe any prior service outages had a material financial
impact, prevented a significant number of customers from
completing and filing their returns in a timely manner, or posed
a risk that customer data would be lost or corrupted. However,
we did experience negative publicity in some instances. The
exact level of demand for Quicken TurboTax for the Web and
electronic filing is impossible to predict. If we are unable to
meet customer expectations in a cost-effective manner, we could
lose customers, receive negative publicity and incur increased
operating costs, any of which could have a significant negative
impact on the financial and market success of these businesses.

Significant problems or delays in the
development of our tax products would result in lost revenue and
customers.

The development of tax
preparation software presents a unique challenge because of the
demanding annual development cycle required to incorporate
unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year. The rigid
development timetable increases the risk of errors in the
products and the risk of launch delays. Any major defects could
lead to negative publicity, customer dissatisfaction and
incremental operating expenses — including expenses
resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and
interest paid by consumer customers due solely to calculation
errors in our products. A late product launch could cause our
current and prospective customers to choose a competitor’s
product for that year’s tax season or to choose not to
purchase tax preparation software. This would result in lost
revenue in the current year and would make it more difficult for
us to sell our products to those customers in future tax seasons.

Specific Factors Affecting Personal
Finance

The long-term viability of personal finance
business will depend on our ability to provide new products and
services that attract customers and that can generate revenue
sources other than just advertising revenue.

The demand for personal finance
software such as Quicken has been weakening over recent years,
and the demand for Internet advertising on Web sites like
Quicken.com has declined precipitously. We must identify and
capitalize on additional sources of revenue to provide
sustainable future growth for our personal finance business. In
an effort to stimulate customer demand and generate revenue
growth, we recently launched Quicken Brokerage powered by
Siebert, an online and telephone-based securities brokerage
service for Quicken and Quicken.com customers made available
through an exclusive strategic alliance with Siebert Financial
Corp., the holding company for Muriel Siebert & Co. Inc..
However, it is too early to tell whether this service will
generate sustainable revenue growth. Furthermore, it is unlikely
that the brokerage service, even if successful, will by itself
be sufficient to sustain our personal finance business, so we
must identify additional sources for growth.

Specific Factors Affecting our Global
Business

Business conditions in international markets
and other risks inherent in global operations may negatively
impact our financial performance.

Conducting business globally involves
many risks, including potential volatility in the political and
economic conditions of certain foreign countries; difficulties
in managing operations in different locations (including hiring
and retaining management personnel); a product development
process that is often more time-consuming and costly than in the
United States due in part to localization requirements;
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and
unanticipated changes in foreign regulatory requirements. In
particular, the economic situation in Japan had a negative
impact on global revenue and profits during recent fiscal years.



ITEM 7A

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK

Short-Term Investment Portfolio

We do not hold derivative financial instruments
in our short-term investment portfolio. Our short-term
investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards
consistent with our investment policy. This policy dictates
that, for short-term investments, we diversify our holdings and
limit our short-term investments with any individual issuer in a
managed portfolio to a maximum of $5 million. The following
table of our short-term investments portfolio is classified by
the original maturity date listed on the security:

Principal Amounts by Stated Maturity

Marketable Securities

We carried balances in marketable equity
securities as of July 31, 2002 that are subject to
considerable market risk due to their volatility. We considered
all of our marketable securities held at that date to be
available-for-sale. If our available-for-sale securities
experience further declines in fair value that are considered
other-than-temporary, we will reflect the additional loss in our
net income (loss) in the period when the subsequent
impairment becomes apparent. See Note 3 of the financial
statements for more information regarding our investments in
marketable securities and the impact our trading securities had
on our reported net income (loss) in prior periods.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk represents a component of
market risk to us because significant declines in interest rates
will cause unfavorable changes in our net income (loss) and
net income (loss) per share and in the value of our
interest rate sensitive assets, liabilities and commitments,
particularly those that relate to our payroll business. Interest
rate movements affect the interest income earned on investments
we hold in our short-term investment portfolio and the value of
those investments.

Over the past few years, we have experienced
significant reductions in our interest income due to declines in
interest rates. A significant decrease in future interest rates
will have a material impact on the interest income earned on our
cash equivalents and short-term investments held at
July 31, 2002.

Impact of Foreign Currency Rate
Changes

We translate foreign currencies (primarily
Canadian dollars, Japanese yen, and British pounds) into
U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly,
currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial
results, though the historical impact has generally been
immaterial. We believe that our exposure to currency exchange
fluctuation risk is insignificant primarily because our global
subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial
obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies.
Currency



exchange risk is also minimized since foreign
debt is due exclusively in local foreign currencies. For each of
the three years presented there was an immaterial currency
exchange impact from our intercompany transactions. Although the
impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has
generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for
the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be
significant in the future, there can be no guarantee that the
impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the
future. As of July 31, 2002, we did not engage in foreign
currency hedging activities.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT
AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intuit
Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Intuit Inc. as of July 31, 2001 and 2002,
and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended July 31, 2002. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item 14(a). These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Intuit Inc. at July 31,
2001 and 2002, and the consolidated results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended July 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

1.     Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the
financial statements of Intuit and its wholly owned
subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation. Certain other previously
reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current presentation. As discussed in Note 11, our Quicken
Loans mortgage business has been accounted for as discontinued
operations in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) Opinion No. 30. Accordingly, we have
reclassified our financial statements for all periods presented
to reflect Quicken Loans as a discontinued operation. Unless
noted otherwise, discussions herein pertain to our continuing
operations.

Investments in which we intend to maintain more
than a temporary 20% to 50% interest, or otherwise have the
ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for
under the equity method. Investments in which we have less than
a 20% interest and over which we do not have the ability to
exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost
or estimated realizable value. We monitor both equity and cost
basis investments for other than temporary declines in value and
make reductions in carrying values when appropriate.

Use of Estimates

We make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures
made in the accompanying notes. Estimates are used for reserves
for product returns, reserves for rebates, determining the
collectibility of accounts receivable, the valuation of deferred
tax assets and other amounts. We also use estimates to determine
the remaining economic lives and carrying values of goodwill,
purchased intangibles, property and equipment and other
long-lived assets. Despite our intention to establish accurate
estimates and assumptions, actual results may differ from our
estimates.

Net Revenue

For our shrink-wrapped software products, we
generally recognize revenue when we ship products (which is when
title passes) either to retailers and distributors or directly
to end user customers. We sell certain consumer tax products on
consignment. We recognize revenue for consigned software
products when the end-user sale has been confirmed. We recognize
revenue only if payment is probable and we have no significant
remaining obligations to the customer. We recognize revenue from
distributors and retailers net of returns reserves that are
based on historical returns experience and other factors such as
the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel,
trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might
impact customer demand for our products. We recognize revenue
from end users net of rebate reserves that are based on the
terms and conditions of the specific promotional program, actual
sales during the promotion, the amount of redemptions received,
historical redemption trends by product and by type of
promotional program and the economic value of the rebate. In
some situations, we receive advance payments from our customers.
Revenue associated with these advance payments is deferred until
the products are shipped or services are provided. We also
reduce revenue by the estimated cost of rebates when products
are shipped.

We recognize revenue from payroll processing and
payroll tax filing services as the services are performed,
provided we have no other remaining obligations. We generally
require customers to remit payroll and payroll tax liability
funds to us in advance of the applicable payroll due date, via
electronic funds transfer. We include in total net revenue the
interest earned on invested balances resulting from timing
differences between the collection of these funds from customers
and the remittance of such funds to outside parties because this
interest income represents an integral part of the revenue
generated from our services. We recognize this interest as it is
earned.



We also offer several plans under which customers
pay for technical support assistance. We recognize support
revenue over the life of the plan, which is generally one year.
We include costs incurred for fee-for-support plans in cost of
revenue.

We recognize revenue from other products and
services when it is earned based on the nature of the particular
product or service. For products and services that we provide
over a period of time, we recognize revenue pro rata based on
the contractual time period. Where we provide or deliver the
product or service at a specific point in time and there are no
remaining obligations, we recognize revenue upon delivery of the
product or completion of the service.

Shipping and Handling Costs

We record costs incurred for the shipping and
handling of our software products as cost of products in our
statement of operations.

Customer Service and Technical
Support

Customer service and technical support costs
include the costs associated with performing order processing,
answering customer inquiries by telephone and through Web sites
and other electronic means and providing free technical support
assistance to customers. In connection with the sale of certain
products, we provide a limited amount of free technical support
assistance to customers. We do not defer the recognition of any
revenue associated with sales of these products, since the cost
of providing this free technical support is insignificant. The
technical support is provided within one year after the
associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements
are minimal and infrequent. We accrue the estimated cost of
providing this free support upon product shipment.

Software Development Costs

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or
SFAS, No. 86,

“Accounting for Costs of Computer
Software to be Sold, Leased, or otherwise Marketed,”

requires companies to expense software development costs as they
incur them until technological feasibility has been established,
at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is
available for general release to customers. To date, our
software has been available for general release concurrent with
the establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly,
we have not capitalized any development costs. SFAS 2,

“Accounting for Research and Development Costs”

establishes accounting and reporting standards for research and
development. In accordance with SFAS 2, costs we incur to
enhance our existing products or after the general release of
the service using the product are expensed in the period they
are incurred and included in research and development costs in
the statement of operations.

We capitalize costs related to the development of
computer software developed or obtained for internal use in
accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants Statement of Position 98-1,

“Accounting
for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use.”

Costs incurred in the application
development phase are capitalized and amortized over their
useful lives, generally not to exceed three years.

Advertising

We expense advertising costs as we incur them.
Advertising expense for the years ended July 31, 2000, 2001
and 2002 was approximately $50.9 million,
$36.9 million and $33.1 million, respectively.

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term
Investments

We consider highly liquid investments with
maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be
cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money
market funds in all periods presented. Short-term investments
consist of available-for-sale debt securities that we carry at
fair value. We include unrealized gains and losses on short-term
investments, net of tax, in stockholders’ equity.
Available-for-sale



debt securities are classified as current assets
based upon our intent and ability to use any and all of these
securities as necessary to satisfy the significant short-term
liquidity requirements that may arise from the highly seasonal
and cyclical nature of our businesses. Because of our
significant business seasonality, cash flow requirements may
fluctuate dramatically from quarter to quarter and require us to
use a significant amount of the short-term investments held as
available-for-sale securities. See Note 2.

Marketable Securities and Other Long-term
Investments

We classify our marketable securities as
available-for-sale, carry them at fair value and include
unrealized gains and losses on them, net of tax, in
stockholders’ equity. We use the specific identification
method to account for gains and losses on marketable equity
securities. We include realized gains and losses and declines in
value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale
securities in gains (losses) on marketable securities and other
investments, net in the statement of operations. Our other
long-term investments consist primarily of equity investments in
privately held companies and are stated at cost, adjusted for
declines in fair value that are considered other-than-temporary.
See Note 3.

Change in Accounting Principle

During fiscal 2001, we adopted SFAS 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,”

which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. It
requires us to recognize all derivatives as either assets or
liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments
at fair value. In May 1999, we completed a $50 million
investment (970,813 shares) in Security First Technologies,
now known as S1 Corporation. In connection with this
agreement, we received options to purchase 4.8 million
additional shares of S1 common stock, at a per share
purchase price of $51.50. These options contained a net-exercise
feature. In August 2000, we recorded the cumulative effect of
the change in accounting for derivatives for our
4.8 million S1 options held in long-term investments. This
resulted in a one-time cumulative effect of $14.3 million,
net of income taxes totaling $9.5 million, in the first
quarter of fiscal 2001. The one-time cumulative effect created
an increase of $0.07 per share in the basic and diluted net
loss per share for fiscal 2001. SFAS 133 requires the
derivatives to be carried at fair value, so subsequent
fluctuations in the fair value of these options were included in
our net income (loss) until we sold them. For fiscal 2001, these
fluctuations resulted in a loss of $9.7 million net of
income taxes, which increased the basic and diluted net loss per
share for the period by $0.05 per share. During the first
quarter of fiscal 2002, we sold these options and recorded a
realized loss of $1.9 million.

If we had adopted SFAS 133 as of the beginning of
fiscal 2000, adjusted pro forma net income would have been
$299.1 million compared to reported net income of
$305.7 million and adjusted pro forma diluted net income
per share would have been $1.42 compared to reported net income
per share of $1.45.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of
accumulated depreciation. We calculate depreciation using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, which range from 3 to 30 years. We amortize
leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over the
lesser of their estimated useful lives or remaining lease terms.

Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and
Other Long-lived Assets

We record goodwill when the purchase price of net
tangible and intangible assets we acquire exceeds their fair
value. We generally amortized goodwill on a straight-line basis
over periods ranging from 3 to 5 years in all periods
presented. However, in accordance with SFAS 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”

we did
not amortize goodwill for acquisitions completed after
June 30, 2001 and effective August 1, 2002 we no
longer amortize goodwill for acquisitions completed before
July 1, 2001. See

“Recent Pronouncements”

below for more information. We amortize the cost of
identified intangibles on a straight-line basis over periods
ranging from 1 to 15 years.



We regularly perform reviews to determine if the
carrying values of our long-lived assets are impaired. We look
for facts or circumstances, either internal or external, that
indicate that we may not recover the carrying value of the asset.

We measure impairment loss related to long-lived
assets based on the amount by which the carrying amounts of such
assets exceed their fair values. Our measurement of fair value
is generally based on an analysis of the present value of
estimated future discounted cash flows. Our analysis is based on
available information and reasonable and supportable assumptions
and projections. The discounted cash flow analysis considers the
likelihood of possible outcomes and is based on our best
estimate of projected future cash flows. If necessary, we
perform subsequent calculations to measure the amount of the
impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying value over
the fair value of the impaired assets.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued SFAS 142,

“Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.”

In October 2001, the FASB issued
SFAS 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”

We implemented both
SFAS 142 and SFAS 144 beginning in the first quarter
of fiscal 2003. See

“Recent Pronouncements”

below for more information.

Customer Deposits

Customer deposits represent cash held on behalf
of our customers in our payroll business.

Payroll Service Obligations

Payroll service obligations relate to our payroll
business and consist primarily of payroll taxes we owe on behalf
of our customers.

Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant
Customers and Suppliers

We operate in markets that are highly competitive
and rapidly changing. Significant technological changes, changes
in customer requirements, the emergence of competitive products
or services with new capabilities and other factors could
negatively impact our operating results.

We are also subject to risks related to changes
in the values of our significant balances of short-term
investments, marketable securities and long-term private equity
investments, as well as risks related to the collectibility of
our trade accounts receivable. Our portfolio of short-term
investments consists primarily of investment-grade securities
that are diversified by limiting our holdings with any
individual issuer in a managed portfolio to a maximum of
$5 million. At July 31, 2002, we held approximately
$16.8 million in marketable securities, as described in
Note 3. See that note for a discussion of our marketable
securities. At July 31, 2002, we also held approximately
$6.8 million in long-term private equity investments, net
of reserves for declines in value that management has determined
to be other-than-temporary.

We sell a significant portion of our products
through third-party distributors and retailers. As a result, we
face risks related to the collectibility of our trade accounts
receivable. To appropriately manage this risk, we perform
ongoing evaluations of customer credit and limit the amount of
credit extended as we deem appropriate but generally do not
require collateral. We maintain reserves for estimated credit
losses and these losses have historically been within our
expectations. However, since we cannot necessarily predict
future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we
cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate.

One distributor accounted for 10% of total net
revenue in fiscal 2000 and the same distributor accounted for
15% of accounts receivable at July 31, 2001. Due to changes
in our distributor relationships during fiscal 2002, we are
selling an increasing proportion of our software products
directly to a variety of retailers rather than through a few
major distributors. No distributor or retailer accounted for 10%
or more of total net revenue in fiscal 2001 or 2002, nor did any
customer account for 10% or more of accounts receivable at
July 31, 2002.



In connection with the sale of our Quicken Loans
mortgage business in July 2002, we have agreed to continue
providing to the purchasing company a line of credit of up to
$375.0 million to fund mortgage loans for a transition
period of up to six months. The line is secured by the related
mortgage loans and had an outstanding balance of
$245.6 million at July 31, 2002. As part of the
consideration for the sale of the business, we also hold a
five-year promissory note in the principal amount of
$23.3 million from the purchasing company. See Note 11.

We rely on three third party vendors to handle
all outsourced aspects of our primary retail desktop software
product launches. We also have an exclusive contract with
another vendor to print and fulfill orders for all of our checks
and many other products for our financial supplies business.
While we believe that relying on two vendors for product
launches and replenishments and on one vendor for our supplies
improves the efficiency and reliability of these activities,
relying on any one vendor for a significant aspect of our
business can have a significant negative impact on our revenue
and profitability if that vendor fails to perform at acceptable
service levels.

Foreign Currency

The functional currency of all our foreign
subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of
our foreign subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate on
the balance sheet date. Revenue, costs and expenses are
translated at average rates of exchange in effect during the
year. We report translation gains and losses as a separate
component of stockholders’ equity. We include net gains and
losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in the
statement of operations and they were immaterial in all periods
presented.

Recent Pronouncements

On June 29, 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued SFAS 141,

“Business
Combinations,

” and SFAS 142,

“Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets.”

SFAS 141 supercedes APB Opinion No. 16,

“Business Combinations,

” and eliminates the
pooling-of-interests method of accounting for business
combinations, thus requiring that all business combinations be
accounted for using the purchase method. In addition, in
applying the purchase method, SFAS 141 changes the criteria
for recognizing intangible assets other than goodwill and states
that the following criteria should be considered in determining
the classification of intangible assets: (1) whether the
intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights,
or (2) whether the intangible asset is separable or
dividable from the acquired entity and capable of being sold,
transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged. If neither criteria
is met, the intangible assets are classified as goodwill and are
not amortized. We have applied the requirements of SFAS 141
to all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001.

SFAS 142 supercedes APB Opinion No. 17,

“Intangible Assets,

” and provides that goodwill
and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life
will no longer be amortized. However, these assets must be
reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if
an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. The
shift from an amortization approach to an impairment approach
applies to all acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001.
The additional goodwill amortization charge for businesses we
acquired subsequent to June 30, 2001 would have been
approximately $8.8 million in fiscal 2002 had this new
standard not been in place. Total goodwill amortization expense,
including impairments, was $139.5 million in fiscal 2001
and $122.6 million in fiscal 2002. We adopted the remaining
elements of this new standard in the first quarter of fiscal
2003 and therefore ceased goodwill amortization for acquisitions
made prior to July 1, 2001. However, it is possible that in
the future we may incur impairment charges related to the
goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future
acquisitions. In addition, we will continue to amortize most
purchased intangible assets and to assess those assets for
impairment as appropriate.

In connection with the transitional goodwill
impairment evaluation under SFAS 142, we will perform an
assessment of goodwill impairment as of August 1, 2002, the
date of adoption. To accomplish this, we will identify our
reporting units and determine the carrying value of each of them
by assigning the assets and



liabilities, including existing goodwill and
intangible assets, to those reporting units as of the date of
adoption. We will then have up to six months from the date of
adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and
compare it to the reporting unit’s carrying amount. To the
extent that a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its
fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit’s
goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of
the transitional impairment test. In the second step, we must
compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s
goodwill to its carrying amount, both of which will be measured
as of the date of adoption. The implied fair value of the
reporting unit’s goodwill is determined by allocating the
reporting unit’s fair value to all of its assets
(recognized and unrecognized) and liabilities in a manner
similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with
SFAS 141. This second step is required to be completed as
soon as possible, but no later than the end of the year of
adoption. Any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the
statement of operations.

As of the date of adoption of SFAS 142 on
August 1, 2002, we had an unamortized acquired intangible
assets balance of approximately $123.6 million, excluding
the balance of approximately $1.9 million for assembled
workforce reclassified to goodwill. As of that date, we also had
an unamortized goodwill balance of approximately
$430.8 million which included the amount of assembled
workforce reclassified to goodwill. These balances will be
subject to the transitional provisions of SFAS 141 and 142.
Transitional impairment losses that may be required to be
recognized upon adoption of SFAS 141 and 142 are
indeterminable at this time.

The following table shows our financial results
as they would have been if we had adopted the non-amortization
provisions of SFAS 142 as of the beginning of fiscal 2000:



In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets,”

which applies to financial statements issued
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001.
SFAS 144 supersedes FASB Statement 121,

“Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed Of,”

and portions of APB Opinion
No. 30,

“Reporting the Results of
Operations.”

SFAS 144 provides a single accounting
model for long-lived assets we expect to dispose of and
significantly changes the criteria for classifying an asset as
held-for-sale. This classification is important because
held-for-sale assets are not depreciated and are stated at the
lower of fair value or carrying amount. SFAS 144 also
requires expected future operating losses from discontinued
operations to be displayed in the period(s) in which the losses
are actually incurred, rather than when the amount of the loss
is estimated, as presently required. We adopted SFAS 144
effective August 1, 2002 and do not expect the adoption of
SFAS 144 to have a material impact on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

In November 2001, the FASB’s Emerging Issues
Task Force released Issue No. 01-9,

“Accounting for
Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of
the Vendor’s Product,”

which applies to annual or
interim financial statement periods beginning after
December 15, 2001. The release provides that cash
consideration (including sales incentives) that we give to our
customers or resellers should be accounted for as a reduction of
revenue rather than as an operating expense unless we receive a
benefit that we can identify and reasonably estimate. We adopted
this new release beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2002.
The adoption of EITF Issue No. 01-9 did not have a material
impact on our total net revenue and as a result we did not
reclassify prior period financial statements.

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146,

“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit and Disposal
Activities.”

This statement revises the accounting for
exit and disposal activities under EITF Issue No. 94-3,

“Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity.”

A formal
commitment to a plan to exit an activity or dispose of
long-lived assets will no longer be sufficient to record a
one-time charge for most exit and disposal costs. Instead,
companies will record exit or disposal costs when they are
incurred and can be measured at fair value, and will
subsequently adjust the recorded liability for changes in
estimated cash flows. The provisions of SFAS 146 are effective
prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after
December 31, 2002. Companies may not restate previously
issued financial statements for the effect of the provisions of
SFAS 146 and liabilities that a company previously recorded
under EITF Issue No. 94-3 are not affected. We do not
believe that the adoption of SFAS 146 will have a material
impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.



2.     Short-Term
Investments

The following schedule summarizes the estimated
fair value of our short-term investments as of the dates
indicated:

The following table summarizes the estimated fair
value of our available-for-sale debt securities held in
short-term investments classified by the stated maturity date of
the security:

3.     Marketable
Securities and Other Long-term Investments

We currently hold marketable securities that we
acquired in connection with strategic business transactions and
relationships. In accordance with SFAS 115, we classify
marketable securities that we buy and hold principally for the
purpose of selling in the near term as trading securities. We
report trading securities at estimated fair value and include
unrealized gains and losses on these securities in our net
income (loss). We classify our other marketable securities as
available-for-sale securities. We report available-for-sale
securities at estimated fair value and include unrealized gains
and losses on these securities in a separate component of
stockholders’ equity.

Marketable securities classified as trading and
available-for-sale at July 31, 2002 and 2001 are summarized
below. Estimated fair value is based on quoted market prices.



In fiscal 2002, proceeds from the sales of
available-for-sale securities totaled $25.0 million; gross
realized gains totaled $6.0 million and gross realized
losses totaled $2.9 million. In fiscal 2001, proceeds from
the sales of available-for-sale securities totaled
$21.5 million; gross realized gains totaled
$15.8 million and gross realized losses totaled
$4.9 million. We recorded charges of $40.2 million in
fiscal 2001 to write down certain available-for-sale securities
for which the decline in fair value below carrying value was
other-than-temporary.

Unrealized gains and losses on trading securities
are included in our net income (loss). We held no trading
securities at July 31, 2002.

Our marketable securities, which are quoted on
the Nasdaq Stock Market, are stocks of high technology companies
whose market prices have been extremely volatile and have
declined substantially during the past three years. These
declines have resulted, and could continue to result, in
material reductions in the carrying values of these assets. This
has a negative impact on our operating results. If these
securities experience further declines in fair value that are
considered other-than-temporary, we will reflect the additional
losses in our statement of operations in the period when the
subsequent impairment becomes apparent.

The fair values of our long-term investments
(consisting primarily of equity investments in privately held
companies) have also declined substantially since our initial
investments due to the volatility and economic downturn of the
high technology industry. We recorded losses of
$7.5 million in fiscal 2002 and $16.2 in fiscal 2001 and
charges of $9.5 million in fiscal 2002 and
$28.6 million in fiscal 2001, to write down certain
long-term investments for which the decline in fair value below
carrying value was other-than-temporary.

4.     Property and
Equipment

Property and equipment consisted of the following
as of the dates indicated:

Capital in progress consists primarily of costs
related to internal use software projects. As discussed in
Note 1, “Software Development Costs,” we
capitalize costs related to the development of computer



software for internal use in accordance with
SOP 98-1. We capitalized approximately $23.4 million
and $21.3 million of internal use software during fiscal
2001 and 2002, respectively. Costs related to internal use
software projects are included in the capital in progress
category of property and equipment until project completion, at
which time they are transferred to the computer software
category and amortized over their useful lives. Amortization
expense for capitalized internal use software was
$3.6 million in fiscal 2001 and $7.5 million in fiscal
2002. The net book value of completed capitalized internal use
software was $11.3 million at July 31, 2001 and
$15.6 million at July 31, 2002.

5.     Goodwill and
Intangible Assets

Goodwill and purchased intangible assets
consisted of the following at the dates indicated:

Accumulated amortization declined during fiscal
2002 due to the retirement of certain fully amortized goodwill
and intangible assets.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

We
adopted SFAS 142 on August 1, 2002. As a result,
goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to
annual impairment tests. Most other intangible assets will
continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. In
accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142, effective
August 1, 2002 we transferred the net balance of $1.9
million for assembled workforce to goodwill and will no longer
amortize that intangible asset. See Note 1.

We summarize the following expenses on the
“acquisition-related charges” line of our statement of
operations:



As discussed in Note 1, we regularly perform
reviews to determine if the carrying values of our goodwill and
intangible assets may be impaired. We look for the existence of
facts and circumstances, either internal or external, which
indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be
recovered.

Fiscal 2001

During fiscal 2001, events and circumstances
indicated possible impairment of certain long-lived assets,
consisting principally of acquired intangible assets and
goodwill recorded in connection with our acquisitions of Venture
Finance Software Corp. in August 2000, SecureTax.com in August
1999 and Hutchison Avenue Software Corporation in August 1999.
These indicators included the deterioration in the business
climate for Web-based companies and management’s intentions
relating to the continuation of certain services provided by our
Personal Finance segment.

We measured the impairment loss related to
long-lived assets based on the amount by which the carrying
amount of such assets exceeded their fair values. Our
measurement of fair value was based on an analysis of the future
discounted cash flows, as discussed in Note 1. In performing
this analysis, we used the best information available in the
circumstances, including reasonable and supportable assumptions
and projections. The discounted cash flow analysis considered
the likelihood of possible outcomes and was based on our best
estimate of projected future cash flows. For VFSC, we considered
the terminal value cash flows expected to result from the
disposition of the assets at the end of their useful lives. The
consideration from the disposition of a portion of VFSC, our
Quicken Bill Manager business, assisted management in the
determination of the fair value of the remaining assets. Based
on our analysis as described above, we recorded impairment
charges of $51.0 million, $26.0 million, and
$1.7 million, to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill
associated with VFSC, SecureTax and Hutchison, respectively. In
the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we reduced the carrying value
of the remaining VFSC goodwill to zero (see

Fiscal 2002

below).

Fiscal 2002

During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, events
and circumstances indicated impairment of goodwill and
intangible assets that we received in connection with our
acquisitions of an Internet-based advertising business from VFSC
in August 2000 (part of our Personal Finance segment) and the
Site Solutions business that we acquired from Boston Light Corp.
in August 1999 (part of our Small Business segment).

Indicators of impairment for our Internet-based
advertising business included a steep decline in demand for
online advertising reflecting the industry-wide decline in
Internet advertising spending, as well as management’s
assessment that revenues and profitability would continue to
decline in the future based on analyses and forecasts completed
during the second quarter of fiscal 2002. The primary indicator
of impairment for our Site Solutions business was
management’s decision to transition the customer base of
Site Solutions and collaborate with a third party to provide the
website building service. This collaboration, which began in the
second quarter of fiscal 2002, eliminated our use of technology
purchased from Boston Light.

In each case, we measured the impairment loss
based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets
exceeded their fair value based on lower projected profits and
decreases in cash flow. Our measurement of fair value was based
on an analysis of the future discounted cash flows as discussed
in Note 1. Based on our analyses, in the second quarter of
fiscal 2002 we recorded charges of $22.6 million
($17.4 million to acquisition-related charges and
$5.2 million to amortization of purchased software) to
reduce the carrying value of the assets associated with our
Internet-based advertising business to zero, and a charge of
$4.7 million ($4.6 million to acquisition-related
charges and $0.1 million to amortization of purchased
software) to reduce the carrying value of assets relating to our
Site Solutions business to zero.

6.     Comprehensive
Net Income (Loss)

SFAS 130,

“Reporting Comprehensive
Income,

” establishes standards for reporting and
displaying comprehensive net income (loss) and its
components in stockholders’ equity. SFAS 130 requires
the



components of other comprehensive income
(loss) such as changes in the fair value of
available-for-sale securities and foreign translation
adjustments to be added to our net income (loss) to arrive
at comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income
(loss) items have no impact on our net income
(loss) as presented in our statement of operations.

The components of accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss), net of income taxes, were as follows:

7.     Deferred
Stock-based Compensation

When we assume unvested stock options in
connection with acquisitions, we record deferred stock
compensation as a reduction of stockholders’ equity. The
amount recorded is equal to the difference between the exercise
price of the options related to future vesting periods and the
fair market value of Intuit stock as of the closing date of the
acquisition. When we grant restricted stock to employees that is
subject to vesting, we also record deferred stock compensation
equal to the difference between the



purchase price and the fair market value of the
stock at the date of grant. Deferred stock compensation is
amortized straight-line over the vesting term of these options
and restricted stock grants.

The following table summarizes the activity in
deferred stock-based compensation:

8.     Per Share
Data

We compute basic income or loss per share using
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. We compute diluted income or loss per share using
the weighted average number of common and dilutive common
equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common
equivalent shares consist of the shares issuable upon the
exercise of stock options under the treasury stock method. In
loss periods, basic and dilutive loss per share are identical
since the effect of common equivalent shares is anti-dilutive
and therefore excluded.

The following table presents the numerators and
denominators and the computation of basic and diluted income or
loss per share for fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002:



The effect of options to purchase
2.3 million and 8.3 million shares of common stock
were not included in the computation of diluted income per share
for fiscal 2000 and fiscal 2002, respectively, because the
option exercise prices were greater than the average market
price of common stock. For fiscal 2001, we excluded options to
purchase 14.6 million shares of common stock in our diluted
loss per share computation because we experienced a net loss for
the year.

9.     Acquisitions

In December 1999, we acquired all of the
outstanding stock of Rock Financial Corporation
(“RFC”), a provider of consumer mortgages, and Title
Source Inc., a title insurance and escrow company affiliated
with RFC, in exchange for the issuance of approximately
$370.0 million or 8.8 million shares of Intuit common
stock. RFC subsequently changed its name to Quicken Loans Inc.
These acquisitions were accounted for as pooling of interests in
accordance with APB 16. In July 2002 we sold our Quicken
Loans mortgage business and accounted for the sale as
discontinued operations. See Note 11.

The acquisitions described below have been
accounted for as purchase transactions and, accordingly, the
results of operations and financial position of the acquired
businesses are included in Intuit’s consolidated financial
statements from the date of acquisition. We allocate the
difference between the purchase price and the net book value of
acquired tangible assets between identified tangible assets and
goodwill. Identified intangible assets consist of customer
lists, covenants not to compete, purchased technology, assembled
workforce and trade names and logos.

Fiscal 2000

In fiscal 2000, we acquired Boston Light Software
Corp., SecureTax.com, and Turning Mill Software, Inc. We
purchased all of the outstanding common and Series A
preferred stock of Boston Light, a developer of software and
Web-based products for small businesses based in Massachusetts,
for approximately $33.5 million in Intuit common stock. In
connection with the agreement, Intuit also assumed 482,910 of
Boston Light’s outstanding employee stock options, which
were converted into options to purchase 160,970 shares of Intuit
common stock. We acquired all of the outstanding common stock of
SecureTax, a developer of online tax preparation and electronic
filing services based in Georgia, for approximately
$52.0 million in cash. We also acquired all of the
outstanding common stock of Turning Mill, a developer



of software and Web-based products headquartered
in Massachusetts, for approximately $22.1 million in Intuit
common stock.

Fiscal 2001

In fiscal 2001, we purchased all of the
outstanding securities of Venture Finance Software Corp. which
were not already held by Intuit (approximately 51%) for
approximately $118.0 million in cash (including
approximately $4.5 million in option exercise and tax
payments in connection with VFSC options exercised immediately
prior to the purchase). We also purchased all of the outstanding
stock of EmployeeMatters, Inc., in exchange for approximately
$41.9 million in Intuit common stock, the elimination of
approximately $8.0 million in bridge loans we extended to
EmployeeMatters prior to the closing, and the assumption of
approximately $3.4 million in liabilities. We acquired
substantially all of the assets of Tax Accounting and Software
Corporation for $63.0 million in cash and the assumption of
approximately $7.8 million in liabilities.

Fiscal 2002

In November 2001, we acquired substantially all
of the assets of OMware, Inc. for $35.5 million or
924,973 shares of Intuit common stock, approximately
$2.1 million in the assumption of debt and bridge loans and
up to $8 million in Intuit common stock to be issued
contingent upon the achievement of future performance objectives
by the business unit. OMware provides business management
software solutions for construction companies. Pursuant to
separate agreements, Intuit will pay up to $2 million in
cash over two years as part of a senior management performance
program. These amounts will be recorded as compensation expense
as amounts are earned. With the assistance of a professional
valuation services firm, we allocated approximately
$27.1 million of the purchase price to goodwill and
$8.5 million of the purchase price to identified intangible
assets. The identified intangible assets are being amortized
over five years.

In May 2002, we purchased all of the outstanding
stock of The Flagship Group for approximately $23.3 million
or 455,259 shares of Intuit common stock, the assumption of
$4.7 million in debt and $3.3 million in cash.
Flagship is the parent company of American Fundware, Inc., which
offers financial accounting solutions for nonprofit
organizations. In connection with the agreement, we also assumed
Flagship’s outstanding employee stock options for 1,204,000
shares of Flagship common stock, which were converted into
options to purchase 130,316 shares of Intuit common stock. With
the assistance of a professional valuation services firm, we
allocated approximately $29.6 million of the purchase price
to goodwill and $4.2 million of the purchase price to
identified intangible assets. The identified intangible assets
are being amortized over terms ranging from three to twelve
years.

In June 2002, we acquired all of the outstanding
stock of CBS Employer Services, Inc. for approximately
$75.3 million in cash (of which $25.4 million is
unpaid but accrued at July 31, 2002) and $3.2 million
or 73,795 shares of Intuit common stock. CBS is a provider of
full-service outsourced payroll functions for small businesses.
In connection with the agreement, we also assumed CBS’s
outstanding employee stock options for 665,504 shares of CBS
common stock, which were converted into options to purchase
193,891 shares of Intuit common stock. With the assistance of a
professional valuation services firm, we allocated approximately
$74.8 million of the purchase price to goodwill and
$9.3 million of the purchase price to identified intangible
assets. The identified intangible assets are being amortized
over terms ranging from five to six years.

In July 2002, we purchased all of the outstanding
stock of Management Reports, Inc. for approximately
$92.2 million in cash. MRI provides business management
software solutions for commercial and residential property
managers. We recorded the transaction in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2002 based on estimated financial information, which was
not materially different from the final information that became
available in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. With the
assistance of a professional valuation services firm, we
allocated approximately $73.4 million of the purchase price
to goodwill and $14.0 million of the



purchase price to identified intangible assets.
The identified intangible assets are being amortized over terms
ranging from five to seven years.

In July 2002, we acquired substantially all of
the assets of Eclipse, Inc. for approximately $88.3 million
in cash. Eclipse provides business management software solutions
for wholesale durable goods distributors. We recorded the
transaction in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 based on
estimated financial information, which was not materially
different from the final information that became available in
the first quarter of fiscal 2003. With the assistance of a
professional valuation services firm, we allocated approximately
$41.4 million of the purchase price to goodwill and
$35.8 million of the purchase price to identified
intangible assets. The identified intangible assets are being
amortized over terms ranging from one to seven years.

The following table shows net revenue, income
(loss) from continuing operations before cumulative effect
of accounting change, net income (loss) and basic and
diluted net income (loss) per share as they would have been
if we had completed the fiscal 2002 acquisitions on
August 1, 2000. Because the pro forma acquisition date is
prior to June 30, 2001, these figures include the effects
of amortization of goodwill and other identified intangible
assets from the date of acquisition through July 31, 2002.
Under the provisions of SFAS 142, goodwill amortization
would cease on August 1, 2002. This unaudited summary
information is presented for illustrative purposes and is not
necessarily indicative of results that would have actually
occurred had these acquisitions taken place at the beginning of
fiscal 2001.



Purchase prices for the acquisitions described
above have been allocated on the basis of their fair values on
the acquisition dates as follows:

Deferred stock compensation is recorded in
stockholders’ equity and is being amortized over the
vesting period of the applicable options using the straight-line
method. Until July 31, 2002, goodwill was amortized over
estimated useful lives which ranged from three to five years. We
implemented SFAS 142 on August 1, 2002. As a result,
goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to
annual impairment tests. Most other intangible assets will
continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives,
which range from one to fifteen years. In accordance with the
provisions of SFAS 142, effective August 1, 2002 we
transferred the net balance of $1.9 million for assembled
workforce to goodwill and will no longer amortize that
intangible asset. See Notes 1 and 5.

Of the total goodwill acquired in fiscal 2000,
none was deductible for income tax purposes. Of the total
goodwill acquired in fiscal 2001 and 2002, $148,950 and
$115,031, respectively, were deductible for income tax purposes.

The following table presents acquired goodwill by
reportable business segment:

10.

Divestitures

In January 2001, we sold certain assets of our
Quicken Insurance business to InsWeb Corporation for
approximately $10.8 million of InsWeb common stock. As a
result of the divestiture, we recorded a pre-tax gain of
$1.6 million and a related tax provision of
$0.6 million in fiscal 2001.

In May 2001, we sold the stock of Venture Finance
Software Corp., which held the technology assets of our Quicken
Bill Manager business, to Princeton eCom Corporation. In
exchange for these assets, Intuit was entitled to receive, at
Princeton eCom’s election, either approximately 20% of
Princeton eCom fully diluted common stock or cash payments of a
minimum of $37 million or a combination of stock and cash.
In connection with this disposition, we recorded a pre-tax loss
of $16.9 million and a related tax benefit of



$6.4 million in fiscal 2001. At
July 31, 2001, our contractual right to receive payment was
valued at $27 million. In fiscal 2002, we determined that
this asset was impaired and recorded a charge to reduce the
carrying value of our investment to its fair value of zero. See
Note 12.

In March 2002, we paid $12.0 million to
terminate our $20.3 million obligation under an interactive
services agreement related to our Quicken Bill Manager business.
When we terminated this agreement, we recorded a pre-tax gain of
$8.3 million and related tax expense of $2.7 million
in fiscal 2002.

11.     Discontinued
Operations

We acquired our Quicken Loans mortgage business
segment in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests
in December 1999. See Note 9. On July 31, 2002, we
sold that business to a company called BRFC LLC. We transferred
all of our capital stock in Quicken Loans Inc. and Title Source,
Inc. to Rock Acquisition Corporation (“Rock”), a
newly-created corporation, then subsequently sold all of the
voting stock of Rock to BRFC. The voting stock represented 87.5%
of Rock’s total outstanding common stock. We retain a 12.5%
non-voting equity interest in Rock and our investment will be
accounted for on a cost basis since we do not have the ability
to exercise significant influence.

Prior to July 31, 2002, Quicken Loans Inc.
and Title Source, Inc. repaid all outstanding intercompany
balances and the net tangible shareholders’ equity in
excess of $33.0 million to Intuit. We received
$33.0 million from BFRC and a five-year secured promissory
note in the principal amount of $23.3 million from Rock as
consideration. The note will be repayable earlier if Rock
achieves certain financial performance targets. We will earn
market interest rates on the promissory note, which is recorded
as a long-term note receivable in other assets on the balance
sheet.

Rock continues to offer loans under the Quicken
Loans brand and is licensing from Intuit the use of the Quicken
Loans trademark for its residential home loan and home equity
loan products. We will receive a minimum royalty of
$1.8 million a year for each of the next five years under
this licensing agreement. In addition, we entered into a
five-year distribution agreement under which Quicken Loans will
provide mortgage services on Quicken.com. We will receive a
minimum fee of $0.8 million a year under this distribution
agreement. The royalties from the licensing agreement and the
fees from the distribution agreement will be recorded as earned
and included in other income on our statement of operations. We
have also agreed to continue providing a line of credit of up to
$375.0 million to fund mortgage loans for a transition
period of up to six months. The line expires on January 31,
2003. The line of credit is secured by the related mortgage
loans and the interest rate is based on the six-month LIBOR rate
plus 1.5%. The balance outstanding on this line of credit of
$245.6 million at July 31, 2002 is included on our
balance sheet under amounts due from discontinued operations
entities.

We accounted for the sale of Quicken Loans as
discontinued operations. In accordance with APB Opinion
No. 30, the net assets, operating results and cash flows of
Quicken Loans have been segregated from continuing operations in
our balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of
cash flows. Net income (loss) from discontinued operations of
$(16.5) million in fiscal 2000, $21.0 million in fiscal
2001 and $47.1 million in fiscal 2002 were net of income
tax (benefits) provisions of $(9.4) million, $12.2 million,
and $26.5 million in those years, respectively. The sale
resulted in a pretax gain of $23.3 million in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2002. We did not record the tax benefit related to the
gain on the transaction because we cannot be assured that we
will realize the tax benefit. We recorded the transaction based
on preliminary financial information, which is subject to change
based on an audit of the final tangible shareholders’
equity balance of Quicken Loans.

12.     Loss on
Impairment of Long-lived Asset

In connection with the sale of our Quicken Bill
Manager business in May 2001, we acquired a $27.0 million
long-term asset related to future consideration from Princeton
eCom which was recorded as other assets on the balance sheet at
July 31, 2001. See Note 10.



As discussed in Note 1, we regularly perform
reviews to determine if the carrying values of our long-lived
assets are impaired. We look for facts or circumstances, either
internal or external, that indicate that the carrying value of
an asset cannot be recovered. During fiscal 2002, events and
circumstances indicated impairment of this asset. These
indicators included the deterioration of Princeton eCom’s
financial position (including cash flows and liquidity) and the
decreased likelihood that it would receive future funding. We
considered the implied fair value of our investment based on
Princeton eCom’s most recent round of planned funding, as
well as the fair value of our investment if funding were
received. Based on our analysis we recorded a charge of
$27.0 million in fiscal 2002 to reduce the carrying value
of this asset to its fair value of zero.

13.     Charge for
Vacant Facilities

During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we
concluded that we would not occupy two vacant leased buildings
in Mountain View, California and that we would be unable to
recover a substantial portion of our lease obligations by
subleasing the vacant space. The resulting $13.2 million
charge was equal to the remaining future lease commitments for
these facilities, net of estimated future sublease income. The
estimated costs of abandoning these leased facilities reflected
management’s best estimates based on market information and
trend analyses compiled by our facilities management team with
the help of a commercial real estate brokerage firm retained by
Intuit.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we made
cash lease payments for these two buildings of
$0.6 million, reducing the original $13.2 million
reserve to a balance of $12.6 million at July 31,
2002. The short-term portion of the reserve is in other current
liabilities and the long-term portion is in long-term
obligations on our balance sheet. The total reserve is expected
to be utilized by the end of fiscal 2010. Our actual future cash
payments may exceed the total reserve balance by a maximum of
$3.7 million if we are unable to sublease either of the
properties.

14.     Industry
Segment and Geographic Information

SFAS 131,

“Disclosures about Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information,”

establishes
standards for the way in which public companies disclose certain
information about operating segments in the company’s
financial reports. Due to the sale of our Quicken Loans mortgage
business segment as well as to several acquisitions during
fiscal 2002, we have reevaluated our operating segments.
Consistent with SFAS 131, we have defined seven operating
segments, described below, based on factors such as how we
manage our operations and how our chief operating decision maker
views results. All operating segments except Global Business are
based in the United States and sell primarily to customers
located there. We have reclassified prior year financial
information to conform to the current year presentation for
comparability.

services revenue is minimal. Other revenue consists of
Quicken.com advertising revenue and royalties from online
transactions revenue.



Global Business product revenue is derived
primarily from QuickBooks, Quicken and QuickTax desktop software
products in Canada and Yayoi small business desktop accounting
products in Japan. Global Business services revenue primarily
consists of revenue from software maintenance contracts sold
with Yayoi software in Japan.

Small Business Verticals and Other revenue is
derived primarily from four businesses that we acquired in
fiscal 2002 that provide small business management software
solutions for vertical industries. Those businesses are Intuit
Construction Business Solutions (formerly OMware, Inc.); Intuit
Public Sector Solutions (formerly The Flagship Group); Intuit
MRI Real Estate Solutions (formerly Management Reports, Inc.);
and Intuit Eclipse Distribution Management Solutions (formerly
Eclipse, Inc.). See Note 9.

The accounting policies of the operating segments
are the same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies in Note 1. Intuit does not track assets
by operating segments and, consequently, does not disclose
assets by operating segments. The following results for the
fiscal years ended July 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002 are broken
out by our operating segments.





(1)

Other includes revenue and segment operating
    income (loss) related to our vertical business operations as
    well as reconciling items such as acquisition-related costs,
    including amortization of purchased software and charges for
    purchased research and development, and other common costs not
    allocated to specific segments. Certain indirect operating costs
    were no longer allocated to our reporting segments beginning in
    fiscal 2002. As a result, segment operating income (loss) and
    common expenses for fiscal 2000 and 2001 have been reclassified
    to conform to the fiscal 2002 presentation for comparability.



15.     Other Current
Liabilities

Other current liabilities at July 31, 2001
and 2002 were as follows:

16.     Notes Payable
and Commitments

Notes Payable

In March 2001, our Japanese subsidiary,
Intuit KK, refinanced its one-year loan agreement with a
Japanese bank for approximately $31.2 million. During the
third quarter of fiscal 2002, we elected to pay half the
outstanding balance and obtained a three-month extension on the
remaining balance of approximately $15.6 million. The total
principal balance of the loan is currently being extended from
month to month and is denominated in Japanese yen. The interest
rate is variable based on the Tokyo inter-bank offered rate or
the short-term prime rate offered in Japan. At July 31,
2002, the rate was approximately 0.56%. The fair value of the
loan approximates cost as the interest rate on the borrowings is
adjusted periodically to reflect market rates, which are
currently significantly lower in Japan than in the United States.

Commitments

Intuit leases office facilities and equipment
under various operating lease agreements. The leases provide for
annual rent increases of up to 10%. Annual minimum commitments
under these leases are shown in the table below. The table
includes leases for two vacant facilities in Mountain View,
California and excludes any potential future sublease income for
those facilities. See Note 13.

Total lease expense for the years ended
July 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002 was approximately
$20.8 million, $25.0 million, and $25.6 million,
respectively. Lease expense for fiscal 2002 does not include a
charge of $13.2 million for the two vacant facilities
referred to above. See Note 13.

In connection with the sale of our Quicken Loans
mortgage business in July 2002, we agreed to continue providing
a line of credit of up to $375.0 million to fund mortgage
loans for the purchasing company for a transition period of up
to six months. The line of credit is secured by the related
mortgage loans. The



balance outstanding on this line of credit of
$245.6 million at July 31, 2002 is included on our
balance sheet under amounts due from discontinued operations
entities. See Note 11.

17.     Stockholders’
Equity

Stock Option Plans

On February 1, 1993, our stockholders
adopted the 1993 Equity Incentive Plan. The 1993 Plan terminated
on January 18, 2002 when our stockholders approved our 2002
Equity Incentive Plan. In connection with our adoption of the
2002 Plan (described below), we transferred 1,900,000 of the
shares remaining available for grant under the 1993 Plan to the
2002 Plan and we ceased making new grants under the 1993 Plan.
We removed the remaining 1,909,906 shares available for
grant under the 1993 Plan from the pool of options available for
grant when the plan terminated. All outstanding options under
the 1993 Plan remain in effect in accordance with their terms.
Under the 1993 Plan, we were permitted to grant incentive and
non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards and stock
bonuses to employees, directors, consultants, and independent
contractors of and advisors to Intuit. The Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors or its delegees determined
who would receive grants, exercisability, exercise price and
other terms. The option exercise price was generally the fair
market value at the date of grant. The outstanding options
generally vest over four years based on continued service and
expire after ten years.

On October 7, 1996, we adopted the 1996
Directors Stock Option Plan. This plan provides for
non-qualified stock options for a specified number of shares to
be granted to all non-employee directors of Intuit. As of
December 2001, Board members who serve on the Audit Committee
and Compensation Committee receive additional annual grants. The
option exercise price equals the fair market value at the date
of grant. Most options are subject to vesting over time based on
continued service, with vesting periods ranging from two to four
years. All options expire after ten years.

On November 11, 1998, we adopted the 1998
Option Plan for Mergers and Acquisitions. Under the 1998 Plan,
we may grant non-qualified stock options to individuals who we
hire as a result of our acquisitions of, or mergers with, other
companies. The 1998 Plan was designed to meet the “broadly
based plans” exemption from the stockholder approval
requirement for stock option plans under the Nasdaq Stock Market
listing requirements at the time the plan was adopted and,
accordingly, has not been submitted to Intuit stockholders for
approval. Options under the 1998 Plan can only be granted to
eligible individuals within 18 months following the
completion of the relevant acquisition or merger. Options
granted under the 1998 Plan have an exercise price not less than
the fair market value of Intuit’s common stock on the date
of grant. During fiscal 2002, Intuit changed its standard option
vesting schedule so that future options granted generally become
exercisable over a three-year period based on continued service
and expire seven years after the grant date. Prior to that
change, options generally vested over four years and expired ten
years after the grant date. Options granted to officers hired as
a result of a merger or acquisition cannot exceed 45% of all
shares reserved for grant under the 1998 Plan.

On January 18, 2002, our stockholders
approved the 2002 Equity Incentive Plan. Under the 2002 Plan, we
may grant incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted
stock awards and stock bonuses to employees, directors,
consultants, and independent contractors of and advisors to
Intuit. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or
its delegees determines who will receive grants, exercisability,
exercise price and other terms. The option exercise price is
generally the fair market value at the date of grant. During
fiscal 2002, Intuit changed its standard option vesting schedule
so that future options granted generally become exercisable over
a three-year period based on continued service and expire seven
years after the grant date. Prior to that change, options vested
over four years and expired ten years after the grant date.

In addition, in several instances we have assumed
the outstanding options of companies that we acquired. Intuit
granted no further options under the acquired companies’
option plans after the date of acquisition. We assumed options
in connection with our acquisitions of Boston Light Software
Corp. and Hutchison Avenue Software Corporation in August 1999,
Rock Financial Corporation in December 1999,



EmployeeMatters, Inc. in January 2001, The
Flagship Group in May 2002 and CBS Employer Services, Inc. in
June 2002.

A summary of activity under all option plans is
as follows:

(1)

Includes 2,364,140 shares reflecting options that
    were canceled and not returned to any option pool because they
    were granted under expired plans, and 1,909,906 shares that were
    eliminated from shares available for grant in connection with
    the termination of the 1993 Plan.



We define net option grants as options granted
less options canceled or expired and returned to the pool of
options available for grant. For fiscal 2000, net option grants
were 5,835,786 shares or 2.9% of the 204,299,955 shares
outstanding at July 31, 2001. Net option grants for fiscal
2001 were 9,880,453 shares or 4.7% of the 210,526,239 shares
outstanding at July 31, 2001. Net option grants for fiscal
2002 were 6,825,109 shares or 3.2% of the 211,163,641 shares
outstanding at July 31, 2002. If net option grants are
calculated by subtracting both canceled or expired options that
were returned to the pool of options available for grant and
options canceled from expired plans, net option grants were
5,264,006 shares or 2.6% of outstanding shares in fiscal 2000,
9,689,233 shares or 4.6% of outstanding shares in fiscal 2001
and 4,460,969 shares or 2.1% of outstanding shares in fiscal
2002.

There were 11,608,020, 15,551,666 and 18,264,940
options exercisable under the various plans at July 31,
2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. At July 31, 2002, there
were 171,875 shares available for grant under the 1996
Directors Stock Option Plan, 2,134,701 shares available for
grant under the 1998 Plan and 8,086,912 shares available
for grant under the 2002 Plan.

The following table summarizes information about
stock options outstanding as of July 31, 2002:

Stock Split

Intuit’s Board of Directors authorized a
three-for-one stock split on September 8, 1999. This was
effected by distributing a 200% stock dividend on
September 30, 1999 to stockholders of record on
September 20, 1999. We have restated all share and per
share amounts referred to in the financial statements and notes
to reflect this stock split.

Stock Repurchase Program

In May 2001, Intuit’s Board of Directors
authorized the company to repurchase up to $500.0 million
of common stock from time to time over a three-year period. In
July 2002, our Board of Directors increased the authorized
purchase amount by $250.0 million. The stock repurchase
program is intended to help offset some of the dilution
resulting from the issuance of shares under Intuit’s
employee stock plans. Shares of stock repurchased under the
program become treasury shares. During the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2001, we repurchased 238,500 shares of our common
stock under this program for an aggregate cost of approximately
$8.4 million. During fiscal 2002, we repurchased
7,361,839 shares of our common stock under this program for
an aggregate cost of approximately $318.4 million. During
fiscal 2002, we reissued 4,621,793 million shares of
treasury stock in connection with employee stock plans.



When we reissue treasury shares, if the proceeds
from the sale are more than the average price we paid to acquire
the shares we record an increase in additional paid-in capital.
Conversely, if the proceeds from the sale are less than the
average price we paid to acquire the shares, we record a
decrease in additional paid-in capital to the extent of
increases previously recorded for similar transactions and a
decrease in retained earnings for any remaining amount.

Repurchases through July 31, 2002 have had
no significant impact on our net income or loss per share.
Intuit intends to continue using its cash and cash equivalents
to fund these repurchases.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In October 1996, Intuit adopted an Employee Stock
Purchase Plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue
Code. A total of 3,800,000 shares of common stock are reserved
for issuance under the plan. The plan allows eligible employees
to purchase Intuit’s stock at 85% of the lower of the fair
market value at the beginning of each 12-month offering period
or at the end of the applicable six-month purchase period.
During fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002 employees purchased 355,281,
469,873 and 583,990 shares, respectively. At July 31, 2002,
there were 1,261,479 shares available for issuance under this
plan.

Stock-Based Compensation

We follow APB Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,”

in
accounting for stock-based compensation. Accordingly, we are not
required to record compensation expense when stock options are
granted to employees, as long as the exercise price is not less
than the fair market value of the stock when the option is
granted, and we are not required to record compensation expense
in connection with the Employee Stock Purchase Plan as long as
the purchase price is not less than 85% of the lower of the fair
market value at the beginning of each 12-month offering period
or at the end of each applicable six-month purchase period. In
October 1995, the FASB issued SFAS 123,

“Accounting for
Stock Based Compensation.”

Although SFAS 123 allows us
to continue to follow the present APB 25 guidelines, we are
required to disclose pro forma net income (loss) and net
income (loss) per share as if we had adopted SFAS 123. The
pro forma impact of applying SFAS 123 in fiscal 2000, 2001 and
2002 will not necessarily be representative of the pro forma
impact in future years.

We have elected to use the Black-Scholes model to
estimate the fair value of options granted. This valuation model
was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded
options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. This model requires the input of highly subjective
assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.
Because our employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and
because changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect this estimate, we believe the Black-Scholes
model does not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of
the fair value of our employee stock options. Inputs used for
the valuation model are as follows:



Our pro forma net income (loss) and diluted
net income (loss) per share would have been as follows if
we had adopted SFAS 123 and recorded compensation expense for
our stock option plans and Employee Purchase Plan in accordance
with its provisions:

The weighted average fair values of options
granted during fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002 were approximately
$23.27, $21.77 and $20.31, respectively.

18.     Performance
Sharing and Benefit Plans

Performance Sharing Plan

Eligible employees participate in Intuit’s
performance sharing plan. The Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors determines aggregate amounts to be paid under
the plan. Performance-sharing expense for fiscal 2000, 2001 and
2002 was approximately $20.7 million, $21.9 million
and $17.6 million, respectively.

Executive Deferred Compensation Plan

Intuit adopted the Executive Deferred
Compensation Plan effective March 15, 2002. The plan allows
executives who meet minimum compensation requirements to defer
up to 50% of their salaries and up to 100% of their bonuses and
commissions. We have agreed to credit the participants’
contributions with earnings that reflect the performance of
certain independent investment funds. We may also make
discretionary employer contributions to participant accounts.
The timing, amounts and vesting schedules of employer
contributions are at our sole discretion. The benefits under
this plan are unsecured and are general assets of Intuit.
Participants are generally eligible to receive payment of their
vested benefit at the end of their elected deferral period or
after termination of their employment with Intuit for any
reason. Discretionary company contributions and the related
earnings vest completely upon the participant’s disability,
death or a change of control of Intuit. We made no employer
contributions to the plan during fiscal 2002.

Benefit Plans

Employees who participate in the Intuit 401(k)
Plan may contribute up to 20% of pre-tax salary to the plan,
subject to IRS limitations. Intuit matches a specified portion
of the employee contributions up to a maximum amount per
employee per year. The amount is subject to change on an annual
basis. At July 31, 2001 and 2002, the match was 75%, up to
$2,500. Matching contributions were approximately
$6.6 million, $6.9 million and $8.4 million,
respectively, for the years ended July 31, 2000, 2001 and
2002. Participating employees age 50 or older may make catch-up
contributions. These contributions are not matched.

19.     Stockholder
Rights Plan

On April 29, 1998, the Board of Directors
adopted a stockholder rights plan designed to protect the
long-term value of Intuit for its stockholders during any future
unsolicited acquisition attempt. In connection with the plan,
the Board declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase
right for each share of Intuit’s common stock outstanding
on May 11, 1998 (the “Record Date”) and further
directed the



issuance of one such right with respect to each
share of Intuit’s common stock that is issued after the
Record Date, except in certain circumstances. If a person or a
group (an “Acquiring Person”) acquires 20% or more of
Intuit’s common stock, or announces an intention to make a
tender offer for Intuit’s common stock, the consummation of
which would result in a person or group becoming an Acquiring
Person, then the rights will be distributed (the
“Distribution Date”). After the Distribution Date,
each right may be exercised for 1/3000th of a share of a newly
designated Series B Junior Participating Preferred stock at
an exercise price of approximately $83.33 per share. The
preferred stock has been structured so that the value of
1/3000th of a share of such preferred stock will approximate the
value of one share of common stock. The rights will expire on
May 1, 2008. In July 2002, we adopted a policy that
requires an independent committee of our Board of Directors to
review the rights plan at least once every three years to
consider whether maintaining the rights plan continues to be in
the best interests of Intuit and its stockholders.

20.     Income
Taxes

Income (loss) from continuing operations
before income taxes included income (loss) from foreign
operations of $4.4 million, $11.2 million and
$22.4 million for fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively.
The provision (benefit) for income taxes from continuing
operations consisted of the following:

Differences between income taxes calculated using
the federal statutory income tax rate of 35% and the provision
(benefit) for income taxes from continuing operations were
as follows:



Tax savings from deductions associated with our
various stock option plans are not reflected in the current
federal and state provisions. Savings were approximately
$93.5 million in fiscal 2000, $59.5 million in fiscal
2001 and $53.2 million in fiscal 2002. These amounts were
credited to stockholders’ equity and reduced taxes payable.

Significant deferred tax assets and liabilities
were as follows:

We have provided a valuation reserve related to
the benefits of losses in our foreign subsidiaries and certain
state capital loss carryforwards that we believe are unlikely to
be realized. The valuation allowance decreased by
$0.2 million in fiscal 2000, did not change in fiscal 2001
and decreased by $2.1 million in fiscal 2002.

At July 31, 2002, we had U.S. federal
and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$26.1 million and $8.6 million, respectively. These
net operating losses will expire at various dates beginning in
fiscal 2005 if not utilized. At July 31, 2002, we also had
various state tax credit carryforwards totaling approximately
$13.8 million. The state credit carryforwards have no expiration
date. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be
subject to substantial annual limitation due to ownership change
limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of
net operating losses before utilization.

21.     Litigation

On March 3, 2000, a class action lawsuit,
Bruce v. Intuit Inc., was filed in the United States District
Court, Central District of California, Eastern Division. Two
virtually identical lawsuits were later filed: Rubin v. Intuit
Inc., was filed on March 8, 2000 in the United States
District Court, Southern District of New York and Newby v.
Intuit Inc. was filed on April 27, 2000, in the United
States District Court, Central District of California, Eastern
Division. The Bruce and Newby lawsuits were consolidated into
one lawsuit, In re Intuit Privacy Litigation, filed on
July 28, 2000 in the United States District Court, Central
District of California, Eastern Division. Following
Intuit’s successful motion to dismiss several of the
claims, an amended complaint was filed on May 2, 2001. A
similar lawsuit, Almanza v. Intuit Inc. was filed on
March 22, 2000 in the Superior Court of the State of
California, San Bernardino County, Rancho Cucamonga Division. An
amended complaint in the Almanza suit was filed on
October 26, 2000. These purported class actions alleged
violations of various federal and California statutes and common
law claims



for invasion of privacy based upon the alleged
intentional disclosure to third parties of personal and private
customer information entered at Intuit’s Quicken.com Web
site. The complaints sought injunctive relief, orders to
disgorge profits related to the alleged acts, and statutory and
other damages. In August 2001, Intuit and the plaintiffs’
counsel in all of the cases except Rubin reached an agreement in
principle to resolve the cases, subject to court approval, based
on terms that are not material to Intuit. The Rubin case was
dismissed on November 19, 2001.

Intuit is subject to other routine legal
proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened
litigation, that arise in the normal course of our business. We
currently believe that the ultimate amount of liability, if any,
for any pending claims of any type (either alone or combined)
will not materially affect our financial position, results of
operations or liquidity. However, the ultimate outcome of any
litigation is uncertain, and either unfavorable or favorable
outcomes could have a material negative impact. Regardless of
outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on Intuit because
of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other
factors.

22.     Related Party
Transactions

We participated in the formation of Venture
Finance Software Corp. in May 1998 in order to facilitate the
development of certain Web-oriented finance products. At
July 31, 2000, we held a 49% non-voting equity interest in
VFSC. We entered into agreements with VFSC to provide it with
services related to on-going development of Web-oriented finance
products and received cost reimbursements of approximately
$23.8 million in fiscal 2000 for development and
administrative services provided in connection with this
agreement. In August 2000, we acquired all of the outstanding
securities of VFSC. See Note 9. In May 2001, we sold
certain technology assets acquired from VFSC to Princeton eCom
Corporation. See Note 10.

Loans to executive officers and other employees
at July 31, 2001 and 2002 were as follows:

Loans to executive officers are primarily
relocation loans. Of the total loans to executive officers at
July 31, 2002, $9.5 million accrue no interest for
either the term of the note or for up to four years. The
remaining loans to executive officers at July 31, 2002
accrue interest at rates equal to the applicable federal rates
in effect at the time the loans were made. Of the total
outstanding loans to executive officers and other employees at
July 31, 2002, loans with a remaining principal balance of
$20.2 million are secured by real property. The loans have
terms which range from one to ten years.



23.     Selected
Quarterly Consolidated Financial Data (Unaudited)

The following tables contain selected quarterly
consolidated financial data for fiscal years 2001 and 2002. We
accounted for the July 2002 sale of our Quicken Loans mortgage
business segment as discontinued operations. As a result, the
operating results of Quicken Loans have been segregated from
continuing operations in our consolidated financial statements
and in these tables. See Note 11.

24.

Event Subsequent to Date of Independent
    Auditors’ Report (Unaudited)

On September 13, 2002, we completed the
purchase of Blue Ocean Software, Inc. for approximately
$170.0 million in cash. Blue Ocean offers software
solutions that help businesses manage their information
technology resources and assets. Intuit plans to operate Blue
Ocean as a separate business unit under its Small Business
division led by Blue Ocean’s chief executive officer and
headquartered in Tampa, Florida.

    Chief Financial Officer of Intuit, has decided to retire from
    Intuit at the end of the calendar year and will remain in his
    current role until then.
