BUSINESS

CORPORATE BACKGROUND

General

Intuit Inc. is a leading provider of business and financial

Quicken, simplify small business management, tax preparation and

employees in offices across the United States and
internationally in Canada, the United Kingdom and several other
locations.

Intuit was incorporated in California in March 1984. In March
1993, we reincorporated in Delaware and completed our initial

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Intuit’s Mission

Intuit’s mission is to revolutionize people’s lives by
solving important problems. Our goal is to create solutions so
profound and simple that customers wouldn’t dream of going
back to their old ways of keeping their books, managing their
businesses, preparing their or their clients’ taxes, or
organizing their personal finances.

We have three business portfolios: Small Business, Tax and
Other. These three portfolios contain a total of five business
segments, which are discussed below.



Small Business.

Our Small Business portfolio
consists of two segments, QuickBooks-Related and Intuit-Branded
Small Business.

•

QuickBooks-Related includes our QuickBooks accounting and
    business management software for small businesses as well as the
    products and services that can be added on to QuickBooks. These
    include financial supplies, QuickBooks Payroll, merchant
    services and technical support.

•

Intuit-Branded Small Business products and services are designed
    primarily for small and medium-sized businesses and include
    outsourced payroll and solutions designed to meet the
    specialized needs of businesses in the property management,
    wholesale durable goods distribution and construction
    industries. The average selling prices of the Intuit-Branded
    Small Business software products for selected industries are
    significantly higher than those for our core small business
    products.

Tax.

Our Tax portfolio consists of two segments,
Consumer Tax and Professional Tax.

•

Consumer Tax includes our TurboTax consumer tax return
    preparation products and services.

•

Professional Tax includes our Lacerte and ProSeries professional
    tax products and services.

Other.

Our Other portfolio is one business
segment, Other Businesses, which consists primarily of our
Quicken personal finance products and services and our
businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom.

Company Growth Strategy

Intuit has a tradition of successful customer-driven invention
– applying technology and services to address complex
customer problems and develop solutions that make tasks simpler.
This tradition has allowed us to build a strong portfolio of
businesses that are dedicated to satisfying a variety of
customer needs. By applying strategic and operational rigor to
this foundation, we believe we can continue to deliver solid
revenue and profit growth.

Four key fundamentals support our growth strategy:

•

We carefully choose the businesses we are in, focusing primarily
    on small business, consumer and professional tax, and
    accountants. We choose to be in businesses with large,
    underserved market opportunities where we believe we have the
    strategic and durable advantage to produce long-term profitable
    growth. We have made a number of acquisitions and divestitures
    in the past several years to adjust our business portfolio so
    that it remains consistent with this focus.

•

We actively look for significant new customer problems and apply
    our core competence of customer-driven invention to solve those
    problems with simple, easy-to-use solutions.

•

At the same time, we solicit and act on feedback from our
    customers so that we can continually improve our existing
    products and services. Our goal is customers who are so happy
    with our products and services that they actively recommend them
    to others. We call these customers promoters, who create
    positive word of mouth and brand preference.

•

We use operational rigor and process excellence methodology,
    tools and resources to execute more effectively on a daily
    basis. Our goal is better customer experiences at lower cost.

Right for Me Initiatives

Our focus on customer needs is embodied in Right for Me
initiatives in all our business segments. Rather than approach
our targeted markets with a “one size fits all”
mentality, we dig deeper to understand the many different needs
of various customer segments. We then use this knowledge to
develop products and services to meet those different needs.
Over the past several years, for example, we have gone from
offering just two versions of QuickBooks – QuickBooks Basic
and QuickBooks Pro – to offering over 20 QuickBooks
solutions. These solutions range from QuickBooks Simple Start
for small businesses just getting started to QuickBooks
Enterprise Solutions for small businesses with more complex
accounting needs to versions of QuickBooks designed to meet the
needs of specific industries. We are also pursuing multi-year
Right for Me initiatives in our Consumer Tax, Professional Tax
and Other Businesses segments. See “Products and
Services” below for more information on these
business-specific initiatives.



PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

Intuit offers products and services in five business segments:
QuickBooks-Related, Intuit-Branded Small Business, Consumer Tax,
Professional Tax and Other Businesses. Our primary products and
services are sold mainly in the United States and are described
below. For a discussion of financial information about these
segments, see

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”

in
Item 7 and Note 9 to the financial statements in
Item 8.

QuickBooks-Related

QuickBooks.

Our QuickBooks product line brings
bookkeeping capabilities and business management tools to small
business users in an easy-to-use design that does not require
them to be familiar with debit/credit accounting. As part of our
Right for Me strategy, we offer a range of products to suit the
needs of different types of small businesses. Our products
include QuickBooks Simple Start, which provides accounting
functionality suitable for very small, less complex businesses;
QuickBooks Pro, which provides accounting functionality suitable
for slightly larger businesses, including those with payroll
needs; QuickBooks Pro for Mac; QuickBooks Premier, for small
businesses needing more advanced accounting functionality; and
QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions, designed for businesses with up
to 250 employees. Our Premier and Enterprise products also come
in a range of industry-specific editions, including Accountant,
Manufacturing and Wholesale, Retail, Non-Profit, Contractor, and
Professional Services. We also offer a web-based version of
QuickBooks called QuickBooks Online Edition that is suitable for
multiple users working in multiple locations.

As part of our Right for Me strategy, we also offer the
following business solutions that go beyond accounting software
to address a variety of small business needs. We typically
market these products and services to existing QuickBooks
customers.

Financial Supplies.

We offer a range of financial
supplies designed for small businesses and individuals for use
with QuickBooks. These include paper checks, envelopes, invoices
and deposit slips. We also offer tax forms, tax return
presentation folders and other supplies for professional tax
preparers. Our customers can personalize many products to
incorporate their logos and use a variety of color, font and
design options.

QuickBooks Payroll.

QuickBooks Payroll is a family of
products sold on a subscription basis to small businesses that
prepare their own payrolls. These include QuickBooks Standard
Payroll, which provides payroll tax tables and federal forms;
QuickBooks Enhanced Payroll, which in addition to the Standard
features also provides state forms and workers’
compensation tracking; and QuickBooks Enhanced Payroll Plus,
which includes QuickBooks software upgrades. Direct deposit and
electronic tax payment and filing services are also available
with some of these offerings for additional fees.

Innovative Merchant Solutions (IMS).

Our
IMS business offers a full range of merchant services to
small businesses nationwide. These include credit card, debit
card, electronic benefits, check guarantee and gift card
processing services as well as web-based transaction processing
services for online merchants. In addition to processing
services, IMS provides a full range of support for its merchants
that includes customer service, charge-back retrieval and
support, and fraud and loss prevention screening.

QuickBooks Point of Sale Solutions.

Our QuickBooks Point
of Sale offering helps retailers manage customer transactions
and inventories. The Basic version is suitable for single stores
that want to process sales using barcodes and track inventory
and customer purchases while the Pro version offers more



advanced functionality such as serial number tracking and the
ability to process layaways and special orders. The Pro
Multi-Store version allows the transfer of information between
stores. We sell this software with or without the accompanying
hardware.

QuickBooks Technical Support.

We offer several technical
support options to our QuickBooks customers. These include
support plans that are sold separately and priced based on the
level of personal assistance and response time the customer
requires as well as a free self-help information section on our
QuickBooks.com web site.

Intuit Developer Network.

The Intuit Developer Network is
an initiative that encourages third-party software developers to
build applications that exchange data with QuickBooks and other
Intuit products by giving them access to certain application
programming interfaces. At the end of fiscal 2005, approximately
41,900 developers had registered to receive our
IDN developer kit since the inception of the program in
2001 and approximately 415 third-party applications were
available for QuickBooks and other Intuit products.

Intuit-Branded Small Business

We offer Intuit-branded outsourced payroll and accounting and
enterprise resource planning solutions designed to meet the
specialized requirements of businesses in three selected
industries.

Outsourced Payroll.

Our outsourced payroll services
consist of QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service, Complete Payroll
and Premier Payroll Service. QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service
provides the back-end aspects of payroll processing, including
tax payments and filings, for customers who process their
payrolls using QuickBooks. Complete Payroll provides
traditional, full service payroll processing, direct deposit,
check delivery and tax payment services. We offer Complete
Payroll with QuickBooks integration or on a standalone basis. We
also continue to provide full service outsourced payroll to our
Premier Payroll Service customers.

Intuit Real Estate Solutions (IRES).

Our
IRES business offers MRI software and related
technical support, consulting and training services for
residential, commercial and corporate property managers.
IRES software products are available as licenses and under
an ASP service model. In addition to its domestic
operations, our IRES business has operations in five
international locations.

Intuit Distribution Management Solutions (IDMS).

Our
IDMS business offers Intuit Eclipse software and related
technical support, consulting and training services for
distributors in the wholesale durable goods industry.

Intuit Construction Business Solutions (ICBS).

Our
ICBS business offers Intuit MasterBuilder software and
related technical support, consulting and training services for
the construction industry.

Consumer Tax

Our Consumer Tax business offers a number of tax return
preparation products and services that appeal to customers whose
returns have varying levels of complexity, consistent with our
Right For Me strategy. Our current solutions include:

Consumer Tax Return Preparation Offerings.

Our TurboTax
products and services are designed to enable individuals and
small business owners to prepare their own federal and state
personal and small business income tax returns easily, quickly
and accurately. They are designed to be easy to use, yet
sophisticated enough for complex tax returns. We offer a range
of desktop software products as well as TurboTax for the Web, an
interactive tax preparation service that enables individual
taxpayers to prepare and electronically file their federal and
state income tax returns entirely online. One of our premium
offerings, TurboTax Premier, addresses the unique income tax
needs of investors, Schedule C business owners and rental
property owners. In addition, our innovative Instant Data Entry
feature enables taxpayers to import data directly into their tax
returns from Form W-2 (wages), Form 1098 (mortgage
interest) and Form 1099



(interest, dividends and stock transactions) from participating
financial institutions and payroll service companies. This
feature saves TurboTax users time and increases accuracy.

Electronic Filing Services.

Through our electronic filing
center, our desktop and web-based tax preparation customers can
electronically file their federal income tax returns, as well as
state returns in all states that support electronic filing. For
the 2004 tax year our online tax services were offered through
the web sites of approximately 1,400 financial institutions,
electronic retailers and other merchants and on Yahoo!®
Finance Tax Center.

Intuit Tax Freedom Project.

Under the Intuit Tax Freedom
Project, a philanthropic public service initiative of the Intuit
Financial Freedom Foundation, in the 2004 tax season we provided
online federal income tax return preparation and electronic
filing services at no charge to federal taxpayers. We are a
member of the Free File Alliance, a consortium of private sector
companies that signed a three-year agreement with the federal
government in October 2002 under which a number of private
sector companies have been providing web-based federal tax
preparation and filing services at no cost through voluntary
public service initiatives. We donated approximately
2.2 million federal units under this program in fiscal
2005. Unless the government or the consortium elect to terminate
the agreement, it will renew every two years in perpetuity after
the October 2005 expiration of the initial term. The agreement
is currently under negotiation by the federal government and the
Free File Alliance for possible changes. See also

“Competition – Consumer Tax”

later in
this Item 1.

Professional Tax

Our Professional Tax segment provides a variety of software and
services for accountants and tax preparers in public practice
who serve multiple clients. We design, create, sell and support
offerings that help professional accountants and tax preparers
provide accounting, tax planning and tax compliance services to
their individual and business clients and that help them manage
their own practices more effectively. Our current tax software
product lines include Lacerte and ProSeries. Lacerte software is
designed for larger tax practices that prepare the most complex
returns. We offer three versions of our ProSeries software:
ProSeries Professional Edition, designed for year-round tax
practices that prepare moderately complex tax returns; ProSeries
Express Edition, designed for tax practices that focus on
helping taxpayers obtain their tax refunds quickly; and
ProSeries Basic Edition, designed for the needs of smaller and
seasonal tax practices. Customers can elect to license
professional tax products for a flat fee for unlimited annual
use, or use them on a “pay-per-return” basis. Lacerte
and ProSeries customers can file their clients’ tax returns
using our electronic filing services. We also offer EasyACCT
Professional Accounting Series, which allows accountants to
create financial statements and prepare tax forms such as
Form W-2 and Form 940 for their clients, as well as
several other software products that help accountants provide a
broader spectrum of services to their clients.

Other Businesses

Quicken Solutions Group

The Quicken Solutions Group includes Quicken software, the
Quicken.com personal finance web site and other consumer
solutions that help users simplify their financial lives.

Quicken Software.

Our Quicken line of desktop software
products helps users organize, understand and manage their
personal finances. Quicken allows customers to reconcile bank
accounts, record credit card and other transactions, write
checks, and track investments, mortgages and other assets and
liabilities. Quicken also allows customers to flag their
tax-related financial transactions and download that information
into our TurboTax consumer tax return preparation software. We
offer basic and deluxe versions of the product as well as
Quicken Premier, which offers more robust investment and tax
planning tools; Quicken Premier Home and Business, which allows
customers to manage both personal and small business finances in
one application; and Quicken for Mac.



Quicken.com and Other Online Services.

Our Quicken.com
personal finance web site gives Quicken customers access to
web-based financial tools, resources and information about a
variety of personal finance topics and allows Quicken personal
finance software users to monitor their investments online. We
offer other online services that we sell separately, including
Quicken-branded bill payment. We also offer access to online
banking and investment tracking services from various financial
institutions that pay us to offer this access.

Other Consumer Solutions.

The Quicken Solutions Group
also offers other solutions designed to help consumers organize
and manage areas of their lives that can be particularly complex
and time-consuming. Our other consumer solutions currently
include Quicken Medical Expense Manager, which helps users track
and manage health care costs, and Quicken Rental Property
Manager, which helps users track and manage rental
property-related income and expenses.

International

Canada and the United Kingdom.

In Canada, we offer
versions of QuickBooks that we have “localized,” that
is, customized to meet the unique needs of customers in that
specific international location. These include QuickBooks
software offerings, payroll offerings and service plans. We also
offer QuickTax and TaxWiz consumer tax return preparation
software; ProFile Financial Application Suite professional tax
preparation products and ProFile Advisor memberships for
accountants; and localized versions of Quicken in Canada. In the
United Kingdom, we offer localized versions of QuickBooks,
including products and services sold in partnership with banks.

Other Locations.

We license localized versions of
QuickBooks and Quicken products in selected European markets
through local distributors and agents. We also license localized
versions of QuickBooks and Quicken products in Australia, New
Zealand and Singapore through a development, marketing and
distribution arrangement with Australia-based Reckon Limited. In
addition, we have a branding agreement for QuickBooks in China
and a distribution arrangement for QuickBooks and Quicken in
South Africa.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

Since the personal computer and software industries are
characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer
needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements, a
continuous high level of investment is required for the
enhancement of existing products and the development of new
products. We develop the majority of our products internally. We
may also supplement our internal development efforts by
acquiring strategically important products and technology from
third parties, or establishing other relationships that enable
us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly. We have a
number of United States patents and pending applications that
relate to various aspects of our products and technology. While
we believe that our patents have value, no single patent is
essential to any of our business segments.

Our core desktop software products (QuickBooks, TurboTax,
Lacerte, ProSeries and Quicken) tend to have fairly predictable,
structured development cycles of about a year, with annual
product releases. These businesses also develop new products
whose development cycles are less predictable. Developing
consumer and professional tax software presents unique
challenges because of the demanding development cycle required
to accurately incorporate tax law and tax form changes within a
rigid timetable. The development timing for our outsourced
payroll offerings is determined by business needs and regulatory
requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on
the scope and complexity of each particular project. The product
development cycles for the other businesses in our
Intuit-Branded Small Business segment also vary, and can be
longer than one year for major product releases.

Over the next few years, we expect that we will be developing
more versions of more products than ever before. We anticipate
that these products will offer increased ease of use, be
customized for specific customer categories and feature improved
integration with other Intuit and third party products and
services and with our internal information systems. Our research
and development efforts will be focused on developing new
products and services to address customer needs in our more
broadly defined markets



as well as adding complementary products and services to drive
revenue from our core products. We also expect to continue to
focus significant research and development efforts on multi-year
projects to modernize the software platforms for many of our
products. Our research and development expenses were
$305.2 million in fiscal 2005, $276.0 million in
fiscal 2004 and $250.7 million in fiscal 2003, and
represented approximately 15% of total net revenue in each of
those periods.

SEASONALITY

Our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Professional Tax businesses are
highly seasonal. Some of our other offerings, such as Quicken,
are also seasonal, but to a lesser extent. Revenue from upgrades
for many of our small business software products, including
QuickBooks, tend to be concentrated around calendar year end.
Sales of income tax preparation products and services are
heavily concentrated in the period from November through April.
These seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is
usually highest during our second fiscal quarter ending
January 31 and third fiscal quarter ending April 30.
We typically report losses in our first fiscal quarter ending
October 31 and fourth fiscal quarter ending July 31,
when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating
expenses continue at relatively consistent levels.

MARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION

Markets

Our primary target markets are small businesses with up to 250
employees, consumer and professional tax, and accountants. In
addition, we have acquired several companies that offer business
management solutions to larger businesses. These include
outsourced payroll, Intuit Real Estate Solutions, Intuit
Distribution Management Solutions and Intuit Construction
Business Solutions.

Many of the markets in which we compete are characterized by
rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and
frequent new product introductions and enhancements by
competitors. Market and industry changes can quickly render
existing products and services obsolete, so our success depends
on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new
business models, updated competitive strategies, new or enhanced
products and services, alternative distribution methods and
other changes in the way we do business.

Marketing Programs

We use a variety of marketing programs to generate software
orders, stimulate demand and generally maintain and increase
customer awareness of our products and services. These programs
include mail, email and telephone solicitations, direct-response
newspaper and magazine advertising, and television and radio
advertising. We also use workflow-integrated in-product
messaging in some of our software products to market other
related products and services, including third-party products
and services. Customers who respond to direct marketing
campaigns and in-product messaging can purchase products and
services from us by telephone, through our web sites or through
our retail partners.

Sales and Distribution Channels

Direct Sales Channel.

We sell many of our products and
services directly to our customers through our web sites, call
centers and direct sales force. Over the past few years, we have
introduced more sophisticated, higher-priced software products
and business management solutions, including solutions for
businesses in selected industries. As a result, we have been
enhancing our direct sales force capabilities to support revenue
growth in these areas.

Retail Distribution Channel.

We market our QuickBooks,
TurboTax and Quicken desktop software at retail in North America
primarily through office supply superstores, warehouse clubs,
consumer electronics retailers, general mass merchandisers,
catalogers and food and drug retailers. In international
markets, we



also rely on distributors, value-added resellers and other third
parties, who sell products into the retail channel.

We continue to benefit from strong relationships with a number
of major North American retailers, which allows us to minimize
our dependence on any specific retailer. We deliver products to
larger retailers through a combination of direct to store
deliveries and shipments to central warehouse locations. We also
ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through
distributors. See

“Manufacturing and Distribution”

later in this Item 1. We continue to aggressively
manage our inventory to optimize in-stock presence and ensure
good product placement within retail stores. In response to
current retail trends, we are also placing a greater proportion
of inventory with retailers on a consignment basis.

As we continue to execute on the Right for Me strategy in each
of our businesses, we are, in some product areas, offering
software products that are more complex and have higher prices
than our traditional retail software products. Our recent
tailoring of some of these software products to specific
customer needs, including industry-specific versions of
QuickBooks, is also resulting in a greater number of Intuit
products. We produce and place in-store displays and other
retail merchandising aids that educate customers about product
functionality and benefits.

OEM Channel.

We have relationships with a number of
personal computer “original equipment manufacturers,”
or OEMs, including Dell Inc., Apple Computer Inc. and
Hewlett-Packard. Although aggregate revenue from our OEM channel
is much less significant than revenue from our other
distribution channels, OEM relationships help us to generate
sales of our core desktop software products in two ways. First,
some OEMs “pre-bundle” new-user versions of certain
desktop software products on the computer systems that the OEMs
sell to their customers. These pre-bundled OEM sales are a good
source of new customers and future revenues. Second, the other
source of revenue from the OEM channel is “after-point of
sale” programs, in which customers who have purchased
computers with new-user versions of Intuit software that are
pre-installed on the desktop can select and purchase additional
software products from a suite of offerings at a later date.

Third-Party “Value-Added” Distribution
Arrangements.

We supplement our direct sales capabilities
and our retail and OEM distribution relationships with selected
third-party distribution arrangements. We believe these
relationships will enhance the growth opportunities for our
higher-end product and service offerings by allowing us to
benefit from the value-added marketing and sales expertise of
these third parties. We currently have arrangements with third
parties who have specialized expertise in marketing, selling and
providing post-sale implementation services for Innovative
Merchant Solutions and some of our Intuit-Branded Small Business
solutions. During fiscal 2006 and beyond, we expect to continue
to optimize, expand and support our network of third-party
relationships.

COMPETITION

Overview

We face intense competition in all of our businesses, both
domestically and internationally. Competitive interest and
expertise in many of the markets we serve, particularly small
business and consumer tax, has grown markedly over the past few
years and we expect this trend to continue. Some of our existing
competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and
marketing resources than we do. As we implement our
customer-driven strategies, we face increased competitive
threats from larger companies than we have historically faced.
In addition, the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new
companies enter markets in which we compete.

Our most obvious competition comes from other companies that
offer technology solutions similar to ours. These competitors
are shown in the table below. However, for many of our products
and services, other important competitive alternatives for
customers are manual tools and processes, or general-purpose
software. Many of our new customers have used pencil and paper
or software such as word processors and spreadsheets, rather
than competitors’ software and services, to perform
financial tasks. For example, many



taxpayers prepared their tax returns manually before using
TurboTax; a large number of small businesses used spreadsheets
to keep their books and they processed their payroll using
spreadsheets and manually-written checks before purchasing
QuickBooks; and most of our personal finance customers tracked
their finances with spreadsheets, manually or not at all before
using Quicken.

Consumer Tax.

In the private sector we face intense
competition primarily from H&R Block, the makers of TaxCut
software, and increasingly from web-based competitive offerings
where we are subject to significant and increasing price
pressure. We also compete for customers with low-cost assisted
tax preparation businesses, such as H&R Block.

We also face potential competitive challenges in our Consumer
Tax business from publicly funded government entities that offer
electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to
individual taxpayers. We are a member of the Free File Alliance,
a consortium of private sector companies that signed a
three-year agreement with the federal government in October
2002. Under this agreement, a number of private sector
companies, rather than the federal government, have been
providing web-based federal tax preparation and filing services
at no cost to federal taxpayers through voluntary public service
initiatives such as our Intuit Tax Freedom Project. The
agreement is currently under negotiation by the federal
government and the Free File Alliance for possible changes. A
number of states have adopted similar public-private agreements
modeled after the Free File Alliance. However, many other states
have taken the opposite approach and offer some form of directly
sponsored tax preparation and filing services free to qualified
taxpayers. We continue to actively work with others in the
private and public sectors to advance the goals of the Free File
Alliance policy initiative and to support successful
public-private partnership. However, future administrative,
regulatory or legislative activity in this area could have a
material adverse effect on our Consumer Tax business.

QuickBooks-Related.

QuickBooks is the leading product in
the retail sales channel for its category. We face potential
competitive challenges in our QuickBooks-Related business from
Microsoft Corporation, which has announced its intention to
target small business customers with accounting software and
associated services.

Competitive factors for desktop software.

We believe the
most important competitive factors for our desktop software
products – QuickBooks, TurboTax, Lacerte, ProSeries
and Quicken – are ease of use, product features, size
of the installed customer base, brand name recognition, value,
and product and support quality. Access to distribution channels
is also important for our QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken
products. In addition, the ability for customers to upgrade
within product families as their businesses grow is a
significant competitive factor for our QuickBooks products. We
believe we compete effectively on these factors as QuickBooks,
TurboTax and Quicken products are the leading products in the
retail sales channel for their respective categories.

Products and services other than desktop software.

We
believe the most important competitive factors for products and
services other than desktop software are features and ease of
use, brand name recognition, speed in getting new products and
services to market, effective distribution and quality of
implementation and support. We believe we compete effectively on
these factors. For our service offerings such as outsourced
payroll and merchant services, service reliability and
scalability of operations are also important factors. Due to the
size of our principal competitors in these service businesses,
we will need to scale our businesses to compete effectively over
the long term. Significant competitive factors for our financial
supplies business include ordering convenience, product quality,
speed of delivery and price. We believe that our convenient
access to our large QuickBooks and Quicken customer bases is a
significant competitive advantage for our financial supplies
business.



Competitors

The following table shows the significant competitors for each
of our major products and services.

CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT

We provide customer service and technical support by telephone,
online chat, fax, e-mail and our customer service and technical
support web sites. We have full-time and outsourced customer
service and technical support staffs, which we supplement with
seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of
peak call volumes, such as during the tax return filing season
or following a major product launch. We outsource to several
firms domestically and internationally. Most of our
internationally outsourced consumer and small business customer
service and technical support personnel are located in India.

We offer free self-help information through our technical
support web sites for QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken. For
example, customers can use our web sites to find answers to
commonly asked questions and check on the status of orders.
Under support plans, customers can also use our web sites to
receive product updates electronically. Support alternatives and
fees vary by product. We also sponsor online user communities
where customers can share product advice with each other.

MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION

Desktop Software and Supplies

The major steps involved in manufacturing desktop software are
manufacturing CDs, printing boxes and related materials, and
assembling and shipping the final products. We have a
manufacturing agreement with ModusLink Corp. under which
ModusLink provides substantially all outsourced manufacturing
related to our retail launches of QuickBooks, TurboTax and
Quicken, as well as for day-to-day retail order fulfillment
after product launches. Although ModusLink has operations in
multiple locations that can provide redundancy if necessary, we
have centralized the manufacturing for our retail products in
one of



their facilities which is co-located with our primary retail
fulfillment vendor, Ingram Micro Logistics (IML), a division of
Ingram Micro Inc. We also outsource the product manufacturing
and distribution for all of our direct sales orders to Arvato
Services, Inc., a division of Bertelsmann AG. We use
John H. Harland Company exclusively to fulfill orders for
all of our printed checks and most other products for our
financial supplies business.

Our retail product launches are operationally complex. Our model
for product delivery for retail launches and replenishment is a
hybrid of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central
warehouse locations. This allows improved inventory management
by our retailers. We also ship products for many of our smaller
retail customers through distributors. We have an agreement with
IML under which IML handles all logistics, fulfillment and
similar functions for our retail sales.

We have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and
availability has historically not been a significant problem for
us. Prior to major product releases for our core desktop
software products we tend to have significant levels of backlog,
but at other times backlog is minimal and we typically ship
products within a few days of receiving an order. Because of
this fluctuation in backlog, we believe that backlog is not a
reliable predictor of our future core desktop software sales.

Internet-Based Products and Services

Intuit’s data centers house most of the systems, networks
and databases required to operate and deliver our Internet-based
products and services. These include QuickBooks Online Edition,
QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service, Complete web-based Payroll,
TurboTax for the Web, consumer and professional electronic tax
filing services, Quicken.com and QuickBase. Through our data
centers, we connect customers to products and services and we
store the vast amount of data that represents the content on our
web sites. As our businesses continue to move toward delivering
more web-based products and services, this infrastructure will
become even more critical in the future. Our data centers
consist of numerous servers and databases located in several
sites across the United States. In an effort to reduce
unavailability, or “down time,” for our Internet-based
products and services, we generally follow industry-standard
practices for creating a fault-tolerant environment, but we do
not have complete redundancy. We have back-up processing
capabilities that are designed to protect us against
site-related disasters for many of our mission-critical
applications. Despite our efforts to maintain continuous and
reliable server operations, we occasionally experience unplanned
outages or technical difficulties.

PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION

We are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations
and financial institution requirements relating to privacy and
security. We are also subject to laws and regulations that apply
to telemarketing and email activities. Additional laws in both
areas are likely to be passed in the future, which could result
in significant limitations on the ways in which we can
communicate with our customers and significantly increase our
compliance costs.

We comply with federal guidelines and practices to help ensure
that customers are aware of, and can control, how we use
information about them. Our primary web sites, such as
QuickBooks.com, TurboTax.com and Quicken.com, have been
certified by TRUSTe, an independent, non-profit organization
that operates a web site certification program to alleviate
users’ concerns about online privacy. We also use privacy
statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy
practices, as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish
instructions with respect to use of their data.

To address security concerns, we use industry-standard security
safeguards to help protect the information customers give to us
from loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration. Whenever
customers transmit sensitive information, such as a credit card
number or tax return data, to us through one of our web sites,
we provide them access to our servers that allow encryption of
the information as it is transmitted to us. We work to protect
personally identifiable information stored on the web
site’s servers from unauthorized



access using commercially available computer security products,
such as firewalls, as well as internally developed security
procedures and practices.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

We offer certain products and services, such as outsourced
payroll, which are subject to special regulatory requirements.
As we expand our small business products and services, we may
become subject to additional government regulation, particularly
in the areas of retirement planning and other employer services.
New laws or regulations may be adopted in these areas that could
impose significant limitations on our business and increase our
cost of compliance. We continually analyze new business
opportunities, and new businesses that we pursue may require
additional costs for regulatory compliance.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We regard our products as proprietary. We attempt to protect our
product technology by relying on a combination of copyright,
patent, trade secret and trademark laws, restrictions on
disclosure and other methods. In particular, we have a
substantial number of registered trademarks including Intuit,
QuickBooks, TurboTax, Lacerte, ProSeries and Quicken. We have
registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the
United States and, depending on the relevance of each brand to
other markets, in many foreign countries. The initial duration
of trademark registrations varies from country to country and is
10 years in the United States. Most registrations can be
renewed perpetually at 10-year intervals. We also currently hold
a small but growing patent portfolio. We regularly file
applications for patents and trademarks and service marks in
order to protect proprietary intellectual property that we
believe is important to our business. We also license some
intellectual property from third parties for use in our products.

We face a number of risks relating to our intellectual property,
including unauthorized use and unauthorized copying, or piracy,
of our products. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our
intellectual property rights, to protect trade secrets or
trademarks, or to determine the validity and scope of the
proprietary rights of others. Patents that have been issued to
us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable
against competitive products in every jurisdiction. Furthermore,
other parties have asserted and may, in the future, assert
infringement claims against us. For further discussion of our
current litigation, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings. These
claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our
proprietary rights. Litigation, even if not meritorious, could
result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and
management attention. In addition, third party licenses may not
continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms,
or at all.

EMPLOYEES

As of August 31, 2005 we had approximately 7,000 employees
located in the United States and internationally in Canada, the
United Kingdom and several other locations. We believe our
future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract
and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business. We
do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with
our employees, and we believe employee relations are generally
good. Although we have employment-related agreements with a
number of key employees, these agreements do not guarantee
continued service. We believe we offer competitive compensation
and a good working environment. We were selected as one of

Fortune

magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work
For” in April 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005. However, we face
intense competition for qualified employees, and we expect to
face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention.



ITEM 2

PROPERTIES

Our principal locations, their purposes and the expiration dates
for the leases on facilities at those locations as of
July 31, 2005 are shown in the table below. We have renewal
options on many of our leases.

The leases for our existing San Diego, California facilities
expire in 2007. In March 2005 we entered into an agreement under
which we will lease approximately 365,000 square feet of office
space in three four-story buildings to be constructed by the
landlord in San Diego. We also have a right of first offer to
lease one or more floors of a fourth four-story building for
approximately 101,000 square feet at the same location and a
right of first refusal with respect to any remaining space in
the fourth building. The lease term will begin on
September 1, 2007 and end on the later of August 31,
2017 or ten years after the date we first occupy the
buildings. We have two options to extend the lease for a period
of five years each.

In addition, our three industry solutions businesses lease their
principal facilities in Santa Rosa, California; Boulder,
Colorado; Shelton, Connecticut; Hyannis, Massachusetts; and
Highland Hills, Ohio. They also lease sales and service offices
across the United States and in selected international
locations. Finally, we lease or own facilities in a number of
other domestic locations and internationally in the United
Kingdom and several other locations.

We believe our facilities are adequate for our current and
near-term needs, and that we will be able to locate additional
facilities as needed. See Note 11 to the financial
statements for more information about our lease commitments.



ITEM 3

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Muriel Siebert & Co., Inc. v. Intuit Inc.,
Index No. 03-602942, Supreme Court of the State of New
York, County of New York.

On September 17, 2003, Muriel Siebert & Co., Inc.
filed a complaint against Intuit alleging various claims for
breach of contract, breach of express and implied covenants of
good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty,
misrepresentation and/or fraud, and promissory estoppel. The
allegations relate to Quicken Brokerage powered by Siebert, a
strategic alliance between the two companies. The complaint
seeks compensatory damages in the amount of either
$11.1 million or, in the alternative, $9.4 million, as
well as punitive damages in the amount of either
$33.0 million or $28.2 million, and other damages.
Intuit unsuccessfully sought to compel the matter to
arbitration. On February 7, 2005, Intuit filed a motion to
dismiss all but one of the plaintiff’s claims in New York
state court. On September 6, 2005, the court dismissed
Siebert’s fraud and punitive damages claims. Intuit
believes this lawsuit is without merit and will vigorously
defend the litigation.

Intuit/ Quicken Sunsetting Litigation, Master File
No. 1-04-CV-016394, Superior Court of California, County of
Santa Clara (Anthony Flannery v. Intuit Inc., et al, Civil
No. 1-04-CV-016394 and Daniel J. Mason v. Intuit Inc.
et al, Civil No. 1-04-CV-018345).

On or about March 19, 2004, plaintiff Anthony Flannery, on
his behalf and on behalf of a class of persons allegedly
similarly situated, filed a complaint against Intuit in Santa
Clara Superior Court, alleging that Intuit’s retirement of
certain services and live technical support associated with its
Quicken 1998, Quicken 1999 and Quicken 2000 products constituted
a breach of express and implied warranties and violated sections
17200 and 17500 of the California Business and Professions Code,
as well as the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (“CLRA”).
The complaint seeks certification as a class action, as well as
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, disgorgement of
profits, restitution, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees
from Intuit.

On or about April 21, 2004, plaintiff Daniel Mason, on his
behalf and on behalf of a class of persons allegedly similarly
situated, filed a complaint against Intuit in Santa Clara
Superior Court making allegations virtually identical to those
of Anthony Flannery. On July 14, 2004, the Court
consolidated the two cases pursuant to stipulation of the
parties.

On July 29, 2004, plaintiffs filed a consolidated First
Amended Complaint. On October 8, 2004, Intuit responded to
plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint by filing demurrers. By
Order dated November 12, 2004, the Court sustained the
demurrers and dismissed all counts of the First Amended
Complaint, holding that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim
upon which relief could be granted. The Court allowed plaintiffs
to file a Second Amended Complaint, which was served on Intuit.
Intuit filed a demurrer to this latest pleading and on
April 27, 2005 the Court sustained Intuit’s demurrers,
dismissed all counts of the Second Amended Complaint and denied
plaintiffs the right to further amend their complaint. On
June 1, 2005, the Court entered its final judgment.
Although plaintiffs had the right to appeal the Court’s
ruling, plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement effective
June 17, 2005 where they waived their right to appeal any
Judgment or Order in this action. This case is now concluded.

Cynthia Belotti/ Ental Precision Machining v. Intuit Inc., et
al, Civil No. 1-04-CV-020277, Superior Court of California,
County of Santa Clara.

On or about May 24, 2004, plaintiff Cynthia Belotti, on her
behalf and on behalf of a class of persons allegedly similarly
situated, filed a complaint against the Company in Santa Clara
Superior Court, alleging that Intuit’s retirement of
certain add-on business services and live technical support
associated with its QuickBooks 2001 and
QuickBooks 2002 products constituted a breach of express
and implied warranties and violated sections 17200 and
17500 of the California Business and Professions Code. The
complaint sought certification as a class action, as well as
damages, disgorgement of profits, restitution, injunctive relief
and attorney’s fees from Intuit.



On or about July 13, 2004, plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint that added Ental Precision Machining, Inc., as
plaintiff; plaintiffs’ counsel has also dismissed without
prejudice all claims on behalf of Cynthia Belotti. On
October 8, 2004, Intuit responded to plaintiffs’ First
Amended Complaint by filing demurrers. By Order dated
November 12, 2004, the Court sustained the demurrers and
dismissed all counts of the First Amended Complaint, holding
that the plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief
could be granted. The Court allowed plaintiff to file a Second
Amended Complaint, which was served on Intuit. Intuit filed a
demurrer to this latest pleading and on April 27, 2005 the
Court sustained Intuit’s demurrers, dismissed all counts of
the Second Amended Complaint and denied plaintiff the right to
further amend its complaint. On June 1, 2005, the Court
entered its final judgment. Although plaintiff had the right to
appeal the Court’s ruling, plaintiff signed a settlement
agreement effective June 17, 2005 where it waived its right
to appeal any Judgment or Order in this action. This case is now
concluded.

Intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings, as well
as demands, claims and threatened litigation, that arise in the
normal course of our business, including assertions that we may
be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of
others. We currently believe that the ultimate amount of
liability, if any, for any pending claims of any type (either
alone or combined) will not materially affect our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. We also believe
that we would be able to obtain any necessary licenses or other
rights to disputed intellectual property rights on commercially
reasonable terms. However, the ultimate outcome of any
litigation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, litigation
can have an adverse impact on Intuit because of defense costs,
negative publicity, diversion of management resources and other
factors. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other
rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual property
claims could adversely affect our business.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED
STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Market Information for Common Stock

Intuit’s common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market
under the symbol “INTU.” The following table shows the
range of high and low sale prices reported on the Nasdaq Stock
Market for the periods indicated. The closing price of
Intuit’s common stock on August 31, 2005 was $45.84.



Stockholders

As of August 31, 2005 we had approximately 900 record
holders and approximately 83,000 beneficial holders of our
common stock.

Dividends

Intuit has never paid any cash dividends on its common stock.
From time to time we consider the advisability of paying a cash
dividend. We currently anticipate that we will retain all future
earnings for use in our business and for repurchases under our
stock repurchase programs. We do not anticipate paying any cash
dividends in the foreseeable future.

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities

Not applicable.

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and
Affiliated Purchasers

Stock repurchase activity during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2005 was as follows:

Notes:

All shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans during
    the three months ended July 31, 2005 were purchased under
    our fifth stock repurchase plan, which was authorized by our
    Board of Directors in May 2005 and expires on May 15, 2008.
    We expect to continue to repurchase shares under this stock
    repurchase program during fiscal 2006. No authorized funds
    remain under our first four stock repurchase programs. For
    additional information about Intuit’s historical stock
    repurchase activities, see Note 13 and Note 17 to the
    financial statements.



ITEM 6

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following tables show Intuit’s selected financial
information for the past five fiscal years. The comparability of
the information is affected by a variety of factors, including
acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, amortization and
impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets, gains
and losses related to marketable equity securities and other
investments and repurchases of common stock under our stock
repurchase programs. We adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142,

“Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets,”

on August 1, 2002 and
stopped amortizing goodwill on that date. Fiscal years prior to
fiscal 2003 reflect significant goodwill amortization charges.

In fiscal 2002 we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage business, in
fiscal 2003 we sold our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary,
Intuit KK, and in fiscal 2005 we sold our Intuit Public
Sector Solutions (IPSS) business. In May 2005 our Board of
Directors formally approved a plan to sell our Intuit
Information Technology Solutions (ITS) business. We accounted
for these businesses as discontinued operations and,
accordingly, we have reclassified the selected financial data
for all periods presented to reflect Quicken Loans,
Intuit KK, IPSS and ITS as discontinued operations. To
better understand the information in the tables, investors
should read

About Intuit

Intuit is a leading provider of business and financial
management solutions for small business, consumer and
professional tax, and accountants. We organize our business into
the following five segments:

•

QuickBooks-Related. This segment includes our QuickBooks
    accounting and business management software for small businesses
    as well as products and services that can be added on to
    QuickBooks. These include financial supplies, QuickBooks
    payroll, merchant services and technical support.

•

Intuit-Branded Small Business. This segment includes products
    and services that are designed primarily for small and
    medium-sized businesses and include outsourced payroll and
    solutions designed to meet the needs of businesses in selected
    industries.

•

Consumer Tax. This segment includes our TurboTax consumer tax
    return preparation products and services.

•

Professional Tax. This segment includes our Lacerte and
    ProSeries professional tax products and services.

•

Other Businesses. This segment consists primarily of our Quicken
    personal finance products and services and our businesses in
    Canada and the United Kingdom.



Key Accomplishments in Fiscal 2005

In fiscal 2005, we successfully executed growth strategies
focused on our core markets of small business, consumer and
professional tax, and accountants. This enabled us to acquire
more new customers in these markets and sell more products and
services to our large base of customers over their lifetime. We
introduced several new products, including: QuickBooks Simple
Start, which provides accounting functionality suitable for very
small businesses; SnapTax, designed for taxpayers with very
simple personal income tax returns; ProSeries Basic Edition,
designed for the needs of smaller and seasonal tax practices;
ProSeries Express Edition, designed for tax practices that focus
on helping taxpayers obtain their tax refunds quickly; Quicken
Medical Expense Manager; and Quicken Rental Property Manager.

Overview of Financial Results

Total net revenue for fiscal 2005 was $2.0 billion, up 13%
compared with fiscal 2004. The fiscal 2005 revenue increase was
primarily due to growth in our QuickBooks-Related and Consumer
Tax segments. Fiscal 2005 net income was $381.6 million, up
20% compared with fiscal 2004. Net income increased in fiscal
2005 primarily due to revenue growth that was partially offset
by higher spending for infrastructure, implementation of new
information systems, new product development and promotion and
Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. Diluted net income per share was
$2.03 in fiscal 2005, an increase of 28% compared with fiscal
2004. Diluted net income per share grew faster than net income
in fiscal 2005 primarily due to the net reduction of average
shares outstanding. Average shares outstanding declined as a
result of repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase
programs, partially offset by the issuance of shares under
option and employee stock purchase plans.

In fiscal 2005 we generated $590.0 million in cash from
continuing operations, compared with $552.5 million in
fiscal 2004. The fiscal 2005 increase in operating cash flow was
primarily due to higher net income from continuing operations.
We used $709.2 million in cash for repurchases of common
stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2005.

Seasonality

Our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Professional Tax businesses are
highly seasonal. Some of our other offerings are also seasonal,
but to a lesser extent. Revenue from upgrades for many of our
small business software products, including QuickBooks, tends to
be concentrated around calendar year end. Sales of income tax
preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in
the period from November through April. These seasonal patterns
mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our
second quarter ending January 31 and third quarter ending April
30. We typically report losses in our first quarter ending
October 31 and fourth quarter ending July 31, when
revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating
expenses continue at relatively consistent levels.

Strategy and Trends

Strategy.

Intuit’s strategy is to apply our
customer-driven invention mindset and processes to solve complex
customer problems. The key to our success is our 20-year history
of staying focused on customer needs. Our in-depth customer
knowledge allows us to make more informed decisions that lead to
better products and services for customers.

Opportunities in Our Core Markets.

While we have strong
positions in our core markets for QuickBooks and TurboTax
software, we believe that there are many more opportunities in
the markets for small businesses and individual consumers. Many
small businesses and individuals are using other methods, such
as manual tools and processes or general-purpose software. In
fiscal 2005 we began to explore ways to meet the needs of
customers that we have never reached before. For example, we
introduced QuickBooks Simple Start with accounting functionality
for very small businesses and SnapTax for taxpayers with very
simple personal income tax returns. We expect to continue this
focus in fiscal 2006 and beyond.



Importance of Developing and Introducing New Products and
Services.

To remain competitive and grow in the future, we
must continue to invest in initiatives aimed at uncovering and
meeting new customer needs while enhancing our existing
offerings to make them even better.

Importance of Technology Infrastructure.

Our
Internet-based products and services include QuickBooks Online
Edition, QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service, Complete web-based
Payroll, TurboTax for the Web and consumer and professional
electronic tax filing services. As our businesses continue to
move toward delivering more web-based products and services, our
technology infrastructure will become even more critical in the
future.

Competition.

We have formidable competitors, and we
expect competition to remain intense during fiscal 2006 and
beyond. For example, Microsoft Corporation currently offers a
number of competitive small business offerings and has indicated
that part of its growth strategy is to focus on the small
business market. Microsoft has also announced its intention to
target small business customers with accounting software and
associated services. In our Consumer Tax business, we face the
risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing or
contracting to provide software or other systems to facilitate
tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to
taxpayers.

Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates,
assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on
our net revenue, operating income or loss and net income or
loss, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities
on our balance sheet. We believe that the estimates, assumptions
and judgments involved in the accounting policies described
below have the greatest potential impact on our financial
statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting
policies. Senior management has reviewed the development and
selection of these critical accounting policies and their
disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the
Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

Net Revenue – Revenue Recognition

We derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products,
license fees, product support, professional services, outsourced
payroll services, merchant services, transaction fees and
multiple element arrangements that may include any combination
of these items. We follow the appropriate revenue recognition
rules for each type of revenue. For additional information, see

“Net Revenue”

in Note 1 to the financial
statements. We generally recognize revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product
or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and
collectibility is probable. However, determining whether and
when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves
assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on
the timing and amount of revenue we report. For example, for
multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and
judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various
elements we must deliver, to determine whether undelivered
services are essential to the functionality of the delivered
products and services, to determine whether vendor-specific
evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and
to determine whether and when each element has been delivered.
If we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments, it
could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of
revenue that we report in a particular period. Amounts for fees
collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where
revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet
as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue
recognition criteria are satisfied.

Net Revenue – Return and Rebate Reserves

As part of our revenue recognition policy, we estimate future
product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves
against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates.
Our return policy allows distributors and retailers, subject to
contractual limitations, to return purchased products. Product
returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the
return of obsolete products. In determining our product returns
reserves, we consider the volume and price mix of products in
the retail channel, historical return



rates for prior releases of the product, trends in retailer
inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand
for our products (including the competitive environment and the
timing of new releases of our products). We fully reserve for
obsolete products in the distribution channels.

Our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales
incentive rebates and end-user rebates. Our estimated reserves
for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on
distributors’ and retailers’ actual performance
against the terms and conditions of rebate programs, which we
typically establish annually. Our reserves for end-user rebates
are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific
promotional rebate program, actual sales during the promotion,
the amount of redemptions received and historical redemption
trends by product and by type of promotional program.

In the past, actual returns and rebates have approximated and
not generally exceeded the reserves that we have established.
However, actual returns and rebates in any future period are
inherently uncertain. If we were to change our assumptions and
estimates, our revenue reserves would change, which would impact
the net revenue we report. If actual returns and rebates are
significantly greater than the reserves we have established, the
actual results would decrease our future reported revenue.
Conversely, if actual returns and rebates are significantly less
than our reserves, this would increase our future reported
revenue. For example, if we had increased our fiscal 2005
returns reserves by 1% of non-consignment sales to retailers for
QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken, our fiscal 2005 total net
revenue would have been $3.6 million lower. If rebate
redemptions for our QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken products
were to increase by 1%, our annual total net revenue would
decrease by approximately $1.2 million.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of
our accounts receivable. The accounts receivable amount on our
balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be
paid. In determining the amount of the reserve, we consider our
historical level of credit losses. We also make judgments about
the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing
credit evaluations, and we assess current economic trends that
might impact the level of credit losses in the future. Our
reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit
losses. However, since we cannot reliably predict future changes
in the financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee
that our reserves will continue to be adequate. If actual credit
losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have
established, that would increase our general and administrative
expenses and reduce our reported net income. Conversely, if
actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve,
this would eventually decrease our general and administrative
expenses and increase our reported net income.

Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived
Assets – Impairment Assessments

We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased
intangible assets and other long-lived assets whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary
impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our
balance sheet may exist. We test the impairment of goodwill
annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if
indicators of impairment arise. The timing of the formal annual
test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our
fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably
foreseen in prior periods. In order to estimate the fair value
of long-lived assets, we typically make various assumptions
about the future prospects for the business that the asset
relates to, consider market factors specific to that business
and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business.
We evaluate cash flows at the lowest operating level and the
number of reporting units that we have identified may make
impairment more probable than it would be at a company with
fewer reporting units and integrated operations following
acquisitions. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we
determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to
reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to
reflect its estimated fair value. Assumptions and estimates
about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and
often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors,
including external factors such as industry and economic trends,
and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy
and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions
and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and
appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could



materially impact our reported financial results. More
conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from
these businesses could result in impairment charges, which would
decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our
balance sheet. Conversely, less conservative assumptions could
result in smaller or no impairment charges, higher net income
and higher asset values. In fiscal 2004 we recorded an
impairment charge of $18.7 million on goodwill associated
with our Intuit Public Sector Solutions business, which was
subsequently sold. At July 31, 2005 we had
$509.5 million in goodwill and $69.7 million in net
purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet.

Accounting for Stock-Based Incentive Programs

Through the end of fiscal 2005, we measured compensation expense
for our stock-based incentive programs using the intrinsic value
method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion
No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees.”

Under this method, we did not record
compensation expense when stock options were granted to eligible
participants as long as the exercise price was not less than the
fair market value of the stock when the option was granted. We
also did not record compensation expense for shares purchased in
connection with our Employee Stock Purchase Plan as long as the
purchase price of the stock was not less than 85% of the lower
of the fair market value of the stock at the beginning of each
offering period or at the end of each purchase period. In
accordance with SFAS 123,

“Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,”

and SFAS 148,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation –
Transition and Disclosure,”

we disclosed our pro forma
net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if the
fair value-based method had been applied in measuring
compensation expense for our stock-based incentive programs.

To determine the pro forma impact of applying SFAS 123, we
estimated the fair value of our options using the Black Scholes
option valuation model. This model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. This model also
requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including
the expected volatility of our common stock price. The
assumptions we used for the valuation model are set forth in
Note 1 to the financial statements.

The appropriate volatility factor for stock options and for our
Employee Stock Purchase Plan is the estimated future volatility
of our stock over the expected life of the options. Prior to the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we estimated the volatility
factors for stock options and for our Employee Stock Purchase
Plan using the historical volatility of our stock over the most
recent five-year period. From the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004
through the third quarter of fiscal 2005 we estimated the
volatility factors for stock options using the historical
volatility of our stock over the most recent three-year period,
which was approximately equal to the average expected life of
our options. During that time we estimated the volatility
factors for our Employee Stock Purchase Plan using the
historical volatility of our stock over the most recent one-year
period, which was equal to the length of the offering periods
under that plan. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005
we estimated the volatility factors for stock options and for
our Employee Stock Purchase Plan using the implied volatility of
our stock. We estimated the implied volatility of our stock
using the prices of publicly traded options, which we believe
provides a more accurate estimate of expected volatility factors
over the life of the options.

Our stock options have characteristics significantly different
from those of traded options, and changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value
estimates. In the future, we may elect to use different
assumptions under the Black Scholes valuation model or a
different valuation model, which could result in a significantly
different impact on our net income or loss.

On December 16, 2004 the FASB issued SFAS 123 (revised
2004),

“Share-Based Payment,”

which is a
revision of SFAS 123. SFAS 123(R) requires all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans,
to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their
fair values. This standard is effective for public companies for
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We are required
to adopt this new standard in the first quarter of our fiscal
year ending July 31, 2006. The adoption of
SFAS 123(R)’s fair value method will have a significant



adverse impact on our net income and net income per share. See

“Recent Accounting Pronouncements”

later in
this Item 7.

Legal Contingencies

We are subject to certain legal proceedings, as well as demands,
claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course
of our business. We review the status of each significant matter
quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure. If the
potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered
probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a
liability and an expense for the estimated loss. Significant
judgment is required in both the determination of probability
and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably
estimable. Our accruals are based on the best information
available at the time. As additional information becomes
available, we reassess the potential liability related to our
pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates.
Potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of
potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our
results of operations and financial position.

Income Taxes – Estimates of Effective Tax Rates,
Deferred Taxes and Valuation Allowance

When we prepare our financial statements, we estimate our income
taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct
business. Significant judgment is required in determining our
worldwide income tax provision. We recognize liabilities for
anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax
jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent
to which, additional taxes will be due. We record an additional
amount in our provision for income taxes in the period in which
we determine that our recorded tax liability is less than we
expect the ultimate tax assessment to be. If in a later period
we determine that payment of this additional amount is
unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax
benefit in that later period. As a result, our ongoing
assessments of the probable outcomes of the audit issues and
related tax positions require judgment and can materially
increase or decrease our effective tax rate and materially
affect our operating results. This also requires us to estimate
our current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences
that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax
and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred
tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our balance sheet.
We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets
will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is
not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we
establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an
accounting period, we record a corresponding tax expense on our
statement of operations.

Our net deferred tax asset at July 31, 2005 was
$173.3 million, net of the valuation allowance of
$6.0 million. We recorded the valuation allowance to
reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize
some of our deferred tax assets (consisting primarily of certain
state capital loss carryforwards) before they expire. The
valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income
for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over
which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. While we have
considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the
valuation allowance, we could be required to increase the
valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax
assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the
valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be
material, on our income tax provision and net income in the
period in which we make the increase.



Results of Operations

Financial Overview

Total net revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal
2004 primarily due to growth in QuickBooks, QuickBooks Payroll
and Innovative Merchant Solutions merchant services revenue in
our QuickBooks-Related segment and to growth in TurboTax for the
Web and electronic filing and refund transfer services in our
Consumer Tax segment. Total net revenue increased in fiscal 2004
compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to higher QuickBooks
Payroll revenue in our QuickBooks-Related segment and to growth
in revenue from TurboTax for the Web and electronic filing
services in our Consumer Tax segment.

Operating income from continuing operations grew faster than
total net revenue in fiscal 2005 because the increase in total
net revenue was only partially offset by higher spending for
infrastructure, implementation of our new information systems,
new product development and promotion and Sarbanes-Oxley
compliance. Operating income from continuing operations grew
faster than total net revenue in fiscal 2004 primarily due to an
increase in revenue from higher-margin products, such as
industry-specific versions of QuickBooks and QuickBooks Payroll,
and to the fact that we reduced costs while revenue grew in our
Quicken business.

Net income from continuing operations grew more slowly than
operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2005. In
fiscal 2004 we reversed $35.7 million in reserves related
to potential income tax exposures that were resolved while in
fiscal 2005 we reversed only $25.7 million of such
reserves. Net income from continuing operations grew at about
the same rate as operating income from continuing operations in
fiscal 2004 primarily because lower interest and other income
and lower gains on marketable equity securities and other
investments were offset by our reversal of $35.7 million in
reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were
resolved.

Diluted net income per share from continuing operations grew
faster than net income from continuing operations in fiscal 2005
and 2004 primarily due to the net reduction of average shares
outstanding. Average shares outstanding declined as a result of
repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs,
partially offset by the issuance of shares under option and
employee stock purchase plans.

At July 31, 2005 our cash, cash equivalents and investments
totaled $994.3 million, a decrease of $23.7 million
from July 31, 2004. In fiscal 2005 we generated cash
primarily from continuing operations and by issuing common stock
under employee stock plans. We used cash in fiscal 2005
primarily for repurchases of common stock under our stock
repurchase programs and capital expenditures. In fiscal 2005 we
bought 16.2 million shares of our common stock under our
stock repurchase programs at an average price of $43.72 for a
total price of $709.2 million. We completed our fourth
stock repurchase program in March 2005. In May 2005 our Board of
Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $500.0 million
of our common stock from time to time over a three-year period
under a fifth repurchase plan that expires on May 15, 2008.
At July 31, 2005 authorized funds of $290.8 million
remained available under this fifth stock repurchase program. We
expect to continue to repurchase shares under this program
during fiscal 2006.



Total Net Revenue

The table below and the discussion of total net revenue that
follows it are organized in accordance with our five reportable
business segments. See Note 9 to the financial statements
for descriptions of product, service and other revenue for each
segment.

Total Net Revenue by Business Segment

QuickBooks-Related

Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004.

QuickBooks-Related
total net revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal
2004 primarily due to higher QuickBooks, Innovative Merchant
Solutions merchant services and QuickBooks Payroll revenue.
QuickBooks revenue grew on higher unit volume resulting



primarily from an increase in new customers and on a favorable
product mix. The increase in merchant services revenue was
primarily due to growth in the customer base, higher transaction
volume per customer and our discontinuation of the outsourcing
of certain merchant processing services beginning in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2005 we completed the
transition to recognizing the full revenue from processing
merchant transactions that were formerly processed through two
major banks rather than the smaller profit-sharing fees we would
have received under our prior arrangement with those banks.
QuickBooks Payroll revenue was higher in fiscal 2005 compared
with fiscal 2004 primarily because of growth in the customer
base, price increases and the successful launch of our
higher-priced Enhanced Payroll Plus offering. Enhanced Payroll
Plus provides QuickBooks software upgrades in addition to
federal and state tax forms and workers’ compensation
tracking.

Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003.

QuickBooks-Related
total net revenue grew in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003
due to increased sales of higher-priced industry-specific
versions of QuickBooks and higher QuickBooks Payroll revenue
driven by growth in the average customer base, an increase in
QuickBooks-related services and the realization in fiscal 2004
of the full impact of a December 2002 price increase. The
October 2003 acquisition of our Innovative Merchant Solutions
merchant services business also contributed to the higher fiscal
2004 total net revenue in this segment.

Intuit-Branded Small Business

Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004.

Intuit-Branded
Small Business total net revenue increased in fiscal 2005
compared with fiscal 2004 primarily due to growth in our
outsourced payroll and Intuit Real Estate Solutions
(IRES) businesses. Higher outsourced payroll revenue was
driven by growth in the number of QuickBooks Assisted Payroll
Service and Complete Payroll customers processing payrolls,
price increases and higher interest income on funds held for
payroll customers, partially offset by attrition in the Premier
Payroll Service customer base. The increase in IRES revenue was
a result of growth in sales to larger customers.

Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003.

Intuit-Branded
Small Business total net revenue increased in fiscal 2004
compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to new client
acquisition in our wholesale durable goods and property
management solutions businesses as well as higher average
selling prices from increased customer use of support and other
services in these businesses.

Consumer Tax

Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004.

Consumer Tax total
net revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004
primarily due to higher federal TurboTax for the Web units and
to volume and price increases in electronic filing and refund
transfer services.

Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003.

Consumer Tax total
net revenue increased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003
as a result of TurboTax for the Web and retail desktop unit
growth, higher attach rates for electronic filing services and
higher average selling prices.

Professional Tax

Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004.

Professional Tax
total net revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal
2004 primarily due to an increase in Lacerte product revenue
driven by improved customer retention rates and to bank product
transmission services volume from our new ProSeries Express
product.

Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003.

Professional Tax
total net revenue grew slightly in fiscal 2004 compared with
fiscal 2003 due to additional sales to existing customers,
higher average selling prices related to product enhancements
and increased sales of our unlimited electronic filing product
as a result of new government rules requiring the electronic
filing of certain professionally prepared 2003 income tax
returns. However, revenue growth in fiscal 2004 was negatively
impacted by competition from lower-priced professional tax
preparation software products.



Other Businesses

Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004.

Other Businesses
total net revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal
2004. Quicken service revenue was higher in fiscal 2005
primarily due to the growing base of financial institutions
paying for Quicken connectivity and growth in our bill payment
customer base. Canadian revenue increased in fiscal 2005
primarily due to market share gains for QuickBooks software and
higher subscription revenue for payroll services that was driven
by improvements in service levels.

Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003.

Other Businesses
total net revenue grew slightly in fiscal 2004 compared with
fiscal 2003 primarily due to higher Quicken revenue.

In fiscal 2004 Quicken direct unit sales increased in response
to direct mail campaigns for upgrades due to the discontinuation
of support for older versions of the product and for TurboTax
cross-selling offers. Retail unit sales also increased.
Aggregate average selling prices for Quicken were higher in
fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 due to a shift in demand
to our higher-priced Quicken Premier and Quicken Home and
Business products. Partially offsetting these increases, Quicken
other revenue declined in fiscal 2004 due to the expiration or
termination of contracts with several significant online
advertising customers. We exited the online advertising business
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.

Canadian revenue in U.S. dollars was slightly higher in fiscal
2004 compared with fiscal 2003 due to the favorable effect of
the strengthening Canadian dollar in fiscal 2004. Total net
revenue in Canadian dollars decreased in fiscal 2004 compared
with fiscal 2003, primarily due to lower demand for QuickBooks
in Canada. QuickTax revenue was also down in fiscal 2004 due to
a decline in unit sales that was partially offset by higher
average selling prices related to a shift in demand toward the
higher-priced specialty versions of that product.

Cost of Revenue

Our cost of revenue has four components: (1) cost of
product revenue, which includes the direct costs of
manufacturing and shipping our software products; (2) cost
of service revenue, which reflects direct costs associated with
providing services, including data center costs related to
delivering Internet-based services; (3) cost of other
revenue, which includes costs associated with generating
advertising and online transactions revenue; and
(4) amortization of purchased intangible assets, which
represents the cost of amortizing over their useful lives
developed technologies that we obtained through acquisitions.

Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004.

Cost of service
revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased in fiscal
2005 compared with fiscal 2004 primarily due to growth in our
Consumer Tax electronic filing revenue and Innovative Merchant
Solutions merchant services revenue, both of which had minimal
cost increases associated with the related revenue increases,
and to customer service efficiencies in our outsourced payroll
business.

Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003.

Cost of product
revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased in fiscal
2004 compared with fiscal 2003. This was primarily due to a
continuing shift toward



sales of our higher-priced QuickBooks products and to lower
royalties incurred for our Consumer Tax and Quicken products.

Cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue
decreased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003. This
decrease was due in part to growth in our Consumer Tax
electronic filing revenue, which had minimal incremental costs.
Cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue also
decreased in fiscal 2004 due to growth in revenue from the
higher-margin Innovative Merchant Solutions merchant services
business we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.

Operating Expenses

We define core operating expenses as the controllable costs of
running our business. Selling and marketing expenses include the
cost of providing customer service and technical support to
customers who have not purchased support plans. Individually and
in the aggregate, core operating expenses as a percentage of
total net revenue were generally consistent in the periods
presented. Total core operating expenses in dollars increased in
fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 primarily due to spending
for infrastructure, implementation of our new information
systems, new product development and promotion and
Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. We plan to continue to upgrade our
new information systems to improve performance and support our
future growth. We also plan to continue to spend for new product
development and promotion. Total core operating expenses in
dollars increased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003
primarily due to spending for infrastructure and implementation
of our new information systems.



Segment Operating Income (Loss)

Segment operating income or loss is segment net revenue less
segment cost of revenue and operating expenses. Segment expenses
do not include certain costs, such as corporate general and
administrative expenses, that are not allocated to specific
segments. These unallocated costs totaled $388.0 million in
fiscal 2005, $348.5 million in fiscal 2004 and
$318.3 million in fiscal 2003. In addition, segment
expenses do not include amortization of purchased intangible
assets, acquisition-related charges, and impairment of goodwill
and purchased intangible assets. Segment expenses also do not
include interest and other income and realized net gains or
losses on marketable equity securities. See Note 9 to the
financial statements for reconciliations of total segment
operating income to income from continuing operations for each
fiscal year presented.

QuickBooks-Related

Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004.

QuickBooks-Related
segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was
flat in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. The 15% revenue
increase compared with fiscal 2004 was offset by increased
spending for QuickBooks product development, technical support
and marketing in fiscal 2005.

Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003.

QuickBooks-Related
segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was
flat in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003. The 18% revenue
increase compared with fiscal 2004 included strong growth in our
high-margin QuickBooks Payroll business and the first quarter
fiscal 2004 acquisition of Innovative Merchant Solutions. The
higher fiscal 2004 revenue was offset by increases in spending
for QuickBooks product development, technical support, marketing
programs and direct sales personnel and infrastructure.

Intuit-Branded Small Business

Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004.

Our Intuit-Branded
Small Business segment had operating income in fiscal 2005 after
experiencing an operating loss in fiscal 2004. This was
primarily due to outsourced payroll revenue growth combined with
customer service efficiencies, the consolidation of regional
sales facilities and a reorganization of the sales force that
resulted in lower spending in that business in fiscal 2005.

Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003.

Our Intuit-Branded
Small Business segment had a smaller operating loss in fiscal
2004 than it did in fiscal 2003. Revenue for this segment grew
11% while we held costs steady in our industry solutions
businesses. Partially offsetting these improvements, outsourced
payroll operating income was lower in fiscal 2004 because we
incurred expenses for additional sales and service personnel
during the first half of the year.



Consumer Tax

Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004.

Consumer Tax
segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was
slightly higher in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. Higher
revenue from TurboTax federal units and volume and price
increases in electronic filing and refund transfer services was
offset by higher expenses for advertising, product development,
customer support and retail merchandising.

Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003.

Consumer Tax
segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was
flat in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003. Higher revenue
and gross margin improvements due to higher average selling
prices and growing high-margin service revenues were partially
offset by additional costs incurred for national television and
radio advertising in fiscal 2004.

Professional Tax

Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004.

Professional Tax
segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue
decreased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. Higher
revenue was more than offset by higher spending for overall
customer support and for product development and marketing
related to our new ProSeries Basic and ProSeries Express
products.

Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003.

Professional Tax
segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue
declined slightly on a 3% revenue increase in fiscal 2004
compared with fiscal 2003. Segment operating income did not grow
in fiscal 2004 because of increased spending on product
development and customer service.

Other Businesses

Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004.

Other Businesses
segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue
increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. Quicken
revenue was higher while Quicken cost of revenue was relatively
flat primarily due to savings resulting from the outsourcing of
our Quicken.com website. Higher revenue combined with relatively
stable spending also produced better fiscal 2005 operating
margins in Canada.

Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003.

Other Businesses
segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue
increased slightly in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003.
Quicken revenue increased on relatively flat spending and we
exited the unprofitable online brokerage business in the first
quarter of fiscal 2004. Partially offsetting the Quicken
improvements, Canadian operating income as a percentage of
related revenue was down in fiscal 2004 due to lower revenue on
relatively stable spending.

Non-Operating Income and Expenses

Interest and Other Income

Higher interest rates and slightly higher average invested
balances resulted in an increase in interest income in fiscal
2005 compared with fiscal 2004. Interest income decreased in
fiscal 2004 compared with 2003 due to lower interest rates and
lower average invested balances that were a result of common
stock repurchases under our stock repurchase programs and
acquisitions. Total interest and other income for all



periods presented included royalties from trademark license and
distribution agreements that we entered into when we sold our
Quicken Loans mortgage business in July 2002. See Note 8 to
the financial statements. The decrease in net foreign exchange
gains in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 and in fiscal
2004 compared with fiscal 2003 resulted primarily from our
conversion of a significant portion of our Canadian intercompany
balances to long-term investments in that subsidiary in the
third quarter of fiscal 2004. This reduced our statement of
operations exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate was 32.6% for fiscal 2005, 28.4% for
fiscal 2004 and 32.9% for fiscal 2003. Our effective tax rate
for fiscal 2005 differed from the federal statutory rate
primarily due to the net effect of the reversal of
$25.7 million in reserves related to potential income tax
exposures that were resolved, the federal research and
experimental credit and to the benefit received from tax-exempt
interest income offset by state taxes. Our effective tax rate
for fiscal 2004 differed from the federal statutory rate
primarily due to the net effect of the reversal of
$35.7 million in reserves related to potential income tax
exposures that were resolved, the federal research and
experimental credit and to the benefit received from tax-exempt
interest income offset by state taxes and acquisition-related
charges. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 differed from
the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of
the benefit received from tax-exempt interest income and various
tax credits offset by state taxes and acquisition-related
charges. See Note 12 to the financial statements.

At July 31, 2005 we had net deferred tax assets of
$173.3 million, which included a valuation allowance of
$6.0 million for certain state capital loss carryforwards.
We decreased the valuation allowance by $1.5 million in
fiscal 2005 due to the realization of state capital loss
carryforwards that were previously estimated to be unrealizable
and adjustments made to foreign net operating loss
carryforwards. The allowance reflects management’s
assessment that we may not receive the benefit of certain loss
carryforwards in certain state jurisdictions. While we believe
our current valuation allowance is sufficient, it may be
necessary to increase this amount if it becomes more likely that
we will not realize a greater portion of the net deferred tax
assets. We assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation
allowance on a quarterly basis. See Note 12 to the
financial statements.

Discontinued Operations

Intuit Information Technology Solutions

In May 2005 our Board of Directors formally approved a plan to
sell our Intuit Information Technology Solutions
(ITS) business. In accordance with the provisions of
SFAS 144, we determined that ITS became a long-lived asset
held for sale and a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2005. Consequently, we have segregated the operating
results of ITS from continuing operations on our statement of
operations for all periods presented. Since the carrying value
of ITS at July 31, 2005 was less than the estimated fair
value less cost to sell, no adjustment to the carrying value of
this long-lived asset was necessary during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005. See Note 8 to the financial statements.

Intuit Public Sector Solutions

In December 2004 we sold our Intuit Public Sector Solutions
(IPSS) business for approximately $11 million and
accounted for the sale as a discontinued operation. In
accordance with SFAS 144, we have segregated the operating
results of IPSS from continuing operations on our statement of
operations for all periods prior to the sale. In fiscal 2005 we
recorded a loss on disposal of IPSS of $4.8 million that
included an income tax provision of $4.3 million for the
estimated tax payable in connection with the tax gain on the
transaction. The fiscal 2004 net loss from Intuit Public Sector
Solutions discontinued operations included a goodwill impairment
charge of $18.7 million. See Note 8 to the financial
statements.



Intuit KK

In February 2003 we sold our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary,
Intuit KK, and accounted for the sale as a discontinued
operation. In accordance with SFAS 144, we have segregated
the operating results of Intuit KK from continuing operations on
our statement of operations for all periods prior to the sale.
In fiscal 2003 we recorded a gain on disposal of this
discontinued operation of $71.0 million, net of income
taxes of $5.1 million. See Note 8 to the financial
statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Statements of Cash Flows

At July 31, 2005 our cash, cash equivalents and investments
totaled $994.3 million, a decrease of $23.7 million
from July 31, 2004. In fiscal 2005 we generated cash
primarily from continuing operations and by issuing common stock
under employee stock plans. We used cash in fiscal 2005
primarily for repurchases of common stock under our stock
repurchase programs and capital expenditures. The following
table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash
flows for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003. See the financial
statements in Item 8 for complete statements of cash flows
for those periods.

We generated cash from our operating activities during fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003, primarily from net income from continuing
operations in each of those years.

We used cash for investing activities during fiscal 2005, 2004
and 2003. Our primary use of cash for investing activities in
fiscal 2004 was for business acquisitions. Our primary use of
cash for investing activities in fiscal 2003 was for net
purchases of available-for-sale debt securities.

We used cash for financing activities in fiscal 2005, 2004 and
2003, primarily for the repurchase of common stock under our
stock repurchase programs. See

“Stock Repurchase
Programs”

below and Note 13 to the financial
statements. This was partially offset by proceeds that we
received from the issuance of common stock under employee stock
plans in each of these fiscal years.

Cash generated by discontinued operations in fiscal 2003
included collection of $245.6 million in amounts due from
the purchaser of our Quicken Loans business and a net gain of
$71.0 million from the sale of Intuit KK. See Note 8
to the financial statements.



Stock Repurchase Programs

Intuit’s Board of Directors has initiated a series of
common stock repurchase programs. Shares of common stock
repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. The
following table summarizes the historical activity under our
stock repurchase programs as of July 31, 2005.

In May 2005 our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of
up to $500.0 million of our common stock from time to time
over a three-year period under Repurchase Plan V, which expires
on May 15, 2008. At July 31, 2005 authorized funds of
approximately $290.8 million remained under Repurchase Plan
V. We expect to continue to repurchase shares under this plan in
fiscal 2006.

Loans to Executive Officers and Other Employees

Outstanding loans to executive officers and other employees
totaled $9.2 million at July 31, 2005 and
$17.1 million at July 31, 2004. Loans to executive
officers and other employees at July 31, 2005 excluded a
$5.5 million secured loan to one executive officer who
ceased to be an Intuit employee in the third quarter of fiscal
2005. We transferred this loan to other long-term assets on our
balance sheet in that quarter. Loans to executive officers are
primarily relocation loans that are generally secured by real
property and have original maturity dates of up to
10 years. At July 31, 2005 no loans were in default
and all interest payments were current in accordance with the
terms of the loan agreements. Consistent with the requirements
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, no loans to executive
officers have been made or modified since July 30, 2002 and
we do not intend to make or modify loans to executive officers
in the future. See Note 17 to the financial statements.

Repurchases of Vested Restricted Stock

In the third quarters of fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, we entered
into share repurchase agreements with Stephen M. Bennett, our
chief executive officer, pursuant to which we repurchased shares
of our common stock from Mr. Bennett at the closing price
quoted on The Nasdaq Stock Market on the dates of repurchase. We
repurchased 15,945 shares of our common stock at $41.81 per
share from Mr. Bennett in fiscal 2005, 17,157 shares at
$44.64 per share in fiscal 2004 and 17,532 shares at $39.02 in
fiscal 2003. All of the proceeds from these repurchases were
remitted to federal and state taxing authorities to satisfy
Mr. Bennett’s federal, state and Medicare tax
withholding obligations resulting from the vesting of 37,500
shares of our common stock in each of those three quarters under
his January 2000 new-hire restricted stock awards. These
repurchases were approved by our Board of Directors.

Other

We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring
technology or businesses, or establishing strategic
relationships with and investing in other companies. We may
decide to use cash and cash equivalents to fund such activities
in the future.

We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and investments will
be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital and
capital expenditure requirements for at least the next
12 months.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of July 31, 2005 we did not have any significant
off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in
Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulations S-K.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment”

On December 16, 2004 the FASB issued SFAS 123 (revised
2004),

“Share-Based Payment,”

(SFAS 123(R)) which is a revision of SFAS 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.”

SFAS 123(R) supercedes APB 25,

“Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees,”

and amends SFAS 95,

“Statement of Cash Flows.”

Generally, the
approach in SFAS 123(R) is similar to the approach
described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123(R) requires
all share-based payments to employees, including grants of
employee stock options and purchases under employee stock
purchase plans, to be recognized in the statement of operations
based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure of fair value
recognition will no longer be an alternative.

SFAS 123(R) is effective for public companies for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2005, with earlier adoption
permitted. We are required to adopt this new standard in the
first quarter of our fiscal year ending July 31, 2006.
SFAS 123(R) permits public companies to adopt its
requirements using one of two methods:

1.

A “modified prospective” method in which compensation
    cost is recognized beginning with the effective date
    (a) based on the requirements of SFAS 123(R) for all
    share-based payments granted after the effective date and
    (b) based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all
    awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that
    remain unvested on the effective date.

2.

A “modified retrospective” method which includes the
    requirements of the modified prospective method described above
    but also permits restatement using amounts previously disclosed
    under the pro forma provisions of SFAS 123 either for
    (a) all prior periods presented or (b) prior interim
    periods of the year of adoption.

We have not yet chosen a method of adoption for SFAS 123(R).

As permitted by SFAS 123, through the end of fiscal 2005 we
accounted for share-based payments to employees using APB
25’s intrinsic value method. As a consequence, we generally
recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options and
purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.



Although the adoption of SFAS 123(R)’s fair value
method will have no adverse impact on our balance sheet or net
cash flows, it will have a significant adverse impact on our net
income and net income per share. The pro forma effects on net
income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to share-based payments
to employees in prior periods are disclosed in Note 1 under

“Stock-Based Incentive Programs.”

Although the
pro forma effects of applying SFAS 123 may be indicative of
the effects of applying SFAS 123(R), the provisions of
these two statements differ in some important respects. The
actual effects of adopting SFAS 123(R) will depend on
numerous factors including the valuation model we use to value
future share-based payments to employees, estimated forfeiture
rates and the accounting policies we adopt concerning the method
of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite
service period. We currently estimate that the fiscal 2006
impact on Intuit of adopting SFAS 123(R) will be a decrease
in net income of approximately $45 million.

SFAS 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax deductions in
excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a
financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as
prescribed under current accounting rules. This requirement will
reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash
flows in periods after adoption. Total cash flow will remain
unchanged compared with cash flow as it would have been reported
under prior accounting rules.

SFAS 154,

“Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections”

On June 1, 2005 the FASB issued SFAS 154,

“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,”

which replaces APB 20,

“Accounting Changes,”

and SFAS 3,

“Reporting Accounting Changes in
Interim Financial Statements.”

SFAS 154 applies to
all voluntary changes in accounting principle, and changes the
requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in
accounting principle. SFAS 154 requires retrospective
application to prior periods’ financial statements of a
voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is
impracticable. APB 20 previously required that most voluntary
changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in
net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of
changing to the new accounting principle. SFAS 154 carries
forward many other provisions of APB 20 without change,
including the provisions related to the reporting of a change in
accounting estimate, a change in the reporting entity and the
correction of an error. SFAS 154 is effective for
accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2005. Earlier
application is permitted for accounting changes and corrections
of errors made in fiscal years beginning after June 1,
2005. We do not expect our adoption of this new standard to have
a material impact on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.



RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

In evaluating Intuit and our business, you should consider
the following factors in addition to the other information in
this annual report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements
in this report are subject to risks and uncertainties that could
cause our actual results to differ materially from the results
expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any of
the following risks could seriously harm our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

We face intense competitive pressures in all of our
businesses that may negatively impact our revenue, profitability
and market position.

We have formidable competitors, and we expect competition to
remain intense during fiscal 2006 and beyond. The number,
resources and sophistication of the companies with whom we
compete has increased as we continue to expand our product and
service offerings. Microsoft Corporation, in particular,
presents a significant threat to a number of our businesses due
to its market position, strategic focus and superior financial
resources. Our competitors may introduce new and improved
products and services, bundle new offerings with market-leading
products, reduce prices, gain better access to distribution
channels, advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new
products and services. Any of these competitive actions taken
over any prolonged period could diminish our revenue and
profitability and could affect our ability to keep existing
customers and acquire new customers. Some additional competitive
factors that may impact our businesses are discussed below.

QuickBooks-Related.

Losing existing or potential
QuickBooks customers to competitors causes us to lose potential
software revenue and limits our opportunities to sell related
products and services such as our financial supplies, QuickBooks
Payroll and merchant service offerings. Many competitors and
potential competitors provide, or have expressed significant
interest in providing, accounting and business management
products and services to small businesses. For example,
Microsoft currently offers a number of competitive small
business offerings and has indicated part of its growth strategy
is to focus on small business offerings. In November 2004
Microsoft announced the impending launch of a number of product
and service offerings aimed at small businesses, including a
product named Microsoft Office Small Business Accounting, which
is expected to be integrated with the Microsoft Office product
suite and available in the fall of 2005. Microsoft also
announced partnerships with ADP and other service providers to
offer payroll-related services that interact with its products.
In July 2005 Microsoft announced that it will collaborate with
leading merchant acquiring institutions, including Chase
Merchant Services LLC, to offer credit card processing for
Microsoft Office Small Business Accounting. Accordingly, we
expect that competition from Microsoft in the small business
area will intensify over time with the introduction of these and
other offerings that directly compete with our QuickBooks and
other offerings. Although we have successfully competed with
Microsoft in the past, given its market position and resources,
Microsoft’s small business product and service offerings
may have a significant negative impact on our revenue and
profitability.

Consumer Tax.

Our consumer tax business faces significant
competition from both the public and private sector. In the
public sector we face the risk of federal and state taxing
authorities developing or contracting to provide software or
other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and
electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers.

•

Federal Government.

Agencies of the U.S. government have
    made several attempts during the two most recent presidential
    administrations to offer taxpayers a form of free tax
    preparation software and filing service. However, in October
    2002 the U.S. Internal Revenue Service agreed not to provide its
    own competing tax software product or service so long as
    participants in an association of private tax preparation
    software companies, including Intuit, agreed to provide
    web-based federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost
    to qualified taxpayers for a period of three years, subject to
    recurring two-year extensions. The relationship, called the
    “Free File Alliance,” is principally designed to serve
    lower income, disadvantaged and underserved taxpayers with the
    objective of making free federal online tax preparation software
    and filing services available to at least 60% of taxpayers. The
    agreement is currently under negotiation by the federal
    government



and the Free File Alliance for possible changes. Although, for
    the time being, the Free File Alliance has kept the federal
    government from being a direct competitor to our tax offerings,
    it has fostered additional web-based competition and has the
    potential to cause us to lose revenue opportunities for a large
    percentage of the tax base. Over time, a growing number of
    competitors have used the Free File Alliance as a free marketing
    tool by giving away services at the federal level and attempting
    to make money by selling state filing and other services.
    Accordingly, for the 2004 tax season we modified our Free File
    Alliance offering to permit all taxpayers to prepare and file
    federal returns at no charge. Our free web-based offering was
    fully functional but it did not allow the download of prior year
    information into the current year tax return. Although we were
    successful in the 2004 tax season in selling Free File Alliance
    users enhanced offerings and state tax preparation services, we
    may not be successful in this endeavor in the future. In
    addition, persons who formerly have paid for our products may
    elect to use our unpaid federal offering instead. Any amendments
    to the current agreement could also have unexpected and negative
    effects on our business. Further, were the federal government to
    terminate the Free File Alliance and elect to provide its own
    software and electronic filing services available to taxpayers
    at no charge it would negatively impact our revenue and profits.

•

State Governments.

State taxing authorities have also
    actively pursued strategies to provide free online tax return
    preparation and electronic filing services for state taxpayers.
    For the 2004 tax season 22 states, including California,
    directly offered their own online services to taxpayers. In
    addition, for the 2004 tax season California tested its Ready
    Return concept by preparing about 60,000 state income tax
    returns from available electronic sources and presenting them at
    no additional cost to taxpayers for acceptance and filing. It is
    possible that other governmental entities that currently do not
    offer such services will elect to pursue similar competitive
    offerings in the future. These publicly sponsored programs have
    caused us to lose potential customers to free offerings and have
    enabled competitors to gain market share at our expense by using
    participation in the free alliances as an effective tool to
    attract customers to ancillary paid offerings. Given the
    efficiencies that electronic tax filing provides to taxing
    authorities, we anticipate that governmental competition will
    present a continued competitive threat to our business for the
    foreseeable future.

•

Private Sector.

In the private sector we face intense
    competition primarily from H&R Block, the makers of TaxCut
    software, and increasingly from web-based competitive offerings
    where we are subject to significant and increasing price
    pressure. We also compete for customers with low-cost assisted
    tax preparation businesses, such as H&R Block.

Other Segments (Intuit-Branded Small Business, Professional
Tax and Other Businesses).

Our professional tax offerings
face pricing pressure from competitors seeking to obtain our
customers through deep product discounts and loss of customers
to competitors offering no-frills offerings at low prices, such
as Kleinrock Publishing’s ATX product line. This business
also faces competition from competitively-priced tax and
accounting solutions that include integration with non-tax
functionality. The substantial size of our principal competitors
in the outsourced payroll services business benefit from greater
economies of scale that may result in pricing pressure for our
offerings. In addition, in November 2004 Microsoft announced
that it had entered into partnership agreements with ADP and
other service providers to offer payroll-related services that
interact with its products. The growth of electronic banking and
other electronic payment systems is decreasing the demand for
checks and consequently causing pricing pressure for our
supplies products as competitors aggressively compete for share
of this shrinking market. Our Quicken products compete both with
Microsoft Money, which is aggressively promoted and priced, and
with web-based electronic banking and personal finance tracking
and management tools that are becoming increasingly available at
no cost to consumers. These competitive pressures may result in
reduced revenue and lower profitability for our Quicken product
line and related bill payment service offering.

Future revenue growth for our core products depends upon
our introduction of new and enhanced products and
services.

Our customer-driven invention and associated product development
efforts are critical to our success. The introduction of new
offerings and product and service enhancements are necessary for
us to differentiate



our offerings from those of our competitors and to motivate our
existing customers to purchase upgrades, or current year
products in the case of our tax offerings. A number of our
businesses derive a significant amount of their revenue through
one-time upfront license fees and rely on customer upgrades and
service offerings that include upgrades to generate a
significant portion of their revenues. As our existing products
mature, encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades
becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide
features and functionality that have meaningful incremental
value. If we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the
value of upgraded products to our customers, our upgrade and
service revenues will be negatively impacted. Similarly, our
business will be harmed if we are not successful in our efforts
to develop and introduce new products and services to retain our
existing customers, expand our customer base and increase
revenues per customer.

Our new product and service offerings may not achieve
market success or may cannibalize sales of our existing
products, causing our revenues and earnings to decrease.

Our future success depends in large part upon our ability to
identify emerging opportunities in our target markets and our
capacity to quickly develop, and sell products and services that
satisfy these demands in a cost effective manner. Successfully
predicting demand trends is difficult, and we may expend a
significant amount of resources and management attention on
products or services that do not ultimately succeed in their
markets. We have encountered difficulty in launching new
products and services in the past. For example, in 2004 we
discontinued our QuickBooks Premier Healthcare offering due to
lack of customer demand. If we misjudge customer needs, our new
products and services will not succeed and our revenues and
earnings will be negatively impacted. In addition, as we expand
our offerings to new customer categories we run the risk of
customers shifting from higher priced and higher margin products
to newly introduced lower priced offerings. For instance, our
new QuickBooks Simple Start offering, our new Snap Tax offering
and our new ProSeries Basic and ProSeries Express offerings may
attract users that would otherwise have purchased our higher
priced, more full featured offerings.

The nature of our products necessitates timely product
launches and if we experience significant product quality
problems or delays, it will harm our revenues, operating income
and reputation.

All of our tax products and many of our non-tax products have
rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in
our products and the risk of launch delays. Many of our products
are highly complex and require interoperability with other
software products and services. Our tax preparation software
product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the
need to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes
each year and because our customers expect high levels of
accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and
file their taxes by April 15th. Due to this complexity and
the condensed development cycles under which we operate, our
products sometimes contain “bugs” that can
unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software. For
example, our software may face interoperability difficulties
with software operating systems or programs being used by our
customers. When we encounter problems we may be required to
modify our code, distribute patches to customers who have
already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing
product inventory in our distribution channels. If we encounter
development challenges or discover errors in our products late
in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product
launch date. Any major defects or launch delays could lead to
the following:

•

loss of customers to competitors, which could also deprive us of
    future revenue attributable to repeat purchases, product
    upgrades and purchases of related services;

•

negative publicity and damage to our brands;

•

customer dissatisfaction;

•

reduced retailer shelf space and product promotions; and

•

increased operating expenses, such as inventory replacement
    costs and in our Consumer Tax business, expenses resulting from
    our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by
    customers due solely to calculation errors in our consumer tax
    preparation products.



The growth of our business depends on our ability to adapt
to rapid technological change.

The software industry in which we operate is characterized by
rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and
frequent new product introductions and enhancements. Our Right
for Me marketing approach increases the importance for us of
developing additional versions of our products to meet specific
customer needs. Our ability to succeed in this rapidly changing
environment requires that we continuously invest resources to
enhance our software architecture and developer tools. We must
make this investment in order to continue to enhance our current
products and develop new products to meet changing customer
needs and to attract and retain talented software developers. We
are currently in the process of modernizing the software
platforms for a number of our product lines, including our
QuickBooks, TurboTax, Quicken and IDMS products. Completing
these upgrades and adapting to other technological developments
may require considerable time and expense. If we experience
prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in upgrading our
software architecture, our ability to develop new products and
enhancements to our current products would suffer.

If we fail to maintain reliable and responsive service
levels for our electronic tax offerings, or if the IRS or other
governmental agencies experience difficulties in receiving
customer submissions, we could lose revenue and
customers.

Our web-based tax preparation services, electronic filing
services and “pay-as-you-go” services are an important
and growing part of our tax businesses and must effectively
handle extremely heavy customer demand during the peak tax
season from January to April. We face significant risks and
challenges in maintaining these services and maintaining
adequate service levels, particularly during peak volume service
times. Similarly, governmental entities receiving electronic tax
filings must also handle large volumes of data and may
experience difficulties with their systems preventing the
receipt of electronic filings. If customers are unable to file
their returns electronically they may elect to make paper
filings. This would result in reduced electronic tax return
preparation and filing revenues and profits and would negatively
impact our reputation and ability to keep and attract customers
who demand a reliable electronic filing experience. We have
experienced relatively brief unscheduled interruptions in our
electronic filing and/or tax preparation services during past
tax years. For example, on April 15, 2003 we experienced a
relatively brief unscheduled interruption in our electronic
filing service during which certain users of our professional
tax products were unable to receive confirmation from us that
their electronic filing had been accepted and on April 15,
2002 we reached maximum capacity for processing e-filings for a
short period of time. If we experience any prolonged
difficulties with our web-based tax preparation or electronic
filing service at any time during the tax season, we could lose
current and future customers, receive negative publicity and
incur increased operating costs, any of which could have a
significant negative impact on the financial and market success
of these businesses and have a negative impact on our near-term
and long-term financial results.

If actual product returns exceed returns reserves, or if
actual customer rebate redemptions exceed rebate reserves, our
revenue would be lower.

We ship more desktop software products to our distributors and
retailers than we expect them to sell, in order to reduce the
risk that distributors or retailers will run out of products.
This is particularly true for our Consumer Tax products, which
have a short selling season and for which returns occur
primarily in our fiscal third and fourth quarters. Like many
software companies that sell their products through distributors
and retailers, we have historically accepted significant product
returns. We establish reserves against revenue for product
returns in our financial statements, based on estimated future
returns of products. We closely monitor levels of product sales
and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain
reserves that are adequate to cover expected returns. In the
past, returns have not generally exceeded these reserves.
However, if we do experience actual returns that significantly
exceed reserves, it would result in lower net revenue. For
example, if we had increased our fiscal 2005 returns reserves by
1% of non-consignment sales to retailers for QuickBooks,
TurboTax and Quicken, our fiscal 2005 total net revenue would
have been approximately $3.6 million lower. In addition,
our policy of recognizing revenue from distributors and
retailers upon delivery of product for non-consignment sales is
predicated upon our



ability to reasonably estimate returns. If we do not continue to
demonstrate our ability to estimate returns then our revenue
recognition policy for these types of sales may no longer be
appropriate. We also offer customer rebates as part of our
selling efforts and establish reserves through a charge to
revenue for estimated future payments of rebates. Historically,
a percentage of customers do not submit requests for their
rebates. Rebate redemption rates are going up because we, along
with certain retailers, are making it easier for customers to
claim rebates. While we have taken this trend into account in
determining our rebate reserves, if a greater number of eligible
customers seek rebates than for which we have provided reserves
our margins will be adversely affected. If rebate redemptions
for our QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken products were to
increase by 1%, our annual total net revenue would decrease by
approximately $1.2 million.

We are continuing to enhance our new information systems,
which we use to manage our business and finance operations, and
problems with the design or implementation of these enhancements
could interfere with our business and operations.

In September 2004 we implemented new information systems that
manage our business and finance operations. During the course of
the conversion we upgraded significant financial systems,
order-taking systems, middleware systems (systems that allow for
interoperability of different databases) and network security
systems. While we were able to complete the processing
requirements of our peak business season in fiscal 2005, we
experienced some system-related slowdowns. Consequently, we
believe that we need to further enhance and upgrade the systems
over the next several months to improve performance and support
our future growth. In the event that we are unable to expand the
capabilities of our systems, our ability to grow our business
will be limited. The expenditures associated with the expansion
and upgrade of our systems could be significant. Problems with
the design or implementation of these system enhancements could
adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely and
accurate manner: take customer orders, ship products, provide
services and support to our customers, bill and track our
customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our
business.

Our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and our
quarterly results fluctuate significantly.

Several of our businesses are highly seasonal causing
significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results.
Revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the
second and third fiscal quarters ending January 31 and
April 30 due to our tax businesses contributing most of
their revenue during those quarters and the timing of the
release of our small business software upgrades. We experience
lower revenues, and significant operating losses, in the first
and fourth quarters ending October 31 and July 31. For
example, in the second and third quarters of our last two fiscal
years we had total net revenue of between $620.6 million
and $834.9 million while in our first and fourth fiscal
quarters we had total net revenue of between $227.1 million
and $301.8 million. Our financial results can also
fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a
variety of factors, including changes in product sales mix that
affect average selling prices, product release dates, the timing
of our discontinuance of support for older product offerings,
the timing of sales of our higher-priced Intuit-Branded Small
Business offerings, our methods for distributing our products,
including the shift to a consignment model for some of our
desktop products sold through retail distribution channels, the
inclusion of upgrades with certain offerings (which can impact
the pattern of revenue recognition), and the timing of
acquisitions, divestitures, and goodwill and purchased
intangible asset impairment charges.

As our product and service offerings become more complex
our revenue streams may become less predictable.

Our expanding range of products and services generates more
varied revenue streams than our traditional desktop software
businesses. The accounting policies that apply to these revenue
streams are more complex than those that apply to our
traditional products and services. We expect this trend to
continue as we acquire additional companies and expand our
offerings. For example, as we begin to offer additional features
and options as part of multiple-element revenue arrangements, we
could be required to defer a higher percentage of our product
revenue at the time of sale than we do for traditional products.
This would decrease recognized revenue at the time products are
shipped, but result in increased recognized



revenue in fiscal periods after shipment. In addition, our
Intuit-Branded Small Business segment businesses offer products
and services with significantly higher prices than our
traditional core business software products. Revenue from these
offerings tends to be less predictable than revenue from our
traditional desktop products due to longer sales and
implementation cycles, which could cause our quarterly revenue
from these businesses to fluctuate.

Acquisition-related costs and impairment charges can cause
significant fluctuation in our net income.

Our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses,
including amortization of purchased assets (which is reflected
in cost of revenue), as well as charges for in-process research
and development, impairment of goodwill, amortization and
impairment of purchased intangible assets and charges for
deferred compensation (which are reflected in operating
expenses). Total acquisition-related costs in the categories
identified above were $26.8 million in fiscal 2005,
$33.6 million in fiscal 2004 and $45.1 million in
fiscal 2003. Although under current accounting rules goodwill is
no longer amortized, we may incur impairment charges related to
the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of
future acquisitions. We test the impairment of goodwill annually
in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of
impairment arise. The timing of the formal annual test may
result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth
fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in
prior periods. For example, at the end of fiscal 2004 we
incurred a goodwill impairment charge of $18.7 million
related to our Intuit Public Sector Solutions business. As of
July 31, 2005 we had goodwill of $509.5 million and
unamortized purchased intangible assets of $69.7 million on
our balance sheet, both of which could be subject to impairment
charges in the future. New acquisitions, and any impairment of
the value of purchased assets, could have a significant negative
impact on our future operating results.

If we do not respond promptly and effectively to customer
service and technical support inquiries we will lose customers
and our revenues will decline.

The effectiveness of our customer service and technical support
operations are critical to customer satisfaction and our
financial success. If we do not respond effectively to service
and technical support requests we will lose customers and miss
revenue opportunities, such as paid service, product renewals
and new product sales. In our service offerings, such as our
merchant card processing and outsourced payroll businesses,
customer service delivery is fundamental to retaining and
maintaining existing customers and acquiring new customers. We
occasionally experience customer service and technical support
problems, including longer than expected waiting times for
customers when our staffing and systems are inadequate to handle
a higher-than-anticipated volume of requests. We also risk
losing service at any one of our customer contact centers and
our redundancy systems could prove inadequate to provide backup
support. Training and retaining qualified customer service and
technical support personnel is particularly challenging due to
the expansion of our product offerings and the seasonality of
our tax business. For example, in fiscal 2005 the number of our
consumer tax service representatives ranged from 15 during
off-season months to about 715 at the peak of the season. If we
do not adequately train our support representatives our
customers will not receive the level of support that they demand
and we strive to deliver. To improve our performance in this
area, we must eliminate underlying causes of service and support
requests through product improvements, better order fulfillment
processes, more robust self-help tools, and improved ability to
accurately anticipate demand for support. Implementing any of
these improvements can be expensive, time consuming and
ultimately prove unsuccessful. If we do not deliver the high
level of support that our customers expect for any of the
reasons stated above we will lose customers and our financial
results will suffer.

If we encounter problems with our third-party customer
service and technical support providers our business will be
harmed and our margins will decline.

We outsource a substantial portion of our customer service and
technical support activities to domestic and international
third-party service providers, including to service providers in
India. During fiscal 2004 we greatly increased the number of
third-party customer service representatives working on our
behalf and we



expect to continue to rely heavily on third parties in the
future. This strategy provides us with lower operating costs and
greater flexibility, but also presents risks to our business,
including the following:

•

International outsourcing has received considerable negative
    attention in the media and there are indications that the U.S.
    Congress may pass legislation that would impact how we operate
    and impact customer perceptions of our service. For example, in
    Congress legislators have discussed restricting the flow of
    personal information to overseas providers and requiring
    representatives in foreign jurisdictions to affirmatively
    identify themselves by name and location;

•

Customers may react negatively to providing information to and
    receiving support from overseas organizations;

•

We may not be able to impact the quality of support that we
    provide as directly as we are able to in our company-run call
    centers;

•

In recent years India has experienced political instability and
    changing policies that may impact our operations. In addition,
    for a number of years India and Pakistan have been in conflict
    and an active state of war between the two countries could
    disrupt our services; and

•

We rely on a global communications infrastructure that may be
    interrupted in a number of ways. For example, in fiscal 2004 we
    had to reroute calls to India due to an underwater cable being
    cut in the Mediterranean Sea.

We depend upon a small number of larger retailers to
generate a significant portion of our sales volume for our
desktop software products.

We sell most of our desktop software products through our retail
distribution channel and a relatively small number of larger
retailers generate a significant portion of our sales volume.
Our principal retailers have significant bargaining leverage due
to their size and available resources. Any change in principal
business terms, termination or major disruption of our
relationship with these resellers could result in a potentially
significant decline in our revenues and earnings. For example,
the sourcing decisions, product display locations and
promotional activities that retailers undertake can greatly
impact the sales of our products. Due to its seasonal nature,
sales of TurboTax are particularly impacted by such decisions
and if our principal distribution sources were to elect to carry
or promote competitive products our revenues would decline. The
fact that we also sell our products directly could cause
retailers to reduce their efforts to promote our products or
stop selling our products altogether. If any of our retailers
run into financial difficulties we may be unable to collect
amounts that we are owed.

Selling new products may be more challenging and costlier
than selling our historical products, causing our margins to
decline.

Because our strategy for some of our products involves the
routine introduction of new products at retail, if retailers do
not offer our new products we will not be able to grow as
planned. An outcome of our Right for Me marketing approach is
the introduction of additional versions of our products.
Retailers may be reluctant to stock unproven products, or
products that sell at higher prices, but more slowly. Retailers
may also choose to place less emphasis on software as a category
within their stores. In addition, it may be costlier for us to
market and sell some of our higher priced products due to our
need to convey the more customer-specific value of the products
to customers rather than communicating more generalized
benefits. This may require us to develop other marketing
programs that supplement our traditional in-store promotional
efforts to sell these products to customers causing our margins
to shrink. If retail distribution proves an ineffective channel
for certain of our new offerings it could adversely impact our
growth, revenue and profitability.

If our manufacturing and distribution suppliers execute
poorly our business will be harmed.

We have chosen to outsource the manufacturing and distribution
of many of our desktop software products to a small number of
third party providers and we use a single vendor to produce and
distribute our check and business forms supplies products.
Although our reliance on a small number of suppliers, or a
single supplier, provides us with efficiencies and enhanced
bargaining power, poor performance by or lack of effective
communication with these parties can significantly harm our
business. This risk is amplified by



the fact that we carry very little inventory and rely on
just-in-time manufacturing processes. We mitigate this risk by
managing our second tier vendors and maintaining contingency
plans. We have experienced problems with our suppliers in the
past. For example, during fiscal 2004 one of our suppliers was
unable to fulfill orders for some of our software products for a
number of days due to operational difficulties and communication
errors. Although together we were able to mitigate the impact of
that delay with minimal disruption to our business, if we
experience longer delays, delays during a peak demand period or
significant quality issues our business could be significantly
harmed.

Failure to maintain the availability and security of the
systems, networks, databases and software required to operate
and deliver our Internet-based products and services could
adversely affect our operating results.

Our Internet-based product and service offerings, including
QuickBooks Online Edition, QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service,
Complete web-based Payroll, Turbo Tax for the Web, consumer and
professional electronic tax filing services, Quicken.com and
QuickBase, rely on a variety of systems, networks and databases,
many of which are maintained by us at our data centers. In order
to prevent interruptions to the availability of our
Internet-based products and services, we generally follow
industry-standard practices for creating a fault-tolerant
environment. However, we do not have complete redundancy for all
of our systems. We maintain back-up processing capabilities that
are designed to protect us against site-related disasters for
many of our mission-critical applications. Notwithstanding our
efforts to protect against “down time” for our
Internet-based products and services, we do occasionally
experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties. In order
to provide our Internet-based products and services, we must
protect the security of our systems, networks, databases and
software. Like all companies that deliver products and services
via the Internet, we are subject to attack by computer hackers
who develop and deploy software that is designed to penetrate
the security of our systems and networks. A hacker who is able
to penetrate our security systems could misappropriate or damage
our proprietary information or cause disruptions in the delivery
of our products and services. We believe that we have taken
steps to protect against such attacks. However, there can be no
assurance that our security measures will not be penetrated by
experienced hackers. In the event that the systems, networks,
databases and software required to deliver our Internet-based
products and services become unavailable or suffer technical
difficulties or a breach in security, we may be required to
expend significant resources to alleviate these problems, and
our operating results could suffer. In addition, any such
interruption or breach of security could damage our reputation
and lead to the loss of customers.

Failure of our information technology systems or those of
our service providers could adversely affect our future
operating results.

We rely on a variety of internal technology systems and
technology systems maintained by our outside manufacturing and
distribution suppliers to take and fulfill customer orders,
handle customer service requests, host our web-based activities,
support internal operations, and store customer and company
data. These systems could be damaged or interrupted, preventing
us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling
customer orders or otherwise interrupting our business. In
addition, these systems could suffer security breaches, causing
company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed. Any
of these occurrences could adversely impact our operations. We
have experienced system challenges in the past. For example,
during fiscal 2004 some of our non-critical systems were
interrupted due to computer viruses that caused loss of
productivity and added expense. We also experience computer
server failures from time to time. To prevent interruptions we
must continually upgrade our systems and processes to ensure
that we have adequate recoverability – both of which
are costly and time consuming. While we and our outside service
partners have backup systems for certain aspects of our
operations, not all systems upon which we rely are fully
redundant and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient
for all eventualities.

Possession and use of personal customer information by our
businesses presents risks and expenses that could harm our
business.

A number of our businesses possess personal customer
information, including credit card numbers. We use commercially
available encryption technology to transmit customer information
when orders are placed over the Internet. However, there can be
no assurance that a third party will not be able to circumvent



these security measures. Possession and use of personal customer
information in conducting our business subjects us to regulatory
burdens and potential lawsuits. We have incurred — and
will continue to incur — significant expenses to
comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and
protocols and there is a trend toward greater regulation of
privacy. For example, regulations like the recently created
federal “Do Not Call List,” and actions by Internet
service providers to limit communications with their subscribers
may impede our ability to communicate with our customers and
increase our compliance costs. Because our businesses rely
heavily on direct marketing, any limitations on our ability to
communicate with our customers could harm our financial results.
In the past we have experienced lawsuits and negative publicity
relating to privacy issues and we could face similar suits in
the future. A major breach of customer privacy or security by
Intuit, or even another company, could have serious negative
consequences for our businesses, including direct damages that
we may be required to pay as a result of a breach by us, reduced
customer demand for our services, damage to our reputation and
additional regulation by federal or state agencies. Although we
have sophisticated network security, internal control measures,
and physical security procedures to safeguard customer
information, there can be no assurance that a data security
breach or theft will not occur resulting in harm to our business
and results of operations.

We are exposed to risks associated with credit card fraud
and credit card processing and payment.

Many of our customers use credit cards to pay for our services.
We have suffered losses, and may continue to suffer losses, as a
result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data. Under
current credit card practices, we may be liable for fraudulent
credit card transactions if we do not obtain a cardholder’s
signature, a frequent practice in Internet sales. We employ
technology solutions to help us detect fraudulent credit card
transactions. However, the failure to detect or control credit
card fraud could have an adverse effect on our results of
operations.

If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property
rights, competitors may exploit our innovations, which could
weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenues.

Our success depends upon our proprietary technology. We rely on
a combination of copyright, trade secret, trademark, patent,
confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to
establish and protect our proprietary rights. As part of our
confidentiality procedures, we generally enter into
non-disclosure agreements with our employees, contractors,
distributors and corporate partners and into license agreements
with respect to our software, documentation and other
proprietary information. Effectively creating and protecting our
proprietary rights is expensive and may require us to engage in
costly and distracting litigation. Despite these precautions,
third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our
products or technology without authorization. Because we
outsource significant aspects of our product development,
manufacturing and distribution we are at risk that confidential
portions of our intellectual property could become public by
lapses in security by our contractors. We have licensed in the
past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our
proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material,
to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the
value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. It is
also possible that other companies could successfully challenge
the validity or scope of our patents and that our patent
portfolio, which is relatively small, may not provide us with a
meaningful competitive advantage. Ultimately, our attempts to
secure legal protection for our proprietary rights may not be
adequate and our competitors could independently develop similar
technologies, duplicate our products, or design around patents
and other intellectual property rights. If our intellectual
property protection proves inadequate we could lose our
competitive advantage and our financial results will suffer.

We expect copying and misuse of our intellectual property
to be a persistent problem causing lost revenue and increased
expenses.

Our intellectual property rights are among our most valuable
assets. Policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is
difficult, expensive, and time consuming. Current U.S. laws that
prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from
software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide
very little protection. We may not be able to prevent
misappropriation of our technology. For example, we frequently
encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through
online auction sites and other



online marketplaces. In addition, efforts to protect our
intellectual property may be misunderstood and perceived
negatively by our customers. For example, during 2003 we
employed technology to prohibit unauthorized sharing of our
TurboTax products. These efforts were not effectively
communicated causing a negative reaction by some of our
customers who misunderstood our actions. Although we continue to
evaluate technology solutions to piracy, and we continue to
increase our civil and criminal enforcement efforts, we expect
piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues
and increased expenses.

Although we are unable to quantify the extent of piracy of our
software products, software piracy may depress our net revenues.
We engage in efforts to educate consumers on the benefits of
licensing genuine products and to educate lawmakers on the
advantages of a business climate where intellectual property
rights are protected, and we cooperate with the Software &
Information Industry Association in their efforts to combat
piracy. However, these efforts may not affect the piracy of our
products.

We do not own all of the software, other technologies and
content used in our products and services.

Many of our products are designed to include intellectual
property owned by third parties. We believe we have all of the
necessary licenses from third parties to use and distribute
third party technology and content that we do not own that is
used in our current products and services. From time to time we
may be required to renegotiate with these third
parties – or negotiate with new third
parties – to include their technology or content in
our existing products, in new versions of our existing products
or in wholly new products. We may not be able to negotiate or
renegotiate licenses on reasonable terms, or at all. If we are
unable to obtain the rights necessary to use or continue to use
third-party technology or content in our products and services,
we may not be able to sell the affected products, which would in
turn have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results.

Third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary
rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and
prevent us from selling our products.

From time to time, we have received claims that we have
infringed the intellectual property rights of others. As the
number of products in the software industry increases and the
functionality of these products further overlap, and as we
acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, we believe
that we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims,
including patent, copyright, and trademark infringement claims.
We expect that software products in general will increasingly be
subject to these claims as the number of products and
competitors increase, the functionality of products overlap and
as the patenting of software functionality continues to grow. We
have, from time to time, received allegations of patent
infringement claims in the past and may receive more claims in
the future based on allegations that our products infringe upon
patents held by third parties. The receipt of a notice alleging
infringement may require us to obtain a costly opinion of
counsel to prevent an allegation of intentional infringement.
Future claims could present an exposure of uncertain magnitude.
We believe that we would be able to obtain any necessary
licenses or other rights to disputed intellectual property
rights on commercially reasonable terms. However, the ultimate
outcome of any allegation is uncertain and, regardless of
outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, could be time
consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert
management’s time and attention from our business, require
us to stop selling, to delay shipping or to redesign our
products, or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or
licensing arrangements, or to satisfy indemnification
obligations that we have with some of our customers. Our failure
to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation
arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely
affect our business.

In addition, we license and use software from third parties in
our business. These third party software licenses may not
continue to be available to us on acceptable terms. Also, these
third parties may from time to time receive claims that they
have infringed the intellectual property rights of others,
including patent and copyright infringement claims, which may
affect our ability to continue licensing their software. Our
inability to use any of this third party software could result
in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business, which
could materially and adversely affect our operating results.



Our acquisition activity could disrupt our ongoing
business and may present risks not contemplated at the time of
the transactions.

We have acquired and may continue to acquire companies, products
and technologies that complement our strategic direction. These
acquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties,
including:

•

inability to successfully integrate the acquired technology and
    operations into our business and maintain uniform standards,
    controls, policies, and procedures;

•

distraction of management’s attention away from normal
    business operations;

•

challenges retaining the key employees of the acquired operation;

•

insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed;

•

expenses associated with the acquisition; and

•

unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process,
    including product quality issues and legal contingencies.

Acquisitions are inherently risky. We can not be certain that
our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will
not materially adversely affect the conduct, operating results
or financial condition of our business. We have generally paid
cash for our recent acquisitions. If we issue common stock or
other equity related purchase rights as consideration in an
acquisition, current shareholders’ percentage ownership and
earnings per share may become diluted.

If we fail to operate our outsourced payroll business
effectively our revenue and profitability will be harmed.

Our payroll business handles a significant amount of dollar and
transaction volume. Due to the size and volume of transactions
that we handle effective processing systems and controls are
essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately.
Despite our efforts, it is possible that we may make errors or
that funds may be misappropriated. In addition to any direct
damages and fines that any such problems would create, which
could be substantial, the loss of customer confidence in our
accuracy and controls would seriously harm our business. Our
payroll business has grown largely through acquisitions and our
systems are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are
difficult to scale. We must constantly continue to upgrade our
systems and processes to ensure that we process customer data in
an accurate, reliable and timely manner. These upgrades must
also meet the various regulatory requirements and deadlines
associated with employer-related payroll activities. Any failure
of our systems or processes in critical switch-over times, such
as in January when many businesses elect to change payroll
service providers, would be detrimental to our business. If we
failed to timely deliver any of our payroll products, it could
cause our current and prospective customers to choose a
competitor’s product for that year’s payroll and not
to purchase Intuit products in the future. To generate sustained
growth in our payroll business we must successfully develop and
manage a more proactive inside and field sales operation. If
these efforts are not successful our revenue growth and
profitability will decline.

Interest income attributable to payroll customer deposits
may fluctuate or be eliminated, causing our revenue and
profitability to decline.

We currently record revenue from interest earned on customer
deposits that we hold pending payment of funds to taxing
authorities or to customers’ employees. If interest rates
decline, or there are regulatory changes that diminish the
amount of time that we are required or permitted to hold such
funds, our interest revenue will decline.

We face a number of risks in our merchant card processing
business that could result in a reduction in our revenues and
profits.

Our merchant card processing service business is subject to the
following risks:

•

if merchants for whom we process credit card transactions are
    unable to pay refunds due to their customers in connection with
    disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions we may be required
    to pay those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of
    the customer reserves we have established to make such payments;



•

we will not be able to conduct our business if the bank sponsors
    and card payment processors and other service providers that we
    rely on to process bank card transactions terminate their
    relationships with us and we are not able to secure or
    successfully migrate our business elsewhere;

•

we could be required to stop providing payment processing
    services for Visa and MasterCard if we or our bank sponsors fail
    to adhere to the standards of the Visa and MasterCard credit
    card associations;

•

we depend on independent sales organizations, some of which do
    not serve us exclusively, to acquire and retain merchant
    accounts;

•

our profit margins will be reduced if for competitive reasons we
    cannot increase our fees at times when Visa and MasterCard
    increase the fees that we pay to process merchant transactions
    through their systems;

•

unauthorized disclosure of merchant and cardholder data, whether
    through breach of our computer systems or otherwise, could
    expose us to protracted and costly litigation; and

•

we may encounter difficulties scaling our business systems to
    support our growth.

Should any of these risks be realized our business could be
harmed and our financial results will suffer.

Increased state tax filing mandates, such as the required
use of specific technologies, could significantly increase our
costs.

We are required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency
standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation
and electronic filing services. Changes in state-imposed
requirements by one or more of the states, including the
required use of specific technologies or technology standards,
could significantly increase the costs of providing those
services to our customers and could prevent us from delivering a
quality product to our customers in a timely manner.

We may be unable to attract and retain key
personnel.

Much of our future success depends on the continued service and
availability of skilled personnel, including members of our
executive team, and those in technical, marketing and staff
positions. Experienced personnel in the software and services
industries are in high demand and competition for their talents
is intense, especially in Silicon Valley and San Diego,
California, where the majority of our employees are located.
Although we strive to be an employer of choice, we may not be
able to continue to successfully attract and retain key
personnel which would cause our business to suffer.

Our insurance policies are costly, may be inadequate and
potentially expose us to unrecoverable risks.

Insurance availability, coverage terms and pricing continue to
vary with market conditions. We endeavor to obtain appropriate
insurance coverage for insurable risks that we identify,
however, we may fail to correctly anticipate or quantify
insurable risks, we may not be able to obtain appropriate
insurance coverage, and insurers may not respond as we intend to
cover insurable events that may occur. We have observed rapidly
changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly
all areas of traditional corporate insurance. Such conditions
have resulted in higher premium costs, higher policy
deductibles, and lower coverage limits. For some risks, because
of cost or availability, we do not have insurance coverage. For
these reasons, we are retaining a greater portion of insurable
risks than we have in the past at relatively greater cost.

Required expensing of stock options will significantly
reduce our net income and earnings per share.

Although we were not previously required to record any
compensation expense in connection with option grants to
employees that have an exercise price at or above fair market
value, a change in generally accepted accounting principles
requires us to treat all employee stock options as compensation
expense beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The
increased compensation expense will significantly reduce our net
income and earnings per share under generally accepted
accounting principles. See

“Recent Accounting
Pronouncements”

earlier in this Item 7.



We are frequently a party to litigation that is costly to
defend and consumes the time of our management.

Due to our financial position and the large number of customers
that we serve we are often forced to defend litigation. For
example, we are currently being sued in an action for claims
related to Quicken Brokerage powered by Siebert, a strategic
alliance between the two companies. Although we believe that
this case has no merit and we are defending the matter
vigorously, defending such matters consumes the time of our
management and is expensive for Intuit. Even though we often
seek insurance coverage for litigation defense costs, there is
no assurance that our defense costs, which can be substantial,
will be covered in all cases. In addition, by its nature,
litigation is unpredictable and we may not prevail even in cases
where we strongly believe a plaintiff’s case has no valid
claims. If we do not prevail in litigation we may be required to
pay substantial monetary damages or alter our business
operations. Regardless of the outcome, litigation is expensive
and consumes the time of our management and may ultimately
reduce our income.

Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our
future results.

Our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably
affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our
deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws
or their interpretation. In addition, we are subject to the
continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal
Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess
the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these
examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for
income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from
these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on
our operating results and financial condition.

Our stock price may be volatile.

Our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility
as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated
financial results and as a result of our announcements and those
of our competitors. In addition, the stock market has
experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have
affected the market price of many technology companies in ways
that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these
companies. These factors, as well as general economic and
political conditions, may materially adversely affect the market
price of our stock in the future.

If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal
controls, we may not be able to detect fraud or report our
financial results accurately, which could harm our business and
the trading price of our common stock.

Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide
reliable financial reports and to detect and prevent fraud. We
periodically assess our system of internal controls, and the
internal controls of service providers upon which we rely, to
review their effectiveness and identify potential areas of
improvement. These assessments may conclude that enhancements,
modifications or changes to our system of internal controls are
necessary. In addition, from time to time we acquire businesses,
many of which have limited infrastructure and systems of
internal controls. Performing assessments of internal controls,
implementing necessary changes, and maintaining an effective
internal controls process is expensive and requires considerable
management attention, particularly in the case of newly acquired
entities. Internal control systems are designed in part upon
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and all such
systems, however well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
the system are met. Because of these and other inherent
limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that
any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. If we
fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal
controls or prevent fraud, we could suffer losses, could be
subject to costly litigation, investors could lose confidence in
our reported financial information and our brand and operating
results could be harmed, which could have a negative effect on
the trading price of our common stock.

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we and
our independent registered public accounting firm must certify
the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting
annually. Identification of material weaknesses in internal
controls over financial reporting by us or our independent
registered public accounting firm could adversely affect our
competitive position in our business, especially our outsourced
payroll business, and the market price for our common stock.



Business interruptions could adversely affect our future
operating results.

Several of our major business operations are subject to
interruption by earthquake, fire, power shortages, terrorist
attacks and other hostile acts, and other events beyond our
control. The majority of our research and development
activities, our corporate headquarters, our principal
information technology systems, and other critical business
operations are located near major seismic faults. We do not
carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses.
While we maintain disaster recovery facilities for most of our
data centers that support the information systems, networks and
databases that are necessary to operate our business, we are
still in the process of establishing disaster recovery
facilities for some of our data centers. Our operating results
and financial condition could be materially adversely affected
in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or man-made
disaster.

Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This Report contains forward-looking statements. All statements
in this Report, other than statements that are purely
historical, are forward-looking statements. Words such as
“expects,” “anticipates,”
“intends,” “plans,” “believes,”

governmental competition will present a continued competitive
threat to our business; our expectation that we will further
upgrade our new information systems to improve performance and
support our future growth; our expectation that we will continue
to spend for new product development and promotion; our belief
that the investments that we hold are not other-than-temporarily
impaired; our belief that we will be able to obtain any
necessary licenses or other rights to any disputed intellectual
property rights on commercially reasonable terms; our belief
that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not
significant; our belief that our income tax valuation allowance
is sufficient; our expectation that we may use cash for future
acquisitions of technology and businesses; our belief that our
cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to
meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements
for the next 12 months; our expectations regarding research

those proceedings; the expected effects of the adoption of new
accounting standards; and our expectations regarding the future
uses of cash and retained earnings.

We caution investors that forward-looking statements are only
predictions based on our current expectations about future
events and are not guarantees of future performance. Because
these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties
that are difficult to predict, there are important factors that
could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to
differ materially from those expressed or implied by the
forward-looking statements. These factors include those
discussed in this Item 7 under the caption

“Risks
That Could Affect Future Results.”

We encourage you to
read that section carefully along with the other information
provided in this Report and in our other filings with the SEC
before deciding to invest in our stock or to maintain or change
your investment. These forward-looking statements are based on
information as of the filing date of this Report, and we
undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking
statement for any reason.



ITEM 7A

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Investment Portfolio

We do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio
of investments and funds held for payroll customers. Our
investments and funds held for payroll customers consist of
instruments that meet quality standards consistent with our
investment policy. This policy specifies that, except for direct
obligations of the United States government, securities issued
by agencies of the United States government, and money market or
cash management funds, we diversify our holdings by limiting our
investments and funds held for payroll customers with any
individual issuer.

The following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents
and investments as of July 31, 2005 by stated maturity. The
table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the
security and includes cash equivalents and investments that are
part of funds held for payroll customers on our balance sheet.
Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds.
Approximately 90% of our available-for-sale debt securities have
an interest reset date, put date or mandatory call date within
one year. As of July 31, 2005 the weighted average interest
rate earned on our money market accounts was 3.19% and the
weighted average interest rate earned on our investments was
3.05%.

Interest Rate Risk

Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of investments and funds
held for payroll customers are subject to market risk due to
changes in interest rates. Interest rate movements affect the
interest income we earn on cash equivalents, investments and
funds held for payroll customers and the value of those
investments. Should interest rates increase by 10% or about 30
basis points from the levels of July 31, 2005, the value of
our investments and funds held for payroll customers would
decline by approximately $0.8 million. Should interest
rates increase by 100 basis points from the levels of
July 31, 2005, the value of our investments and funds held
for payroll customers would decline by approximately
$2.6 million.

Impact of Foreign Currency Rate Changes

Since we translate foreign currencies (primarily Canadian
dollars and British pounds) into U.S. dollars for financial
reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can have an impact on
our financial results. The historical impact of currency
fluctuations has generally been immaterial. We believe that our
exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not
significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice
customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost
exclusively in their local currencies. Due primarily to the
effect of the weakening U.S. dollar on intercompany balances
with our Canadian subsidiary, we recorded foreign currency
exchange gains of $5.1 million in fiscal 2003 and
$2.7 million in fiscal 2004. In the third quarter of fiscal
2004, we converted a significant portion of our Canadian
intercompany balances to long-term investments in that
subsidiary, which reduced our statement of operations exposure
to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We recorded a nominal
foreign currency exchange loss in fiscal 2005. Although the
impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has
generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for
the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be
significant in the future, there can be no guarantee that the
impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the
future. As of July 31, 2005 we did not engage in foreign
currency hedging activities.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of July 31, 2005 based on the guidelines established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Based on the results of this evaluation, our
management has concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of July 31, 2005 to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. We reviewed the results of
management’s assessment with the Audit Committee of
Intuit’s Board of Directors.

Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, audited management’s assessment and
independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of July 31, 2005.
Ernst & Young has issued an attestation report
concurring with management’s assessment, which is included
in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP,

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intuit Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Intuit Inc. as of July 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
July 31, 2005. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of
Intuit’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Intuit Inc. at July 31, 2005 and
2004, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
July 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in
all material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Intuit Inc.’s internal control over
financial reporting as of July 31, 2005, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control – Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
September 21, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP,

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intuit Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that Intuit Inc. maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of July 31,
2005, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the COSO criteria). Intuit Inc.’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Intuit Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of July 31, 2005 is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion,
Intuit Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of July 31,
2005, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
2005 consolidated financial statements of Intuit Inc. and our
report dated September 21, 2005 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the financial
statements of Intuit and its wholly owned subsidiaries. We have
eliminated all significant intercompany balances and
transactions in consolidation. We have reclassified certain
other amounts previously reported in our financial statements to
conform to the current presentation. As discussed in
Note 8, we accounted for the February 2003 sale of our
Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, the December 2004 sale of our
Intuit Public Sector Solutions (IPSS) business and the May
2005 decision to sell our Intuit Information Technology
Solutions (ITS) business as discontinued operations.
Accordingly, we have reclassified our financial statements for
all periods presented to reflect Intuit KK, IPSS and ITS as
discontinued operations. Unless noted otherwise, discussions in
these notes pertain to our continuing operations.

Use of Estimates

We make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and the disclosures made in
the accompanying notes. For example, we use estimates in
determining the appropriate levels of reserves for product
returns and rebates, the collectibility of accounts receivable,
the appropriate levels of various accruals, the amount of our
worldwide tax provision and the realizability of deferred tax
assets. We also use estimates in determining the remaining
economic lives and carrying values of purchased intangible
assets (including goodwill), property and equipment and other
long-lived assets. In addition, we use assumptions when
employing the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair
value of stock options granted for pro forma disclosures. See

“Stock-Based Incentive Programs”

later in this
Note 1. Despite our intention to establish accurate
estimates and use reasonable assumptions, actual results may
differ from our estimates.

Net Revenue

We derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products,
license fees, product support, professional services, outsourced
payroll services, merchant services, transaction fees and
multiple element arrangements that may include any combination
of these items. We recognize revenue for software products and
related services in accordance with the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants’ Statement of Position
(SOP) 97-2,

“Software Revenue
Recognition,”

as modified by SOP 98-9. For other
offerings, we follow Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 104,

“Revenue
Recognition.”

We recognize revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product
or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and
collectibility is probable.

In some situations, we receive advance payments from our
customers. We also offer multiple element arrangements to our
customers. We defer revenue associated with these advance
payments and the relative fair value of undelivered elements
until we ship the products or perform the services. Deferred
revenue consisted of the following at the dates indicated:

In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standard
Board’s (FASB’s) Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 01-9,

“Accounting for Consideration Given by a
Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendor’s
Product,”

we account for cash consideration (such as
sales incentives) that we give to our



customers or resellers as a reduction of revenue rather than as
an operating expense unless we receive a benefit that we can
identify and for which we can reasonably estimate the fair value.

Product Revenue

We recognize revenue from the sale of our packaged software
products and supplies when legal title transfers, which is
generally when we ship the products or, in the case of certain
agreements, when products are delivered to retailers. We sell
some of our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Quicken products on
consignment to a limited number of retailers. We recognize
revenue for these consignment transactions only when the
end-user sale has occurred. For product revenue that is sold on
a subscription basis and includes periodic updates, we recognize
revenue ratably over the contractual time period.

We reduce product revenue from distributors and retailers for
estimated returns that are based on historical returns
experience and other factors, such as the volume and price mix
of products in the retail channel, return rates for prior
releases of the product, trends in retailer inventory and
economic trends that might impact customer demand for our
products (including the competitive environment and the timing
of new releases of our product). We also reduce product revenue
for the estimated redemption of rebates on certain current
product sales. Our estimated reserves for distributor and
retailer sales incentive rebates are based on distributors’
and retailers’ actual performance against the terms and
conditions of rebate programs, which we typically establish
annually. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based
on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate
program, actual sales during the promotion, the amount of
redemptions received and historical redemption trends by product
and by type of promotional program.

Service Revenue

We recognize revenue from outsourced payroll processing and
payroll tax filing services as the services are performed,
provided we have no other remaining obligations to these
customers. We generally require customers to remit payroll tax
funds to us in advance of the applicable payroll due date via
electronic funds transfer. We include in total net revenue the
interest earned on invested balances resulting from timing
differences between when we collect these funds from customers
and when we remit the funds to outside parties.

We offer several technical support plans and recognize support
revenue over the life of the plans. Service revenue also
includes Web services such as TurboTax for the Web and
electronic tax filing services in both our Consumer Tax and
Professional Tax segments. Service revenue for electronic
payment processing services that we provide to merchants is
recorded net of interchange fees charged by credit card
associations because we do not control these fees. Finally,
service revenue includes revenue from consulting and training
services, primarily in our Intuit-Branded Small Business
segment. We generally recognize revenue as these services are
performed, provided that we have no other remaining obligations
to these customers and that the services performed are not
essential to the functionality of delivered products and
services.

Other Revenue

Other revenue consists primarily of revenue from revenue-sharing
arrangements with third-party service providers and from online
advertising agreements. We recognize transaction fees from
revenue-sharing arrangements as end-user sales are reported to
us by these partners. We typically recognize revenue from online
advertising agreements as the lesser of when the advertisements
are displayed or pro rata based on the contractual time period
of the advertisements.

Multiple Element Arrangements

We enter into certain revenue arrangements for which we are
obligated to deliver multiple products and/or services (multiple
elements). For these arrangements, which generally include
software products, we allocate and defer revenue for the
undelivered elements based on their vendor-specific objective
evidence of fair value (VSOE). VSOE is generally the price
charged when that element is sold separately.



In situations where VSOE exists for all elements (delivered and
undelivered), we allocate the total revenue to be earned under
the arrangement among the various elements, based on their
relative fair value. For transactions where VSOE exists only for
the undelivered elements, we defer the full fair value of the
undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the
total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the
undelivered items as revenue. If VSOE does not exist for
undelivered items that are services, then we recognize the
entire arrangement fee ratably over the service period. If VSOE
does not exist for undelivered elements that are specified
products or features, we defer revenue until the earlier of the
delivery of all elements or the point at which we determine VSOE
for these undelivered elements.

We recognize revenue related to the delivered products or
services only if: (1) the above revenue recognition
criteria are met; (2) any undelivered products or services
are not essential to the functionality of the delivered products
and services; (3) payment for the delivered products or
services is not contingent upon delivery of the remaining
products or services; and (4) we have an enforceable claim
to receive the amount due in the event that we do not deliver
the undelivered products or services.

For arrangements where undelivered services are essential to the
functionality of delivered software, we recognize both the
product license revenues and service revenues under the
percentage of completion contract method in accordance with the
provisions of SOP 81-1,

“Accounting for Performance
of Construction Type and Certain Production Type
Contracts.”

To date, product license and service
revenues recognized pursuant to SOP 81-1 have not been
significant.

Shipping and Handling

We record the amounts we charge our customers for the shipping
and handling of our software products as product revenue and we
record the related costs as cost of product revenue on our
statement of operations. Product revenue from shipping and
handling is not significant.

Customer Service and Technical Support

The costs of providing customer service under paid technical
support contracts are included on the cost of service revenue
line on our statement of operations. Customer service and free
technical support costs are included on the sales and marketing
expense line on our statements of operations. Customer service
and technical support costs include costs associated with
performing order processing, answering customer inquiries by
telephone and through Web sites, e-mail and other electronic
means, and providing free technical support assistance to
customers. In connection with the sale of certain products, we
provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to
customers. We do not defer the recognition of any revenue
associated with sales of these products, since the cost of
providing this free technical support is insignificant. The
technical support is provided within one year after the
associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements
are minimal and infrequent. We accrue the estimated cost of
providing this free support upon product shipment.

Software Development Costs

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 86,

“Accounting for Costs of Computer Software to be Sold,
Leased, or otherwise Marketed,”

requires companies to
expense software development costs as they incur them until
technological feasibility has been established, at which time
those costs are capitalized until the product is available for
general release to customers. To date, our software has been
available for general release concurrent with the establishment
of technological feasibility and, accordingly, we have not
capitalized any development costs. SFAS 2,

“Accounting for Research and Development
Costs,”

establishes accounting and reporting standards
for research and development. In accordance with SFAS 2,
costs we incur to enhance our existing products or after the
general release of the service using the product are expensed in
the period they are incurred and included in research and
development costs on our statement of operations.



Internal Use Software

We capitalize costs related to computer software developed or
obtained for internal use in accordance with SOP 98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed
or Obtained for Internal Use.”

Software obtained for
internal use has generally been enterprise-level business and
finance software that we customize to meet our specific
operational needs. Costs incurred in the application development
phase are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives,
generally three to five years. We have not sold, leased or
licensed software developed for internal use to our customers
and we have no intention of doing so in the future.

Advertising

We expense advertising costs as we incur them. We recorded
advertising expense of approximately $51.8 million in
fiscal 2005, $43.2 million in fiscal 2004 and
$32.4 million in fiscal 2003.

Leases

We review all leases for capital or operating classification at
their inception under the guidance of SFAS 13,

“Accounting for Leases,”

as amended. We use our
incremental borrowing rate in the assessment of lease
classification and define the initial lease term to include the
construction build-out period but to exclude lease extension
periods. We conduct our operations primarily under operating
leases. For leases that contain rent escalations, we record the
total rent payable during the lease term, as defined above, on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease. We record the
difference between the rents paid and the straight-line rent as
a deferred rent liability in other current liabilities or
long-term obligations, as appropriate, on our balance sheets.

In accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin No. 88-1,

“Issues Relating to Accounting for Leases,”

we
record landlord allowances as deferred rent liabilities in other
current liabilities or long-term obligations, as appropriate, on
our balance sheets. We record landlord cash incentives as
operating activity on our statements of cash flows. We record
other landlord allowances as non-cash investing and financing
activities on our statements of cash flows. Also in accordance
with FTB 88-1, we classify the amortization of landlord
allowances as a reduction of occupancy expense on our statements
of operations.

Foreign Currency

The functional currency of all our foreign subsidiaries is the
local currency. Assets and liabilities of our foreign
subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate on the balance
sheet date. Revenue, costs and expenses are translated at
average rates of exchange in effect during the year. We report
translation gains and losses as a separate component of
stockholders’ equity. We include net gains and losses
resulting from foreign exchange transactions on our statement of
operations. We recorded a nominal loss from foreign exchange
transactions in fiscal 2005 and gains from foreign exchange
transactions of $2.7 million in fiscal 2004 and
$5.1 million in fiscal 2003.

Income Taxes

When we prepare our financial statements, we estimate our income
taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct
business. Significant judgment is required in determining our
worldwide income tax provision. We recognize liabilities for
anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax
jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent
to which, additional taxes will be due. We record an additional
amount in our provision for income taxes in the period in which
we determine that our recorded tax liability is less than we
expect the ultimate tax assessment to be. If in a later period
we determine that payment of this additional amount is
unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax
benefit in that later period. As a result, our ongoing
assessments of the probable outcomes of the audit issues and
related tax positions require judgment and can materially
increase or decrease our effective tax rate and materially
affect our operating results. This also requires us to estimate
our current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences
that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax
and



accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax
assets and liabilities, which we show on our balance sheet. We
must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets
will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is
not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we
establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an
accounting period, we record a corresponding tax expense on our
statement of operations.

Our net deferred tax asset at July 31, 2005 was
$173.3 million, net of the valuation allowance of
$6.0 million. We recorded the valuation allowance to
reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize
some of our deferred tax assets (consisting primarily of certain
state capital loss carryforwards) before they expire. The
valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income
for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over
which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. While we have
considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the
valuation allowance, we could be required to increase the
valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax
assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the
valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be
material, on our income tax provision and net income in the
period in which we make the increase.

Per Share Computations

We compute basic income or loss per share using the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
We compute diluted income or loss per share using the weighted
average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares
outstanding during the period. Common equivalent shares consist
of the shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options under
the treasury stock method and vested restricted stock awards.
Stock options with exercise prices greater than the average
market price for our common stock are excluded from the
calculation of diluted income or loss per share because their
effect is anti-dilutive. In loss periods, basic and diluted loss
per share are identical since the effect of common equivalent
shares is anti-dilutive and therefore excluded.

The following table presents the composition of shares used in
the computation of basic and diluted per share amounts for
fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003:

Cash Equivalents and Investments

We consider highly liquid investments with maturities of three
months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds in all
periods presented.



Investments consist of available-for-sale debt securities that
we carry at fair value. We use the specific identification
method to compute gains and losses on investments. We include
unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of tax, in
stockholders’ equity. Available-for-sale debt securities
are classified as current assets based upon our intent and
ability to use any and all of these securities as necessary to
satisfy the significant short-term liquidity requirements that
may arise from the highly seasonal and cyclical nature of our
businesses. Because of our significant business seasonality,
stock repurchase programs and acquisition opportunities, cash
flow requirements may fluctuate dramatically from quarter to
quarter and require us to use a significant amount of the
investments held as available-for-sale securities. See
Note 2.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are
not interest bearing. We maintain an allowance for doubtful
accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables.
We review our accounts receivable by aging category to identify
significant customers with known disputes or collectibility
issues. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, we provide
reserves based on the age of the receivable. In determining the
amount of the reserve, we make judgments about the
creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing
credit evaluations. We also consider our historical level of
credit losses and current economic trends that might impact the
level of future credit losses.

Funds Held for Payroll Customers and Payroll Customer
Fund Deposits

Funds held for payroll customers represent cash held on behalf
of our payroll customers that is invested in cash, cash
equivalents and investments. Payroll customer fund deposits
consist primarily of payroll taxes we owe on behalf of our
payroll customers.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which
range from three to 30 years. We amortize leasehold
improvements using the straight-line method over the lesser of
their estimated useful lives or remaining lease terms. We
include the amortization of assets that are recorded under
capital leases in depreciation expense.

Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived
Assets

We record goodwill when the purchase price of net tangible and
intangible assets we acquire exceeds their fair value. We
amortize the cost of identified intangible assets on a
straight-line basis over periods ranging from two to seven years.

We regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values
of our long-lived assets are impaired. In accordance with
SFAS 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,”

we review goodwill and other intangible assets
that have indefinite useful lives for impairment at least
annually in our fourth fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an
event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. In
accordance with SFAS 144,

“Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,”

we review
intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other
long-lived assets when an event occurs indicating the potential
for impairment. In our reviews, we look for facts or
circumstances, either internal or external, indicating that we
may not recover the carrying value of the asset. We measure
impairment losses related to long-lived assets based on the
amount by which the carrying amounts of these assets exceed
their fair values. Our measurement of fair value under
SFAS 142 is generally based on a blend of an analysis of
the present value of estimated future discounted cash flows and
a comparison of revenue and operating income multiples for
companies of similar industry and/or size. Our measurement of
fair value under SFAS 144 is generally based on the present
value of estimated future discounted cash flows. Our analysis is
based on available information and on assumptions and
projections that we consider to be reasonable and supportable.
The discounted cash flow analysis considers the likelihood of
possible outcomes and is based on our best estimate of projected
future cash flows. If necessary, we perform subsequent
calculations to



measure the amount of the impairment loss based on the excess of
the carrying value over the fair value of the impaired assets.

Stock-Based Incentive Programs

We provide equity incentives to our employees and to the members
of our Board of Directors. Through the end of fiscal 2005, we
applied the intrinsic value recognition and measurement
principles of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion
No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,”

in accounting for stock-based incentives.
Accordingly, we were not required to record compensation expense
when stock options were granted to eligible participants as long
as the exercise price was not less than the fair market value of
the stock when the option was granted. We were also not required
to record compensation expense in connection with our Employee
Stock Purchase Plan as long as the purchase price of the stock
was not less than 85% of the lower of the fair market value of
the stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end
of each purchase period.

In October 1995 the FASB issued SFAS 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,”

and
in December 2002 the FASB issued SFAS 148,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation –
Transition and Disclosure.”

Although these
pronouncements allowed us to continue to follow the APB 25
guidelines and not record compensation expense for most employee
stock-based awards, we were required to disclose our pro forma
net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if we had
adopted SFAS 123 and SFAS 148. The pro forma impact of
applying SFAS 123 and SFAS 148 in fiscal 2005, 2004 and
2003 does not necessarily represent the pro forma impact in
future years.

On December 16, 2004 the FASB issued SFAS 123 (revised
2004),

“Share-Based Payment,”

which is a
revision of SFAS 123. SFAS 123(R) requires all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans,
to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their
fair values. This standard is effective for public companies for
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We are required
to adopt this new standard in the first quarter of our fiscal
year ending July 31, 2006. See

“Recent Accounting
Pronouncements”

later in this Note 1.

To determine the pro forma impact of applying SFAS 123, we
estimated the fair value of our options using the Black-Scholes
option valuation model. This model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. This model also
requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including
the expected volatility of our common stock price. Our stock
options have characteristics significantly different from those
of traded options, and changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates.

Assumptions used for the valuation model are set forth below.
The appropriate volatility factor for stock options and for our
Employee Stock Purchase Plan is the estimated future volatility
of our stock over the expected life of the options. Prior to the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we estimated the volatility
factors for stock options and for our Employee Stock Purchase
Plan using the historical volatility of our stock over the most
recent five-year period. From the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004
through the third quarter of fiscal 2005 we estimated the
volatility factors for stock options using the historical
volatility of our stock over the most recent three-year period,
which was approximately equal to the average expected life of
our options. During that time we estimated the volatility
factors for our Employee Stock Purchase Plan using the
historical volatility of our stock over the most recent one-year
period, which was equal to the length of the offering periods
under that plan. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005
we estimated the volatility factors for stock options and for
our Employee Stock Purchase Plan using the implied volatility of
our



stock. We estimated the implied volatility of our stock using
the prices of publicly traded options, which we believe provides
a more accurate estimate of expected volatility factors over the
life of the options.

The following table illustrates the effect on our net income and
net income per share if we had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to stock-based
incentives using the Black Scholes valuation model. For purposes
of this reconciliation, we add back to previously reported net
income all stock-based incentive expense we have recorded that
relates to acquisitions. We then deduct the pro forma
stock-based incentive expense determined under the fair value
method for all awards including those that relate to
acquisitions. The pro forma stock-based incentive expense has no
impact on our cash flow. In the future, we may elect to use
different assumptions under the Black Scholes valuation model or
a different valuation model, which could result in a
significantly different impact on our pro forma net income or
loss.

The weighted average fair value of options granted during fiscal
2005 was $10.42, during fiscal 2004 was $16.68 and during fiscal
2003 was $22.20.

Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers and
Suppliers

We operate in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly
changing. Significant technological changes, shifting customer
requirements, the emergence of competitive products or services
with new capabilities and other factors could negatively impact
our operating results.

We are also subject to risks related to changes in the values of
our significant balance of investments and funds held for
payroll customers. Our portfolio of investments consists of
investment-grade securities and our funds held for payroll
customers consist of cash, cash equivalents and investment-grade
securities.



Except for direct obligations of the United States government,
securities issued by agencies of the United States government,
and money market or cash management funds, we diversify our
investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer.

We sell a significant portion of our products through
third-party retailers and distributors. As a result, we face
risks related to the collectibility of our accounts receivable.
At July 31, 2005 amounts due from our eight largest
retailers and distributors represented approximately 17% of
total accounts receivable. At January 31, 2005, the height
of the 2004 consumer tax season, amounts due from those eight
retailers and distributors represented approximately 45% of
total accounts receivable. To appropriately manage this risk, we
perform ongoing evaluations of customer credit and limit the
amount of credit extended as we deem appropriate but generally
do not require collateral. We maintain reserves for estimated
credit losses and these losses have historically been within our
expectations. However, since we cannot necessarily predict
future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we
cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate.
No distributor or individual retailer accounted for 10% or more
of total net revenue in fiscal 2005, 2004 or 2003, nor did any
customer account for 10% or more of accounts receivable at
July 31, 2005 or July 31, 2004. Amounts due from Rock
Acquisition Corporation, the purchaser of our Quicken Loans
mortgage business, under certain licensing and distribution
agreements comprised 11.0% of accounts receivable at
July 31, 2005 and 11.6% of accounts receivable at
July 31, 2004. See Note 8.

We rely on three third-party vendors to perform the
manufacturing and distribution functions for our primary desktop
software products. We also have a key single-source vendor that
prints and fulfills orders for all of our checks and most other
products for our financial supplies business. While we believe
that relying heavily on key vendors improves the efficiency and
reliability of our business operations, relying on any one
vendor for a significant aspect of our business can have a
significant negative impact on our revenue and profitability if
that vendor fails to perform at acceptable service levels for
any reason, including financial difficulties of the vendor.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

SFAS 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment”

On December 16, 2004 the FASB issued SFAS 123 (revised
2004),

“Share-Based Payment,”

which is a
revision of SFAS 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.”

Statement 123(R) supercedes APB 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,”

and
amends SFAS 95,

“Statement of Cash Flows.”

Generally, the approach in SFAS 123(R) is similar to
the approach described in SFAS 123. However,
SFAS 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee stock options and purchases under
employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized in the statement
of operations based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure
of fair value recognition will no longer be an alternative.

SFAS 123(R) is effective for public companies for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2005, with earlier adoption
permitted. We are required to adopt this new standard in the
first quarter of our fiscal year ending July 31, 2006.
SFAS 123(R) permits public companies to adopt its
requirements using one of two methods:

1.

A “modified prospective” method in which compensation
    cost is recognized beginning with the effective date
    (a) based on the requirements of SFAS 123(R) for all
    share-based payments granted after the effective date and
    (b) based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all
    awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that
    remain unvested on the effective date.

2.

A “modified retrospective” method which includes the
    requirements of the modified prospective method described above
    but also permits restatement using amounts previously disclosed
    under the pro forma provisions of SFAS 123 either for
    (a) all prior periods presented or (b) prior interim
    periods of the year of adoption.

We have not yet chosen a method of adoption for SFAS 123(R).

As permitted by SFAS 123, through the end of fiscal 2005 we
accounted for share-based payments to employees using APB
25’s intrinsic value method. As a consequence, we generally
recognized no



compensation cost for employee stock options and purchases under
our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Although the adoption of
SFAS 123(R)’s fair value method will have no adverse
impact on our balance sheet or net cash flows, it will have a
significant adverse impact on our net income and net income per
share. The pro forma effects on net income and earnings per
share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS 123 to share-based payments to employees in prior
periods are disclosed in this Note 1 under

“Stock-Based Incentive Programs.”

Although the
pro forma effects of applying SFAS 123 may be indicative of
the effects of applying SFAS 123(R), the provisions of
these two statements differ in some important respects. The
actual effects of adopting SFAS 123(R) will depend on
numerous factors including the valuation model we use to value
future share-based payments to employees, estimated forfeiture
rates and the accounting policies we adopt concerning the method
of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite
service period.

SFAS 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax deductions in
excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a
financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as
prescribed under current accounting rules. This requirement will
reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash
flows in periods after adoption. Total cash flow will remain
unchanged compared with cash flow as it would have been reported
under prior accounting rules.

SFAS 154,

“Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections”

On June 1, 2005 the FASB issued SFAS 154,

“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,”

which replaces APB 20,

“Accounting Changes,”

and SFAS 3,

“Reporting Accounting Changes in
Interim Financial Statements.”

SFAS 154 applies to
all voluntary changes in accounting principle, and changes the
requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in
accounting principle. SFAS 154 requires retrospective
application to prior periods’ financial statements of a
voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is
impracticable. APB 20 previously required that most voluntary
changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in
net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of
changing to the new accounting principle. SFAS 154 carries
forward many other provisions of APB 20 without change,
including the provisions related to the reporting of a change in
accounting estimate, a change in the reporting entity and the
correction of an error. SFAS 154 is effective for
accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2005. Earlier
application is permitted for accounting changes and corrections
of errors made in fiscal years beginning after June 1,
2005. We do not expect our adoption of this new standard to have
a material impact on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

2.     Investments and Funds Held
for Payroll Customers

As discussed in Note 1,

“Concentration of Credit
Risk and Significant Customers and Suppliers,”

our
portfolio of investments consists of investment-grade securities
and our funds held for payroll customers consist of cash, cash
equivalents and investment-grade securities. Except for direct
obligations of the United States government, securities issued
by agencies of the United States government, and money market or
cash management funds, we diversify our investments by limiting
our holdings with any individual issuer.



The following schedule summarizes our investments and funds held
for payroll customers at the dates indicated:

Unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt
securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) on our balance sheet. Gross unrealized gains
and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities were as
follows at the dates indicated:

The following table summarizes the fair value and gross
unrealized losses related to 115 available-for-sale debt
securities, aggregated by type of investment and length of time
that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized
loss position, at July 31, 2005:

We periodically review our investment portfolios to determine if
any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes
in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns. At
July 31, 2005 we believe that the investments that we hold
are not other-than-temporarily impaired. While certain
available-for-sale debt securities have fair values that are
below cost, we believe that it is probable that principal and
interest



will be collected in accordance with contractual terms, and that
the decline in market value is due to changes in interest rates
and not due to increased credit risk.

Realized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt
securities are included in interest and other income on our
statement of operations. Gross realized gains and losses on our
available-for-sale debt securities were as follows for the
periods indicated:

The following table summarizes our available-for-sale debt
securities held in investments and funds held for payroll
customers, classified by the stated maturity date of the
security:

Approximately 90% of our available-for-sale debt securities have
an interest reset date, put date or mandatory call date within
one year.

3.     Property and Equipment

Property and equipment consisted of the following at the dates
indicated:

Capital in progress consists primarily of costs related to
internal use software projects. As discussed in Note 1,

“Software Development Costs,”

we capitalize
costs related to the development of computer software for
internal use in accordance with SOP 98-1. We capitalized
internal use software costs totaling $31.4 million in
fiscal 2005, $65.8 million in fiscal 2004 and
$42.9 million in fiscal 2003. These amounts included
capitalized labor costs of $17.9 million in fiscal 2005,
$21.7 million in fiscal 2004 and $23.0 million in
fiscal 2003. Costs related to internal use software projects are
included in the capital in progress category of property and
equipment until project completion, at which time they are
transferred to



the computer software category and amortized on a straight-line
basis over their useful lives, generally three to five years.

4.     Goodwill and Purchased
Intangible Assets

As discussed in Note 1,

“Goodwill, Purchased
Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets,”

under
current accounting rules goodwill is not amortized but is
subject to annual impairment tests. Changes in the carrying
value of goodwill by reportable segment during fiscal 2005 were
as presented in the following table. Our reportable segments are
described in Note 9. Goodwill for our Intuit Information
Technology Solutions (ITS) business has been reclassified
to long-term assets of discontinued operations on our balance
sheet at July 31, 2005 and 2004. See Note 8.

Purchased intangible assets consisted of the following at the
dates indicated. The fiscal 2005 increase in customer lists was
primarily due to the addition of customer lists for our
Intuit-Branded Small Business and Other Business segments.
Purchased intangible assets for our ITS business have been
reclassified to long-term assets of discontinued operations at
July 31, 2005 and 2004. See Note 8.



We summarize the following expenses on the acquisition-related
charges line of our statement of operations:

At July 31, 2005 we expected future amortization of our
purchased intangible assets by fiscal year to be as shown in the
following table. Amortization of purchased intangible assets is
charged primarily to amortization of purchased intangible assets
in cost of revenue and to acquisition-related charges in
operating expenses on our statement of operations. Future
acquisitions could cause these amounts to increase. In addition,
if impairment events occur they could accelerate the timing of
purchased intangible asset charges.

As discussed in Note 1, we regularly perform reviews to
determine if the carrying values of our goodwill and purchased
intangible assets may be impaired. We look for the existence of
facts and circumstances, either internal or external, that
indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be
recovered.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, events and
circumstances indicated impairment of goodwill that we recorded
in connection with our acquisition of Intuit Public Sector
Solutions (IPSS) in May 2002. IPSS was part of our
Intuit-Branded Small Business segment. The primary indicator of
impairment was the fact that actual sales levels did not meet
initial projections.

We measured the impairment loss based on the amount by which the
carrying amount of goodwill exceeded the fair value based on
lower projected profits and decreases in cash flow. Our
measurement of fair value was based on a blend of an analysis of
the future discounted cash flows and a comparison of revenue and
operating income multiples for companies of similar industry
and/or size as discussed in Note 1. Based on our analysis,
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we recorded a charge of
$18.7 million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill
to $10.9 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2005 our
Board of Directors formally approved a plan to sell IPSS and it
became a long-lived asset held for sale and a discontinued
operation in that quarter. The impairment charge is therefore
included in the fiscal 2004 net loss from IPSS discontinued
operations. We sold IPSS for approximately $11.0 million in
December 2004. See Note 8.

5.     Comprehensive Net Income
(Loss)

SFAS 130,

“Reporting Comprehensive
Income,”

establishes standards for reporting and
displaying comprehensive net income (loss) and its
components in stockholders’ equity. SFAS 130 requires
the components of other comprehensive income (loss), such as
changes in the fair value of available-for-sale



securities and foreign currency translation adjustments, to be
added to our net income (loss) to arrive at comprehensive
income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) items have
no impact on our net income (loss) as presented on our
statement of operations.

The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),
net of income taxes, were as follows for the periods indicated:

6.  Deferred Compensation

When we assume unvested stock options in connection with
acquisitions, we record deferred stock-based compensation as a
reduction of stockholders’ equity. The amount recorded is
equal to the difference between the exercise price of the
unvested options and the fair market value of Intuit stock on
the closing date of the acquisition. Deferred stock-based
compensation for unvested stock options that we have assumed is
amortized ratably over the vesting term of these options to
acquisition-related charges on our statement of operations.

When we grant restricted stock to employees that is subject to
vesting, we record deferred stock-based compensation equal to
the difference between the purchase price and the fair market
value of the stock on the date of grant. Deferred stock-based
compensation for restricted stock is amortized ratably over the
vesting term of the awards to general and administrative expense
on our statement of operations. See



Note 13 for a description of restricted stock granted to
our chief executive officer in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003.

The following table summarizes the activity in deferred
stock-based compensation for the periods indicated:

7.  Acquisitions

The acquisitions described below have been accounted for as
purchase transactions and, accordingly, the results of
operations and financial position of the acquired businesses are
included in Intuit’s financial statements from the date of
acquisition. We allocate the difference between the purchase
price and the net book value of acquired tangible assets between
identified intangible assets and goodwill. Identified intangible
assets consist of customer lists, purchased technology, trade
names and logos, and covenants not to compete.

Fiscal 2004

In October 2003 we acquired all of the membership interests of
Innovative Merchant Solutions LLC and a related entity doing
business as Innovative Gateway Solutions (together, IMS) for an
aggregate purchase price of approximately $116.7 million in
cash. Of the total purchase price, $86.3 million was paid
to the members of IMS and $30.4 million was deposited into
a third-party escrow account at closing. Of the cash deposited
into escrow, $22.2 million has been paid to former IMS
members in accordance with the terms of the acquisition
agreement, $0.2 million was paid to settle a third-party
claim and the remaining $8.0 million will be paid to former
IMS members in October 2005 upon the satisfaction of certain
operating contingencies.

IMS offers a full range of merchant services to small businesses
nationwide, including credit and debit card processing services.
We acquired IMS as part of our Right for Me philosophy to offer
a wider range of business solutions for small businesses. IMS
became part of our QuickBooks-Related segment. We allocated
approximately $17.3 million of the IMS purchase price to
identified intangible assets and recorded the excess purchase
price of $98.4 million as goodwill. The identified
intangible assets are being amortized over terms ranging from
two to four years. IMS’s results of operations for periods
prior to the date of acquisition were not material when compared
with our consolidated results.



Fiscal 2003

In September 2002 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of
Blue Ocean Software, Inc. for approximately $177.3 million
in cash. We paid $16.5 million of the purchase price into a
third-party escrow account. This amount was paid in fiscal 2004
in accordance with the terms of the escrow agreement. Blue Ocean
offers software solutions that help businesses manage their
information technology resources and assets. We acquired this
company as part of our Right for Me philosophy to offer a wider
range of business solutions for small businesses. Blue Ocean was
branded as Intuit Information Technology Solutions
(ITS) and became part of our Intuit-Branded Small Business
segment.

We allocated approximately $13.2 million of the purchase
price to purchased technology and $7.8 million to
in-process research and development, which was charged to
expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. We recorded the
excess purchase price of $150.3 million (as adjusted) as
goodwill. The purchased technology was being amortized over six
years. In May 2005 our Board of Directors formally approved a
plan to sell ITS. In accordance with the provisions of
SFAS 144, we determined that ITS became a long-lived asset
held for sale and a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2005 and we therefore discontinued the amortization of
ITS intangible assets in that quarter. Since the carrying value
of ITS at July 31, 2005 was less than the estimated fair
value less cost to sell, no adjustment to the carrying value of
this long-lived asset was necessary during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005. See Note 8. Blue Ocean’s results of
operations for periods prior to the date of acquisition were not
material when compared with our consolidated results.

In the past, we marketed and sold our Premier Payroll Service
jointly with Wells Fargo Bank. In February 2003 we acquired for
$29.2 million in cash the rights to brand and market the
offering directly to Premier Payroll Service customers who
currently use Intuit’s service. As a result of this
agreement, we no longer pay royalties to Wells Fargo on Premier
Payroll Service revenue. We recorded the purchase price as a
purchased intangible asset and are amortizing it on a
straight-line basis to cost of service revenue over five years,
the estimated useful life of the customer base. Total
accumulated amortization for this asset was $14.4 million
at July 31, 2005 and $8.5 million at July 31,
2004.

In July 2003 we acquired all the outstanding stock of Income
Dynamics, Inc. for approximately $10.0 million or 224,589
shares of Intuit common stock and $0.3 million in cash.
Income Dynamics offers software that provides tools for
taxpayers to determine the fair market value of items donated to
charities. Income Dynamics became part of our Consumer Tax
segment. We allocated approximately $3.2 million of the
purchase price to identified intangible assets and recorded the
excess purchase price of $7.9 million as goodwill. The
identified intangible assets are being amortized over terms
ranging from two to five years. Income Dynamics’ results of
operations for periods prior to the date of acquisition were not
material when compared with our consolidated results.



Purchase Price Allocation and Acquired Goodwill by Reportable
Segment

Purchase prices for the acquisitions described above have been
allocated on the basis of their fair values on the acquisition
dates as follows:

Deferred stock compensation is recorded in stockholders’
equity and is being amortized over the vesting period of the
applicable options using the straight-line method. We amortize
most other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives,
which range from two to seven years. See Note 1,

“Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other
Long-lived Assets,”

and Note 4.

The following table presents the changes in goodwill by
reportable business segments for the periods indicated. The
table includes purchase price adjustments that lowered recorded
goodwill for certain acquisitions.

Of the total goodwill acquired, amounts deductible for income
tax purposes totaled $78.4 million in fiscal 2004 and
$0.8 million in fiscal 2003.



8.  Discontinued Operations

Intuit Information Technology Solutions

In May 2005 our Board of Directors formally approved a plan to
sell our Intuit Information Technology Solutions
(ITS) business, which was part of our Intuit-Branded Small
Business segment. The decision was a result of management’s
desire to focus resources on Intuit’s core products and
services. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144,

“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived
Assets,”

we determined that ITS became a long-lived
asset held for sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.
SFAS 144 provides that a long-lived asset classified as
held for sale should be measured at the lower of its carrying
amount or fair value less cost to sell. Since the carrying value
of ITS at July 31, 2005 was less than the estimated fair
value less cost to sell, no adjustment to the carrying value of
this long-lived asset was necessary during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005. In accordance with SFAS 144, we discontinued
the amortization of ITS intangible assets in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2005.

Also in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, we
determined that ITS became a discontinued operation in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Consequently, we have segregated
the net assets, operating results and cash flows of ITS from
continuing operations on our balance sheets, statements of
operations and statements of cash flows for all periods
presented. ITS generated cash flows from its business operations
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. We expect ITS to
continue to generate cash flows from its business operations
until it is sold.

The carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and
liabilities of ITS at July 31, 2005 were as shown in the
following table. Carrying amounts approximated fair values.

Intuit Public Sector Solutions

In December 2004 we sold our Intuit Public Sector Solutions
(IPSS) business for approximately $11 million. IPSS
was part of our Intuit-Branded Small Business segment. In
accordance with SFAS 144, we accounted for the sale as
discontinued operations. We have therefore segregated the net
assets, operating results and cash flows of IPSS from continuing
operations on our balance sheets, statements of operations and
statements of cash flows for all periods prior to the sale. The
$4.8 million loss on disposal of IPSS that we recorded in
fiscal 2005 included $4.3 million for the estimated tax
payable in connection with the tax gain on the sale of IPSS.



Intuit KK

In February 2003 we sold all of the outstanding stock of our
wholly owned Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, to a private equity
investment firm located in Japan for approximately
$79 million. Intuit KK was part of our Other Businesses
segment. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, we
accounted for the sale as discontinued operations. We have
therefore segregated the net assets, operating results and cash
flows of Intuit KK from continuing operations on our balance
sheets, statements of operations and statements of cash flows
for all periods prior to the sale.

Quicken Loans

In July 2002 we sold 87.5% of our Quicken Loans mortgage
business to Rock Acquisition Corporation and accounted for the
sale as discontinued operations. In October 2002 we sold our
12.5% minority interest in Rock to Rock’s majority
shareholders and recorded a $5.6 million gain on the
transaction.

Concurrent with the sale, Rock licensed the right to use our
Quicken Loans trademark for its residential home loan and home
equity loan products for five years. We also entered into a
five-year distribution agreement with Rock through which it will
provide mortgage services on Quicken.com. We recorded royalties
under the trademark licensing agreement of $9.3 million in
each of fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003. We recorded fees under the
distribution agreement of $0.6 million in fiscal 2005,
$0.9 million in fiscal 2004 and $0.8 million in fiscal
2003. The royalties from the licensing agreement and the fees
from the distribution agreement are recorded as earned and
included in interest and other income on our statements of
operations. Royalties and fees due from Rock under these
agreements totaled $9.5 million at July 31, 2005 and
July 31, 2004 and were included in accounts receivable on
our balance sheets.



The components of net income (loss) from discontinued
operations on our statements of operations as well as net
revenue from discontinued operations and income or loss from
discontinued operations before income taxes are as follows for
the periods indicated:

The $4.8 million loss on disposal of IPSS that we recorded
in fiscal 2005 included $4.3 million for the estimated tax
payable in connection with the tax gain on the sale of IPSS. The
fiscal 2004 net loss from Intuit Public Sector Solutions
discontinued operations included a goodwill impairment charge of
$18.7 million.

9.  Industry Segment and Geographic Information

SFAS 131,

“Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information,”

establishes
standards for the way in which public companies disclose certain
information about operating segments in their financial reports.
Consistent with SFAS 131, we have defined five reportable
segments, described below, based on factors such as how we
manage our operations and how our chief operating decision maker
views results. We define the chief operating decision maker as
our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer.

QuickBooks-Related product revenue is derived primarily from
QuickBooks desktop software products; QuickBooks Payroll, a
family of products sold on a subscription basis offering payroll
tax tables, forms and electronic tax payment and filing, and in
some cases QuickBooks software upgrades, to small businesses
that prepare their own payrolls; and financial supplies such as
paper checks, envelopes and invoices. QuickBooks-Related service
revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks Online Edition,
QuickBooks support plans and merchant services provided by our
Innovative Merchant Solutions business. Other revenue for this
segment consists primarily of royalties from small business
online services.



Intuit-Branded Small Business product revenue is derived
primarily from business management software for three selected
industries: residential, commercial and corporate property
management; wholesale durable goods distribution; and
construction. Intuit-Branded Small Business service revenue is
derived from technical support, consulting and training services
for those software products and from outsourced payroll
services. Service revenue for this segment also includes
interest earned on funds held for payroll customers.

Consumer Tax product revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax
federal and state consumer desktop tax return preparation
software. Consumer Tax service revenue is derived primarily from
TurboTax for the Web online tax return preparation, consumer
electronic filing and refund transfer services.

Professional Tax product revenue is derived primarily from
Lacerte and ProSeries professional tax preparation software
products. Professional Tax service revenue is derived primarily
from electronic filing, bank product transmission and training
services.

Other Businesses consist primarily of Quicken and Canada.
Quicken product revenue is derived primarily from Quicken
desktop software products. Quicken other revenue consists
primarily of fees from consumer online transactions and from
Quicken-branded credit card and bill payment offerings that we
provide through our partners. We exited the online advertising
business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. In Canada,
product revenue is derived primarily from localized versions of
QuickBooks and Quicken as well as QuickTax and TaxWiz consumer
desktop tax return preparation software and ProFile professional
tax preparation products. Service revenue in Canada consists
primarily of revenue from payroll services and software
maintenance contracts sold with QuickBooks.

Our QuickBooks-Related, Consumer Tax and Professional Tax
segments operate solely in the United States. All of our
segments sell primarily to customers located in the United
States. International total net revenue was less than 5% of
consolidated total net revenue for all periods presented.

Corporate includes costs such as corporate general and
administrative expenses that are not allocated to specific
segments. In addition, corporate includes reconciling items such
as amortization of purchased intangible assets,
acquisition-related charges, and impairment of goodwill and
purchased intangible assets. Corporate also includes interest
and other income and realized net gains or losses on marketable
equity securities and other investments.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same
as those described in the summary of significant accounting
policies in Note 1. Except for goodwill and purchased
intangible assets, we do not generally track assets by
reportable segment and, consequently, we do not disclose total
assets by reportable segment. See Note 4 for goodwill by
reportable segment.



The following tables show our financial results by reportable
segment for the twelve months ended July 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003.



10.     Other Current Liabilities

Other current liabilities were as follows at the dates indicated:



11.     Long-Term Obligations and
Commitments

Long-Term Obligations

Long-term obligations were as follows at the dates indicated:

Reserve for Vacant Facilities

During fiscal 2002 we concluded that we would not occupy two
vacant leased buildings in Mountain View, California and that we
would be unable to recover a substantial portion of our lease
obligations by subleasing the vacant space. In that period, we
recorded a $13.2 million reserve that was equal to the
remaining future lease commitments for these facilities, net of
estimated future sublease income. During fiscal 2003 we decided
to reoccupy one of the two vacant buildings and primarily as a
result of this decision we recorded a net credit for vacant
facilities of $1.1 million in that fiscal year. During
fiscal 2004 we increased the reserve for the remaining Mountain
View building by $0.7 million to reflect our revised
estimate of future sublease income for that facility. Conditions
in the San Francisco Bay Area corporate real estate market did
not improve significantly during the period following the
establishment of this additional reserve and we had no plans to
occupy the vacant building. In order to resolve all of our
obligations under this lease commitment, in March 2005 we
purchased the vacant building from the lessor for approximately
$10.8 million, terminated the lease agreement and sold the
building to a third party for approximately $3.3 million.
In connection with these transactions, we charged the vacancy
reserve for the difference between our purchase price for the
building and our selling price for the building. The remaining
vacancy reserve of $0.6 million was reversed and recorded
as a reduction of general and administrative expense on our
statement of operations for fiscal 2005.

Activity in this reserve for vacant facilities was as follows
for the periods indicated:

$1.4 million of the total Mountain View vacancy reserve was
in other current liabilities and $7.5 million was in
long-term obligations on our balance sheet at July 31, 2004.



Capital Lease Obligations

Future minimum lease payments under capital lease obligations at
July 31, 2005 were as follows:

Operating Leases

We lease office facilities and equipment under various operating
lease agreements. Our facilities leases generally provide for
periodic rent increases and many contain escalation clauses and
renewal options. Certain leases require us to pay property
taxes, insurance and routine maintenance. Annual minimum
commitments under these leases, including those for our Intuit
Information Technology Solutions discontinued operation, are
shown in the table below.

Rent expense totaled $21.5 million in fiscal 2005,
$25.6 million in fiscal 2004 and $26.2 million in
fiscal 2003.



12.     Income Taxes

The provision (benefit) for income taxes from continuing
operations consisted of the following for the periods indicated:

Neither income from continuing operations before income taxes
from foreign operations nor the associated tax provision were
significant in fiscal 2005, 2004 or 2003. Differences between
income taxes calculated using the federal statutory income tax
rate of 35% and the provision for income taxes from continuing
operations were as follows for the periods indicated:

Tax savings from deductions associated with our various stock
option plans are not reflected in the current federal and state
tax provisions. Savings were approximately $26.4 million in
fiscal 2005, $27.1 million in fiscal 2004 and
$47.8 million in fiscal 2003. These amounts were credited
to stockholders’ equity and reduced income taxes payable.

We will qualify for the annual deduction under the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) beginning in our fiscal year
ending July 31, 2006. SFAS 109 provides that this
deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction and not
as a tax rate reduction. The Act also provided for a special
one-time tax deduction for foreign earnings that are
repatriated. We will not receive any benefit from this portion
of the Act.



Significant deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows
at the dates indicated.

We have provided a valuation allowance related to the benefits
of certain state capital loss carryforwards and state net
operating losses that we believe are unlikely to be realized.
The valuation allowance decreased by $1.5 million in fiscal
2005 and did not change in fiscal 2004.

The components of total net deferred tax assets, net of
valuation allowance, as shown on our balance sheet were as
follows at the dates indicated:

At July 31, 2005 we had various state credit carryforwards
totaling approximately $11.0 million. The state credit
carryforwards have no expiration date. At July 31, 2005 we
also had various state net operating loss carryforwards totaling
approximately $55.4 million for which we have recorded a
gross deferred tax asset of $4.0 million and a valuation
allowance of $1.9 million. These net operating losses will
expire at various dates beginning in fiscal 2006 if not
utilized. At July 31, 2005 we had foreign tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $1.3 million. The foreign
tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2006 if
not utilized. At July 31, 2005 we had state capital loss
carryovers of $41.9 million for which we have recorded a
gross deferred tax asset of $4.1 million and a valuation
allowance of $4.1 million. Utilization of the credit
carryforwards, net operating losses and state capital losses may
be subject to substantial annual limitation. The annual
limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses
and capital losses before utilization.



13.     Stockholders’ Equity

Stock Option Plans

Our stockholders approved our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan at our
annual meeting on December 9, 2004. The 2005 Plan replaces
our 2002 Equity Incentive Plan, 1996 Directors Stock Option Plan
and 1998 Option Plan for Mergers and Acquisitions. Beginning
December 9, 2004 no further awards may be granted under the
2002 Plan, Directors Plan or 1998 Plan. However, all outstanding
equity awards under these plans remain in effect in accordance
with their terms. There were 1,930,910 shares available for
grant under the 2002 Plan, 6,875 shares available for grant
under the Directors Plan and 2,285,294 shares available for
grant under the 1998 Plan on the date of their termination for a
total of 4,223,079 shares. These shares ceased to be
available for grant under any of our equity compensation plans.

Under the 2005 Plan, we are permitted to grant incentive and
non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted
stock units, stock appreciation rights and stock bonus awards to
our and our subsidiaries’ employees, non-employee directors
and consultants. The 2005 Plan provides for the automatic grant
of stock options to non-employee directors according to a
formula in the plan document. For other awards, the Compensation
and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of
Directors or its delegees determines who will receive grants,
when those grants will be exercisable, their exercise price and
other terms. The 2005 Plan limits to a maximum of 2,000,000
shares awards having a price less than the full fair market
value of Intuit’s common stock on the date of grant. Our
option grants typically have a seven year term and vest over
three years based on continued service. All options granted
under the 2005 Plan through July 31, 2005 have been granted
at the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant.

During fiscal 2003 we introduced a mandatory share ownership
program. Under this program all senior vice presidents and Board
members, other than our chief executive officer, are required to
hold a minimum of 3,000 shares by the later of May 2006 or three
years from the date the individual becomes subject to the share
ownership program. Our chief executive officer is required to
hold 100,000 shares. To provide an incentive to the senior vice
presidents and an executive vice president, we implemented a
matching unit award component to the share ownership program.
Under this matching unit program, for each two shares one of
these officers purchases during his or her three-year compliance
period, we grant a matching unit award for one share, up to a
maximum of 1,500 matching unit awards. Beginning
December 9, 2004 these matching unit awards are granted as
restricted stock unit awards under the 2005 Plan. They were
granted as stock bonus awards under the 2002 Plan prior to that
date. These matching units vest as to 100 percent of the
shares subject to the award four years after grant, or earlier
on the officer’s retirement, death or disability. We record
deferred compensation expense for these matching units based on
the fair value of the award at the date of grant and recognize
compensation expense ratably over the vesting period. We awarded
a total of 2,355 matching units in fiscal 2005, 3,424 matching
units in fiscal 2004 and 2,849 matching units in fiscal 2003.

On July 27, 2005 we granted 50,000 performance-based
restricted stock units to our chief executive officer under the
2005 Plan. Provided the fiscal 2006 performance goals
established by the Compensation Committee are achieved, the
restricted stock units will vest on July 28, 2008. If the
performance goals are not achieved, the restricted stock units
will terminate without vesting. On two occasions we granted
restricted stock units to our chief executive officer as stock
bonus awards under the 2002 Plan. On July 30, 2003 we
granted an award for 425,000 shares and on July 31, 2004 we
granted an award for 25,000 shares. The 2003 award vests as to
255,000 shares on July 31, 2006 and as to an additional
85,000 shares on each of July 31, 2007 and July 31,
2008. The 2004 award vests as to 25,000 shares on July 31,
2007. We record deferred compensation expense for these awards
based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant and
recognize compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.
See Note 6.

Outstanding awards that were originally granted under the 2002,
Directors, 1998 and 1993 Plans remain in effect in accordance
with their terms. The following paragraphs describe the general
terms of the 2002, Directors and 1998 Plans, all of which
terminated upon adoption of the 2005 Plan, as well as the 1993
Equity Incentive Plan, which terminated upon adoption of the
2002 Plan.



Under the 2002 Plan, we were permitted to grant stock options,
restricted stock and stock bonus awards to our and our
subsidiaries’ employees, directors, consultants and
independent contractors. The Compensation Committee determined
who received grants, when the grants became exercisable, the
exercise price and other terms of the awards. The option
exercise price was generally the fair market value on the date
of grant. During fiscal 2002, we changed our standard option
vesting schedule so that future options granted under the 2002
Plan generally became exercisable over a three-year period based
on continued service and expire no later than seven years from
the date of grant. Prior to that change, our standard option
vesting schedule provided that options generally became
exercisable over a four-year period based on continued service
and expired no later than ten years from the date of grant.

Our Directors Plan provided for the grant of non-qualified stock
options for a specified number of shares to be granted to each
non-employee director of Intuit. As of December 2002, Board
members who served on the Audit Committee, Compensation
Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee received
additional annual grants. The option exercise price was the fair
market value on the date of grant. Most options are subject to
vesting over time based on continued service, with vesting
periods ranging from one to four years. All options expire after
ten years.

Our 1998 Plan provided for the grant of non-qualified stock
options to individuals whom we hired as a result of our
acquisitions of or mergers with other companies for a period of
18 months following the completion of the acquisitions or
mergers. The 1998 Plan was designed to meet the “broadly
based plans” exemption from the stockholder approval
requirement for stock option plans under the Nasdaq Stock Market
listing requirements at the time the plan was adopted and,
accordingly, was not submitted to Intuit stockholders for
approval. Options could not be granted under the 1998 Plan with
an exercise price that was less than the fair market value of
Intuit’s common stock on the date of grant.

Our 1993 Plan terminated on January 18, 2002 when our
stockholders approved our 2002 Plan to replace the 1993 Plan.
When the 1993 Plan terminated, all outstanding options under the
1993 Plan remained in effect in accordance with their terms.
There were 3,809,906 shares available for grant under the 1993
Plan at its termination. We transferred 1,900,000 of these
shares to our new 2002 Plan to be available for grant under that
plan. The remaining 1,909,906 shares ceased to be available
for grant under any of our equity compensation plans. Under the
1993 Plan, we were permitted to grant incentive and
non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, stock
bonuses and performance awards to employees, directors,
consultants, and independent contractors of and advisors to
Intuit and our subsidiaries. The Compensation Committee or its
delegees determined who would receive grants, when those grants
would be exercisable, their exercise price and other terms. The
option exercise price was generally the fair market value at the
date of grant. The outstanding options generally vest over four
years based on continued service and expire after ten years.



A summary of activity under all equity incentive plans is as
follows:

(1)

Includes 1,896,027 shares reflecting options that were canceled
    and not returned to any option pool because they were granted
    under expired plans, and 4,223,079 shares that were eliminated
    from shares available for grant in connection with the
    termination of the 2002 Plan, Directors Plan and the 1998 Plan.



We define net option grants as options granted less options
canceled or expired and returned to the pool of options
available for grant. We also monitor net option grants by
subtracting from options granted both canceled or expired
options that were returned to the pool of options available for
grant and options canceled from expired plans. Net option grants
under these two methods in shares and as a percentage of shares
outstanding were as shown in the following table for the periods
indicated:

There were 22,324,428 options exercisable under our stock option
plans at July 31, 2005; 22,310,306 options exercisable
at July 31, 2004; and 19,789,835 options exercisable at
July 31, 2003. At July 31, 2005 there were 1,313,190
shares available for grant under the 2005 Plan.

The following table summarizes information about stock options
outstanding at July 31, 2005:

Stock Repurchase Programs

Intuit’s Board of Directors has authorized a series of
common stock repurchase programs. Shares of common stock
repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. Under
these programs, we repurchased 16.2 million shares of our
common stock for $709.2 million in fiscal 2005,
13.5 million shares for $609.4 million in fiscal 2004
and 17.9 million shares for $813.6 million in fiscal
2003. No authorized funds remained under any of our first four
repurchase plans at July 31, 2005. In May 2005 our Board of
Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $500.0 million
of our common stock from time to time over a three-year period
under a fifth repurchase plan that expires on May 15, 2008.
Authorized funds of $290.8 million remained under that plan
at July 31, 2005.

Repurchased shares of our common stock are held as treasury
shares until they are reissued or retired. When we reissue
treasury stock, if the proceeds from the sale are more than the
average price we paid to acquire the shares we record an
increase in additional paid-in capital. Conversely, if the
proceeds from the sale are less than the average price we paid
to acquire the shares, we record a decrease in additional
paid-in capital to the extent of increases previously recorded
for similar transactions and a decrease in retained earnings for
any remaining amount.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

On November 26, 1996 our stockholders adopted our Employee
Stock Purchase Plan under Section 423 of the Internal
Revenue Code. The ESPP permits our eligible employees to make
payroll deductions to purchase our stock on regularly scheduled
purchase dates at a discount. The ESPP has been amended several
times since its adoption. We amended it most recently on
July 27, 2005 to extend its term to July 27, 2015. On
January 25, 2005 we amended the ESPP so that effective with
the June 2005 offering period, offering periods under the ESPP
are for three, instead of twelve, months. The last twelve-month
offering period comprised of four three-month accrual periods
began in March 2005 and will continue until it ends in
accordance with its original terms under the ESPP. The purchase
price for shares purchased under the ESPP is 85% of the lower of
the closing price for Intuit common stock on the first day of
the offering period in which the employee is participating or
the last day of the accrual period of that offering period.

Employees purchased 607,961 shares of Intuit common stock in
fiscal 2005, 564,918 shares in fiscal 2004 and 476,454 shares in
fiscal 2003 under the ESPP. At July 31, 2005 there were
1,212,146 shares available for issuance under this Plan.



14.     Benefit Plans

Executive Deferred Compensation Plan

In December 2004 we adopted a new 2005 Executive Deferred
Compensation Plan that was effective January 1, 2005. We
adopted the 2005 Plan to meet the requirements of the new
restrictions on deferred compensation under Section 409A of
the Internal Revenue Code. The 2005 Plan was designed to track
the provisions of our original Executive Deferred Compensation
Plan that became effective March 15, 2002. All deferrals
for compensation that would otherwise be payable on or after
January 1, 2005 and employer contributions made on or after
January 1, 2005 are credited to participants under the new
2005 Plan. No new deferrals or contributions will be made to the
original plan. Both plans provide that executives who meet
minimum compensation requirements are eligible to defer up to
50% of their salaries and up to 100% of their bonuses and
commissions. We have agreed to credit the participants’
contributions with earnings that reflect the performance of
certain independent investment funds. We may also make
discretionary employer contributions to participant accounts.
The timing, amounts and vesting schedules of employer
contributions are at our sole discretion. The benefits under
this plan are unsecured and are general assets of Intuit.
Participants are generally eligible to receive payment of their
vested benefit at the end of their elected deferral period or
after termination of their employment with Intuit for any reason
or at a later date to comply with the restrictions of
Section 409A. Discretionary company contributions and the
related earnings vest completely upon the participant’s
disability, death or a change of control of Intuit.

We made employer contributions to the plan of $1.3 million
in fiscal 2005, $0.8 million in fiscal 2004 and
$0.2 million in fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2004 and 2003,
we also entered into several agreements in which we committed to
make employer contributions on behalf of certain executives
provided that they remain employed at Intuit on certain future
dates. All contributions were fully vested at the time of
contribution. We held assets of $19.3 million and
liabilities of $19.9 million related to this plan at
July 31, 2005 and assets of $11.9 million and
liabilities of $13.0 million at July 31, 2004. Assets
related to this plan are in other assets and liabilities related
to this plan are in other current liabilities on our balance
sheets. The plan liabilities include accrued employer
contributions not yet funded to the plan.

401(k) Plan

Employees who participate in the Intuit Inc. 401(k) Plan
may contribute up to 20% of pre-tax salary to the plan, subject
to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The plan
allows Intuit to make matching contributions. Beginning
April 1, 2005 we changed our matching formula to match
employee contributions to the greater of (a) $0.75 per
dollar contributed by the employee, up to a maximum matching
contribution of $3,000; or (b) 75 percent of the first
six percent of employee contributions, subject to IRS
limitations. Fifty percent of matching contributions vest after
two years of service by the employee and 100 percent of
matching contributions vest after three years of service.
However, employees who were in service on April 1, 2005
will receive vesting of 25 percent of matching
contributions after one year of service. Matching contributions
were $13.4 million in fiscal 2005, $10.1 million in
fiscal 2004 and $10.9 million in fiscal 2003. Participating
employees who are age 50 or older may also make catch-up
contributions. These contributions are not matched.

15.     Stockholder Rights Plan

On April 29, 1998 the Board of Directors adopted a
stockholder rights plan designed to protect the long-term value
of Intuit for its stockholders during any future unsolicited
acquisition attempt. In connection with the plan, the Board
declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for
each share of Intuit’s common stock outstanding on
May 11, 1998 (the Record Date) and further directed the
issuance of one such right with respect to each share of
Intuit’s common stock that is issued after the Record Date,
except in certain circumstances. If a person or a group (an
Acquiring Person) acquires 20% or more of Intuit’s common
stock, or announces an intention to make a tender offer for
Intuit’s common stock, the consummation of which would
result in a person or group becoming an Acquiring Person, then
the rights will be distributed (the Distribution Date). After
the Distribution Date, each right may be exercised for



1/3000th of a share of a newly designated Series B Junior
Participating Preferred stock. In January 2003 the Board amended
the rights plan to change the exercise price for the rights from
$83.33 per 1/3 of 1/1000th share to $300.00 per 1/3 of 1/1000th
share. The preferred stock has been structured so that the value
of 1/3000th of a share of this preferred stock will approximate
the value of one share of common stock. The rights will expire
on May 1, 2008. In July 2002 we adopted a policy that
requires an independent committee of our Board of Directors to
review the rights plan at least once every three years to
consider whether maintaining the rights plan continues to be in
the best interests of Intuit and its stockholders. In April 2005
the Nominating and Governance Committee of our Board of
Directors, which is composed solely of independent directors,
reviewed the rights plan and determined that it continues to be
in the best interests of Intuit and its stockholders.

16.  Litigation

Muriel Siebert & Co., Inc. v. Intuit Inc.,
Index No. 03-602942, Supreme Court of the State of New
York, County of New York.

On September 17, 2003, plaintiff Muriel Siebert &
Co., Inc. filed a complaint against Intuit alleging various
claims for breach of contract, breach of express and implied
covenants of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary
duty, misrepresentation and/or fraud, and promissory estoppel.
The allegations relate to Quicken Brokerage powered by Siebert,
a strategic alliance between the two companies. The complaint
seeks compensatory damages in the amount of either
$11.1 million or, in the alternative, $9.4 million, as
well as punitive damages in the amount of either
$33.0 million or $28.2 million, and other damages.
Intuit unsuccessfully sought to compel the matter to
arbitration. On February 7, 2005, Intuit filed a motion to
dismiss all but one of the plaintiff’s claims in New York
state court. On September 6, 2005, the court dismissed
Siebert’s fraud and punitive damages claims. Intuit
believes this lawsuit is without merit and will vigorously
defend the litigation.

Intuit/ Quicken Sunsetting Litigation, Master File
No. 1-04-CV-016394, Superior Court of California, County of
Santa Clara (Anthony Flannery v. Intuit Inc., et al,
Civil No. 1-04-CV-016394 and Daniel J. Mason v.
Intuit Inc. et al, Civil No. 1-04-CV-018345).

On or about March 19, 2004, plaintiff Anthony Flannery, on
his behalf and on behalf of a class of persons allegedly
similarly situated, filed a complaint against Intuit in Santa
Clara Superior Court, alleging that Intuit’s retirement of
certain services and live technical support associated with its
Quicken 1998, Quicken 1999 and Quicken
2000 products constituted a breach of express and implied
warranties and violated sections 17200 and 17500 of the
California Business and Professions Code, as well as the
Consumer Legal Remedies Act (“CLRA”). The complaint
seeks certification as a class action, as well as unspecified
compensatory and punitive damages, disgorgement of profits,
restitution, injunctive relief and attorney’s fees from
Intuit.

On or about April 21, 2004, plaintiff Daniel Mason, on his
behalf and on behalf of a class of persons allegedly similarly
situated, filed a complaint against Intuit in Santa Clara
Superior Court making allegations virtually identical to those
of Anthony Flannery. On July 14, 2004, the Court
consolidated the two cases pursuant to stipulation of the
parties.

On July 29, 2004, plaintiffs filed a consolidated First
Amended Complaint. On October 8, 2004, Intuit responded to
plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint by filing demurrers. By
Order dated November 12, 2004, the Court sustained the
demurrers and dismissed all counts of the First Amended
Complaint, holding that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim
upon which relief could be granted. The Court allowed plaintiffs
to file a Second Amended Complaint, which was served on Intuit.
Intuit filed a demurrer to this latest pleading and on
April 27, 2005 the Court sustained Intuit’s demurrers,
dismissed all counts of the Second Amended Complaint and denied
plaintiffs the right to further amend their complaint. On
June 1, 2005, the Court entered its final judgment.
Although plaintiffs had the right to appeal the Court’s
ruling, plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement effective
June 17, 2005 where they waived their right to appeal any
Judgment or Order in this action. This case is now concluded.



Cynthia Belotti/ Ental Precision Machining v. Intuit
Inc., et al, Civil No. 1-04-CV-020277, Superior Court
of California, County of Santa Clara.

On or about May 24, 2004, plaintiff Cynthia Belotti, on her
behalf and on behalf of a class of persons allegedly similarly
situated, filed a complaint against the Company in Santa Clara
Superior Court, alleging that Intuit’s retirement of
certain add-on business services and live technical support
associated with its QuickBooks 2001 and
QuickBooks 2002 products constituted a breach of express
and implied warranties and violated sections 17200 and
17500 of the California Business and Professions Code. The
complaint sought certification as a class action, as well as
damages, disgorgement of profits, restitution, injunctive relief
and attorney’s fees from Intuit.

On or about July 13, 2004, plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint that added Ental Precision Machining, Inc., as
plaintiff; plaintiffs’ counsel has also dismissed without
prejudice all claims on behalf of Cynthia Belotti. On
October 8, 2004, Intuit responded to plaintiff’s First
Amended Complaint by filing demurrers. By Order dated
November 12, 2004, the Court sustained the demurrers and
dismissed all counts of the First Amended Complaint, holding
that the plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief
could be granted. The Court allowed plaintiff to file a Second
Amended Complaint, which was served on Intuit. Intuit filed a
demurrer to this latest pleading and on April 27, 2005 the
Court sustained Intuit’s demurrers, dismissed all counts of
the Second Amended Complaint and denied plaintiff the right to
further amend its complaint. On June 1, 2005, the Court
entered its final judgment. Although plaintiff had the right to
appeal the Court’s ruling, plaintiff signed a settlement
agreement effective June 17, 2005 where it waived its right
to appeal any Judgment or Order in this action. This case is now
concluded.

Intuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings, as well
as demands, claims and threatened litigation, that arise in the
normal course of our business, including assertions that we may
be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of
others. We currently believe that the ultimate amount of
liability, if any, for any pending claims of any type (either
alone or combined) will not materially affect our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. We also believe
that we would be able to obtain any necessary licenses or other
rights to disputed intellectual property rights on commercially
reasonable terms. However, the ultimate outcome of any
litigation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, litigation
can have an adverse impact on Intuit because of defense costs,
negative publicity, diversion of management resources and other
factors. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other
rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual property
claims could adversely affect our business.

17.  Related Party Transactions

Loans to Executive Officers and Other Employees

Prior to July 30, 2002, loans to executive officers were
made generally in connection with their relocation and purchase
of a residence near their new place of work. Consistent with the
requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation enacted on
July 30, 2002, we have not made or modified any loans to
executive officers since that date and we do not intend to make
or modify any loans to executive officers in the future. At
July 31, 2005 no loans were in default and all interest
payments were current in accordance with the terms of the loan
agreements.

Long-term loans to executive officers and other employees are a
separate line item on our balance sheet. At July 31, 2004
certain loan amounts were due within twelve months and were
therefore classified as



prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet.
Loans to executive officers and other employees, including these
current amounts, were as follows at the dates indicated:

Loans to executive officers and other employees at July 31,
2005 excluded a $5.5 million secured loan to one executive
officer who ceased to be an Intuit employee in the third quarter
of fiscal 2005. We transferred this loan to other long-term
assets on our balance sheet during that quarter.

Of the total loans to executive officers and other employees at
July 31, 2005, $4.4 million accrue no interest for the
term of the note. The remaining loans to executive officers and
other employees at July 31, 2005 accrue interest at rates
equal to the applicable federal rates in effect at the time the
loans were made. All of the loans to executive officers and
other employees at July 31, 2005 were secured by real
property and had original terms of ten years.

Repurchases of Vested Restricted Stock

In the third quarters of fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 we entered
into share repurchase agreements with Stephen M. Bennett,
our chief executive officer, pursuant to which we repurchased
shares of our common stock from Mr. Bennett at the closing
price quoted on The Nasdaq Stock Market on the dates of
repurchase. We repurchased 15,945 shares of our common
stock at $41.81 per share from Mr. Bennett in fiscal 2005,
17,157 shares at $44.64 per share in fiscal 2004 and
17,532 shares at $39.02 in fiscal 2003. All of the proceeds from
these repurchases were remitted to federal and state taxing
authorities to satisfy Mr. Bennett’s federal, state
and Medicare tax withholding obligations resulting from the
vesting of 37,500 shares of our common stock in each of
those three quarters under his January 2000 new-hire restricted
stock awards. These repurchases were approved by our Board of
Directors.
