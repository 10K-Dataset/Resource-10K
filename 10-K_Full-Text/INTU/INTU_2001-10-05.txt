BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Intuit’s Mission: Revolutionizing Financial and Business Management

Intuit’s mission is to revolutionize how people manage their financial lives,
and how small businesses and accounting professionals manage their businesses.
We are the leading provider of small business, tax preparation and personal
finance software products and Web-based services that simplify complex
financial tasks for consumers, small businesses and accounting professionals.
Our principal products and services include Quicken®, QuickBooks®, Quicken
TurboTax®, ProSeries®, Lacerte® and Quicken Loans™. Details about our products
and services are provided beginning on page 5.

Business Strategy and Key Initiatives

Our strategy is to build and maintain a sustainable competitive advantage in
each business we’re in. The following key initiatives support our business
strategy:

•

Deliver innovative solutions to our customers that make complex tasks
simple, and deliver great end-to-end customer experiences

. During the
past few years, we have delivered a number of new and innovative
solutions to our customers, including the “Instant Data Entry” feature
in our Quicken TurboTax products, our Live Tax Advice service
available to all taxpayers, QuickBooks Online Billing, and QuickBase®,
our Web-sharable information management solution. We’re also focused
on ensuring that every customer contact with us is a great experience,
in order to enhance the already-strong customer loyalty we enjoy.



•

Utilize third-party relationships and acquisitions to improve our
competitive position and drive revenue and profit growth.

In the past
few years we have established a number of key third party
relationships, such as Wells Fargo for our QuickBooks Internet Gateway
merchant account service, and we’ve also made a number of
acquisitions, primarily in the small business and tax areas. These
relationships and acquisitions have improved our competitive advantage
by complementing and strengthening our existing businesses. We
believe they position us well for future growth.

•

Improve profitability through operational rigor.

We have improved
our focus and execution in a number of areas, including resource
allocation, process excellence and procurement. As a result of our
improved resource allocation rigor, we identified two businesses where
we were not on a path to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage,
and we exited those businesses in fiscal 2001.

•

Put in place process and technology infrastructures that deliver
competitive advantage and support profit growth.

We have
significantly strengthened and deepened our management team over the
past 18 months, creating a number of new officer-level positions to
bring in new expertise, including a chief technology officer and a
chief information officer. We have also added senior leaders to head
our procurement efforts and Six Sigma process excellence initiatives.

•

Be a great place to work and attract great people.

Our employees are
the key to our success. We strive to maintain a productive and
performance-oriented work environment that supports employee growth
and development and recognizes and rewards contributions.

“Right for My Business” Small Business Strategy

In September 2001, we announced our “Right for My Business” strategy for our
Small Business Division, to better address the small business management market
opportunity. Our focus is to be the right solution for every small business by
providing tools and services that address the unique needs of each small
business.

Industry-Specific Accounting Solutions.

As part of that strategy, we intend to offer
industry-specific accounting solutions to meet the specialized requirements of
small businesses in selected vertical industries. We have announced the following three
initiatives to achieve that goal:

•

We are developing
industry-specific versions of QuickBooks, such as an
edition of QuickBooks designed specifically for accountants, and an
electronic cash register software solution designed for retailers.

•

We are expanding the Intuit Developer Network, a multifaceted
initiative that includes giving software developers access to the
application programming interfaces for certain of our small business
products. Through the Intuit Developer Network we are encouraging
third party software developers to develop applications that integrate
with certain of our small business products. We expect that this will
include applications that address the needs of small businesses in specific vertical
industries.

•

We are actively pursuing acquisitions of companies that offer
standalone business management solutions to small businesses in specific industries. For
example, we have signed an agreement to acquire substantially all of
the assets of OMware, Inc., the provider of “The Master Builder,” a
leading business management solution for the construction industry.

Beyond Entry-Level Accounting.

A second part of our “Right for My Business”
strategy is to provide accounting solutions for companies that, due to their
larger size or complexity, have more demanding accounting needs. Our product
initiatives include QuickBooks Premier, which is being designed for small
businesses that want more advanced accounting functionality. We are also
working on an accounting software product for even larger, more complex
businesses.

Business Management Solutions.

The third part of our “Right for My Business”
strategy is expansion of our efforts to provide business solutions that go
beyond accounting software, to address a wider range of business management



issues facing small businesses. We currently offer a number of business
management tools, including payroll services and financial supplies, as well as
QuickBase, our online database service that enables users to organize, manage
and share a wide range of information over the Internet quickly, easily and at
a reasonable cost. We plan to offer a QuickBooks retirement solution designed
to offer small businesses a variety of retirement plan options, and a human
resource management tool to help small businesses manage all aspects of
employee administration.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

Intuit offers products and services in five principal business divisions: Small
Business, Tax, Personal Finance, Quicken Loans and Global Business. Our
primary products and services are described below. For financial information
about these businesses, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations,” beginning on page 20 and
Note 15 of the financial statements. For a description
of principal risks associated with these businesses, see “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Risks that Could Affect Future Results,” beginning on page 29.

Small Business Division

QuickBooks Software.

Our QuickBooks product line brings extensive bookkeeping
capabilities, as well as business management tools, to small business users in
an easy-to-use design that does not require customers to be familiar with
debit/credit accounting. QuickBooks for the Web™ provides basic financial and
accounting management capabilities with any time, anywhere access. We also
sell a variety of technical support programs to our QuickBooks customers
through the QuickBooks Support Network.

Our QuickBooks 2001 products offer a variety of Web-enabled features, including
QuickBooks Online Billing, which allows small businesses to send invoices
online, and to utilize a third-party service provider to receive customer
payments electronically. The QuickBooks Internet Gateway platform gives
customers access to a range of online small business service offerings from
third-party vendors, including the QuickBooks Merchant Account Service, which
enables small businesses to accept credit card payments from their customers.
Gateway vendors generally pay us a portion of their ongoing Gateway-generated
revenues and/or per-customer fees, and often certain set-up and marketing fees
as well, in order to participate in the program.

Employer Services.

The mission of our Employer Services group is to help small
business owners better manage key tasks relating to their employees. We offer
three primary payroll services. Our Basic Payroll Service is a payroll tax table
subscription service for small business customers that need current tax tables
to prepare their own payrolls. Our Deluxe Payroll Service is an online payroll
services that handles all aspects of payroll processing, including tax payments
and filings. It is fully integrated with QuickBooks, so customer data entry is
minimized. Our Premier Payroll Service provides traditional, full service
payroll processing, tax payment and check delivery services on a private-label
basis to customers of participating financial institutions. Our acquisition
of EmployeeMatters, Inc. in December 2000 is enabling us to expand our employer
services into new areas, including retirement solutions and human resource
management tools.

Financial Supplies.

We offer a range of financial supplies, many of which
integrate with our small business, personal finance and professional tax
software products. Examples of our supplies products include paper checks,
envelopes, invoices, deposit slips, stationery and business cards, as well as
tax forms, tax return presentation folders and other items for professional tax
preparers. Many products can incorporate customer logos and offer a variety of
color, font and design options.

Tax Division

Desktop Consumer Tax Software.

Our Quicken TurboTax desktop products are
designed to enable individuals and small business owners to prepare their own
federal and state personal and business income tax returns easily, quickly and
accurately. Our consumer tax products are designed to be easy to use, but
sophisticated enough for complicated tax returns. The innovative “Instant Data
Entry” feature enables taxpayers to import data from Form W-2s (wages)



and Form 1099s (interest, dividends and stock transactions) from participating
financial institutions directly into their tax forms, thereby saving
significant time and increasing accuracy.

Web-Based Consumer Tax Preparation and Electronic
Filing Services.

Quicken
TurboTax for the Web is an interactive tax preparation service that enables
individual taxpayers to prepare their federal and state income tax returns
entirely online. This service allows us to reach a different segment of
consumer tax customers than those who use our desktop products, as a majority
of Quicken TurboTax for the Web tax filers in fiscal 2000 and fiscal 2001 had
not used tax preparation software before. Through our electronic filing
center, customers of our desktop and Web-based tax preparation software can
electronically file their federal tax returns, as well as state returns in most
states that support electronic filing. Under the Quicken Tax Freedom Project,
a philanthropic public service initiative designed to address the “digital
divide,” we provide online tax preparation and electronic filing services at no
charge to lower-income federal and state tax filers.

Other Consumer Tax-Related Services.

Our Quick Cash service allows Quicken
TurboTax users to apply for refund anticipation loans of up to $5,000 (less
applicable fees), right from within the software. Our Tax Advisor service,
which is available to all taxpayers, offers a referral network of professional
tax experts that taxpayers can contact by phone, email or instant messaging to
discuss their tax questions. The tax experts pay Intuit a portion of the fees
they charge to the taxpayers.

Professional Tax Software.

Our ProSeries and Lacerte tax products are designed
for tax professionals who prepare tax returns for their individual and business
clients. Customers can elect to license professional tax products for a single
fee for unlimited annual use or to use them on a “pay-per-return” basis.
ProSeries and Lacerte customers can file their customers’ tax returns through
our electronic filing services. During fiscal 2001 we piloted NetTax®, a
Web-based tax preparation product for professional tax preparers. During
fiscal 2002, we will also offer EasyACCT Professional Accounting System
products, which we acquired through our recent acquisition of Tax and
Accounting Software Corporation. See Note 12 of the
financial statements. These products allow accountants to process
general ledger data for their clients, create financial statements and prepare
tax forms (such as W-2s and 940s) for their clients.

IntuitAdvisor.

IntuitAdvisor™ is a subscription-based Web site that offers a
collection of Web-based tools to help tax accounting and financial
professionals manage and grow their businesses more effectively. For example,
the site enables professional tax preparers to set up internal “Intranet” sites
to in order to share information and data and within their offices and with
their clients. The solutions are designed to work with ProSeries and Lacerte
tax preparation products.

Personal Finance Division

Quicken Software.

Our Quicken line of desktop software products help users
organize, understand and manage their personal finances. Quicken allows
customers to reconcile bank accounts, record credit card and other
transactions, write checks, and track investments, mortgages and other assets
and liabilities. Many customers use Quicken products to manage their
home-based businesses. We provide a range of online transaction-based services
related to Quicken, including bill payment and online banking services through
the Quicken desktop product, as well as a Quicken credit card.

Quicken.com.

Quicken.com™ is our primary personal finance Web site. It
enables customers to automate financial management tasks and make better
financial decisions by giving them software tools, resources and objective
information about a variety of personal finance topics, including investing,
mortgage, insurance, taxes, banking and retirement, in a single online
destination. Quicken.com content is created by Intuit as well as by third
party publishers and financial experts. We offer certain products and services
— such as insurance and bill payment — through contractual arrangements with
third party service providers of these services. We do not currently charge
customers a fee to access most features on Quicken.com, but we receive revenue
from financial institutions and other companies that advertise and/or sell
their products or services through links from Quicken.com.



Quicken Loans Division

Our Quicken Loans business allows consumers to shop and apply for residential
mortgages online (through the Quicken Loans Web site or by telephone through
our mortgage call center), or, for Michigan residents, through traditional
branch offices. We offer a variety of loans directly to consumers, including
conventional, government-insured, sub-prime and home equity loans. We manage
the entire loan process from origination through funding, and then sell the
loans and post-closing servicing obligations in bulk to participating financial
institutions. As we have focused more resources on the Web site and call
center during the past two years, the percentage of our mortgage revenue
generated and processed through the Web site and/or through the call center
increased from 18% in fiscal 1999 to 37% in fiscal 2000 and to 50% in fiscal
2001. We are continuing to develop ways to automate and streamline the loan
process.

Global Business Division

We have major facilities in Japan and Canada, and we also serve markets across
Europe, Southeast Asia and other selected locations. In all international
markets except Canada and Europe, we focus primarily on small business
products. We have established third-party relationships with local companies
in certain locations to help us better address specific markets.

Japan.

The principal product offered by Intuit KK, our Japanese subsidiary, is
Yayoi®, a small business accounting product that addresses the middle segment
of the small business market in Japan. Sales of Yayoi products also generate
recurring revenue from ongoing support contracts that are sold with the
software.

Canada.

We offer localized versions of QuickBooks and Quicken in Canada, as
well as QuickTax™ consumer and professional tax products. We also have a
relationship with Rogers Media, Inc., a leading media company in Canada, under
which we offer Quicken.ca

SM

, a personal finance Web site with content similar
to Quicken.com.

Other.

We offer localized versions of QuickBooks and Quicken in selected
European markets, including the United Kingdom and Germany. We have
development, marketing and distribution arrangement with Lexware, a leading
business software company in Germany, as well as relationships with other local
distributors and agents. We offer localized versions of QuickBooks and Quicken
products in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Singapore, as well as other
parts of Southeast Asia, through a development, marketing and distribution
arrangement with Australia-based Reckon Limited.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

During the past several years, we have devoted significant resources to
developing and expanding newer products and services, including QuickBooks for
the Web, QuickBooks Deluxe Payroll Service, the Intuit Developer Network,
Web-based tax preparation and electronic tax filing, and our Quicken.com and
Quicken Loans Web sites. Our research and development expenses were $143.4
million in fiscal 1999, $169.1 million in fiscal 2000 and $207.1 million in
fiscal 2001. We supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring
strategically important products and technology from third parties, or
establishing other relationships that enable us to expand our business more
rapidly.

For our desktop software products, our recent development efforts have focused
on improving the ease with which they can be supported and maintained in order
to create a better customer experience, as well as adding new features. We are
also focused on incorporating technology in our products and services to
address customer concerns about privacy and security without sacrificing
product performance and ease of use.

Over the next few years, we expect that our research and development efforts
will be focused in two primary areas. We plan to add complementary products
and services to drive additional, recurring revenue from our core products,
such as employee administration products and services for our QuickBooks
customers. We are also redefining the markets we serve to increase our
potential customer base, and we are developing products and services to address
customer needs in those broader markets. We strive to maintain a balance
between relatively low-risk investments to



address existing customer demands, and investments in more innovative but
higher-risk projects with potentially greater returns.

Historically, our desktop software products have tended to have a fairly
predictable, structured development cycle of about a year, with annual
releases. For our small business desktop products, we expect to supplement
annual releases of our core QuickBooks product with ongoing releases of new
industry-specific products to address the specialized requirements of selected
vertical industries, as well as products for larger or more complex businesses.
The development cycles for our Internet-based offerings and our other service
offerings are less predictable and generally much shorter than for our desktop
products, with greater opportunities for a “launch and learn” approach. The
development of tax preparation software presents a unique challenge because of
the demanding annual development cycle required to incorporate annual tax law
changes each year. For a description of other risks and challenges we face
relating to our product development, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risks That Could Affect
Future Results.”

MARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION

Markets

Many of the markets that we compete in are characterized by rapidly changing
customer demands, continuous technological changes and improvements, shifting
industry standards and frequent new product introductions by competitors. In
addition, the Internet has shifted more purchasing leverage to consumers by
greatly enhancing their ability to make product and price comparisons. Market
and industry changes can quickly render existing products and services
obsolete, so our marketing success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to
these changes with new or enhanced products and services, new business models,
alternative distribution methods, different competitive strategies and other
changes to the way we do business.

Retail Distribution

We market our desktop software in North America through traditional retail
software outlets, computer superstores, office and warehouse clubs and general
mass merchandisers, with mass merchants becoming an increasingly important
channel during the past few years. In international markets, we also rely on
distributors, value-added resellers and other third parties, who sell products
into the retail channel.

We continue to benefit from strong relationships with a number of major
retailers, which allows us to minimize our dependency on any specific retailer.
We are reducing our dependency on distributors as we ship more of our products
directly to individual retail locations. See “Manufacturing and Distribution.”
No retailer accounted for 10% or more of our total net revenue during the past
three fiscal years, and no distributor met this threshold in fiscal 2001.
One distributor, Ingram Micro Inc., accounted for 16% of total net revenue in fiscal 1999 and 10%
in fiscal 2000.

We ship more products to our retailers than we expect them to sell in order to
reduce the risk that they will run out of products. This is particularly true
for our tax products. As a result, we often experience significant levels of
product returns from the retail channel. See “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risks That Could
Affect Future Results.” In addition, the recent slowdown in consumer demand
for software may result in software becoming a less important category for
retailers. As a result of this trend, we may face challenges in ensuring good
product placement within retail stores. See “Competition” and “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Risks That Could Affect Future Results.”

Direct Sales and Electronic Distribution

We use various direct sales campaigns (including mail and telephone
solicitations, direct-response newspaper and magazine advertising, and
television and radio advertising) to generate software orders, stimulate retail
demand and generally maintain and increase consumer awareness of our products.
Direct marketing campaigns are one of the most effective ways to encourage
existing customers to purchase additional products and services, including
software



upgrades. Direct sales often generate significantly higher revenue and profit
per unit than retail sales (particularly for our small business and tax
products). Direct sales make up a significant portion of total desktop
software revenue, accounting for approximately a third of our desktop revenue
in fiscal 2001.

Many of our direct customers choose to order and/or take delivery of products
electronically through the Quicken Store

SM

and other company Web sites.
Electronic ordering and delivery are generally more convenient for customers
and more cost-efficient for Intuit. Electronic delivery has been a
particularly effective method of distribution for our Quicken TurboTax state
tax preparation products and for product updates for our professional tax
products. During fiscal 2001, approximately 13% of our total net revenue was
generated by products ordered and/or delivered electronically.

OEM and Other Sales Channels

We have relationships with a number of personal computer “original equipment
manufacturers,” or OEMs, including Compaq Computer Corporation and Hewlett-Packard Company, that enable us to generate sales in two ways.
First, the OEMs “pre-bundle” entry-level versions of certain desktop software
products on the computer systems that the OEMs sell to their customers.
Although these pre-bundled OEM sales sometimes generate little revenue or
profit for Intuit (due to the low prices that the OEMs may pay for the
products), they are a good source of new customers. The second source of
revenue from the OEM channel is “after-market” programs, in which customers who
are purchasing computers can select and purchase software products that they
want to have pre-installed. Revenues generally reflect retail pricing but our
delivery costs are relatively low. We have a franchise/corporate direct sales
program through which we make products and services available to a large number
of individual users under an enterprise license with the franchise or
corporation with which the users are associated. We also have a small internal
sales force that focuses on sales of advertising and sponsorships on
Quicken.com, as well as advertising within our desktop products.

COMPETITION

Overview

We face intense competition in almost all of our business areas, both
domestically and globally. Some of our existing competitors have significantly
greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. In addition,
the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in
which we compete. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Risks That Could Affect Future Results.”

For our desktop software, we believe the most important competitive factors are
product features, ease of use, the size of the installed customer base, brand
name recognition, price, product and support quality and access to distribution
channels. We believe we compete effectively on most of these factors, as our
three principal desktop software products (QuickBooks, Quicken TurboTax, and
Quicken) are the leading products in the retail sales channel for their
respective categories.

For most of our products and services (including Internet-based products and
services) other than desktop software, we believe the most important
competitive factors are features and ease of use, brand name recognition, speed
in getting new products and services to market, and the ability to distribute
them effectively (through generating Web site traffic or through traditional
retail and direct distribution). For our service offerings, service
reliability and scalability of operations are also important factors. In
addition, the competitive success of some of our Internet-based products will
depend on greater availability of broadband distribution. Some of our
non-desktop products and services, such as Quicken TurboTax for the Web and
electronic tax filing, have initially established solid competitive positions.
However, the markets for many of our products and services are still emerging
and the competitive landscape is constantly evolving.



Small Business Division

Competitors for our small business accounting software include companies such
as Peachtree Software, which is owned by The Sage Group PLC, MYOB Group, pure
Web-based accounting software providers such as NetLedger, and Microsoft, which
recently announced a new small business product initiative in conjunction with
Great Plains, which it acquired earlier this year. In addition to established
competitors, other potential competitors have expressed significant interest in
providing accounting and other products and services to small businesses. Our
new strategic initiative to expand the depth and breadth of our small business
offerings will expose us to additional competition from others who are already
offering industry-specific accounting solutions, larger or more complex
accounting solutions, and business management tools and services.

Our payroll, human resource and benefits administration services compete
directly with other employer services, traditional payroll service providers
and Web-based service providers. Significant competitive factors include
distribution channels, a highly fragmented market including financial
institutions that are developing or promoting their own payroll services, and
offerings by non-traditional competitors such as Microsoft’s b-Central. The
majority of our growth in payroll services comes from customers who have not
previously used any payroll service, rather than from customers who have used
services from a competitor. We face direct competition in our Premier Payroll
Service business from traditional payroll services offered by a number of
companies, including Paychex and ADP. Our Deluxe Payroll Service competes
directly with new companies that are offering Web-based payroll services as
well as more established companies that are launching Web-based services.
Peachtree and others also offer tax table subscription services that compete
directly with our Basic Payroll Service.

Our financial supplies business competes with a number of business forms
companies, such as New England Business Service and Deluxe Business Systems, as
well as with direct mail check printers, banks and a number of smaller-scale
Internet-based printing companies. In addition, our QuickBooks products
include some features (such as customizable invoicing) that compete with our
supplies products. Online bill payment services, and online payroll services
with direct deposit capabilities also offer competitive alternatives to printed
checks. Significant competitive factors for the supplies business include
ordering convenience, methods of reaching customers, product quality, speed of
delivery and price. We believe convenient access to our large QuickBooks and
Quicken customer bases is a significant competitive advantage for us.

Tax Division

Competition in consumer tax is intense. Our major domestic competitor for both
desktop and Web-based consumer tax software continues to be H&R Block (the
makers of TaxCut software). However, Microsoft offered a competitive product
in fiscal 2000, and major new competitors may enter these markets in the
future. In particular, Web-based tax preparation is a relatively new service,
and we expect the competitive landscape to evolve as more competitors enter the
market and others consolidate. We also face potential competitive challenges
from electronic tax preparation and filing services offered by federal and
state governments. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Risks That Could Affect Future Results.”

The professional tax preparation software marketplace has many competitors.
Our largest competitors in the U.S. are CCH Incorporated, with its Computax
product line, and RIA, with its Fast-Tax and Creative Solutions offerings. In
the past, the professional tax market has been highly fragmented, but it has
experienced some consolidation in recent years.

Personal Finance Division

In desktop personal finance software, Microsoft is our primary domestic
competitor. We also face competition from Web-based personal finance tracking
and management tools that are becoming increasingly available at no cost to
consumers. There are many competitors for our other personal finance products
and services. For example, our Quicken.com site competes for traffic, and
advertising and sponsorship sales, with online financial publishers, the
financial areas on numerous online services such as Yahoo!, and
financially-oriented Web sites such as Microsoft’s Money Central. Certain
portals and financial institutions also provide service offerings such as
Web-based bill



payment, that compete with services we offer on Quicken.com. We also face
increasing competition from financial institutions that are developing their
own financial software and Web sites.

Quicken Loans Division

Our Quicken Loans mortgage business competes with traditional providers of
mortgage loan products, as well as with other online service providers.
Competitors include a number of smaller companies with a very narrow product
focus (such as E-LOAN), as well as larger, more diversified companies (such as
Countrywide Credit Industries, Inc.).

Global Business Division

In Japan, our primary competitors in the small business accounting arena are
OBC, PCA and Sorimachi. In Canada, we face competition from a number of
companies in the small business arena, including Computer Associates
International, Inc. and MYOB Group. The primary international competitor for
our consumer tax business is Taxamatic, Inc., the makers of TAXWIZ, and the
primary international competitor for our professional tax business is CCH
Canadian Limited. Our primary global competitor in the personal finance area
is Microsoft. In Europe, we face competition from The Sage Group PLC (based in
the United Kingdom), Bhuldata (Wiso) and Microsoft in the small business
market, as well as competition from Web-based accounting products that are
becoming available. This increasing competition may have a more significant
impact on our global business in the future, as the focus of our European
business is shifting towards the small business market. Many of the
competitors identified above, including MYOB, Sage and Microsoft, also compete
with us in other global markets.

CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT

We provide customer service and technical support by telephone, fax, e-mail and
our customer service and technical support Web sites. We have full-time
customer service and technical support staffs, which we supplement with
seasonal employees and outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes, such as
during the tax return filing season, or following a major product launch.

During the past few years, we have focused on developing support capabilities
that can supplement, or in some situations replace, telephone service and
support. For example, customers can use our Web sites to find answers to
commonly asked questions, check on the status of a product order and receive
bug fixes electronically. Alternative service and support methods are less
expensive for us and are often more efficient and effective for customers as
well. During fiscal 2001, we initiated a number of Six Sigma process
excellence projects in our customer service and technical support operations.
We believe these projects are critical to our ongoing efforts to provide better
service to customers at the same or lower cost.

We generally charge customers for technical support, but we do not charge for
product installation or product defect issues, or fax, email and “self-help”
support through our technical support Web sites. Our QuickBooks customers can
purchase a variety of technical support plans, while Quicken customers pay a
per-minute fee. Quicken TurboTax customers pay for technical support during
evening and weekend hours. For ProSeries and Lacerte customers, the cost of
technical support is included in the product purchase price.

Despite our efforts to adequately staff and equip our customer service and
technical support operations, we cannot always respond promptly to customer
requests for assistance. When we experience customer service and support
problems, they can adversely affect customer relationships and our financial
results. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations — Risks That Could Affect Future Results.”



MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION

Desktop Software

The major steps involved in manufacturing desktop software are duplicating CDs
and floppy disks, printing boxes and related materials, and assembling and
shipping the final products. We have a manufacturing agreement with Modus
Media International, Inc. under which Modus provides all outsourced
manufacturing related to our retail and direct launches of QuickBooks, Quicken
TurboTax and Quicken. Modus has operations in multiple locations to provide
redundancy. We also have an in-house manufacturing and shipping facility to
handle low-volume products, and to handle a portion of the manufacturing and
shipping for direct sales orders, primarily after the initial product launch
orders are filled. We have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and
availability has not been a problem for us in the past.

Our retail product launches have become operationally more complex over the
past few years. We have evolved from shipping to a few hundred distribution
centers (with distributors delivering products to individual retail locations)
to a “direct to storefront” model in which we ship products directly to
thousands of individual retail locations. This allows us to be more responsive
to the needs of our retail accounts. We have an agreement with Ingram Micro Logistics
under which Ingram handles all logistics, fulfillment and other distribution
functions for our retail launches of QuickBooks, Quicken TurboTax and Quicken.

We believe that using these two vendors (Modus Media and Ingram Micro
Logistics) to handle essentially all manufacturing and distribution,
respectively, for our three primary retail product launches improves the
efficiency and reliability of our product launches, and enables us to move more
quickly to the direct-to-storefront model preferred by many of our retailers.
It also allows us to better manage inventory levels. However, exclusive
reliance on one vendor for specific functions can have severe negative
consequences on our business, revenue and operating results if a vendor fails
to perform for any reason. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risks That Could Affect Future
Results.”

Prior to major product releases, we tend to have significant levels of backlog,
but at other times backlog is minimal and we normally ship products within a
few days of receiving an order. Because of this fluctuation in backlog, we
believe that backlog is not an important measure of our future sales.

Internet-based Products and Services

Intuit’s data centers house most of the systems, networks and databases
required to operate and deliver our Internet-based products and services.
Through our data centers, we connect customers to products and services, and we
store the vast amount of data that represents the content on our Web sites.
Our data centers consist of approximately 2,000 servers and 200 databases
located primarily in three locations. In an effort to reduce unavailability,
or “down time” for our Internet-based products and
services, we generally follow
industry-standard practices for creating a fault-tolerant environment
but we do not have complete redundancy. We also
rely on a third party to host our Quicken.com Web site. Despite our efforts to
maintain continuous and reliable server operations, like all providers of
Internet-based products and services, we occasionally experience unplanned
outages or technical difficulties. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risks That Could Affect
Future Results.”

PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION

Customers are becoming increasingly concerned about the privacy and security of
information they provide to product and services providers. This concern
applies to information provided in connection with Internet-based products and
services, as well as information provided through more traditional channels,
such as product registration cards. Due to the nature of the information
customers provide to us, we are subject to various federal and state laws
relating to privacy and security. Additional laws of this type may be passed
in the future, which could result in significant compliance costs. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Risks That Could Affect Future Results.”



We have established guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers are
aware of, and can control, how we use information about them. All
publicly-accessible Intuit-owned and operated Web sites at which customer data
is collected (including Quicken.com, QuickBooks.com and TurboTax.com) have been
certified by TRUSTe, an independent, non-profit privacy organization that
operates a Web site certification program to alleviate users’ concerns about
online privacy. Each of our Web sites, as well as our software products, has a
privacy statement providing notice to customers of our privacy practices, as
well as providing them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to
use of their data.

To address security concerns, we use industry-standard security safeguards to
help protect the information customers give to us from loss, misuse and
unauthorized alteration. Whenever customers transmit sensitive information,
such as a credit card number or tax return data, to us through our Web site, we
provide them access to our servers that allow encryption of the information as
it is transmitted to us. We work to protect personally identifiable
information stored on the Web site’s servers from unauthorized access using
commercially available computer security products, such as firewalls, as well
as internally developed security procedures and practices.

Despite our efforts to address customer concerns about privacy and security, we
believe these issues may still pose a significant risk to Intuit and other
companies, especially companies doing business over the Internet. During the
past two years we have faced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to
privacy issues. Our response to these allegations has been that we do not
share any personally identifiable information except as disclosed in our
privacy policies. A major breach of customer privacy or security, even by
another company, could have serious consequences for our businesses. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Risks That Could Affect Future Results” and “Legal Proceedings.”

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

We offer several regulated products and services through separate subsidiary
corporations. For example, our Quicken Loans business is operated by a
subsidiary that is subject to federal and state mortgage lender regulations.
Our Quicken Investment Services, Inc. subsidiary, which is responsible for
certain of the investment-related features in our products and services, is
registered as an investment adviser with the SEC and is subject to some state
regulatory laws as well. Our Quicken products allow customers of participating
brokerages to trade securities through their broker’s Web site. We believe we
have structured this feature in a way that does not subject Intuit to direct
government regulation under federal and/or state securities broker-dealer laws.
However, it is possible that these services, or other services we may offer in
the future, may become regulated under broker-dealer laws or other regulations.
Our new strategic initiative to expand the depth and breadth of our small
business offerings may expose us to additional government regulation,
particularly in the areas of retirement planning and other employer services.
We continually analyze new business opportunities, and any new businesses that
we pursue may require additional costs for regulatory compliance.

Current government regulation poses a number of risks to us, including
potential liability to customers and/or penalties and sanctions by government
regulators. Future regulation could hamper the growth of our businesses. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Risks That Could Affect Future Results.”

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws,
and employee and third-party nondisclosure and license agreements, to protect
our software products and other proprietary technology. While our proprietary
technology is important, we believe our success depends more heavily on the
innovation and technical skills of our employees. We do not own all of the
software and other technologies used in our products and services, but we have
the licenses from third parties that we believe are necessary and appropriate
for using that technology in our current products.

We consider our principal trademarks (including Intuit, QuickBooks, Quicken,
Quicken TurboTax and Quicken Loans) to be important assets and have registered
these and other trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and many



foreign countries. The initial duration of trademark registrations varies from
country to country and is 10 years in the U.S. Most registrations can be
renewed perpetually at 10-year intervals.

We face a number of risks relating to our intellectual property, including
persistent unauthorized copying, or “piracy” of our desktop software products,
and the risk of third party infringement claims. See “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risks That
Could Affect Future Results.”

EMPLOYEES

As of September 30, 2001, we had approximately 6,000 full-time employees, and
about 100 part-time and/or seasonal employees, located in the United States,
Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom. We believe our future success and growth
will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all
areas of our business. We do not currently have any collective bargaining
agreements with our employees, and we believe employee relations are generally
good. Although we have employment-related agreements with a number of key
employees, these agreements do not guarantee continued service. We believe we
offer competitive compensation and a good working environment. However, we
face intense competition for qualified employees, and we expect to face
continuing challenges in recruiting and retention.

ITEM 2

PROPERTIES

Our principal offices and corporate headquarters are located in Mountain View,
California. We lease the majority of our Mountain View facilities under leases
with staggered eight-year terms that we entered into in 1994. Our total
available Mountain View facilities consist of approximately 482,000 square
feet. We maintain a number of leased facilities in San Diego, California,
consisting of approximately 320,000 square feet. These facilities are used for
general office space, a data center and a manufacturing and distribution
center. The San Diego leases have expiration dates ranging from 2003 through
2007. We also lease approximately 135,000 square feet in Tucson, Arizona,
where our primary customer service call center is located. The Tucson lease
expires in 2009. See Note 17 of the financial statements for information about
our lease commitments. We also lease or own facilities in a number of other
domestic locations, including Plano, Texas (where our Lacerte subsidiaries are
located); Reno, Nevada (headquarters for our payroll business); and Livonia,
Michigan (where our Quicken Loans business is headquartered). We also lease or
own facilities in Canada, England and Japan.

We believe our facilities are adequate for our current and near-term needs, and
that we will be able to locate additional facilities as needed.

ITEM 3

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On March 3, 2000, a class action lawsuit, Bruce v. Intuit Inc., was filed in
the United States District Court, Central District of California, Eastern
Division. Two virtually identical lawsuits were later filed: Rubin v. Intuit
Inc., was filed on March 8, 2000 in the United States District Court, Southern
District of New York and Newby v. Intuit Inc. was filed on April 27, 2000, in
the United States District Court, Central District of California, Eastern
Division. The Bruce and Newby lawsuits were consolidated into one lawsuit, In
re Intuit Privacy Litigation, filed on July 28, 2000 in the United States
District Court of California, Eastern Division. Following Intuit’s successful
motion to dismiss several of the claims, an amended complaint was filed on May
2, 2001. A similar lawsuit, Almanza v. Intuit Inc. was filed on March 22, 2000
in the Superior Court of State of California, San Bernardino County, Rancho
Cucamonga Division. An amended complaint in the Almanza suit was filed on
October 26, 2000. These purported class actions allege violations of various
federal and California statutes and common law claims for invasion of privacy
based upon the alleged intentional disclosure to third parties of personal and
private customer information entered at Intuit’s Quicken.com Web site. The
complaints seek injunctive relief, orders to disgorge profits related to the



alleged acts, and statutory and other damages. Intuit believes these lawsuits
are without merit and intends to defend the litigation vigorously.

Intuit is subject to other legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and
threatened litigation, that arise in the normal course of our business. We
currently believe that the ultimate amount of liability, if any, for any
pending claims of any type (either alone or combined) will not materially
affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. However,
the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain, and either unfavorable or
favorable outcomes could have a material negative impact. Regardless of
outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on Intuit because of defense
costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.

Overview

Intuit’s mission is to revolutionize how people manage their financial lives,
and how small businesses and accounting professionals manage their businesses.
We are the leading provider of small business, tax preparation and personal
finance software products and Web-based services that simplify complex
financial tasks for consumers, small businesses and accounting professionals.
Our principal products and services include Quicken®, QuickBooks®, Quicken
TurboTax®, ProSeries®, Lacerte® and Quicken Loans®.

Our businesses are highly seasonal — particularly our tax business, but also
small business and personal finance to a lesser extent. Sales of tax products
are heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. Sales of
personal finance and small business products are typically strongest during the
calendar year-end holiday buying season and the beginning of the calendar year
and therefore major product launches for these products usually occur in the
fall or early winter to take advantage of these customer buying patterns.
These seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest
during our second and third quarters. We typically report a loss in our first
and fourth quarters when revenue from our tax businesses and QuickBooks are
minimal, but operating expenses to develop new products and services continue
at relatively consistent levels. Operating results can also fluctuate for
other reasons such as changes in product release dates, non-recurring events
such as acquisitions, dispositions, gains and losses from marketable
securities, and product price cuts in quarters with relatively high fixed
expenses.

Gains and losses related to marketable securities
and other investments have a significant impact on the
comparability of our yearly results. All of our marketable securities are
stocks of high technology companies that have been extremely volatile. The
volatility of the stock market and the potential risk of fluctuating stock
prices have an impact on our operating results each year. We carry significant
balances in marketable equity securities that are subject to considerable
market risk due to their volatility. Fluctuations in the carrying value of our
shares of Excite@Home and 724 Solutions will have an immediate impact on our
earnings because we report these shares as trading securities. In fiscal 2001,
the market



prices of a number of these companies’ stocks declined substantially. As such,
the fair value of companies included in our long-term investments also declined
substantially from our initial investment due to the volatility and economic
downturn of the high technology industry. During fiscal 2001, we recorded a
charge of $68.8 million for other than temporary declines in the value of our
marketable securities and other investments, and a charge of $40.0 million
relating to the decline in the valuation of our trading securities. These
declines have resulted in a material reduction in the carrying value of these
assets and had a negative impact on our operating results year over year. See
Note 3 of the financial statements for more information regarding risks related
to our investments in marketable securities and the impact of our trading
securities on our reported net income.

Acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets also have a significant
impact on the comparability of our results year over year. During the past
three years, we have completed several acquisitions. In comparing Intuit’s
results for the last three fiscal years, readers should note that our
acquisition of Computing Resources, Inc. (“CRI”) in May 1999 had a significant
impact on our financial results, and on the comparability of our results year
over year. Results for fiscal 2000 and 2001 include activity for CRI, while
fiscal 1999 results include only three months of CRI’s activity. See Notes 12
and 13 of the financial statements.

Total Net Revenue

The following total net revenue discussion is categorized by our business
divisions. The table below shows each business division’s percentage of our
total net revenue for each year. Prior year information has been reclassified
to conform to the current year financial presentation for comparability. See

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000

. Total net revenue for fiscal 2001 was
$1,261.5 million, compared to $1,093.8 million in fiscal 2000, representing
growth of 15%. This increase reflected growth in a number of areas, including
a 57% increase in our payroll services business. We were also able to
capitalize on the positive mortgage interest rate environment and experienced
growth in our Quicken Loans Division, which doubled revenue from fiscal 2000.
Our Tax Division also had a strong year with an increase of 19%. Our Web-based
tax return preparation and electronic tax return filing services revenue more
than doubled from fiscal 2000. This was partially offset by a 16% decline in
the Personal Finance Division, which was negatively effected by the declining
demand for online Internet advertising.

Fiscal 2000 Compared to Fiscal 1999

. Total net revenue for fiscal 2000 was
$1,093.8 million, compared to $940.4 million in fiscal 1999, representing
growth of 16%. This growth reflected revenue growth of 35% for the Small
Business Division, 23% for the Personal Finance, and 19% for the Global
Business Division. Partially offsetting this growth was a 39% decline in
revenue for our Quicken Loans Division, which combined our former
QuickenMortgage business and the mortgage business of Rock Financial Corporation (“Rock”). Our acquisition of Rock in December 1999 was accounted for as a
pooling of interests transaction and had a significant negative impact on our
total net revenue growth from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000, because it required
us to include Rock’s pre-acquisition results in both fiscal 1999 and fiscal
2000. See Quicken Loans Division discussion below.



Net Revenue by Business Divisions

The following revenue discussion is categorized by our business divisions,
which is how we examine results internally. Our domestic supplies business is
considered a part of our Small Business Division, while the global supplies
business is considered part of our Global Division.

Small Business Division

Small Business Division revenue is derived primarily
from QuickBooks desktop products, payroll services, financial supplies
products, and the QuickBooks Support Network.

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000

. For fiscal 2001 revenue for the Small
Business Division increased 15% over revenue for fiscal 2000. Revenue from
QuickBooks desktop products remained relatively flat. While we experienced an
increase in the average selling prices for the year, unit sales declined 17%.
This is attributable to the decline in the rate at which existing QuickBooks
customers upgraded to a newer QuickBooks product, as well as the lower
acquisition rate of newer users. We expect continued growth in our Small
Business Division. However, we expect the
QuickBooks revenue growth rate to slow unless we are able to
capitalize on new sources of revenue for our QuickBooks business. See “Risks
That Could Affect Future Results.”

Revenue from our payroll business increased 57% for fiscal 2001 compared to
fiscal 2000. An increase in our average selling prices for both our Basic
Payroll Service and our Deluxe Payroll Service contributed to this growth
resulting from price increases and a shift towards a mix of higher-priced
products. We also added approximately 80,000 customers across our product
lines, which also contributed to this increase. We believe that our payroll
business will continue to provide us with a significant opportunity to generate
recurring revenue in the future. Revenues from our Financial supplies,
QuickBooks Internet Gateway and QuickBooks Support Network also increased in
fiscal 2001.

Fiscal 2000 Compared to Fiscal 1999

. For fiscal 2000 revenue for the Small
Business Division increased 35% over revenue for fiscal 1999. QuickBooks
revenue grew due to higher average selling prices resulting from an improved
mix of higher priced and greater functionality products. While we experienced
solid growth in new users for QuickBooks 2000, the upgrade rate for existing
customers was lower than our historical patterns. Domestic supplies revenues
grew about 13% in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999. Revenue growth resulted
primarily from our decision to charge customers for shipping and handling charges
beginning in August 1999. Our Basic, Deluxe and Premier Payroll Services and
the QuickBooks Support Network also experienced growth in fiscal 2000.

Tax Division

Tax Division revenue is derived primarily from Quicken TurboTax
federal and state consumer desktop tax preparation products, electronic tax
filing services, Quicken TurboTax for the Web online tax preparation services
and ProSeries and Lacerte professional tax preparation products.

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000

. For fiscal 2001, Tax Division revenue
increased approximately 19% compared to fiscal 2000. The Consumer Tax Group
experienced revenue growth of 26% due to a combination of higher average
selling prices resulting from price increases as well as improved product mix
and increased unit sales for both our desktop and Web-based tax preparation
products. Our tax business also benefited from Microsoft’s
discontinuation of its desktop consumer tax preparation software after the calendar 1999 tax season which ended April 15, 2000. Overall,
our consumer tax business added 1.3 million new customers in fiscal 2001. Our
Web-based tax preparation and electronic filing services also experienced
strong growth during the current tax season. Our Web based tax preparation
revenue more than doubled from the prior year as a result of increased prices
as well as a 71% increase in unit volume. In addition, our electronic filing
services revenue increased 53%.

Our professional tax products experienced revenue growth of 10% in fiscal 2001.
This growth resulted from a higher average selling price for both our
ProSeries and Lacerte unlimited-use products and unit growth for our pay-per
return customers. Renewal rates for our existing customer base remained strong
during fiscal 2001.

Fiscal 2000 Compared to Fiscal 1999.

In fiscal 2000, Tax Division revenue
increased approximately 12% compared to fiscal 1999, reflecting growth in all
products and services. While our Quicken TurboTax desktop products experienced
about 18% unit sales growth in fiscal 2000, revenue growth was less than 2%,
due to extremely competitive pricing pressures. We also experienced revenue
increases in fiscal 2000 of 131% for Quicken TurboTax



for the Web and 96% for electronic filing services, compared to fiscal 1999.
In addition, revenue from our professional tax products increased approximately
13% from fiscal 1999. This growth was attributable to a combination of a
continued shift to higher-priced products, increased pay-per-return units,
and growth in our customer base due in part to our acquisitions of Compucraft Tax
Services LLC and TaxByte, Inc. during fiscal 1999.

Personal Finance Division

Personal Finance Division revenue comes primarily
from Quicken desktop products, advertising (both Web-based on Quicken.com, as
well as in-product advertising), and online transactions.

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000

. Revenue from the Personal Finance
Division decreased 16% compared to fiscal 2000. This decline in revenue is
attributable in part to a 27% decline in unit sales for our Quicken desktop
products and a 31% decline in our Internet advertising revenues. Advertising
revenue declined compared to prior the year due to the overall economic
environment which resulted in reduced advertising spending by purchasers of
Internet advertising. We experienced continued
growth in our on-line transaction business, which partially offset
these declines.

Fiscal 2000 Compared to Fiscal 1999.

Fiscal 2000 Personal Finance Division
revenue was up 23% compared to fiscal 1999. Revenue for our Quicken product
line grew approximately 18% compared to fiscal 1999, despite lower average
selling prices. The increase was due to Y2K-driven customer upgrade activity,
aggressive retail promotions in tandem with our tax products and the launch of
the first new Macintosh version since 1998. Advertising and sponsorship
revenues more than doubled from fiscal 1999, due to increased demand from the
growing number of Internet companies, and increased page views, unique visitors
and registered visitors on Quicken.com. Online transactions revenue also grew
more than 20%.

Quicken Loans Division

Quicken Loans Division revenues come primarily from
selling loans and post-closing servicing arrangements in bulk to
participating financial institutions,
and from loan fees for originating loans.

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000

. Revenue for the Quicken Loans Division
increased by 100% from fiscal 2000. The growth was primarily due to two
factors: an increased volume of loans sold driven by the demand to refinance
and originate mortgage loans as a result of declining interest rates; and an
increase in margins earned on loan fees and gains on the sale of loans.
Infrastructure improvements and more efficient processes also enabled us to
capitalize on the mortgage rate environment. While we expect continued growth
in our mortgage business, we do not expect revenue and profit growth rates
experienced by our mortgage business during fiscal 2001 to be sustainable in
the long-term.

Fiscal 2000 Compared to Fiscal 1999

. Mortgage revenue declined approximately
39% from fiscal 1999 to fiscal 2000. The decline was attributable to the
consolidation of branch offices and reallocation of resources from a
traditional branch office-based mortgage business to the online/call center
mortgage business, resulting in a decline in total loan volume in the
transition period. Although total loan volume declined during the transition
period, our revenue per loan increased significantly as we transitioned from
referring customers to participating lenders to managing the entire loan
process. Rising mortgage rates reduced the demand for refinance mortgages.
Deteriorating conditions in the sub-prime lending market also contributed to
the decline in revenue.

Global Business Division

Global Business Division revenues come primarily
from Yayoi small business products in Japan, and QuickBooks, Quicken and
QuickTax products in Canada.

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000

. Global Division Business revenue for
fiscal 2001 increased 4% compared to fiscal 2000. This increase was primarily
due to the overall growth in Canada, which was driven by a 45% growth in
QuickBooks sales. In addition, Canada experienced 14% growth in professional
tax revenue as a result of an acquisition we made earlier in the fiscal year.
Revenue in Japan continued to increase due to higher retail sales of our Yayoi
small business accounting software which was partially offset by declining
sales of QuickBooks. These amounts were offset by an adverse foreign exchange
rate impact that resulted in lower average selling prices in US dollars and
decreased royalties.

Fiscal 2000 Compared to Fiscal 1999.

Global Business Division revenue for
fiscal 2000 increased 19% compared to fiscal 1999. This increase was a result
of favorable currency fluctuations particularly in Japan, as well as increased
sales of the Yayoi small business product in Japan and strong tax product sales
in Canada (due in part to



our acquisition of the assets of CCH’s consumer tax business). Results in all
other countries partially offset these revenue increases, as we experienced
reduced revenue but increased profitability due to a shift from direct
participation in certain markets to licensing arrangements.

There are two components of our cost of revenue. The largest component is the
direct cost of manufacturing and shipping products and offering services, which
includes data center costs relating to delivering Internet-based products and
services. The second component is the amortization of purchased software,
which is the cost of depreciating products or services obtained through
acquisitions over their useful lives.

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000

. For fiscal 2001, cost of revenue
decreased to 26% of total net revenue, compared to 27% for fiscal 2000. The
decline was primarily attributable to improvement in inventory management with
lower excess and obsolete inventory expenses for all our product lines.

Fiscal 2000 Compared to Fiscal 1999.

For fiscal 2000, cost of revenue increased
to 27% of total net revenue, compared to 24% for fiscal 1999. This increase
was primarily attributable to significant increases in hardware and
infrastructure costs for equipment purchases to increase the capacity and
efficiency of our Internet-based operation. These infrastructure costs tend to
reflect the depreciation of capital assets, which are generally expensed evenly
over the estimated useful lives of the assets. In addition, our service
businesses, such as our payroll services and QuickBooks Support Network,
contributed disproportionately to our total net revenue growth in fiscal 2000
and these services generally have higher cost of revenue compared to our
desktop software businesses.

Customer Service and Technical Support

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000.

For fiscal 2001, customer service and
technical support expenses were 12% of total net revenue, compared to 13% in
fiscal 2000. This improvement reflected continued gains in providing customer
service and technical support more efficiently and less expensively through Web
sites and other electronic means, and from the expansion of the QuickBooks
Support Network.

Fiscal 2000 Compared to Fiscal 1999.

For fiscal 2000, customer service and
technical support expenses were 13% of total net revenue, compared to 14% in
fiscal 1999. This improvement reflected our acquisition of our Premier Payroll
Service business from CRI, which experiences comparatively lower customer
service and technical support expenses as a percentage of revenue.

Selling and Marketing

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000

. For fiscal 2001 selling and marketing
expenses were 21% of total net revenue, compared to 24% in fiscal 2000. The
fiscal 2001 decrease was related to the fact that we experienced relatively
higher sales and marketing expenses in the first half of fiscal 2000 due to
aggressive marketing programs relating to the expansion of our Internet-based
businesses and to respond to the extremely competitive consumer tax season with
the entrance and subsequent exit of Microsoft’s TaxSaver product. Advertising
expenses declined from $57.9 million in fiscal 2000 to $40.3 million in fiscal
2001. In fiscal 2001 our payroll business and Quicken Loans Division
experienced relatively lower marketing expenditures as they continue to benefit
from the marketing value of the Intuit brand.

Fiscal 2000 Compared to Fiscal 1999.

For fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999 selling
and marketing expenses were 24% of total net revenue. Selling and marketing
expenses increased for some of our small business products and services, and
well as for our Global Business Division. These increases were partially
offset by decreases in selling and marketing expenses for our payroll business
and Quicken Loans, which we reduced to allow more focus on process improvements
for those businesses.

Research and Development

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000

. For fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 research
and development expenses were 16% of total net revenue. In both fiscal 2001
and 2000, we invested significant amounts in our emerging services businesses,
mostly focused in our Small Business Division. This included research and
development efforts for QuickBooks for the Web, our online Deluxe Payroll
Service, our QuickBase information management tool and the Intuit Developer
Network. During fiscal 2002, we expect to continue significant investments in
research and development, particularly for our electronic tax offerings and
new small business products and services.

Fiscal 2000 Compared to Fiscal 1999

. Research and development expenses were
16% of total net revenue for fiscal 2000, compared to 15% for fiscal 1999.
During fiscal 2000, our primary research and development efforts were in the
Small Business Division, with significant investments in the QuickBooks
Internet Gateway, Site Solutions and the QuickBooks Deluxe payroll service.
Fiscal 1999 research and development efforts were focused on our electronic tax
offerings.

General and Administrative

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000

. General and administrative expenses were
8% of total net revenue for fiscal 2001 and 2000. During fiscal 2001, we experienced an increase in
our bad debt expense related to the economic downturn of the high technology
industry. Included in our general and administrative expense for
fiscal 2001 was $2.5 million in deferred compensation amortization
expense related to restricted stock
granted in connection with our hiring of a new President and Chief
Executive Officer in January 2000.

Fiscal 2000 Compared to Fiscal 1999.

General and administrative expenses in
fiscal 2000 were approximately 8% of total net revenue, compared to 9% for
fiscal 1999. The improvement was primarily a result of management being



able to leverage our existing infrastructure to keep the growth in these
expenses at a lower rate than our total net revenue growth. In addition,
fiscal 1999 expenses included an increase in the reserve for doubtful accounts
of approximately $3 million relating to a financially weak distributor.
Included in our general and administrative expense for fiscal 2000 was $1.3 million
in deferred compensation amortization expense related to the
restricted stock grant
in January 2000.

Charge for Purchased Research and Development

Fiscal 2001, Fiscal 2000 and Fiscal 1999

. In fiscal 2001, we recorded charges
of $0.2 million for purchased research and development as a result of our
acquisition of Tax and Accounting Software Corporation (“TAASC”). During
fiscal 2000, we recorded $1.3 million for purchased research and development as
a result of our Boston Light Software Corporation (“Boston Light”) and
Hutchison Avenue Software Corporation (“Hutchison”) acquisitions. We did not
incur a charge for purchased research and development in fiscal 1999. In
connection with these acquisitions and with the assistance of third-party
appraisers, we determined the value of in-process projects under development
for which technological feasibility had not been established. The value of the
projects was determined by estimating the costs to develop the in-process
technology into commercially feasible products, estimating the net cash flows
we believed would result from the products and discounting these net cash flows
back to their present value.

Acquisition-Related Charges

Acquisition-related charges include the amortization of goodwill and purchased
intangible assets, deferred compensation expenses arising from acquisitions,
and impairment charges. See Note 6 of the financial statements.

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000

. For
fiscal 2001 acquisition-related
charges were $248.2 million, compared to $157.9 million in fiscal 2000. The
increase was primarily attributable to an impairment charge of $78.7 million
recorded in the second half of fiscal 2001. During our review for impairment,
events and circumstances indicated possible impairment of our long-lived assets
related to our acquisitions of Venture Finance Software Corp. (“VFSC”),
SecureTax.com (“SecureTax”) and Hutchison (which consist principally of
acquired intangible assets and goodwill.) These indicators included the
deterioration in the business climate for Web-based companies, and management’s
intentions relating to continuation of certain services provided by our Personal Finance
Division. We measured the impairment loss related to long-lived assets based
on the amount by which the carrying amount of such assets exceeded their fair
values. Our measurement of fair value was based on an analysis of the future
discounted cash flows. In performing this analysis, we used the best
information available under the circumstances, including reasonable and supportable
assumptions and projections. The discounted cash flow analysis considered the
likelihood of possible outcomes and was based on our best estimate of projected
future cash flows, including terminal value cash flows expected to result from
the disposition of the assets at the end of their useful lives. Based on our
analysis we recorded impairment charges of $51.0 million,
$26.0 million and $1.7 million associated with VFSC, SecureTax and Hutchison, respectively.

Fiscal 2000 Compared to Fiscal 1999.

Acquisition-related charges increased to
$157.9 million in fiscal 2000, compared to $92.9 million in fiscal 1999. The
increase was attributable to the amortization of intangible assets associated
with our acquisitions of CRI in May 1999, of Boston Light, SecureTax and
Hutchison in August 1999, and of Turning Mill Software, Inc. (“Turning Mill”)
in November 1999.

Reorganization Costs

Fiscal 2001, Fiscal 2000 and Fiscal 1999.

During fiscal 2001, we did not incur
any reorganization costs. For fiscal 2000 reorganization costs were $3.5
million compared to $2.0 million in fiscal 1999. These reorganization costs
were associated with our Quicken Loans subsidiary (formerly Rock) closing
numerous branch offices in Michigan as it began to transition its mortgage
business from a traditional branch-based business to an online and call
center-based business.



Non-Operating Income and Expenses

Interest and Other Income and Expense, Net

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000.

In fiscal 2001, interest and other income
and expense, net, increased to $60.4 million, compared to $48.4 million in
fiscal 2000 despite a decline in interest rates. This resulted from higher
average cash and short-term investment balances during fiscal 2001, due in part
to sales of marketable securities as well as cash generated from operations.
Interest earned on customer payroll deposits and mortgage loans held for
resale, as well as interest expense on lines of credit used for our mortgage
business are reported as, or offset, revenue for our payroll and mortgage
businesses, and are not included in interest and other income.

Fiscal 2000 Compared to Fiscal 1999.

In fiscal 2000, interest and other income
and expense, net, increased to $48.4 million, compared to $18.3 million in
fiscal 1999. The increase resulted from increased cash and short-term
investment balances resulting primarily from our sales of marketable
securities, as well as higher interest rates.

Gain (Loss) from Marketable Securities and Other Investments, Net

We consider our shares of Excite@Home and 724 Solutions common stock to be
trading securities. See Note 3 of the financial statements. As a result,
unrealized gains (or losses) due to market fluctuations in these securities are
included in our net income on a quarterly basis. Recent volatility in the
market has significantly reduced the value of our trading securities. We
expect to be impacted by this volatility as long as we hold these securities.
See “Risks That Could Affect Future Results.”

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000

. During fiscal 2001, we recorded a pre-tax
net loss relating to marketable securities and other investments of $98.1
million compared to a pre-tax net gain of $481.1 million during fiscal 2000. Our
fiscal 2001 net loss included impairment charges totaling $68.8 million
relating to some of our private and publicly held investments and a $40.0
million charge for the decline in valuation of our trading securities. The
majority of our fiscal 2001 gains of $10.7 million, net of taxes, resulted from
dispositions of marketable securities.

Fiscal 2000 Compared to Fiscal 1999.

We recorded pre-tax net gains relating to
marketable securities of $481.1 million in fiscal 2000 and $579.2 million in
fiscal 1999. Our fiscal 2000 net gains resulted primarily from dispositions of
Checkfree, Signio (now VeriSign) and Homestore.com common stock. Our fiscal
1999 net gains resulted primarily from sales of Excite@Home, Signio and
Concentric common stock, and the gain from converting our Excite common stock
to Excite@Home common stock in connection with At Home Corporation’s
acquisition of Excite.

Net Loss on Divestitures

During fiscal 2001 we recorded a pre-tax net loss of $15.3 million resulting
from divestitures of businesses. During the second quarter of fiscal 2001 we
realized a pre-tax net gain of $1.6 million for the sale of certain assets of
our wholly owned subsidiary, Intuit Insurance Services, Inc., which operated
our Quicken Insurance business. The gain was offset by a pre-tax net loss of
$16.9 million for the sale of the technology assets of our Quicken Bill Manager
business, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001.

Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes

Fiscal 2001, Fiscal 2000 and Fiscal 1999.

For fiscal 2001 we recorded an
income tax benefit of $0.2 million on a pretax loss of $96.5 million,
resulting in an effective tax rate of (0.2%). For fiscal 2000, we recorded an
income tax provision of $207.2 million on a pretax income of $512.7 million,
resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 40.4%. For fiscal 1999, we
recorded an income tax provision of $245.5 million on pretax income of $632.0
million, resulting in an effective income tax rate of approximately 38.8%. The
difference in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2001 from fiscal 2000 and 1999,
was primarily due to the tax effect of non-deductible merger-related
charges.

As of July 31, 2001, we had net deferred tax assets of $223.8 million, which
included a valuation allowance of $11.4 million for net operating loss
carryforwards relating to our international subsidiaries. The allowance
reflects management’s assessment that we may not receive the benefit of certain
loss carryforwards of our international



subsidiaries. While we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient,
it may be necessary to increase this amount if it becomes more likely that a
greater portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. We assess
the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis.
See Note 22 of the financial statements.

Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change

During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we recorded a cumulative gain of $14.3
million, net of taxes, as a result of a change in accounting principle that
required us to recognize the cumulative effect of the increase in the fair
value of our S1 options as of August 1, 2000. See Note 3 of the financial
statements. Subsequent fluctuations in the fair value of these options will
also be included in our net income or net loss.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At July 31, 2001 our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled
$1,569.4 million, a $102.2 million increase from July 31, 2000.

Our operations provided $233.2 million in cash during fiscal 2001. Primary
components of cash from operations were net income adjustments made for
non-cash expenses. These adjustments included acquisition related charges
totaling $248.2 million and a net loss on marketable securities and other
investments of $98.1 million. Offsetting these adjustments was a cumulative
effect of an accounting change for $(14.3) million, net of taxes and an
increase in our deferred income tax benefit. In addition, our accounts
receivable and draft payables balances generated a combined $79.8 million to
cash from operations. This was partially offset by the increase in our prepaid
and other current assets and mortgage loans, which was primarily the result of
fluctuations in the timing of our expenses and the closing of loans.

Investing activities used $283.3 million in cash during fiscal 2001. The
primary use of cash was for business acquisitions, which included VFSC and
TAASC. As part of our continuing internal investment in information systems
and infrastructure for our emerging businesses, we purchased $77.1 million of
property and equipment including $12.7 million of capitalized internally
developed software. In connection with our acquisition of CRI in May 1999, we
paid two annual installments of $25 million in May of 2000 and 2001. A third
installment is due in May 2002.

Financing activities provided $80.7 million during fiscal 2001, primarily
attributable to proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock
purchase and option plans. This was partially offset by the use of $8.4
million for our stock repurchase program.

We currently hold investments in a number of publicly traded companies. See
Note 3 of the financial statements. The volatility of the stock market and the
potential risk of fluctuating stock prices may have an impact on the proceeds
from future sales of these securities and therefore on our future liquidity.
Due to our reporting of the Excite@Home and 724 Solutions shares as trading
securities, future fluctuations in the carrying values of these securities will
impact our earnings. See Note 3 of the financial statements. If future
declines in our other marketable securities are deemed to be permanent, they
will also impact our earnings.

In the normal course of business, we enter into leases for new or expanded
facilities in both domestic and global locations. We also evaluate, on an
ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or
establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. We
may decide to use cash and cash equivalents to fund such activities in the
future. In May 2001, Intuit’s Board of Directors authorized the company to
repurchase up to $500.0 million of common stock over a
three-year period. At July 31, 2001, there was
$491.6 million of common stock remaining under the repurchase
authorization.

We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be
sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital and capital expenditure
requirements for at least the next twelve months.



Recent Accounting Pronouncements

On June 29, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (SFAS 141),
“

Business Combinations,

” and
No. 142 (SFAS 142), “

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

.”

SFAS 141 supersedes APB Opinion No. 16,

“Business Combinations,”

and eliminates
the pooling-of-interests method of accounting for business combinations, thus
requiring that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method.
In addition, in applying the purchase method, SFAS 141 changes the criteria for
recognizing intangible assets apart from goodwill and states the following
criteria should be considered in determining the recognition of the intangible
assets: (1) the intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights,
or (2) the intangible asset is separable or dividable from the acquired entity
and capable of being sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged. The
requirements of SFAS 141 are effective for all business combinations completed
after June 30, 2001.

SFAS 142 supercedes APB Opinion No. 17,

“Intangible Assets,”

and requires
goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life to no
longer be amortized. However, these assets must be reviewed at least annually
for impairment. Application of SFAS 142 is required immediately for business
combinations completed after June 30, 2001. However, for transactions completed
prior to July 1, 2001, we may elect to adopt SFAS 142 effective either
August 1, 2001 or August 1, 2002. This election must be made prior to the
issuance of our financial statements for the quarter ending October 31, 2001.
Due to the complexity of this new standard and its recent issuance,
we have decided to adopt SFAS 142 effective August 1, 2002. We are currently
evaluating the impact of FAS 142 on our financial position and statement of
operations.

RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

Company-Wide Factors That Could Affect Future Results

Our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal, which causes significant
quarterly fluctuations in our revenue and net income.

Several of our
businesses are highly seasonal — particularly our tax business, but also small
business and personal finance to a lesser extent. This causes significant
quarterly fluctuations in our financial results. Revenue and operating results
are usually strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending
January 31 and April 30. We experience lower revenues, and often significant
operating losses, in the first and fourth quarters ending October 31 and July
31.

Acquisition-related costs can cause significant fluctuation in our net income.

Our recent acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses, including
amortization of purchased software (which is reflected in cost of revenue), as
well as charges for in-process research and development and amortization of
goodwill, purchased intangibles and deferred compensation (which are reflected
in operating expenses). Total acquisition-related costs in the categories
identified above were $100.7 million in fiscal 1999, $168.1 million in fiscal
2000 and $263.4 million in fiscal 2001 (including a charge of $78.7 million in
fiscal 2001 to write down the long-lived intangible assets related to the
recent acquisitions of VFSC, SecureTax and
Hutchison). Additional acquisitions, and any additional impairment of the
value of purchased assets, could have a significant negative impact on future
operating results.

Gains and losses related to marketable
securities and other investments can cause significant
fluctuations in our net income.

Our investment activities have had a
significant impact on our net income. We recorded pre-tax net gains from
marketable securities and other investments of $579.2 million in fiscal 1999
and $481.1 million in fiscal 2000 and a pre-tax net loss of $98.1 million in
fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2000 and 2001 decreases in the market prices of our
trading securities have resulted in significant reductions in our pre-tax
income. Future price fluctuations in trading securities, and any significant
long-term declines in value of other securities, could reduce our net income in
future periods.

Recent changes to Financial Accounting Standards Board guidelines relating to
accounting for goodwill could make our acquisition-related charges less
predictable in any given reporting period.

The FASB recently adopted a new



standard for accounting for goodwill acquired in a business combination. It
continues to require recognition of goodwill as an asset but does not permit
amortization of goodwill as previously required. Under the new statement,
goodwill is separately tested for impairment using a fair-value-based approach
when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. Any required
goodwill impairment charges will be presented as a separate line item within
the operating section of the income statement. The shift from an amortization
approach to an impairment approach applies to previously recorded goodwill as
well as goodwill arising from acquisitions completed after adoption of the new
standard. When we adopt the new standard, our goodwill amortization charges
will cease. However, it is possible that in the future, we would incur less
frequent, but larger, impairment charges related to the goodwill already
recorded as well as goodwill arising out of future acquisitions as we continue
to expand our business. We currently expect to adopt the new standard
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2003.

A general decline in economic conditions could lead to reduced demand for our
products and services.

The recent downturn in general economic conditions has
led to reduced demand for a variety of goods and services, including many
technology products, and we believe the economic decline has been partially
responsible for slower than expected growth in our Small Business Division
during fiscal 2001. If conditions continue to decline, or fail to improve, in
geographic areas that are significant to us, such as the United States, Canada
and Japan, we could see a significant decrease in the overall demand for our
products and services that could harm our operating results.

If we do not continue to successfully develop new products and services in a
timely manner, our future financial results will suffer.

We believe that it is
necessary to continually develop new products and services and to improve
existing products and services to remain competitive in the markets we serve.
Failure to do so may give competitors opportunities to improve their
competitive position at our expense, and result in declines in our revenue and
earnings. However, development and improvement of products and services is a
complex process involving several risks. Hiring and retaining highly qualified
technical employees is critical to the success of our development efforts, and
we face intense competition for these employees. Launches of products and
services can be delayed for a variety of reasons. New or improved products and
services may also have “bugs” that hinder performance. Third party products we
incorporate in, or use to build and support, our products and services, may
also contain defects that impair performance. These problems can be expensive
to fix and can also result in higher technical support costs and lost
customers. New products or features are sometimes built on top of older
architectures or infrastructures, which can take longer to get to
market, make
quality assurance and support more difficult, and lead to complexity in
supporting future functionality.

If we do not continue to successfully refine and update the business and
operating models for our expanding range of products and services, including
Internet-based and other emerging service businesses, and continue to improve
the operational support for these businesses, the businesses will not achieve
sustainable financial viability or broad customer acceptance.

Our business
models for our expanding range of products and services, including
Internet-based businesses and other emerging service businesses, rely
on more
complex and varied revenue streams than our traditional desktop software
businesses. For these businesses to become and remain economically viable, we
must continually refine their business and operating models to reflect evolving
economic circumstances. These businesses also depend on a different
operational infrastructure than our desktop software businesses, and we must
continually develop, expand and modify our internal systems and procedures to
support these businesses, including call center, customer management, order
management, billing and other systems. In particular, our Web-based tax
preparation and electronic filing services must effectively handle extremely
heavy customer demand during the peak tax season. If we are unable to meet
customer expectations in a cost-effective manner, we could lose customers,
receive negative publicity, and incur increased operating costs, which could
have a significant negative impact on the financial and market success of these
businesses. Despite our efforts to maintain continuous and reliable operations
at our data center, like all providers of Internet-based products and services,
we occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties.
Lengthy and/or frequent service outages — particularly for services that
customers consider time-sensitive — can result in negative publicity, damage to
our reputation and loss of customers.

Despite our efforts to adequately staff and equip our customer service and
technical support operations, we cannot always respond promptly to customer
requests for assistance.

We occasionally experience customer service and
support problems, including longer than expected “hold” times when our staffing
is inadequate to handle higher than anticipated call volume, and a large number
of inquiries from customers checking on the status of product orders when the
timing of shipments fails to meet customer expectations. This can adversely
affect customer relationships



and our financial performance. In order to improve our customer service and
technical support, we must continue to focus on eliminating underlying causes
of service and support calls (through product improvements and better order
fulfillment processes), and on more accurately anticipating demand for customer
service and technical support.

We face risks relating to customer privacy and security and increasing
regulation, which could hinder the growth of our businesses.

Despite our
efforts to address customer concerns about privacy and security, these issues
still pose a significant risk, and we have experienced lawsuits and negative
publicity relating to privacy issues. For example, during fiscal 2000 and
fiscal 2001, there were press articles criticizing our privacy and security
practices as they relate to the connectivity of our desktop software to our Web
sites. We have faced lawsuits and negative press alleging that we improperly
shared information about customers with third party “ad servers” for our Web
sites. A major breach of customer privacy or security by Intuit, or even by
another company, could have serious consequences for our businesses —
particularly our Internet businesses — including reduced customer interest
and/or additional regulation by federal or state agencies. In addition,
mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols have been developed by
the federal government, and we have incurred significant expenses to comply
with these requirements. Additional similar federal and state laws may be
passed in the future, and the cost of complying with additional legislation
could have a negative impact on our operating results. If Internet use does
not grow as a result of privacy or security concerns, increasing regulation or
for other reasons, the growth of our Internet-based businesses would be
hindered.

We face challenges in maintaining adequate access to retail distribution
channels.

We face ongoing challenges in negotiating financially favorable
terms with retailers. Any termination or significant disruption of our
relationship with any of our major distributors or retailers, or a significant
unanticipated reduction in sales volume attributable to any of our principal
resellers, could result in a significant decline in our net revenue. Also,
any financial difficulties of our retailers or distributors could have an
adverse effect on our operating expenses if uncollectable amounts from them
exceed the bad debt reserves we have established.

We rely on two third party vendors to handle all outsourced aspects of our
primary retail desktop software product launches.

For manufacturing and
distributing our primary retail products at the time of product launches, we
have an exclusive manufacturing relationship with Modus Media, and an exclusive
distribution arrangement with Ingram Micro Logistics. While we believe that
relying on only two outsourcers for our primary retail product launches
improves the efficiency and reliability of our product launches, reliance on
any vendor for a significant aspect of our business can have severe negative
consequences if the vendor fails to perform for any reason.

Actual product returns may exceed return reserves.

We ship more desktop
products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell, in
order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers will run out of
products. This is particularly true for our tax products, which have a short
selling season. Like most software companies, we have a liberal product return
policy and we have historically accepted significant product returns. We
establish reserves for product returns in our financial statements, based on
estimated future returns of products. We closely monitor levels of product
sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain reserves
that are adequate to cover expected returns. In the past, returns have not
generally exceeded these reserves. However, if we do experience actual returns
that significantly exceed reserves, it would result in lower net revenue.

Our recent acquisitions have resulted in business integration challenges.

Our
recent acquisitions have expanded our product and service offerings, personnel
and geographic locations. Integrating and organizing acquired businesses
creates challenges for our operational, financial and management information
systems, as well as for our product development processes. If we do not
adequately address issues presented by growth through acquisitions, we may not
fully realize the intended benefits (including financial benefits) of these
acquisitions.

We face existing and potential government regulation in many of our businesses,
which can increase our costs and hinder the growth of our businesses.

Our
Internet-based products and services are available in many states and foreign
countries. As a result, we may be subject to regulation and/or taxation in
many additional jurisdictions, which could substantially slow commercial use of
the Internet and growth of our Internet-based businesses. We offer several
regulated products and services through separate subsidiary corporations.
Establishing and maintaining regulated subsidiaries requires significant
financial, legal and management resources. If the subsidiaries fail to



comply with applicable regulations, they could face liability to customers
and/or penalties and sanctions by government regulators.

Legal protection for our intellectual property is not always effective to
prevent unauthorized use.

We rely on a combination of copyright, patent,
trademark and trade secret laws, and employee and third-party nondisclosure and
license agreements, to protect our software products and other proprietary
technology. Current U.S. laws that prohibit copying give us only limited
practical protection from software “pirates,” and the laws of many other
countries provide very little protection. Policing unauthorized use of our
products is difficult, expensive and time-consuming and anti-copy protections
may decrease product ease of use and performance. We expect that software
piracy will be a persistent problem for our desktop software products. In
addition, the Internet may tend to increase, and provide new methods for,
illegal copying of the technology used in our desktop and Internet-based
products and services.

We do not own all of the software and other technologies used in our products
and services.

We have the licenses from third parties that we believe are
necessary for using technology that we do not own in our current products and
services. From time to time it may be necessary to renegotiate with these
third parties for inclusion of their technology in existing products, in new
versions of our current products or in new products. Third party licenses may
not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. Other parties occasionally
claim that features or content of our products, or our use of trademarks, may
infringe their proprietary rights. Past claims have not resulted in any
significant litigation, settlement or licensing expenses, but future claims
could. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future,
and claims could result in costly litigation, require us to redesign one or
more of our products or services, require us to obtain a license to
intellectual property rights of third parties or perhaps to cease marketing
affected products and services. Third party licenses may not be available on
reasonable terms, or at all.

The stock market has experienced price volatility that has particularly
affected technology companies.

Market fluctuations have adversely affected our
stock price in the past and may do so in the future. Some of the volatility
has resulted from factors such as the seasonality and quarterly fluctuations in
our revenue and operating results, announcements of technical innovations,
acquisitions or strategic relationships by Intuit or its competitors, changes
in earnings estimates by analysts and changes in market conditions in the
computer hardware and software industries. However, volatility may also be
unrelated to our operating performance or the business environment in which we
operate.

Our ability to conduct business could be impacted by a variety of factors such
as electrical power interruptions, earthquakes, fires, terrorist activities and
other similar events.

Our business operations depend on the efficient and
uninterrupted operation of a large number of computer and communications
hardware and software systems. These systems are vulnerable to damage or
interruption from electrical power interruptions, telecommunication failures,
earthquakes, fires, floods, terrorist activities and their aftermath, and other
similar events. Recently, electrical power in certain locations in California
has been interrupted for short periods of time in the form of “rolling
blackouts.” To date, our business operations have not been materially impacted
by these outages. However, it is possible that rolling blackouts will continue
in the foreseeable future and our facilities could be significantly affected in
the future. Other unpredictable events could also impact our ability to
continue our business operations. For example, the recent terrorist attacks on
New York City and Washington, D.C. and the aftermath of those attacks may have
an unpredictable negative impact on our business activities. For our
Internet-based services, system failures of our internal server
operations or those of various third-party service
providers, including Web site operators, could result in interruption in our
services to our customers. Any significant interruptions in our ability to
conduct our business operations could reduce our revenue and operating income.
Our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for the
impact of interruptions to our business operations.

Factors Relating to
Competition

We face competitive pressures in all of our businesses, which can have a
negative impact on our revenue, profitability and market position.

There are
formidable current and potential competitors in the private sector, and we also
face potential competition from publicly-funded government entities seeking to
enter private markets in the United States for consumer electronic financial
services. Accordingly, we expect competition to remain intense during fiscal
2002 and beyond. In all our businesses, we face continual risks that
competitors will introduce better



products and services, reduce prices, gain better access to distribution
channels, increase advertising (including advertising targeted at Intuit
customers), and release new products and services before we do. Any of these
competitive actions (particularly any prolonged price competition) could result
in lower net revenue and/or lower profitability for Intuit. They could also
affect our ability to keep existing customers and acquire new customers, which
is particularly important for our Internet-based products and services.

In the small business area, we face a wide range of competitive risks that
could impact our financial results.

Our desktop and Web-based accounting
software products and services face current competition from other desktop
software, as well as other Web-based accounting products. Microsoft Great
Plains recently announced that it will be launching a new accounting and
payroll product for small businesses that is targeted at similar size customers
as QuickBooks and QuickBooks for the Web. Other competitors and potential
competitors have begun providing, or have expressed significant interest in
providing, accounting and business management products and services to small
businesses. For example, Microsoft’s bCentral offers a variety of Web-enabled
small business services. In online payroll, the competitive landscape is
changing quickly and we could lose some competitive advantage if other
companies begin offering online payroll services that integrate with desktop
and/or Web-based accounting software. Our financial supplies business
continues to experience pricing pressures from many of our competitors. While
we have been able to offset some of the impact of price competition by
improving operational efficiencies and customer service, ongoing price
pressures could result in lower revenue and profitability for our supplies
business.

We face competitive pressures in our tax businesses, particularly our consumer
tax preparation software business, which can have a negative impact on our
revenue, profitability and market position.

Recent tax seasons
have been extremely competitive. There are formidable current and potential competitors
in the private sector, and we also face potential competition from
publicly-funded government entities seeking to enter private markets in the
United States for consumer electronic financial services. Accordingly, we
expect competition to remain intense during fiscal 2002 and beyond.

Our personal finance products face aggressive competition that could limit
future growth.

Our Quicken products compete directly with Microsoft Money,
which is aggressively promoted and priced. We expect competitive pressures for
Quicken to continue, both from Microsoft Money, and from Web-based personal
finance tracking and management tools that are becoming increasingly available
at no cost to consumers. We expect these pressures will result in reduced
revenue and could result in lower profitability for our Quicken product line.
There are many competitors for our Internet-based personal finance products and
services. The number of competitors has increased in recent years as more
companies expand their businesses onto the Internet. However, the general
downturn in Internet and technology stocks since March 2000 has resulted in
significant consolidation, with fewer, but more financially sound, competitors
surviving. This could make it more difficult for us to compete effectively.

Products and services offered to consumers by government agencies may
increasingly overlap with products and services offered by Intuit and others in
the private sector, and could have a significant negative impact on our future
financial results.

Government agencies are increasingly using public funds to
offer commercial products and services to consumers that are duplicative of
those provided by private sector companies, including Intuit. For example,
some federal and state tax agencies have begun to expand their mission by
offering individual taxpayers electronic tax preparation and filing services
similar to those currently offered by Intuit and others at a low cost. In
addition, a growing number of firms are providing Web-based tax filing services
at no cost to lower income taxpayers through public service initiatives, such
as Intuit’s Quicken Tax Freedom Project, offering additional competition.
Although some governmental agencies have begun taking steps to reverse this
trend by abandoning previous plans to provide electronic commerce products and
services, future administrative, regulatory or legislative activity in this
area could adversely impact Intuit and other companies that provide software
and electronic financial services. Intuit is actively working with others in
the private sector, as well as with federal and state government officials, to
help clarify the appropriate role for government agencies in the electronic
commerce marketplace.

Specific Factors Affecting Our
Small Business Division

If we are unable to capitalize on new sources of revenue for our QuickBooks
business, the business will not be able to achieve sustained growth.

Sales of
our QuickBooks desktop product for fiscal 2001 were lower than expected, due to
lower upgrade sales to existing customers compared to fiscal 2000, as well as
lower than expected sales to



new customers. We cannot rely solely on these sources of revenue to provide
sustainable future growth for our Small Business Division. We must generate
revenue from broader markets and customer segments as well as from new products
and services.

Our employer services business faces a number of risks that could limit future
growth.

For our employer services, we must be able to process employee data
accurately, reliably and in a timely manner in order to attract and retain
customers and avoid the costs associated with errors. For example, if we make
errors in providing accurate and timely payroll information, cash deposits or
tax return filings, we face potential liability to customers, additional
expense to correct product errors and loss of customers. For our
Internet-based offerings (including our Deluxe and online Basic payroll), we
must also continue to improve our operations to provide reliable connectivity
to our data centers to enable customers to transmit and receive data. In order
to expand the customer base for our Deluxe and Premier payroll services, we
must continue to focus on streamlining the service activation process for new
customers. For employer services currently under development, we face a risk
of potential delays in technology development. We also face the risk that we
may not be able to successfully cross-sell employee administration products and
services to the existing base of QuickBooks customers.

Specific Factors Affecting our
Tax Division

Significant problems or delays in the development of our tax products would
result in lost revenue and customers.

The development of tax preparation
software presents a unique challenge because of the demanding annual
development cycle required to incorporate unpredictable tax law changes each
year. The rigid development timetable increases the risk of errors in the
products and the risk of launch delays. Any major defects could lead to
negative publicity, customer dissatisfaction and incremental operating expenses
- including expenses resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and
interest paid by consumer customers due solely to calculation errors in our
products. A late product launch could cause our current and prospective
customers to choose a competitor’s product for that year’s tax season or to
choose not to purchase tax preparation software. This would result in lost
revenue in the current year and would make it more difficult for us to sell our
products to those customers in future tax seasons.

If we fail to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our
electronic tax offerings, we could lose revenue and customers.

Our online tax
preparation and electronic tax filing services face significant challenges in
maintaining high service levels, particularly during peak volume service times.
For example, we have experienced relatively brief unscheduled interruptions in
our electronic filing/and or tax preparation services during fiscal 1999, 2000
and 2001. We do not believe any prior service outages had a material financial
impact, prevented customers from completing and filing their returns in a
timely manner, or posed a risk that customer data would be lost or corrupted.
However, we did experience negative publicity in some instances. The exact
level of demand for Quicken TurboTax for the Web and electronic filing is
impossible to predict, and we could experience adverse financial and public
relations consequences if these services are unavailable for an extended period
of time, or late in the tax season, due to technical difficulties or other
reasons.

Specific Factors Affecting our
Personal Finance Division

The long-term viability of our Quicken.com Web site will depend on our ability
to provide products and services that attract customers and advertisers,
develop alternative revenue sources, and ensure reliable operation of
the site.

Growth in customers and traffic is important for our Quicken.com site and its
ability to generate advertising revenue, but traffic can vary significantly
from month to month due to seasonal trends, site performance, performance of
the major stock market indices, economic trends and other factors. Monthly
Quicken.com page views have varied dramatically over the past two years, from
approximately 150 million in September 1999, to a peak of over 300 million in
March 2000, back down to about 140 million in July 2001. In addition, the
demand for Internet advertising has declined significantly during the past 18
months. We must identify and capitalize on additional sources of revenue to
provide sustainable future growth. Our Quicken.com operations are currently
dependent on hosting services provided to us by Excite@Home, which recently
filed for bankruptcy. We are taking steps to transition these hosting
operations to our in-house data center. This will reduce in the short term,
and eventually eliminate, our operational dependency on Excite@Home. However,
this transition could involve major disruption to the Quicken.com service,
depending on how quickly the transition needs to be completed. If Excite@Home
ceases



to provide hosting services before we are able to complete a transition, our
contract with them gives us the right to run their hosting operations for
Quicken.com, but there can be no assurance that we could enforce that right.
In addition, due to the constantly evolving business environment in which we
operate, and the changing priorities and economic circumstances of Intuit and
our business allies, we have been, and may continue to be, required to adapt
some of our other third party relationships in ways that are less attractive to
us (financially or otherwise) and/or establish new relationships.

Specific Factors Affecting our
Quicken Loans Division

It is unlikely that the revenue and profit growth rates experienced by our
mortgage business during fiscal 2001 will be sustainable long-term, either on a
year-over-year basis or on a sequential quarter basis.

Mortgage rate
increases, the impact of the economic climate on the housing market, business
operation risks and other factors could result in significantly lower revenue
and profit growth for our mortgage business. Increases in mortgage interest
rates and other interest rates adversely affected our mortgage business during
fiscal 2000, contributing to a significant revenue decline from fiscal 1999 to
fiscal 2000. Conversely, declines in mortgage interest rates during fiscal
2001 had a positive impact on revenue. If mortgage rates rise again, this
could negatively impact the volume of applications and closed loans,
particularly our most mortgage-rate sensitive products such as conventional
refinancing loans. Fluctuations in non-mortgage rates also create risks with
respect to the loans on our balance sheet and impact our cost of funds to
provide loans. In addition, our ability to successfully streamline the online
application, approval, and closing process will have a significant impact on
our ability to attract customers to our mortgage service, and on our ability to
continue increasing the percentage of our mortgage revenue generated through
the online channel compared to branch offices. We must also maintain
relationships with certain banks and other third parties who we rely on to
provide access to capital, and later, purchase and service the loans. If we
are unable to maintain key relationships, or if the terms of key relationships
change to be less favorable to Intuit, it could have a negative impact on our
mortgage business and on Intuit’s financial results.

Specific Factors Affecting our Global Business Division

Business conditions in international markets, other risks inherent in global
operations, and changes in our business model in Europe, may negatively impact
our financial performance.

Conducting business globally involves many risks,
including potential volatility in the political and economic conditions of
foreign countries; difficulties in managing operations in different locations
(including hiring and retaining management personnel); a product development
process that is often more time-consuming and costly than in the U.S. due in
part to “localization” requirements; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates; and unanticipated changes in foreign regulatory requirements. For
example, the economic situation in Japan had a negative impact on global
revenue and profits during recent fiscal years. In addition, the shift in our
business model in Germany has led to declining revenues for us in the markets
we serve through a distribution arrangement.



ITEM 7A

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We do not hold derivative financial instruments in our short-term investment
portfolio. Our short-term investments consist of instruments that meet quality
standards consistent with our investment policy. This policy dictates that,
for short-term investments, we diversify our holdings and limit our short-term
investments with any individual issuer in a managed portfolio to a maximum of
$5 million. The following table of our short-term investments portfolio is
classified by the original maturity date listed on the security:

Marketable Securities

We carried significant balances in marketable equity securities as of July 31,
2001. These securities are subject to considerable market risk due to their
volatility. Fluctuations in the carrying value of our shares of Excite@Home
and 724 Solutions will have an immediate impact on our earnings because we
report these shares as trading securities. If our available-for-sale securities
experience further declines in fair value that are considered other than
temporary, we will reflect the additional loss in our net income in the period
when the subsequent impairment becomes apparent. See Note 3 of the financial
statements for more information regarding risks related to our investments in
marketable securities and the impact of our trading securities on our reported
net income.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk represents a component of market risk to us and represents
the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes
in our net income and in the value of our interest rate sensitive assets,
liabilities and commitments, particularly those that relate to our mortgage and
payroll businesses. In a higher interest rate environment, borrower demand for
mortgage loans generally declines, adversely affecting our mortgage loan
business. Interest rate movements also affect the interest income earned on
loans we hold for sale in the secondary market, interest expense on our lines
of credit, the value of our mortgage loans and ultimately the gain or loss on
the sale of those mortgage loans. In addition, interest rate movements affect
the interest income earned on investments we hold in our short-term investment
portfolio and the value of those investments.

As part of our risk management programs, we enter into financial agreements and
purchase financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage our
exposure to interest rate risk with respect to our conventional mortgage loans
and our government-insured loans (together, “Prime Loans”), but not with
respect to our sub-prime loans or home equity lines of credit. We use these
financial agreements and financial instruments for the explicit purpose of
managing interest rate risks to protect the value of our mortgage loan
portfolio and not for trading purposes.

We actively monitor and manage our exposure to interest rate risk on Prime
Loans, which is incurred in the normal course of business. The committed and
closed pipelines of Prime Loans, as well as the related forward commitments are
valued daily. We refer to the loans, pipeline, commitments and derivatives
together as the “Hedge Position.” We evaluate the Hedge Position against a
spectrum of interest rate scenarios to determine expected net changes in the
fair values of the Hedge Position in relation to the changes in interest rates.
We evaluate our interest rate risk



exposure daily using models that estimate changes in the fair value of the
Hedge Position and compare those changes against the fair value of the
underlying assets and commitments.

Based on the carrying values of our mortgage loans and lines of credit that we
held at July 31, 2001, we do not believe that short-term changes in interest
rates will have a material effect on the interest income we earn on loans held
for sale in the secondary market, interest expense on our lines of credit or
the value of mortgage loans. See Notes 4 and 14 of the financial statements
for more information regarding risks related to our mortgage loans and lines of
credit. However, a change in interest rates may potentially have a material
impact on the interest income earned on our cash equivalents and short-term
investments held at July 31, 2001.

Impact of Foreign Currency Rate Changes

We translate foreign currencies into U.S dollars for reporting purposes;
currency fluctuations can have an impact, though generally immaterial, on our
results. We believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is
insignificant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and
satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local
currencies. For all three years presented there was an immaterial currency
exchange impact from our intercompany transactions. Currency exchange risk is
also minimized since foreign debt is due exclusively in local foreign
currencies. As of July 31, 2001, we did not engage in foreign currency hedging
activities.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Intuit Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intuit Inc. as
of July 31, 2000 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended July 31, 2001. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 14(a). These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Intuit Inc. at
July 31, 2000 and 2001, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2001, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered
in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly
in all material respects the information set forth therein.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of
Intuit and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain other previously
reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

As discussed in Note 12, in December, 1999, we acquired all of the outstanding
stock of Rock Financial Corporation (“Rock”), a provider of consumer mortgages,
based in Michigan and Title Source Inc. (“Title Source”), a title insurance and
escrow company affiliated with Rock, in exchange for the issuance of common
shares of Intuit stock. Rock subsequently changed its name to Quicken Loans
Inc. These acquisitions have been accounted for as pooling of interests in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board 16 (“APB 16”) and accordingly, the
consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, have been
restated as of the earliest period presented to include the results of
operations, financial position and cash flows of the above pooled entities.

Intuit reports its financial results on a July 31 fiscal year-end basis,
whereas Rock and Title Source reported their financial results on a December 31
calendar year-end basis prior to the acquisitions. For the purpose of pooling
of interests accounting, Rock and Title Source changed their year-end from
December 31, to July 31. Intuit’s statement of operations for the year ended
July 31, 1999 was combined with Rock’s and Title Source’s statement of
operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 1999. As a result, Rock and
Title Source’s revenues and net income of $7.8 million for the six month
period ended December 31, 1998 have been included in our combined results for
fiscal 1999. The $7.8 million in net income has been reflected as an
adjustment to retained earnings for the year ended July 31, 1999. Our fiscal
2000 financial statements, includes results for Rock and Title Source for the
thirteen months ended July 31, 2000.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include all of our accounts and those of
our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated all significant intercompany
accounts and transactions. Investments in which management intends to maintain
more than a temporary 20% to 50% interest, or otherwise has the ability to
exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method.
Investments in which we have less than a 20% interest or otherwise does not
have ability to exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost
or estimated realizable value. Intuit monitors both equity and cost basis
investments for other-than temporary declines in value and makes appropriate
reductions in carrying values when necessary.

Use of Estimates

To comply with generally accepted accounting principles, we make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
the disclosures made in the accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but
not limited to reserves for product returns and exchanges, reserves for
rebates, the collectibility of accounts receivable and deferred taxes. We also
use estimates to determine the remaining economic lives and carrying value of
goodwill, purchased intangibles and fixed assets. Despite our intention to
establish accurate estimates and assumptions, actual results may differ from
our estimates.

Net Revenue

We recognize revenue upon shipment, which is when title passes, of our
shrink-wrapped software products net of returns reserves, based on historical
experience, provided that collection is probable and we have no significant
remaining obligations. In some situations, we receive advance payments from
our customers. Revenue associated with these advance payments is deferred
until the products are shipped or services are provided. We also reduce
revenue by the estimated cost of rebates when products are shipped.

Revenue from payroll processing and payroll tax filing services under client
contracts is recognized as the services are performed provided that no other
obligations are required to be performed. Interest income earned on unremitted
payroll tax funds invested is recognized as earned. We generally
require our payroll tax outsourcing customers to remit payroll tax liability
funds to us in advance of the applicable payroll due date, via
electronic funds transfer. Interest earned on invested balances resulting from
timing differences between the collection of these funds from customers and the
remittance of such funds to outside parties is included in total net revenue in
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, as this



interest income represents an integral part of the revenue generated from our
services. Interest income generated from our cash and cash
equivalent balance is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations, as this interest income does not result
from our operating activities.

We recognize revenue from Internet products and services when it is earned
based on the nature of the particular product or service. For Internet
products and services that we provide over a period of time, we recognize
revenue pro rata based on the contractual time period. However, where we
provide or deliver the Internet product or service at one point in time, we
recognize revenue upon delivery of the product or completion of the service.

We also offer several plans under which customers are charged for
technical support assistance. For plans where we collect fees in advance, we
recognize revenue over a period of time, which is generally one year. We
include costs incurred for fee for support plans in cost of goods sold.

We defer loan origination revenue and the associated commissions and processing
costs on loans held for sale until the related loan is sold. We recognize
gains and losses on loans at the time we sell them, based upon the difference
between the selling price and the carrying value of the related loans sold. We
recognize loan servicing revenue as the related principal is collected. We
recognize interest income on mortgage loans held for sale as it is earned, and
we recognize interest expenses on related borrowings as cost of revenue as we
incur them.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs in connection with our shrink-wrapped software
products are expensed as incurred and included in cost of products in our
results of operations.

Customer Service and Technical Support

Customer service and technical support costs include the costs associated with
performing order processing, answering customer inquiries through Web sites and
other electronic means and providing customer assistance by telephone. In
connection with the sale of certain products, we provide a limited amount
of free technical support assistance to customers. We do not defer the
recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products, since the
cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant. The technical
support is provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized
and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent. We accrue the
estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment.

Software Development Costs

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS No. 86,

“Accounting for Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or otherwise
Marketed

,” software development costs are expensed as incurred until
technological feasibility has been established, at which time such costs are
capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. To
date, our software has been available for general release concurrent with the
establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, no development
costs have been capitalized. In accordance with SFAS No. 2,

“Accounting for
Research and Development Costs,”

which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for research and development, costs incurred in connection with the
enhancement of our existing products or after the general release of
the service using the product are expensed in the current period and included
in the research and development costs within the statement of operations.

We capitalize costs related to the development of computer software developed
or obtained for internal use in accordance with the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 98-1,

“Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.”

Costs
incurred in the application development phase are capitalized and amortized
over their useful life, not to exceed five years.

Advertising

We expense advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense for the years
ended July 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 was approximately $53.3 million, $57.9
million and $40.3 million, respectively.

Customer Deposits

We record customer deposits for cash held on behalf of our customers in our
payroll and mortgage businesses.



Payroll Service Obligations

We record payroll service obligations related to our payroll business, which
primarily consist of payroll taxes owed on behalf of our customers.

Drafts Payable

We record drafts payable for funds advanced to our mortgage customers for loans
that we originated that have not been drawn against our line of credit.

Foreign Currency

The functional currency of all our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency.
Assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated at the
exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue, costs and expenses are
translated at average rates of exchange in effect during the year. We report
translation gains and losses as a separate component of stockholders’ equity.
Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are included
in the consolidated statement of operations and were immaterial in all periods
presented.

2.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

Intuit considers highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or
less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Short-term investments
consist of available-for-sale debt securities that are carried at fair value.
Available-for-sale debt securities are classified as current assets based upon
our intent and ability to use any and all of these securities as necessary to
satisfy the short-term liquidity requirements that may arise from the highly
seasonal and cyclical nature of our businesses. Based on our significant
business seasonality, cash flow requirements within quarters may fluctuate
dramatically and require us to use a significant amount of the short-term
investments held as available-for-sale debt securities.

The following schedule summarizes the estimated fair value of our cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments:

The following table outlines the estimated fair value of Intuit’s
available-for-sale debt securities held in short-term investments classified by

Marketable Securities and Long-term Investments

We currently hold several marketable securities, which we acquired in
connection with strategic business transactions and relationships. Our
available-for-sale equity securities are carried at fair value and we include
unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, in stockholders’ equity. We have
designated our investments in At Home Corporation (which does business as
Excite@Home) and 724 Solutions as trading securities and fluctuations in the
market value of these shares are reported in net income. Our other long-term
investments are stated at cost. We held the following marketable securities at
July 31, 2000 and 2001. The cost basis of our marketable securities reflect
adjustments for other than temporary impairments in value as well as sales of
securities.

Our marketable securities are quoted on the Nasdaq National Market. All of our
marketable securities are stocks of high technology companies whose market
prices have been extremely volatile. The market prices of a number of these
companies’ stocks have declined substantially during the past two years. The
market prices of stocks we hold could continue to decline. These declines have
resulted and could continue to result, in a material reduction in the carrying
value of these assets and have a negative impact on our operating results. If
our trading securities experience further declines in market value, we will
reflect the declines in our net income on a quarterly basis. If our
available-for-sale securities experience further declines in fair value that
are considered other than temporary, we will reflect the additional loss in our
net income in the period when the subsequent impairment becomes apparent. The
fair value of companies included in our long-term investments have declined
substantially since our initial investment due to the volatility and economic
downturn of the high technology industry.

During fiscal 2001, we sold 85,000 shares of Checkfree, 351,865 shares of
Homestore.com, 201,500 shares of S1 Corporation, and 100,000 shares of 724
Solutions. In connection with these sales we recognized realized gains of $4.0
million, $ 11.1 million, $0.7 million and $0.1 million, respectively. In
addition, we sold 19,431 shares of VeriSign, 1,197,327, shares of
Quotesmith.com and 350,000 shares of Excite@Home and recognized aggregate
realized losses of $5.2 million. Total net gains on sales of marketable
securities were $10.7 million for fiscal year 2001. This gain was offset by a
loss of $68.8 million for other than temporary declines in the value of our
marketable securities and other investments, including an impairment of $10.8
million for the consideration received in the disposition of our Quicken
Insurance business. We also recognized losses of $40.0



million to reflect a decline in valuations of our trading securities. This
resulted in combined net losses on marketable securities and other investments
of $98.1 million for the fiscal 2001. The specific identification method is
used to account for computing gains and losses on marketable equity securities.

During fiscal 2001, we adopted FAS 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities,”

which establishes accounting and reporting standards
for derivative instruments and hedging activities. It required us to recognize
all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and
measure those instruments at fair value. In May 1999, we completed a $50
million investment (970,813 shares) in Security First Technologies (“Security
First”). In November 1999, Security First changed its name to S1 Corporation
(“S1”). In connection with this agreement, and contingent on S1’s completion
of two subsequent acquisitions, we received options to purchase 4.8 million
additional shares of S1 common stock, at a per share purchase price of $51.50.
These options contained a net-exercise feature. In August 2000, we recorded
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for derivatives for our 4.8
million S1 options held in long-term investments. This resulted in a one-time
cumulative effect of $14.3 million, net of taxes totaling $9.5 million. The
one-time cumulative effect created an increase of $0.07 per share on the basic
and diluted net loss per share for fiscal 2001. FAS 133 requires the
derivatives to be carried at fair value, so subsequent fluctuations in the fair
value of these options are being included in our net income. For fiscal 2001
these fluctuations resulted in a loss of $16.2 million. These options are
significantly out of the money and, therefore, there can be no guarantee that
we will ever exercise or realize any value from these options. The carrying
value at July 31, 2001 was $7.7 million. At July 31, 2001, S1’s stock traded at
$13.59 per share.

The following table shows what adjusted net income and diluted net income per
share would have been as if we had adopted FAS 133 as of the beginning of
fiscal 1999:

Mortgage Loans

We carry mortgage loans at the lower of their cost or estimated realizable
value, and we estimate their fair value using quoted market prices for similar
loans, adjusted for differences in loan characteristics, including credit
quality. The carrying amount of accrued interest receivable approximates the
assets’ fair value. The carrying amounts of mortgage loans held at July 31,
2000 and 2001 were $60.3 million and $123.2 million, respectively.

5.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. We
calculate depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 30 years. Leasehold improvements
are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated
useful lives or remaining lease terms. Property and equipment consisted of the

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

We record goodwill when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of net
tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is amortized on a
straight-line basis over periods ranging from 3 to 5 years. The cost of
identified intangibles is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over
periods ranging from 1 to 15 years.

We regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values of our
long-lived assets are impaired. The reviews look for the existence of facts or
circumstances, either internal or external, which indicate that the carrying
value of the asset cannot be recovered. During fiscal year 2001, events and
circumstances indicated possible impairment of our long-lived assets consisting
principally of acquired intangible assets and goodwill. These indicators
included the deterioration in the business climate for Web-based companies and
management’s intentions related to the continuation of certain services provided by our Personal
Finance Division.

We measured the impairment loss related to long-lived assets based on the
amount by which the carrying amount of such assets exceeded their fair values.
Our measurement of fair value was based on an analysis of the future discounted
cash flows. In performing this analysis, we used the best information
available in the circumstances, including reasonable and supportable
assumptions and projections. The discounted cash flow analysis considered the
likelihood of possible outcomes and was based on our best estimate of projected
future cash flows. For VFSC, we considered the terminal value cash flows
expected to result from the disposition of the assets at the end of their
useful lives. The consideration from the disposition of a portion of VFSC, our
Quicken Bill Manager business, assisted management in the determination of the
fair value of the remaining assets. Based on our analysis as described above,
we recorded charges of $51.0 million, $26.0 million, and $1.7 million, to
reduce the carrying value of the goodwill associated with VFSC, SecureTax and
Hutchison, respectively. If necessary, we will perform subsequent calculations
to measure the amount of the impairment loss based on the excess of the
carrying value over the fair value of the impaired assets. If market values
for the assets are not available, the fair value would be calculated using the
present value of estimated expected future discounted cash flows. The cash
flow calculations including the discount rate, would be based on management’s
best estimates, using appropriate assumptions and projections at the time. In
June 2001, FASB issued FAS 142, “

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

.” We
intend to implement FAS 142 beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. See
Note 10 of these financial statements.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Intuit operates in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing.
Many circumstances could have an unfavorable impact on Intuit’s operating
results. Examples include significant technological changes, changes in
customer requirements or the emergence of competitive products or services with
new capabilities.

We are also subject to risks related to changes in the values of our
significant balances of marketable securities, private equity investments and
short-term investments, as well as risks related to the collectibility of our
trade accounts receivable. At July 31, 2001, we held approximately $85.3
million in marketable securities, as described in Note 3 above.
Fluctuations in the market value of our shares in Excite@Home and 724 Solutions
result in recognized gains and losses in our statement of operations on an
ongoing basis, as these investments are treated as trading securities. If
there were other than temporary impairment in any marketable securities held as
available-for-sale, we would report this decline in our statement of
operations. See Note 3 above for a discussion of
risks associated with our marketable securities. At July 31, 2001, we held
approximately $24.1 million in private equity investments, net of reserves for
declines in value that management has determined to be other than temporary.
Our remaining portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of short-term
investment-grade securities.



We sell a significant portion of our products through third-party resellers
and, as a result, maintain one individually significant receivable balance with
our major distributor. If the financial condition or operations of these
distributors deteriorate substantially, our operating results could be
adversely affected. See Note 23 of the financial statements.

To appropriately manage the credit risk associated with our accounts
receivable, we perform ongoing evaluations of customer credit. Generally, no
collateral is required. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and
these losses have historically been within our expectations. However, since
we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our
customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be
adequate.

In the normal course of our mortgage business, we enter into loan commitments
to extend credit in order to meet the financing needs of our customers. Loan
commitments are agreements to lend to a customer as long as all conditions
specified in the contract are met. Commitments generally have fixed expiration
dates or other termination clauses and may require the customer to pay a fee.
We evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The
amount of collateral we obtain is based on our credit evaluation of the
customer.

Loan commitments subject us to market risks and credit risks. Market risk
occurs if interest rates rise after a loan commitment is made. To offset this
risk on conventional loans that are in process, we utilize mandatory forward
sale commitments. At July 31, 2001, we had $146.6 million in mandatory forward
sale commitments for future delivery of mortgages to Federal National Mortgage
Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. Loan
commitments also involve credit risk relating to the customer, which is not
reflected on the balance sheet. We use the same credit policies for making
credit commitments as we do for the underlying loan product.

Loan commitments to extend credit at July 31, 2000 and 2001 were as follows:

Comprehensive Income

Statement of Financial Accounting No. 130,

“Reporting Comprehensive Income,”

(“SFAS 130”) establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive
net income and its components in stockholders’ equity. However, it has no
impact on our net income as presented in our financial statements. SFAS 130
requires foreign currency translation adjustments and changes in the fair value
of available-for-sale securities to be included in comprehensive income.

Deferred Stock-based Compensation

We recognize deferred stock compensation for the difference between the
exercise price and the fair value of unvested stock options that we assume when
we acquire companies, and restricted stock grants made to employees. The
deferred stock compensation is amortized straight-line over the vesting term of
these options and restricted stock grants. During fiscal 2001, we recorded
deferred stock compensation of $2.7 million. We also recorded amortization expense of $7.5
million, of which $2.5 million was



recorded as general and administrative expense and $5.0 million was recorded as
acquisition-related charges in the results of operations.

10.

Recent Pronouncements

On June 29, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (SFAS 141),

“Business Combinations,”

and
No. 142 (SFAS 142),

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

SFAS 141 supersedes APB Opinion No. 16,

“Business Combinations,”

and eliminates
the pooling-of-interests method of accounting for business combinations, thus
requiring that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method.
In addition, in applying the purchase method, SFAS 141 changes the criteria for
recognizing intangible assets apart from goodwill and states the following
criteria should be considered in determining the recognition of the intangible
assets: (1) the intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights,
or (2) the intangible asset is separable or dividable from the acquired entity
and capable of being sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged. The
requirements of SFAS 141 are effective for all business combinations completed
after June 30, 2001.

SFAS 142 supercedes APB Opinion No. 17,

“Intangible Assets,”

and requires
goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life to no
longer be amortized. However, these assets must be reviewed at least annually
for impairment. Application of SFAS 142 is required immediately for business
combinations completed after June 30, 2001. However, for transactions completed
prior to July 1, 2001, we may elect to adopt SFAS 142 effective either
August 1, 2001 or August 1, 2002. This election must be made prior to the
issuance of our financial statements for the quarter ending October 31, 2001.
Due to the complexity of this new standard and its recent issuance,
we have decided to adopt SFAS 142 effective August 1, 2002. We are currently
evaluating the impact of FAS 142 on our financial position and statement of
operations.

11.

Per Share Data

Basic income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is
computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common
equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common equivalent shares
consist of the shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options under the
treasury stock method. All share and per share amounts shown in this table
have been restated to reflect a three-for-one stock split effective September
30, 1999. See Note 19 of the financial statements.



The effect of options to purchase 2.8 million and 2.3 million shares of common
stock in 1999 and 2000 was not included in the computation of diluted income
per share because the option exercise prices were greater than the average
market price of common stock. During fiscal 2001, we excluded options to
purchase 14.6 million shares of common stock in our diluted income per share
computation, since we experienced a net loss for the year.

12.

Acquisitions

In December 1999, we completed the purchase of all of the outstanding shares of
Rock, a provider of consumer mortgages based in Michigan. In connection with
the acquisition, Intuit assumed all of Rock’s outstanding employee stock
options. Rock subsidiary changed its name to Quicken Loans. Rock stockholders
received 0.58 shares of Intuit common stock for each share of Rock common
stock. In a related transaction, Intuit also acquired Title Source, Inc., an
affiliate of Rock. Title Source provides title insurance and escrow services
to real estate agents, lenders, attorneys, corporations and homeowners. We
accounted for the acquisitions of Rock and Title Source as a pooling of
interests for accounting purposes and have restated all previously reported
amounts to reflect the effect of the pooling. A total net revenue and net
income (loss) reconciliation for the year ended July 31, 1999 is summarized
below:

The acquisitions described below have been accounted for as purchase
transactions in accordance with APB No. 16 and, accordingly, the results of
operations and financial position of the acquired businesses are included in
Intuit’s consolidated financial statements only after the date of acquisition.

Fiscal 1999

In May 1999, we acquired Computing Resources, Inc. (“CRI”), a Reno,
Nevada-based provider of payroll services. The purchase price for
privately-held CRI was approximately $200 million, consisting of approximately
$100 million cash and approximately $25 million of Intuit stock that was paid
at closing, and an additional $75 million in cash required to be paid in three
annual installments of $25 million, in May of 2000, 2001 and 2002.

The following table shows pro forma total net revenue, net income from
continuing operations and diluted net income as if we had acquired CRI at the
beginning of fiscal 1999:

Fiscal 2000

In fiscal 2000, we acquired Boston Light Software Corp. (“Boston Light”),
SecureTax.com, and Turning Mill Software, Inc. (“Turning Mill”). We purchased
all of the outstanding common and Series A preferred stock of Boston Light, a
developer of software and Web-based products for small businesses based in
Massachusetts, for approximately $33.5 million in stock. In connection with
the agreement, Intuit also assumed 482,910 of Boston Light’s outstanding
employee stock options, which were converted into options to purchase 160,970
shares of Intuit common stock. We also acquired all of the outstanding common
stock of SecureTax.com and Turning Mill for approximately $52.0
million in cash and approximately $22.1 million in stock, respectively.



Fiscal 2001

In fiscal 2001, we purchased all of the outstanding securities of Venture
Finance Software Corp. (“VFSC”) that were not already held by Intuit
(approximately 51%) for approximately $118 million in cash (including
approximately $4.5 million in option exercise and tax payments in connection
with VFSC options exercised immediately prior to the purchase). We also
purchased all of the outstanding stock of EmployeeMatters, Inc., in exchange
for approximately $41.9 million in stock, the elimination of approximately $8.0
million in bridge loans we extended to EmployeeMatters prior to the closing,
and the assumption of approximately $3.4 million of liabilities.
We acquired substantially
all of the assets of TAASC for $63.0 million in cash and the
assumption of approximately $7.8 million of liabilities.

Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented
for fiscal 2000 and 2001 since the effect of these acquisitions was not
material to our financial position or results of operations.

Divestitures

In January 2001, we sold certain assets of our Quicken Insurance business to
InsWeb Corporation for approximately $10.8 million of InsWeb common stock. As
a result of the divestiture, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $1.6 million and a
related tax provision of $0.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2001.

In May 2001, we sold the technology assets of our Quicken Bill Manager business
to Princeton eCom Corporation. In exchange for these assets, Intuit is
entitled to receive, at Princeton eCom’s election to be made by February 2002,
either (i) shares of Princeton eCom common stock equal to
approximately 20% of Princeton eCom’s fully diluted shares as of
June 30, 2001, (ii) cash payments
of a minimum of $37 million paid in four equal annual
installments of a minimum of $9.3 million per year,
beginning in February 2002, or (iii) a combination of shares and cash. The
number of shares will be determined by Princeton eCom and the balance of the
consideration would be paid in cash in four annual installments. Related to
this disposition, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $16.9 million and a related tax
benefit of $6.4 million with respect to this transaction in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2001. There can be no guarantee that we will ultimately realize the
value attributed to the consideration to be received from Princeton eCom.
Princeton eCom is privately owned and operates in a highly volatile industry.
Reductions in the value of Princeton eCom could result in the impairment of the
carrying value of our investment. At July 31, 2001, our investment was valued
at $27 million.



14.

Borrowings

As of July 31, 2001, Intuit had one mortgage line of credit, which is reflected
in escrow liabilities. Advances may be drawn for working capital and sub-prime
and conventional prime mortgage loans, with the maximum amount based on a
formula computation. Advances are due on demand and are collateralized by
residential first and second mortgages. Interest is paid on a monthly basis.
The maximum outstanding balance permitted under this line is $20 million.
During the last three quarters of fiscal 2001, we had a no balance outstanding
under this line of credit.

During fiscal 2001, we also had a line of credit that provided for a principal
amount of up to $50 million in demand loans secured by mortgage loans and other
assets. Interest rates on loans varied depending on the type of underlying
loan, and the loans were subject to sub-limits, advance rates and warehouse
terms that varied depending on the type of underlying loan. This line
terminated as of July 31, 2001.

Drafts payable represent funds advanced for mortgages originated, which have
not yet been drawn against the lines of credit.

15.

Industry Segment and Geographic Information

SFAS 131,

“Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information”

(“SFAS 131”) establishes standards for the way in which public companies
disclose certain information about operating segments in the company’s
financial reports. Consistent with SFAS 131, we have determined our five
operating segments, outlined below, based on factors such as how our operations
are managed and how results are viewed by our chief operating decision maker.
Prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the current year
financial presentation for comparability.

Small Business Division revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks desktop
products, payroll services, financial supplies products, and the QuickBooks Support
Network.

Tax Division revenue is derived primarily from Quicken TurboTax federal and state
consumer desktop tax preparation products, electronic tax filing services, Quicken TurboTax
for the Web online tax preparation services and ProSeries and Lacerte professional
tax preparation products.

Personal Finance Division revenue comes primarily from Quicken desktop
products, advertising (both Web-based on
Quicken.com, as well as in-product advertising), and online transactions.

Quicken Loans Division revenue comes primarily from selling and originating
loans in bulk to participating financial
institutions and post-closing servicing revenues and loan fees.

Global Business Division revenue comes primarily
from Yayoi small business products in Japan, and QuickBooks, Quicken and QuickTax products in
Canada.



The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those
described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1. Intuit
does not track assets by operating segments. Consequently, we do not disclose
assets by operating segments. The following results are broken out by our
operating segments for the fiscal years ended July 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001:



(1)

Other includes reconciling items such as acquisition-related costs,
including amortization of purchased software and charge for purchased
research and development, and other common costs not allocated to
specific segments.

During fiscal 2001, we worked closely with our retail channel partners to more
aggressively manage inventory and ensure that on site destruction of excess and
obsolete inventory occurred in a more timely manner than in previous years. As
a result the reserve for returns and exchanges balance at July 31, 2001 was
significantly lower when compared to prior year.

17.

Notes Payable and Commitments

Notes Payable

In March 2001, our Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, refinanced its one-year loan
agreement with a Japanese bank for approximately $30.0 million. The loan is
denominated in Japanese yen and is therefore subject to foreign currency
fluctuations when translated to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The
interest rate is variable based on the Tokyo inter-bank offered rate or the
short-term prime rate offered in Japan. At July 31, 2001, the rate was
approximately 0.58%. The fair value of the loan approximates cost as the
interest rate on the borrowings is adjusted periodically to reflect market
rates (which are currently significantly lower in Japan than in the United
States). We are obligated to pay interest only on the loan through March 2002.



Intuit leases certain office facilities and equipment under various operating
lease agreements. The leases provide for annual rent increases of up to 10%.
Annual minimum commitments under these leases are as follows:

In connection with our acquisition of CRI in May 1999, we are required to pay
three annual installments of $25 million, in May of 2000, 2001 and 2002.

respectively. The activity for the year ended July 31, 2000 includes a
provision of $0.7 million offset by charge-offs of $1.6 million. The activity
for the year ended July 31, 2001 includes a provision of $0.8 million offset by
charge-offs of $0.6 million.

As of July 31, 2000 and July 31, 2001, there were approximately $0.3 million
and $0.8 million, respectively, of loans held for investment that were greater
than 90 days past due, the vast majority of which were sub-prime loans. We
believe these loans are appropriately reserved in our allowance for loan loss.

19.

Stockholders’ Equity

Stock Option Plans

On January 31, 1993, we adopted the 1993 Equity Incentive Plan (“1993 Plan”).
Under the 1993 Plan, we may grant incentive and non-qualified stock options,
restricted stock awards and stock bonuses to employees, directors, consultants,
and independent contractors of and advisors to Intuit. The Board of Directors
or its delegees determines who will receive grants, exercisability, exercise
price and other terms. The option exercise price is usually the fair market
value at the date of grant. The options generally vest over a four-year period
based on continued service and expire after ten years.

On October 7, 1996, we adopted the 1996 Directors Stock Option Plan. This plan
provides for non-qualified stock options for a specified number of shares to be
granted to non-employee directors of Intuit on an annual basis. The option
exercise price equals the fair market value at the date of grant. Most options
are subject to vesting over time and based on continued service, with vesting
periods ranging from two to four years. All options expire after ten years.

On November 11, 1998, we adopted the 1998 Option Plan for Mergers and
Acquisitions (“1998 Plan”). Under the 1998 Plan, we may grant non-qualified
stock options to individuals who are hired by Intuit as a result of
acquisitions of, or mergers with, other companies by Intuit. The 1998 Plan has
been designed to meet the “broadly based plans” exemption from the stockholder
approval requirement for stock option plans under the Nasdaq National Market
listing requirements and, accordingly, has not



been submitted to Intuit stockholders for approval. Options under the 1998
Plan can only be granted to eligible individuals within 18 months following the
completion of the relevant acquisition or merger. Options granted under the
1998 Plan have an exercise price not less than the fair market value of
Intuit’s common stock on the date of grant. They will generally become
exercisable over a four-year period based on continued service and expire ten
years after the grant date. Options granted to officers hired as a result of a
merger or acquisition cannot exceed 45% of all shares reserved for grant under
the 1998 Plan.

In addition, in several instances we have assumed the outstanding options of
companies that we acquired. No additional options have been granted under the
acquired companies’ option plans. We assumed options in connection with our
acquisitions of Boston Light and Hutchison in August 1999, Rock Financial
Corporation in December 1999, and Employee Matters in January 2001.

A summary of activity under all option plans is as follows:

There were 8,658,814, 11,608,020, and 15,551,666 options exercisable under the
various plans at July 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. At July 31, 2001,
there were 8,419,469 shares available for grant under the 1993 Plan, 241,875
shares available for grant under the 1996 Directors Stock Option Plan, and
2,377,159 shares available for grant under the 1998 Plan.

Stock Split

Intuit’s Board of Directors authorized a three-for-one stock split on September
8, 1999. This was effected by distributing a 200% stock dividend on September
30, 1999 to stockholders of record on September 20, 1999. We have restated all
share and per share amounts referred to in the financial statements and notes
to reflect this stock split.

Stock Repurchase Program

In May 2001, Intuit’s Board of Directors authorized the company to repurchase
up to $500 million of common stock from time to time in the open market over a
three-year period. As of July 31, 2001, we had repurchased approximately 0.2
million shares of our common stock under this program for an aggregate cost of
approximately $8.4 million.

The stock repurchase program is intended to help offset the dilution resulting
from the issuance of shares under Intuit’s employee stock plans. Repurchase
through July 31, 2001 had no impact upon earnings per share. Intuit intends to
use its cash and cash equivalents to fund these repurchases.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In October 1996, Intuit adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under Section
423 of the Internal Revenue Code and reserved 900,000 shares of common stock
for future issuance. In January 1998, an additional 600,000 shares were
reserved for future issuance, in January 1999, an additional 900,000 shares
were reserved for future issuance, in November 1999 an additional 400,000
shares were reserved for future issuance, and in December 2000 an additional
400,000 shares were reserved for future issuance. The plan allows eligible
employees to purchase Intuit’s stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market
value at the beginning or end of each offering period. During fiscal 1999,
2000 and 2001 employees purchased 396,546, 355,281 and 469,873 shares,
respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

We follow APB Opinion 25 (“APB 25”), “

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees

,” in accounting for stock-based compensation. Accordingly, we are
not required to record compensation expense when stock options are granted to
employees, as long as the exercise price is not less than the fair market value
of the stock when the option is granted, and we are not required to record
compensation expense in connection with the Employee Stock Purchase Plan as
long as the purchase price is not less than 85% of the lower of the fair market
value at the beginning or end of each offering period. In October 1995, the
FASB issued SFAS 123,

“Accounting for Stock Based Compensation.”

Although SFAS
123 allows us to continue to follow the present APB 25 guidelines, we are
required to disclose pro forma net income (loss) and net income (loss) per
share as if we had adopted the new statement. The pro forma impact of applying
SFAS 123 in fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001 will not necessarily be representative
of the pro forma impact in future years.

We have elected to use the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of
options granted. This valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions
including the expected stock price volatility. Because our employee stock
options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect this estimate, we believe the Black-Scholes model does not necessarily
provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock
options. Inputs used for the valuation model are as follows:

20.

Performance Sharing and Benefit Plans

Performance Sharing Plan

Eligible employees participate in Intuit’s performance sharing plan. The
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determines amounts to be paid
under the plan. Performance-sharing expense for fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001 was
approximately $12.4 million, $20.7 million and $23.3 million, respectively.

Benefit Plans

Prior to fiscal 2001, we provided several 401(k) plans for eligible employees.
During fiscal 2001, we merged all plans into Intuit’s 401(k) plan.
Participating employees may contribute up to 15% of pretax salary to the plan,
subject to IRS limitations. Intuit matches a specified portion of the employee
contributions up to a maximum amount per employee per year. The amount is
subject to change on an annual basis. At July 31, 2000 and 2001, the match was
75%, up to $2,500. Matching contributions were approximately $5.8 million,
$6.6 million and $8.1 million, respectively, for the years ended July 31, 1999,
2000 and 2001. The plan of Lacerte, our wholly owned subsidiary, merged with
the existing Intuit 401(k) plan on January 1, 2000. Quicken Loans maintained
its own separate 401(k) plan. Employees under this plan could make elective
contributions to the plan. The plan required Quicken Loans to contribute 20%
of employee contributions to the plan up to a maximum of 1% of the employee’s
gross pay. Matching contributions to the Quicken Loans plan for the years
ended July 31, 1999 and 2000, amounted to $0.2 million and $0.6 million,
respectively.

21.

Shareholder Rights Plan

On April 29, 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan
designed to protect the long-term value of Intuit for its stockholders during
any future unsolicited acquisition attempt. In connection with the plan, the
Board declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share
of Intuit’s common stock outstanding on May 11, 1998 (the “Record Date”) and
further directed the issuance of one such right with respect to each share of
Intuit’s common stock that is issued after the Record Date, except in certain
circumstances. If a person or a group (an “Acquiring Person”) acquires 20% or
more of Intuit’s common stock, or announces an intention to make a tender offer
for Intuit’s common stock, the consummation of which would result in a person
or group becoming an Acquiring Person, then the rights will be distributed (the
“Distribution Date”). After the Distribution Date, each right may be exercised
for 1/3000th of a share of a newly designated Series B Junior Participating
Preferred stock at an exercise price of approximately $83.33 per share. The
preferred stock has been structured so that the value of 1/3000th of a share of
such preferred stock will approximate the value of one share of common stock.
The rights will expire on May 1, 2008.



22.

Income Taxes

Income (loss) before income taxes included income (loss) from foreign
operations of $(9.0) million, $4.4 million and $11.2 million for the fiscal
1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The provision for income taxes consisted of
the following:

Differences between income taxes calculated using the federal statutory income

Tax savings from deductions associated with our various stock option plans are
not reflected in the current federal and state provisions. Savings were
approximately $58.2 million in fiscal 1999, $93.5 million in fiscal 2000 and
$59.5 million in fiscal 2001. These amounts were credited to stockholders’
equity and reduced taxes payable.

Significant deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:

We have provided a valuation reserve related to the benefit of losses in our
foreign subsidiaries that we believe is unlikely to be realized.

Significant Customer Information

One distributor accounted for 16% of total net revenue in fiscal 1999, 10% of
total net revenue in fiscal 2000 and no distributor met the 10% threshold in
fiscal 2001. The same distributor accounted for 17% and 15% of the accounts
receivable balance at July 31, 2000 and July 31, 2001.

Reorganization

Prior to Intuit’s acquisition of Rock in December 1999, Rock had evaluated the
performance of certain retail mortgage branches and made a decision in December
1998, to close nine branches that had been generating operating losses and
negative cash flow. Reorganization costs incurred in connection with the
branch closings were $2.0 million and $3.5 million in fiscal 1999 and 2000,
respectively. These charges primarily consisted of fixed asset write-offs,
ongoing lease commitments and severance pay for terminated employees. See Note
1 for more information about our basis of presentation.

26.

Litigation

On March 3, 2000, a class action lawsuit, Bruce v. Intuit Inc., was filed in
the United States District Court, Central District of California, Eastern
Division. Two virtually identical lawsuits were later filed: Rubin v. Intuit
Inc., was filed on March 8, 2000 in the United States District Court, Southern
District of New York and Newby v. Intuit Inc. was filed on April 27, 2000, in
the United States District Court, Central District of California, Eastern
Division. The Bruce and Newby lawsuits were consolidated into one lawsuit, In
re Intuit Privacy Litigation, filed on July 28, 2000 in the United States
District Court of California, Eastern Division. Following Intuit’s successful
motion to dismiss several of the claims, an amended complaint was filed on May
2, 2001. A similar lawsuit, Almanza v. Intuit Inc. was filed on March 22, 2000
in the Superior Court of State of California, San Bernardino County, Rancho
Cucamonga Division. An amended complaint in the Almanza suit was filed on
October 26, 2000. These purported class actions allege violations of various
federal and California statutes and common law claims for invasion of privacy
based upon the alleged intentional disclosure to third parties of personal and
private customer information entered at Intuit’s Quicken.com Web site. The
complaints seek injunctive relief, orders to disgorge profits related to the
alleged acts, and statutory and other damages. Intuit believes these lawsuits
are without merit and intends to defend the litigation vigorously.

Intuit is subject to other legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and
threatened litigation, that arise in the normal course of our business. We
currently believe that the ultimate amount of liability, if any, for any
pending claims of any type (either alone or combined) will not materially
affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. However,
the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain, and either unfavorable or
favorable outcomes could have a material negative impact. Regardless of the
outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on Intuit because of defense
costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.

27.

Related Party Transactions

As of July 31, 2000, we held a 49% non-voting equity interest in Venture
Finance Software Corp. (“VFSC”). We entered into agreements with VFSC to
provide it with services related to on-going development of Web-oriented
finance products. We received cost reimbursements of approximately $17.1
million and $23.8 million in fiscal 1999 and 2000 respectively, for development
and administrative services provided in connection with this agreement. At
July 31, 2000, we held a receivable due from VFSC of $7.2 million. In August
2000, we acquired all of the outstanding securities of VFSC. See Note 12 of
the financial statements. Subsequently in May 2001, we sold certain technology
assets acquired from VFSC to Princeton eCom. See Note 13 of the financial
statements.



As of July 31, 2000 and 2001, loans to
affiliates were $6.5 million and $9.5
million, respectively. All loans are secured, with maturity
dates up to 10 years. Interest rates are determined using the
applicable federal rate as
of the date of the loan.

Events Subsequent to Date of
Auditors’ Report

On September 24, 2001, we announced that we had entered into an Asset Purchase
Agreement with OMware, Inc. (“OMware”) pursuant to which Intuit will acquire
substantially all of the assets of OMware. The agreement was signed on August
22, 2001. OMware is a leading provider of construction management software
solutions. Its flagship product, The Master Builder, helps construction
companies handle accounting, estimating, job costing and project management.
The Master Builder is available in two editions to serve the needs of both
small and large construction companies. OMware will be operated as a separate
business unit of Intuit, headquartered in Sebastopol, California. Under the
terms of the agreement, Intuit will acquire substantially all of the assets of
OMware for up to approximately $42 million in Intuit stock, with $34 million to
be paid at the closing of the transaction, and up to $8 million to be issued
contingent upon the achievement of certain future performance objectives by the
business unit. The transaction has been approved by the boards of both Intuit
and OMware and is expected to close in November 2001, subject to various
conditions, including approval of OMware’s shareholders and customary
regulatory and other approvals.
