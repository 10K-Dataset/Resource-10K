PART I

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Annual Report on Form 10-K, other
periodic reports filed by Regions Financial Corporation
(“Regions”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and any other written
or oral statements made by or on behalf of Regions may include
forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) provides a
“safe-harbor” for forward-looking statements which are
identified as such and are accompanied by the identification of
important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from the forward-looking statements. For these
statements, we, together with our subsidiaries, unless the
context implies otherwise, claim the protection afforded by the
safe harbor in the Act. Forward-looking statements are not based
on historical information, but rather are related to future
operations, strategies, financial results or other developments.
Forward-looking statements are based on management’s
expectations as well as certain assumptions and estimates made
by, and information available to, management at the time the
statements are made. Those statements are based on general
assumptions and are subject to various risks, uncertainties, and
other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially
from the views, beliefs, and projections expressed in such
statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors
include, but are not limited, to those described below:

•

Regions’ ability to achieve the earnings
    expectations related to the businesses that were acquired,
    including its merger with Union Planters Corporation
    (“Union Planters”) in July 2004, or that may be
    acquired in the future, which in turn depends on a variety of
    factors, including:


•

The occurrence of natural disasters or the threat
    or occurrence of war or acts of terrorism and the existence or
    exacerbation of general geopolitical instability and uncertainty.

•

Possible changes in trade, monetary and fiscal
    policies, laws, and regulations, and other activities of
    governments, agencies, and similar organizations, including
    changes in accounting standards, may have an adverse effect on
    business.

•

Possible changes in consumer and business
    spending and saving habits could affect Regions’ ability to
    increase assets and to attract deposits.

The words “believe,”
“expect,” “anticipate,” “project,”
and similar expressions signify forward looking statements. You
should not place undue reliance on any forward looking
statement, which speak only as of the date made. We assume no
obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements
that are made from time to time.

Item 1.

Business

Regions Financial Corporation (together with its
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, “Regions” or
“Company”) is a financial holding company
headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama which operates throughout
the South, Midwest and Texas. Regions’ operations consist
of banking, brokerage and investment services, mortgage banking,
insurance brokerage, credit life insurance, leasing, commercial
accounts receivable factoring and specialty financing. At
December 31, 2005, Regions had total consolidated assets of
approximately $84.8 billion, total consolidated deposits of
approximately $60.4 billion and total consolidated
stockholders’ equity of approximately $10.6 billion.

Regions is a Delaware corporation that, on
July 1, 2004, became the successor by merger to Union
Planters and the former Regions Financial Corporation.
Regions’ principal executive offices are located at
417 North 20th Street, Birmingham, Alabama 35203, and
its telephone number at such address is (205) 944-1300.

Banking Operations

Regions conducts its banking operations through
Regions Bank, an Alabama chartered commercial bank that is a
member of the Federal Reserve System. At December 31, 2005,
Regions operated 1,311 full service banking offices in Alabama,
Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.


The following chart reflects the distribution of
total assets, loans, deposits and branches in each of the states
in which Regions conducts its banking operations:

Other Financial Services Operations

In addition to its banking operations, Regions
provides additional financial services through the following
subsidiaries or divisions:

Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.
(“Morgan Keegan”), a subsidiary of Regions Financial
Corporation, is a full-service regional brokerage and investment
banking firm. Morgan Keegan offers products and services
including securities brokerage, asset management, financial
planning, mutual funds, securities underwriting, sales and
trading, and investment banking. Morgan Keegan, one of the
largest investment firms in the South, employs approximately
1,000 financial advisors offering products and services from 281
offices located in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,
Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New York,
Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and
Virginia.

Regions Mortgage, a division of Regions Bank, and
EquiFirst Corporation (“EquiFirst”), a subsidiary of
Regions Bank, are engaged in mortgage banking. Regions
Mortgage’s primary business and source of income is the
origination and servicing of mortgage loans for long-term
investors. EquiFirst typically originates mortgage loans which
are sold to third-party investors. Regions Mortgage’s
servicing portfolio totaled approximately $37.2 billion and
included approximately 398,000 real estate mortgages at
December 31, 2005. Regions Mortgage and EquiFirst operate
loan production offices in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida,
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee
and Texas.

Rebsamen Insurance, Inc., a subsidiary of Regions
Financial Corporation, acts as a general insurance broker for a
full-line of insurance products, primarily focusing on
commercial property and casualty insurance customers.

Regions Agency, Inc., a subsidiary of Regions
Financial Corporation, acts as an insurance agent or broker with
respect to credit life insurance, accident and health insurance
and other types of insurance relating to extensions of credit by
Regions Bank or Regions’ banking-related subsidiaries.


Regions Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary of
Regions Financial Corporation, acts as a re-insurer of credit
life insurance and accident and health insurance in connection
with the activities of certain affiliates of Regions.

Regions Interstate Billing Service, Inc., a
subsidiary of Regions Financial Corporation, factors commercial
accounts receivable and performs billing and collection
services, focusing primarily on clients in the trucking and
automotive service industry.

Acquisition Program

In July 2004, Regions and Union Planters
completed a merger of the two companies. Union Planters was a
$32.2 billion bank holding company headquartered in
Memphis, Tennessee. The merger was accounted for as a purchase
of Union Planters by Regions for accounting and financial
reporting purposes.

A substantial portion of the growth of Regions
from its inception as a bank holding company in 1971 to the
merger with Union Planters has been through the acquisition of
other financial institutions, including commercial banks and
thrift institutions, and the assets and deposits thereof. Prior
to the merger with Union Planters, Regions had completed 103
acquisitions of financial institutions and financial service
providers representing in aggregate (at the time the
acquisitions were completed) approximately $28.4 billion in
assets. As part of its ongoing strategic plan, Regions
continually evaluates business combination opportunities. Any
future business combination or series of business combinations
that Regions might undertake may be material, in terms of assets
acquired or liabilities assumed, to Regions’ financial
condition. Recent business combinations in the financial
services industry have typically involved the payment of a
premium over book and market values. This practice could result
in dilution of book value and net income per share for the
acquirer.

Segment Information

Reference is made to Note 24 “Business
Segment Information” to the consolidated financial
statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for information required by this item.

Supervision And Regulation

General.

Regions is
a financial holding company, registered with the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System under the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”). As such,
Regions and its subsidiaries are subject to the supervision,
examination and reporting requirements of the BHC Act and the
regulations of the Federal Reserve.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, adopted in 1999
(“GLB Act”), significantly relaxed previously existing
restrictions on the activities of banks and bank holding
companies. Under such legislation, an eligible bank holding
company may elect to be a “financial holding company”
and thereafter may engage in a range of activities that are
financial in nature and that were not previously permissible for
banks and bank holding companies. A financial holding company
may engage directly or through a subsidiary in the statutorily
authorized activities of securities dealing, underwriting and
market making, insurance underwriting and agency activities,
merchant banking and insurance company portfolio investments. A
financial holding company also may engage in any activity that
the Federal Reserve determines by rule or order to be financial
in nature, incidental to such financial activity, or
complementary to a financial activity and that does not pose a
substantial risk to the safety and soundness of an institution
or to the financial system generally.

In addition to these activities, a financial
holding company may engage in those activities permissible for a
bank holding company, including factoring accounts receivable,
acquiring and servicing loans, leasing personal property,
performing certain data processing services, acting as agent or
broker in selling credit life insurance and certain other types
of insurance in connection with credit transactions and
conducting certain insurance underwriting activities. The BHC
Act does not place territorial limitations on permissible
nonbanking activities of bank holding companies. Despite prior
approval, the Federal Reserve has the power to order any bank
holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or
to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the
Federal Reserve has reasonable grounds to believe that
continuation of


such activity or such ownership or control
constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or
stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.

The GLB Act also permits securities brokerage
firms and insurance companies to own banks and bank holding
companies. The GLB Act also seeks to streamline and coordinate
regulation of integrated financial holding companies, providing
generally for “umbrella” regulation of financial
holding companies by the Federal Reserve, and for functional
regulation of banking activities by bank regulators, securities
activities by securities regulators, and insurance activities by
insurance regulators.

For a bank holding company to be eligible for
financial holding company status, all of its subsidiary insured
depository institutions must be well-capitalized and
well-managed. A bank holding company may become a financial
holding company by filing a declaration with the Federal Reserve
that it elects to become a financial holding company. The
Federal Reserve must deny expanded authority to any bank holding
company with a subsidiary insured depository institution that
received less than a satisfactory rating on its most recent
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the “CRA”) review
as of the time it submits its declaration. If, after becoming a
financial holding company and undertaking activities not
permissible for a bank holding company, the company fails to
continue to meet any of the prerequisites for financial holding
company status, the company must enter into an agreement with
the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and
management requirements. If the company does not return to
compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve may order
the company to divest its subsidiary banks or the company may
discontinue or divest its non-permissible activities.

The BHC Act requires every bank holding company
to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before:
(1) it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control
of any voting shares of any bank if, after such acquisition, the
bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control
more than 5.0% of the voting shares of the bank; (2) it or
any of its subsidiaries, other than a bank, may acquire all or
substantially all of the assets of any bank; or (3) it may
merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company.

The BHC Act further provides that the Federal
Reserve may not approve any transaction that would result in a
monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or
conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business
of banking in any section of the United States, or the effect of
which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to
create a monopoly in any section of the country, or that in any
other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the
anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly
outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and
needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also
required to consider the financial and managerial resources and
future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks
concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be
served. Consideration of financial resources generally focuses
on capital adequacy, and consideration of convenience and needs
issues includes the parties’ performance under the CRA,
both of which are discussed below.

Regions Bank is a member of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), and as such, its
deposits are insured by the FDIC to the extent provided by law.
It is also subject to numerous statutes and regulations that
affect its business activities and operations, and is supervised
and examined by one or more state or federal bank regulatory
agencies.

Regions Bank is a state-chartered bank. Regions
Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to
supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve and the state
banking authority of Alabama, the state in which it is
headquartered. The Federal Reserve and the Alabama Department of
Banking regularly examine the operations of Regions Bank and are
given authority to approve or disapprove mergers,
consolidations, the establishment of branches and similar
corporate actions. The federal and state banking regulators also
have the power to prevent the continuance or development of
unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law.


Community Reinvestment
Act.

Regions Bank is subject to the
provisions of the CRA. Under the terms of the CRA, the bank has
a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and
sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire
communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.
The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or
programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an
institution’s discretion to develop the types of products
and services that it believes are best suited to its particular
community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires each
appropriate federal bank regulatory agency, in connection with
its examination of a subsidiary depository institution, to
assess such institution’s record in assessing and meeting
the credit needs of the community served by that institution,
including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The regulatory
agency’s assessment of the institution’s record is
made available to the public. The assessment also is part of the
Federal Reserve’s consideration of applications to acquire,
merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its
holding company, to establish a new branch office that will
accept deposits or to relocate an office. In the case of a bank
holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or other
bank holding company, the Federal Reserve will assess the
records of each subsidiary depository institution of the
applicant bank holding company, and such records may be the
basis for denying the application. Regions Bank received a
“satisfactory” CRA rating in its most recent
examination.

Patriot Act.

In
2001, President Bush signed into law comprehensive
anti-terrorism legislation known as the USA Patriot Act.
Title III of the USA Patriot Act requires financial
institutions, including Regions’ banking, broker-dealer,
and insurance subsidiaries, to help prevent, detect and
prosecute international money laundering and the financing of
terrorism. Regions’ banking, broker-dealer and insurance
subsidiaries have augmented their systems and procedures to meet
the requirements of these regulations.

Payment of
Dividends.

Regions Financial
Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its
banking and other subsidiaries. The principal source of cash
flow of Regions Financial Corporation, including cash flow to
pay dividends to its stockholders, is dividends from Regions
Bank. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the
payment of dividends by Regions Bank to Regions Financial
Corporation, as well as by Regions Financial Corporation to its
stockholders.

As to the payment of dividends, Regions Bank is
subject to the laws and regulations of the state of Alabama and
to the regulations of the Federal Reserve.

If, in the opinion of a federal regulatory
agency, an institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or
is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which,
depending on the financial condition of the institution, could
include the payment of dividends), such agency may require,
after notice and hearing, that such institution cease and desist
from such practice. The federal banking agencies have indicated
that paying dividends that deplete an institution’s capital
base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound
banking practice. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), an
insured institution may not pay any dividend if payment would
cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is
undercapitalized. See “Regulatory Remedies under
FDICIA” below. Moreover, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC
have issued policy statements stating that bank holding
companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends only
out of current operating earnings.

At December 31, 2005, under dividend
restrictions imposed under federal and state laws, Regions Bank,
without obtaining governmental approvals, could declare
aggregate dividends to Regions Financial Corporation of
approximately $1.1 billion.

The payment of dividends by Regions Financial
Corporation and Regions Bank may also be affected or limited by
other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate
capital above regulatory guidelines.

Capital Adequacy.

Regions Financial Corporation and its subsidiary bank are
required to comply with the applicable capital adequacy
standards established by the Federal Reserve. There are two
basic measures of capital adequacy for bank holding companies
that have been promulgated by the Federal Reserve: a risk-based
measure and a leverage measure. All applicable capital standards
must be satisfied for a financial holding company to be
considered in compliance.


The risk-based capital standards are designed to
make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to
differences in credit and market risk profile among banks and
bank holding companies, to account for off-balance-sheet
exposure, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid
assets. Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad
risk categories, each with appropriate weights. The resulting
capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total
risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items.

The minimum guideline for the ratio of total
capital (“Total Capital”) to risk-weighted assets
(including certain off-balance-sheet items, such as standby
letters of credit) is 8.0%. At least half of the Total Capital
must be composed of common equity, undivided profits, minority
interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries,
noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of
cumulative perpetual preferred stock, less goodwill and certain
other intangible assets (“Tier 1 Capital”). The
remainder may consist of subordinated debt, other preferred
stock and a limited amount of allowance for loan losses. The
minimum guideline for Tier 1 Capital is 4.0%. At
December 31, 2005, Regions’ consolidated Tier 1
Capital ratio was 8.60% and its Total Capital ratio was 12.76%.

In addition, the Federal Reserve has established
minimum leverage ratio guidelines for financial holding
companies. These guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of
Tier 1 Capital to average assets, less goodwill and certain
other intangible assets (the “Leverage Ratio”), of
3.0% for bank holding companies that meet certain specified
criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating. All
other bank holding companies generally are required to maintain
a Leverage Ratio of at least 3.0%, plus an additional cushion of
100 to 200 basis points. Regions’ Leverage Ratio at
December 31, 2005, was 7.42%. The guidelines also provide
that bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or
making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital
positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels
without significant reliance on intangible assets. Furthermore,
the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will consider a
“tangible Tier 1 Capital leverage ratio”
(deducting all intangibles) and other indicators of capital
strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities.

A subsidiary bank is subject to substantially
similar risk-based and leverage capital requirements as those
applicable to Regions. Regions Bank was in compliance with
applicable minimum capital requirements as of December 31,
2005. Neither Regions nor Regions Bank has been advised by any
federal banking agency of any specific minimum capital ratio
requirement applicable to it.

Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject
a bank to a variety of enforcement remedies, including the
termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, and to certain
restrictions on its business. See “Regulatory Remedies
under FDICIA” below.

Support of Subsidiary
Banks.

Under Federal Reserve policy,
Regions Financial Corporation is expected to act as a source of
financial strength to, and to commit resources to support, its
subsidiary bank. This support may be required at times when,
absent such Federal Reserve policy, Regions may not be inclined
to provide it. In addition, any capital loans by a financial
holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right
of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such
subsidiary bank. In the event of a financial holding
company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the financial
holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain
the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the
bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.

Regulatory Remedies under
FDICIA.

FDICIA establishes a system of
regulatory remedies to resolve the problems of undercapitalized
institutions. Under this system, which became effective in 1992,
the federal banking regulators are required to establish five
capital categories (“well capitalized,”
“adequately capitalized,”
“undercapitalized,” “significantly
undercapitalized,” and “critically
undercapitalized”) and to take certain mandatory
supervisory actions, and are authorized to take other
discretionary actions, with respect to institutions in the three
undercapitalized categories, the severity of which will depend
upon the capital category in which the institution is placed.
Generally, subject to a narrow exception, FDICIA requires the
banking regulator to appoint a receiver or conservator for an
institution that is critically undercapitalized. The federal
banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant
capital level for each category.


Under the agencies’ rules implementing
FDICIA’s remedy provisions, an institution that
(1) has a Total Capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a
Tier 1 Capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, and a Leverage
Ratio of 5.0% or greater and (2) is not subject to any
written agreement, order, capital directive, or regulatory
remedy directive issued by the appropriate federal banking
agency is deemed to be “well capitalized.” An
institution with a Total Capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a
Tier 1 Capital ratio of 4.0% or greater, and a Leverage
Ratio of 4.0% or greater is considered to be “adequately
capitalized.” A depository institution that has a Total
Capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 Capital ratio of
less than 4.0%, or a Leverage Ratio of less than 4.0% is
considered to be “undercapitalized.” An institution
that has a Total Capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1
Capital ratio of less than 3.0%, or a Leverage Ratio of less
than 3.0% is considered to be “significantly
undercapitalized,” and an institution that has a tangible
equity capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2.0% is
deemed to be “critically undercapitalized.” For
purposes of the regulation, the term “tangible equity”
includes core capital elements counted as Tier 1 Capital
for purposes of the risk-based capital standards plus the amount
of outstanding cumulative perpetual preferred stock (including
related surplus), minus all intangible assets with certain
exceptions. A depository institution may be deemed to be in a
capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its
actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory
examination rating.

An institution that is categorized as
undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically
undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital
restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency.
Under FDICIA, a bank holding company must guarantee that a
subsidiary depository institution meets its capital restoration
plan, subject to certain limitations. The obligation of a
controlling bank holding company under FDICIA to fund a capital
restoration plan is limited to the lesser of 5.0% of an
undercapitalized subsidiary’s assets or the amount required
to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized
institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its
average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any
branches, or engaging in any new line of business, except in
accordance with an accepted capital restoration plan or with the
approval of the FDIC. In addition, the appropriate federal
banking agency is given authority with respect to any
undercapitalized depository institution to take any of the
actions it is required to or may take with respect to a
significantly undercapitalized institution as described below if
it determines “that those actions are necessary to carry
out the purpose” of FDICIA.

For those institutions that are significantly
undercapitalized or undercapitalized and either fail to submit
an acceptable capital restoration plan or fail to implement an
approved capital restoration plan, the appropriate federal
banking agency must require the institution to take one or more
of the following actions: sell enough shares, including voting
shares, to become adequately capitalized; merge with (or be sold
to) another institution (or holding company), but only if
grounds exist for appointing a conservator or receiver; restrict
certain transactions with banking affiliates as if the
“sister bank” exception to the requirements of
Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act did not exist;
otherwise restrict transactions with bank or nonbank affiliates;
restrict interest rates that the institution pays on deposits to
“prevailing rates” in the institution’s
“region;” restrict asset growth or reduce total
assets; alter, reduce, or terminate activities; hold a new
election of directors; dismiss any director or senior executive
officer who held office for more than 180 days immediately
before the institution became undercapitalized, provided that in
requiring dismissal of a director or senior officer, the agency
must comply with certain procedural requirements, including the
opportunity for an appeal in which the director or officer will
have the burden of proving his or her value to the institution;
employ “qualified” senior executive officers; cease
accepting deposits from correspondent depository institutions;
divest certain nondepository affiliates which pose a danger to
the institution; or be divested by a parent holding company. In
addition, without the prior approval of the appropriate federal
banking agency, a significantly undercapitalized institution may
not pay any bonus to any senior executive officer or increase
the rate of compensation for such an officer without regulatory
approval.

At December 31, 2005, Regions Bank had the
requisite capital levels to qualify as well capitalized.

FDIC Insurance
Assessments.

Pursuant to FDICIA, the
FDIC adopted a risk-based assessment system for insured
depository institutions that takes into account the risks
attributable to different categories and concentrations of
assets and liabilities. The risk-based system, which went into
effect in 1994, assigns an institution to one of three capital
categories: (1) well capitalized; (2) adequately
capitalized; and (3) undercapitalized, as determined by
capital reported by the institution in the quarterly report
issued before each


assessment period. Each institution also is
assigned by the FDIC to one of three supervisory subgroups
within each capital group. The supervisory subgroup to which an
institution is assigned is based on a supervisory evaluation
provided to the FDIC by the institution’s primary federal
regulator and information which the FDIC determines to be
relevant to the institution’s financial condition and the
risk posed to the deposit insurance funds (which may include, if
applicable, information provided by the institution’s state
supervisor). An institution’s insurance assessment rate is
then determined based on the capital category and supervisory
subgroup to which it is assigned. Under the final risk-based
assessment system, there are nine assessment risk
classifications (i.e., combinations of capital groups and
supervisory subgroups) to which different assessment rates are
applied.

Regions Bank is assessed at the well-capitalized
level where the premium rate is currently zero. Like all insured
banks, it also must pay a quarterly assessment of approximately
$.02 per $100 of assessable deposits to pay off bonds that
were issued in the late 1980’s by a mixed-ownership
government corporation, the Financing Corporation, to raise
funds to cover costs of the resolution of the savings and loan
crisis.

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act
(“FDIA”), insurance of deposits may be terminated by
the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in
unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound
condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable
law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.

Safety and Soundness
Standards.

The FDIA, as amended by
FDICIA and the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory
Improvement Act of 1994, requires the federal bank regulatory
agencies to prescribe standards, by regulations or guidelines,
relating to internal controls, information systems and internal
audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest
rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, stock
valuation and compensation, fees and benefits and such other
operational and managerial standards as the agencies deem
appropriate. In 1995, the federal bank regulatory agencies
adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards
pursuant to FDICIA, as amended. The guidelines establish general
standards relating to internal controls and information systems,
internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting,
interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, fees and
benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other
things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage
the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. The
guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and
unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the
amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the
services performed by an executive officer, employee, director,
or principal stockholder. In addition, the agencies adopted
regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to
order an institution that has been given notice by an agency
that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness
standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so
notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable
compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an
acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order
directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an
order directing other actions of the types to which an
undercapitalized institution is subject under the “prompt
corrective action” provisions of FDICIA. See
“Regulatory Remedies under FDICIA” above. If an
institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may
seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose
civil money penalties. The federal bank regulatory agencies also
proposed guidelines for asset quality and earnings standards.

Depositor
Preference.

The Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993 provides that deposits and certain
claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation
against an insured depository institution would be afforded a
priority over other general unsecured claims against such an
institution in the “liquidation or other resolution”
of such an institution by any receiver.

Regulation of Morgan
Keegan.

As a registered investment
adviser and broker-dealer, Morgan Keegan is subject to
regulation and examination by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”), the National Association of
Securities Dealers (“NASD”), the New York Stock
Exchange (“NYSE”) and other self regulatory
organizations (“SROs”), which may affect its manner of
operation and profitability. Such regulations cover a broad
range of subject matter. Rules and regulations for registered
broker-dealers cover such issues as: capital requirements; sales
and trading practices; use of client funds and securities; the
conduct of directors, officers, and employees; record-keeping
and recording; supervisory procedures to prevent


improper trading on material non-public
information; qualification and licensing of sales personnel; and
limitations on the extension of credit in securities
transactions. Rules and regulations for registered investment
advisers include the limitations on the ability of investment
advisers to charge performance-based or non-refundable fees to
clients, record-keeping and reporting requirements, disclosure
requirements, limitations on principal transactions between an
adviser or its affiliates and advisory clients, and anti-fraud
standards.

Morgan Keegan is subject to the net capital
requirements set forth in Rule 15c3-1 of the Exchange Act.
The net capital requirements measure the general financial
condition and liquidity of a broker-dealer by specifying a
minimum level of net capital that a broker-dealer must maintain,
and by requiring that a significant portion of its assets be
kept liquid. If Morgan Keegan failed to maintain its minimum
required net capital, it would be required to cease executing
customer transactions until it came back into compliance. This
could also result in Morgan Keegan losing its NASD membership,
its registration with the SEC or require a complete liquidation.

The SEC’s risk assessment rules also apply
to Morgan Keegan as a registered broker-dealer. These rules
require broker-dealers to maintain and preserve records and
certain information, describe risk management policies and
procedures, and report on the financial condition of affiliates
whose financial and securities activities are reasonably likely
to have a material impact on the financial and operational
condition of the broker-dealer. Certain “material
associated persons” of Morgan Keegan, as defined in the
risk assessment rules, may also be subject to SEC regulation.

In addition to federal registration, state
securities commissions require the registration of certain
broker-dealers and investment advisers. Morgan Keegan is
registered as a broker-dealer with every state, the District of
Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Morgan Keegan is registered as an
investment adviser in the following states: Alabama, Arkansas,
California, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia,
Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina,
Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South
Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont,
Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

Violations of federal, state, and SRO rules or
regulations may result in the revocation of broker-dealer or
investment adviser licenses, imposition of censures or fines,
the issuance of cease and desist orders, and the suspension or
expulsion of officers and employees from the securities business
firm. In addition, Morgan Keegan’s business may be
materially affected by new rules and regulations issued by the
SEC or SROs as well as any changes in the enforcement of
existing laws and rules that affect its securities business.

Regulation of Insurors and Insurance
Brokers.

Regions’ operations in
the areas of insurance brokerage and reinsurance of credit life
insurance are subject to regulation and supervision by various
state insurance regulatory authorities. Although the scope of
regulation and form of supervision may vary from state to state,
insurance laws generally grant broad discretion to regulatory
authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated
activities. This supervision generally includes the licensing of
insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling
of customer funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Regions Life
Insurance Company is subject to extensive regulatory supervision
and to insurance laws and regulation requiring, among other
things, maintenance of capital, record keeping, reporting and
examinations.

Other.

The United
States Congress and other state law-making bodies continue to
consider a number of wide-ranging proposals for altering the
structure, regulation and competitive relationships of the
nation’s financial institutions. It cannot be predicted
whether or in what form further legislation may be adopted or
the extent to which Regions’ business may be affected
thereby.


Competition

All aspects of Regions’ business are highly
competitive. Regions’ subsidiaries compete with other
financial institutions located in the states in which they
operate and other adjoining states, as well as large banks in
major financial centers and other financial intermediaries, such
as savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer
finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies,
investment companies, mutual funds, other mortgage companies and
financial service operations of major commercial and retail
corporations.

Customers for banking services and other
financial services offered by Regions’ subsidiaries are
generally influenced by convenience, quality of service,
personal contacts, price of services and availability of
products. Although Regions’ position varies in different
markets, Regions believes that its affiliates effectively
compete with other financial services companies in their
relevant market areas.

Employees

As of December 31, 2005, Regions and its
subsidiaries had approximately 25,000 full-time-equivalent
employees.

damages are routinely claimed in these cases. Regions continues
to be concerned about the general trend in litigation involving
large damage awards against financial service company defendants.

Regions evaluates these contingencies based on
information currently available, including advice of counsel and
assessment of available insurance coverage. Although it is not
possible to predict the ultimate resolution or financial
liability with respect to these litigation contingencies,
management is of the opinion that the outcome of pending and
threatened litigation would not have a material effect on
Regions’ consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion And Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operation

Introduction

General

The following discussion and financial
information is presented to aid in understanding Regions
Financial Corporation’s (“Regions” or the
“Company”) financial position and results of
operations. The emphasis of this discussion will be on the years
2003, 2004 and 2005; in addition, financial information for
prior years will also be presented when appropriate. Certain
amounts in prior year financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

On July 1, 2004, Regions merged with Union
Planters Corporation (“Union Planters”) headquartered
in Memphis, Tennessee. The combination with Union Planters added
approximately $35.7 billion of assets, $22.3 billion
of loans, and $22.9 billion of deposits. This transaction
was accounted for as a purchase of Union Planters by Regions and
accordingly prior period financial statements have not been
restated, except certain share and per share amounts related to
the exchange of Regions common stock. Union Planters’
results of operations were included in Regions’ results
beginning July 1, 2004. Comparisons with prior periods are
significantly impacted by the merger with Union Planters (see
Note 18 “Business Combinations” to the
consolidated financial statements).

Regions’ primary business is providing
traditional commercial and retail banking services to customers
throughout its geographic footprint. Regions’ banking
subsidiary, Regions Bank, has operations in Alabama, Arkansas,
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. In 2005, Regions’ banking
operations, excluding trust activities, contributed
approximately $789.0 million to consolidated net income.

In addition to providing traditional commercial
and retail banking services, Regions provides other financial
services in the fields of investment banking, asset management,
trust, mutual funds, securities brokerage, mortgage banking,
insurance, commercial accounts receivable factoring and other
specialty financing. Regions provides investment banking and
brokerage services through 281 offices of Morgan
Keegan & Company, Inc. (“Morgan Keegan”).
Morgan Keegan contributed approximately $101.7 million to
net income in 2005, including trust activities. Regions’
mortgage banking operations, Regions Mortgage and EquiFirst
Corporation (“EquiFirst”), provide residential
mortgage loan origination and servicing activities for customers
and contributed approximately $76.0 million to net income
in 2005. Regions Mortgage serviced approximately
$37.2 billion in mortgage loans as of December 31,
2005. Regions provides full-line insurance brokerage services
primarily through Rebsamen Insurance, Inc., one of the 50
largest insurance brokers in the country. Credit life insurance
services for customers are provided through other Regions’
affiliates. Insurance activities contributed approximately
$15.8 million to net income in 2005.

Regions’ profitability, like that of many
other financial institutions, is dependent on its ability to
generate revenue from net interest income and non-interest
income sources. Net interest income is the difference between
the interest income Regions receives on earning assets, such as
loans and securities, and the interest expense Regions pays on
interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and
borrowings. Regions’ net interest income is impacted by the
size and mix of its balance sheet components and the interest
rate spread between interest earned on its assets and interest
paid on its liabilities. Non-interest income includes fees from
service charges on deposit accounts, trust and securities
brokerage activities, mortgage origination and servicing,
insurance and other customer services which Regions provides.
Results of operations are also affected by the provision for
loan losses and non-interest expenses such as salaries and
employee benefits, occupancy and other operating expenses,
including income taxes.

Economic conditions, competition and the monetary
and fiscal policies of the Federal government in general,
significantly affect financial institutions, including Regions.
Lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are
influenced by the level of business spending and investment,
consumer income, spending and savings, capital market
activities, competition among financial institutions, customer
preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market
rates on competing products in Regions’ primary market
areas.


Regions’ business strategy has been and
continues to be focused on providing a competitive mix of
products and services, delivering quality customer service and
maintaining a branch distribution network with offices in
convenient locations.

The Company’s principal market areas are
located in the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and
Virginia. Morgan Keegan also operates offices in Massachusetts
and New York.

2005 Highlights

Regions’ most significant accomplishment in
2005 was the successful three-phase conversion of more than 700
Union Planters bank branches to Regions’ banking systems.
The integration of systems was accomplished ahead of the
original schedule and resulted in minimal negative impact to
Regions customers. The integration is expected to result in
improved returns through increased operational efficiencies and
strengthened customer relationships.

Regions reported net income available to common
shareholders of $2.15 per diluted share in 2005, including
a reduction of $.24 per diluted share related to
$115.4 million (net of tax) in merger and storm-related
expenses. Net income available to common shareholders was
$2.19 per diluted share in 2004.

Net interest income for 2005 was
$2.8 billion, compared to $2.1 billion in 2004. The
net interest margin for 2005 was 3.91%, up from 3.66% in 2004.
The increase in the net interest margin was due primarily to
favorable balance sheet positioning in a rising interest rate
environment during 2005; Regions, being in a slightly asset
sensitive balance sheet position, benefited from rising interest
rates during 2005, as increases in asset yields outpaced
increases in interest-bearing liability costs. Additionally, a
shift in the mix of earning assets and interest bearing
liabilities benefited the Company. Loans, typically
Regions’ highest yielding asset, increased slightly as a
percentage of total earning assets. Low cost core deposits
comprised a larger percentage of interest-bearing liabilities,
resulting from marketing campaigns targeting such products, as
well as an influx of low-cost deposits during the last two
quarters of 2005 in Hurricane Katrina-impacted areas. As of
December 31, 2005, interest rate sensitivity analysis
indicated Regions’ balance sheet remains in a slightly
asset sensitive position.

Net charge-offs totaled $136.2 million, or
0.23%, of average loans in 2005, compared to 0.29% in 2004.
Non-performing assets decreased $45.4 million to
$406.9 million at December 31, 2005.

Non-interest income (excluding security
gains/losses) totaled 39% of total revenue (tax-equivalent
basis) in 2005, as Regions continued to benefit from a
diversified revenue steam. Brokerage and investment banking
revenues increased in 2005, attributable to strong private
client, equity capital markets, and investment advisory income
streams during the year. Service charges on deposit accounts
increased significantly in 2005, due primarily to deposit
accounts added from the Union Planters merger. Residential
mortgage servicing and origination fees were higher in 2005, due
to business activity added in connection with the Union Planters
merger, as well as a relatively low interest rate environment.

Non-interest expense totaled $3.0 billion in
2005 compared to $2.5 billion in 2004. Included in
non-interest expense in 2005 are merger and storm-related
charges of $176.8 million. Regions incurred merger-related
expenses throughout the merger integration process incident to
the Regions and Union Planters merger. Through the integration
of Regions and Union Planters, Regions expects continued
realization of efficiencies in the banking unit, as well as
other lines of business. Regions realized $135 million in
cumulative cost savings in 2005 in connection with the merger.
Regions intends to continue to invest in many areas of the
franchise, including personnel, technology and product delivery
channels to increase revenue and improve efficiencies while
continuing to provide superior customer service.

On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck
the Gulf Coast as a powerful Category 3 hurricane, causing
significant flood and wind damage and loss of life, property,
power, and income along the coastal areas of Louisiana
(including New Orleans), Mississippi, and Alabama. At
December 31, 2005, only 11 of the 190 Regions’
branches affected by Hurricane Katrina remained closed due to
the damage sustained from the hurricane and subsequent flooding.
As of December 31, 2005, Regions had approximately
$1.2 billion in


outstanding loans in the most significantly
impacted areas. As a result of this disaster, Regions expects
some continued impact to certain revenue streams due to business
interruptions caused by this disaster. In addition, incremental
costs are expected to be incurred related to the disaster, a
significant portion of which is expected to be covered by
insurance.

Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing financial information, management is
required to make significant estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses for the periods shown. The accounting principles
followed by Regions and the methods of applying these principles
conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States and general banking practices. Estimates and
assumptions most significant to Regions are related primarily to
allowance for loan losses, intangibles (excess purchase price,
other identifiable intangible assets and mortgage serving
rights) and income taxes, and are summarized in the following
discussion and notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Allowance for Loan Losses

Management’s determination of the adequacy
of the allowance for loan losses, which is based on the factors
and risk identification procedures discussed in the following
pages, requires the use of judgments and estimates that may
change in the future. Changes in the factors used by management
to determine the adequacy of the allowance, or the availability
of new information, could cause the allowance for loan losses to
be increased or decreased in future periods. For example,
management has used judgments and estimates in its determination
of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses related to the
impact of Hurricane Katrina. The availability of additional or
different information affecting customers in the
Katrina-impacted areas could cause the allowance for loan losses
to be increased or decreased in future periods. In addition,
bank regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process,
may require that additions be made to the allowance for loan
losses based on their judgments and estimates.

Intangible Assets

Regions’ intangible assets consist primarily
of excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired
businesses (excess purchase price), other identifiable
intangible assets (primarily core deposit intangibles) and
amounts capitalized for the right to service mortgage loans.

Regions’ excess purchase price is tested for
impairment annually, or more often if events or circumstances
indicate impairment may exist. Adverse changes in the economic
environment, operations of acquired business units, or other
factors could result in a decline in implied fair value of
excess purchase price. If the implied fair value is less than
the carrying amount, a loss would be recognized to reduce the
carrying amount to implied fair value.

Other identifiable intangible assets, primarily
core deposit intangibles, are reviewed at least annually for
events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of
the intangible asset, such as loss of core deposits, increased
competition or adverse changes in the economy. To the extent an
other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable, an
impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount
to the fair value.

For purposes of evaluating mortgage servicing
impairment, Regions must estimate the value of its mortgage
servicing rights (“MSR”). MSR do not trade in an
active market with readily observable market prices. Although
sales of MSR do occur, the exact terms and conditions of sales
may not be readily available. As a result, Regions stratifies
its mortgage servicing portfolio on the basis of certain risk
characteristics, including loan type and contractual note rate,
and values its MSR using discounted cash flow modeling
techniques, which require management to make estimates regarding
future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration
historical and forecasted mortgage loan prepayment rates and
discount rates. Changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or
other factors could result in impairment of the servicing asset
and a charge against earnings to reduce the recorded carrying
amount. Based on a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, Regions
estimates that a reduction in the primary mortgage market rates
of 25 basis points and 50 basis points


would reduce the December 31, 2005 fair
value of MSR by 8% ($30 million) and 15%
($60 million), respectively.

Income Taxes

Management’s determination of the
realization of the deferred tax asset is based upon
management’s judgment of various future events and
uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income
earned by certain subsidiaries and the implementation of various
tax plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset.
Management believes that the subsidiaries will generate
sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax
benefits. Regions’ 1998 to 2004 consolidated federal income
tax returns are open for examination. From time to time Regions
engages in business plans that may also have an effect on its
tax liabilities. While Regions has obtained the opinion of
advisors that the tax aspects of these plans should prevail,
examination of Regions’ income tax returns or changes in
tax law may impact these plans and resulting provisions for
income taxes. For example, as a result of normal examinations of
Regions’ income tax returns, Regions has received notices
of proposed adjustments relating to taxes due for certain years.
Regions believes that adequate provisions for income taxes have
been recorded and intends to vigorously contest the proposed
adjustments. To the extent, however, that final resolution of
the proposed adjustments results in significantly different
conclusions from Regions’ current assessment of the
proposed adjustments, Regions’ effective tax rate in any
given financial reporting period may be materially different
from its current effective tax rate.

Acquisitions

The acquisitions of banks and other financial
service companies historically have contributed significantly to
Regions’ growth. The acquisitions of other financial
service companies have also allowed Regions to better diversify
its revenue stream and to offer additional products and services
to its customers. Regions, from time to time, evaluates
potential bank and non-bank acquisition candidates; however, no
transactions were pending at December 31, 2005.

During 2005, Regions completed acquisitions of an
oil and gas valuation and brokerage entity, as well as various
insurance production activities. Regions paid approximately
$7.2 million in cash and recorded $5.6 million in
identifiable intangible assets, as well as $1.5 million of
excess purchase price, related to these acquisitions.

On July 1, 2004, Regions completed its
merger with Union Planters, headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee.
Union Planters provided traditional commercial and retail
banking services and other financial services in the fields of
mortgage banking, insurance, trust, securities brokerage and
investments, professional employment services and specialty
financing. The combination with Union Planters added
$35.7 billion in assets, $22.3 billion in loans and
$22.9 billion in deposits, and significantly expanded
Regions geographic footprint as well as its customer base.
Through the merger, Regions expanded its banking presence into
new markets in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi
and Missouri and strengthened its banking presence in existing
markets in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Tennessee and
Texas.

Additionally in 2004, Regions acquired Evergreen
Timber Investment Management (“ETIM”), adding
approximately $20 million in assets. ETIM manages timber
assets for third parties.

In 2003, Regions consummated the purchase of
three branches from Inter Savings Bank, FSB, which strengthened
its community banking franchise in central Florida. These
branches combined added $185 million in assets,
$5 million in loans and $185 million in deposits.

Financial Condition

Regions’ financial condition depends
primarily on the quality and nature of its assets, liabilities
and capital structure, market and economic conditions, and the
quality of its personnel.


Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses

Loan Portfolio

Regions’ primary investment is loans. At
December 31, 2005, loans represented 79% of Regions’
earning assets.

Lending at Regions is generally organized along
three functional lines: commercial loans (including financial
and agricultural), real estate loans and consumer loans. The
composition of the portfolio by these major categories is
presented below (with real estate loans further broken down
between construction and mortgage loans):

As the above table demonstrates, over the last
five years loans increased a total of $27.5 billion, a
compound growth rate of 17%. In 2002, total loans increased
$100 million, primarily due to growth in the commercial
portfolio and partially offset by the reclassification of
$1.1 billion of indirect auto loans to the loans held for
sale category on September 30, 2002. Excluding the effect
of the reclassification, total loans would have increased
$1.2 billion, or 4%, in 2002. Loans increased
$1.2 billion, or 4%, in 2003, due primarily to growth in
the real estate portfolio partially offset by a decline in the
commercial portfolio. Loans increased significantly in 2004 due
to $22.3 billion of loans which were added by the Union
Planters merger, $430 million of indirect auto loans
reclassified to the loan portfolio from the loans held for sale
category and internally generated loan growth. Excluding loans
added from the merger and reclassification, loans increased 8%
in 2004. Loans increased $878 million, or 2%, in 2005, due
primarily to growth in the real estate construction portfolio,
partially offset by declines in other loan categories.

All major categories in the loan portfolio have
increased significantly over the last five years due primarily
to the merger with Union Planters during 2004. Over the last
five years, commercial, financial and agricultural loans
increased $5.0 billion, or 51%. Real estate construction
loans increased $3.7 billion, or 101%, over the same
period. Real estate mortgage loans increased $15.7 billion,
or 139%, and consumer loans increased $3.1 billion, or 50%,
over the last five years.

In 2005, as economic conditions remained
relatively steady, loan growth was generated in the real estate
construction category, while other categories experienced slight
declines. Average total loans were $31.5 billion in 2003,
compared to $44.7 billion in 2004 and $58.0 billion in
2005. The modest internal loan growth trend experienced is the
result of reduced loan demand attributable to slowing real
estate market conditions, significant prepayments of mortgage
loans, and management initiatives to focus on higher margin
loans and increase diversification of the portfolio, combined
with the reclassification of indirect auto loans in 2002.
Regions anticipates modest overall loan growth in 2006.

Regions’ residential real estate mortgage
loans originated from the mortgage divisions totaled
$8.9 billion at December 31, 2005, an increase of
approximately $200 million from a year earlier. Included in
these loans are approximately $5.7 billion of adjustable
rate mortgages (“ARM”) and $3.2 billion of fixed
rate mortgages at year end.

The fixed rate residential mortgage
portfolio’s weighted average coupon declined to 5.86% from
5.90% the previous year, while the weighted average remaining
maturity increased slightly to 177 months from
170 months for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The residential
ARM portfolio exhibited a yield increase with


rates averaging 5.65% in 2005, compared to 5.37%
a year earlier. At December 31, 2005, the weighted average
months to reprice was 33, down from 35 months at year-end
2004.

The amounts of total gross loans (excluding
residential mortgages and consumer loans) outstanding at
December 31, 2005, based on remaining scheduled repayments
of principal, due in (1) one year or less, (2) more
than one year but less than five years and (3) more than
five years, are shown in the following table. The amounts due
after one year are classified according to sensitivity to
changes in interest rates.

A sound credit policy and careful, consistent
credit review are vital to a successful lending program. All
affiliates of Regions operate under written loan policies that
attempt to maintain a consistent lending philosophy, provide
sound traditional credit decisions, provide an adequate
risk-adjusted return and render service to the communities in
which the bank branches are located. Regions’ lending
policy generally confines loans to local customers or to
national firms doing business locally. Credit reviews and loan
examinations help confirm that affiliates are adhering to these
loan policies.

Allowance for Loan Losses

Every loan carries some degree of credit risk.
This risk is reflected in the consolidated financial statements
by the allowance for loan losses, the amount of loans charged
off and the provision for loan losses charged to operating
expense. It is Regions’ policy that when a loss is
identified, it is charged against the allowance for loan losses
in the current period. The policy regarding recognition of
losses requires immediate recognition of a loss if significant
doubt exists as to principal repayment.

Regions’ provision for loan losses is a
reflection of management’s judgment as to the adequacy of
the allowance for loan losses. Some of the factors considered by
management in determining the amount of the provision and
resulting allowance include: (1) detailed reviews of
individual loans; (2) gross and net loan charge-offs in the
current year; (3) the current level of the allowance in
relation to total loans and to historical loss levels;
(4) past due and non-accruing loans; (5) collateral
values of properties securing loans; (6) the composition of
the loan portfolio (types of loans) and risk profiles; and
(7) management’s analysis of economic conditions and
the resulting impact on Regions’ loan portfolio.

A coordinated effort is undertaken to identify
credit losses in the loan portfolio for management purposes and
to establish the loan loss provision and resulting allowance for
accounting purposes. A regular, formal and ongoing loan review
is conducted to identify loans with unusual risks or possible
losses. Credit administration and internal audit are jointly
responsible for this review, which tests the accuracy of loan
gradings assigned at the individual banking offices, reviews
significant portfolio segments for early identification of
problems or potential problems, and tests for compliance with
laws, regulations, and internal policies and procedures. This
process provides information that helps in assessing the quality
of the portfolio, assists in the prompt


identification of problems and potential
problems, and aids in deciding if a loan represents a probable
loss that should be recognized or a risk for which an allowance
should be maintained.

If it is determined that payment of interest on a
loan is questionable, it is Regions’ policy to classify the
loan as non-accrual and reverse interest previously accrued on
the loan against interest income. Interest on such loans is
thereafter recorded on a “cash basis” and is included
in earnings only when actually received in cash and when full
payment of principal is no longer doubtful.

Although it is Regions’ policy to
immediately charge off as a loss all loan amounts judged to be
uncollectible, historical experience indicates that certain
losses exist in the loan portfolio that have not been
specifically identified. To anticipate and provide for these
inherent losses, the allowance for loan losses is established by
charging the provision for loan losses expense against current
earnings. No portion of the resulting allowance is in any way
allocated or restricted to any individual loan or group of
loans. The entire allowance is available to absorb losses from
any and all loans.

Regions determines its allowance for loan losses
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 114, “Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a
Loan — an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 5 and
15” and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies.” In
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses,
management uses information from its ongoing loan review process
to stratify the loan portfolio into loan pools with common risk
characteristics. The higher-risk-graded loans in the portfolio
are assigned estimated amounts of loss based on several factors,
including current and historical loss experience of each
higher-risk category, regulatory guidelines for losses in each
higher-risk category, and management’s judgment of economic
conditions and the resulting impact on the higher-risk-graded
loans. All loans deemed to be impaired, which include all
non-accrual loans greater than $1 million, excluding loans
to individuals, are evaluated individually. Impaired loans
totaled approximately $64 million at December 31, 2005
and $95 million at December 31, 2004. The vast
majority of Regions’ impaired loans are dependent upon
collateral for repayment. For these loans, impairment is
measured by evaluating collateral value as compared to the
current investment in the loan. For all other loans, Regions
compares the amount of estimated discounted cash flows to the
investment in the loan. In the event a particular loan’s
collateral value or discounted cash flows are not sufficient to
support the collection of the investment in the loan, the loan
is specifically considered in the determination of the allowance
for loan losses or a charge is immediately taken against the
allowance for loan losses. The amount of the allowance for loan
losses related to the higher-risk loans was approximately 47% at
December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 55% at
December 31, 2004. Higher-risk loans, which include
impaired loans, consist of loans classified as OLEM (other loans
especially mentioned) and below and loans in other loan
categories that are significantly past due.

In addition to establishing allowance levels for
specifically identified higher risk-graded loans, management
determines allowance levels for all other loans in the portfolio
for which historical experience indicates that losses exist.
These loans are categorized by loan type and assigned estimated
amounts of loss based on several factors, including current and
historical loss experience of each loan type and
management’s judgment of economic conditions and the
resulting impact on each category of loans. The amount of the
allowance for loan losses related to all other loans in the
portfolio for which historical experience indicates that losses
exist was approximately 53% of Regions’ allowance for loan
losses at December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 45%
at December 31, 2004. The amount of the allowance related
to these loans is combined with the amount of the allowance
related to the higher risk-graded loans to evaluate the overall
level of the allowance for loan losses.

In August of 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the
Gulf Coast (mainly impacting Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama)
as a Category 3 hurricane, causing significant flood and wind
damage and loss of life, property, power, and income. Regions
had approximately $1.2 billion in loans ($473 million
in commercial real estate loans, $299 million in commercial
and industrial loans, $186 million in consumer loans, and
$198 million in mortgage loans) in the most significantly
impacted areas at December 31, 2005. Approximately 50% of
the consumer loans are home equity lines of credit. As part of
its ongoing evaluation process at December 31, 2005,
Regions has identified approximately $61 million in
allowance for loan losses related to this portion of its


loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2005,
Regions had recognized approximately $972,000 in net loan
charge-offs ($641,000 for commercial loans and $331,000 for
retail and consumer loans) related to Hurricane Katrina.

Management considers the current level of
allowance for loan losses adequate to absorb probable losses on
loans in the portfolio. Management’s determination of the
adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, which is based on the
factors and risk identification procedures previously discussed,
requires the use of judgments and estimations that may change in
the future. Changes in the factors used by management to
determine the adequacy of the allowance or the availability of
new information could cause the allowance for loan losses to be
increased or decreased in future periods. The amount of the
allowance for loan losses related to the Hurricane Katrina
impacted portfolio may change in the future as additional or
different information affecting customers in the
Katrina-impacted areas is obtained. Changes in (1) risk
assessments of individual loans in this area,
(2) collateral values of properties securing loans in this
area, (3) levels of past due and non-accruing loans in this
area, (4) economic conditions in the Hurricane Katrina
impacted area and (5) other factors, could result in
changes in Regions’ allowance for loan losses in the
future. In addition, bank regulatory agencies, as part of their
examination process, may require that additions be made to the
allowance for loan losses based on their judgments and estimates.

Over the last five years, the year-end allowance
for loan losses as a percentage of loans ranged from a low of
1.31% at December 31, 2004 to a high of 1.41% at
December 31, 2003 and 2002. As of December 31, 2005,
the allowance as a percentage of loans was 1.34%.

The following table presents information on
non-performing loans and real estate acquired in settlement of
loans:

The analysis of loan loss experience, as
reflected in the following table, shows that net loan losses
over the last five years ranged from a high of
$136.2 million in 2005 to a low of $104.6 million in
2003. Net loan losses were $131.0 million in 2004,
$111.8 million in 2002, and $126.8 million in 2001.
Over the last five years, net loan losses averaged 0.31% of
average loans and were 0.23% of average loans in 2005. In 2005,
Regions experienced a lower charge-off percentage for commercial
and consumer credits, while real estate net charge-offs as a
percentage of average loans were flat in comparison to the prior
year. Regions expects charge-offs to increase slightly in 2006,
although additional charge-offs could be recognized as a result
of higher defaults


related to Hurricane Katrina or the hurricane
season in 2006, fraud in connection with loans we originate or
lower loan production as a result of rising interest rates.

The following analysis presents a five-year
history of the allowance for loan losses and loan loss data:


Risk Characteristics of Loan
    Portfolio

In order to assess the risk characteristics of
the loan portfolio, it is appropriate to consider the economy of
Regions’ primary banking markets as well as the three major
categories of loans — commercial, real estate and
consumer.

Economy of Regions’ primary banking
markets.

The Alabama economy has
experienced relatively stable growth over the last several
years, including substantial growth in the information
technology and biotechnology sectors within Birmingham and
Huntsville. Industries important in the Alabama economy include
vehicle and vehicle parts manufacturing and assembly, lumber and
wood products, health care services and steel production. High
technology and defense-related industries are important in the
northern part of the state. Agriculture, particularly poultry,
beef and cotton, are also important to the state’s economy.

Tennessee’s economy is heavily influenced by
automobile manufacturing, tourism, entertainment and recreation,
health care and other service industries. With one out of four
Tennesseans employed in service industries, the state’s
economy is dependent on this sector.

The economy of northern Georgia, where the
majority of Regions’ Georgia franchise is located, is
diversified with a strong presence in poultry production, carpet
manufacturing, automotive manufacturing-related industries,
tourism, and various service sector industries. A well-developed
transportation system has contributed to the growth in north
Georgia. This area has experienced rapid population growth and
has favorable household income characteristics relative to many
of Regions’ other markets.

In the southern region of Georgia, while
agriculture is important, other industries play a significant
role in the economy as well. Georgia ranks as one of the
nation’s top producers of paper and paper board products.
Albany and Valdosta, Regions’ primary market areas in
southern Georgia, are hubs for retail trade and health care for
the entire south Georgia market. These markets are also home to
numerous manufacturing and production facilities of Fortune 500
Companies.

Florida has also experienced significant economic
growth during the last several years. Tourism and space research
are very important to the Florida economy, and military payrolls
are significant in the panhandle area. Florida has experienced
strong in-migration, contributing to strong construction
activity, increasing real estate values, and a growing
retirement-age population. Citrus fruit production is also
important in the state.

The Arkansas economy is supported in part by the
forest products industry, due to the abundance of
corporate-owned forests and public forest lands. In recent
years, retail trade, transportation and steel production have
become increasingly important to the state’s economy.

Natural resources are very important to the
Louisiana economy. Energy and petrochemical industries play a
significant role in the economy. Shipping, shipbuilding, and
other transportation equipment industries are strong in the
state’s durable goods industries. Tourism, amusement and
recreation, service, and health care industries are also
important to the Louisiana economy. Cotton, rice and sugarcane
are among Louisiana’s most important agricultural
commodities, while Louisiana’s fishing industry is one of
the largest in the nation. The coastal region of Louisiana was
significantly impacted by Hurricane Katrina from both an
infrastructure and economic perspective.

The economy in the state of Texas has been among
the strongest in the nation in recent years. In addition to oil,
gas and agriculture, the Texas economy is supported by
telecommunications, computer and technology research, and the
health care industry.

Manufacturing and agriculture primarily drive the
Indiana economy. Steel, transportation equipment, and food
products are the leading manufacturers in Indiana.
Indiana’s production of corn and wheat support its
livestock and meatpacking industries as well as its dairy
industry.

Missouri’s economy relies mainly on
industry. Aerospace and transportation equipment production as
well as printing and publishing are important to the economic
growth. Missouri’s mining concerns are also vital to the
economy. Missouri is a leading producer of coal, zinc and lead.

The economy along the I-85 corridor in South
Carolina is home to numerous multinational manufacturers,
resulting in one of the highest per capita foreign investment
areas in the nation. Auto manufacturing has become increasingly
important in recent years in this area.


The economy in Iowa is heavily influenced by
agriculture. Iowa is one of the leaders in the production of
corn and soybeans. In recent years, manufacturing has become
increasingly important. Top products include farm machinery,
tires and chemicals.

The economy of Kentucky is primarily industrial,
including manufacturing of electrical equipment, automobiles and
food products. Tourism has become increasingly important in
recent years. Kentucky is also a leading producer of coal.

Timber products and agriculture continue to be
important to the Mississippi economy, although tourism and
entertainment have become important in recent years.
Mississippi’s primary agricultural products include
poultry, catfish and dairy. Mississippi’s coastal regions
were significantly impacted by Hurricane Katrina, both from an
infrastructure and economic perspective.

The North Carolina economy is diversified with
manufacturing, agriculture, financial services and textiles as
its primary industries. North Carolina has experienced
population growth well in excess of the national average in
recent years. The economy is further supported by three state
universities, which provide stable employment and serve as
research centers in the area.

The Illinois economy is diversified with
manufacturing, mining, textiles and agriculture. Illinois’
manufactured products include food products, fabricated and
primary metal products, chemicals and published materials.
Illinois ranks high among the states in the production of coal
as well as corn, soybeans, hay and wheat.

Virginia’s economy is primarily industrial,
including manufacturing of transportation and electrical
equipment, food processing, textiles, and lumber and wood
production. Agriculture remains an important industry within the
state, especially production of tobacco, tomatoes, and apples.
Virginia is also one of the top ten coal producers in the United
States.

The economies in the markets served by Regions
continue to be among the best in the nation. General economic
conditions deteriorated throughout the nation in 2001 and did
not show significant recovery in 2002. In 2003, various sectors
of the economy reported growth, while others continued the slow
growth trends of 2002. Generally, economic conditions continued
to improve during 2004. Overall economic conditions were
generally steady during 2005, despite pressures from rising oil
prices and the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the Gulf
Coast. These factors were offset by the continued relatively low
interest rate environment, resulting in strong consumer
spending, construction, and productivity growth.

Commercial.

Regions’ commercial loan portfolio is highly diversified
within the markets it serves. Geographically, the largest
concentration is the 18% of the commercial loan portfolio in
Alabama followed by Georgia with 16%, Tennessee with 13%,
Florida with 12%, and Arkansas with 9%. Commercial loans in
Louisiana account for 7% of the portfolio, followed by Texas and
Indiana with 5% each, Missouri with 4%, Illinois and Mississippi
with 3% each, South Carolina with 2%, and Iowa, Kentucky and
North Carolina with 1% each. A small portion of these loans is
secured by properties outside Regions’ banking market areas.

Included in the commercial loan classification
are approximately $1.8 billion of syndicated loans.
Syndicated loans are typically made to national companies and
are originated through an agent bank. Regions’ syndicated
loans are primarily to national companies with operations in
Regions’ banking footprint.

From 2001 to 2005, net commercial loan losses as
a percent of average commercial loans outstanding ranged from a
low of 0.52% in 2005 to a high of 0.88% in 2001. Commercial loan
losses in 2005 totaled $77.2 million, or 0.52% of average
commercial loans compared to 0.61% in 2004. The lower percentage
of commercial loan losses in 2005 compared to 2004 resulted
primarily from continued positive economic conditions. Future
losses are a function of many variables, of which general
economic conditions are the most important. Assuming moderate to
slow economic growth during 2006 in Regions’ market areas
and immaterial impact on Regions’ commercial loan portfolio
from Hurricane Katrina, commercial loan losses in 2006 are
expected to approximate 2005 levels. However, commercial loan
losses may be higher than expected in 2006 as a result of slower
than expected economic growth, unexpected losses from the
hurricane season, and our inability to properly assess the
credit of borrowers and underlying collateral value due to a
number of factors, including environmental and other hazard
factors.


Real Estate.

Regions’ real estate loan portfolio consists of
construction and land development loans, loans to businesses for
long-term financing of land and buildings, loans on one-to
four-family residential properties, loans to mortgage banking
companies (which are secured primarily by loans on one- to
four-family residential properties and are known as warehoused
mortgage loans) and various other loans secured by real estate.

Real estate construction loans increased
$1.9 billion in 2005 to $7.4 billion, or 12.6% of
Regions’ total loan portfolio. Over the last five years,
real estate construction loans averaged 11.2% of Regions’
total loan portfolio. During 2002 and 2003, construction loan
demand declined as the economy exhibited signs of weakness. In
2004, as the economic conditions improved, loan demand increased
as new construction projects increased. During 2005,
construction loan demand increased due to generally strong
economic conditions. Most of the construction loans relate to
shopping centers, apartment complexes, commercial buildings and
residential property development. These loans are normally
secured by land and buildings and are generally backed by
commitments for long-term financing from other financial
institutions. Real estate construction loans are closely
monitored by management, since these loans are generally
considered riskier than other types of loans and are
particularly vulnerable in economic downturns and in periods of
high interest rates. Regions generally requires higher levels of
borrower equity investment in addition to other underwriting
requirements for this type of lending as compared to other real
estate lending. Regions has not been an active lender to real
estate developers outside its market areas.

The loans to businesses for long-term financing
of land and buildings are primarily to commercial customers
within Regions’ markets. Total loans secured by non-farm,
non-residential properties totaled $12.8 billion at
December 31, 2005. Although some risk is inherent in this
type of lending, Regions attempts to minimize this risk by
generally making a significant amount of loans of this type only
on owner-occupied properties, and by requiring collateral values
that exceed the loan amount, adequate cash flow to service the
debt, and in most cases, the personal guarantees of principals
of the borrowers.

Regions also attempts to mitigate the risks of
real estate lending by adhering to standard loan underwriting
policies and by diversifying the portfolio both geographically
within its market area and within industry groups.

Loans on one-to four-family residential
properties, which total approximately 52% of Regions’ real
estate mortgage portfolio, are principally on single-family
residences. These loans are geographically dispersed throughout
Regions’ market areas, and some are guaranteed by
government agencies or private mortgage insurers. Historically,
this category of loans has not produced sizable loan losses;
however, it is subject to some of the same risks as other real
estate lending. Warehoused mortgage loans, since they are
secured primarily by loans on one- to four-family residential
properties, are similar to these loans in terms of risk.

From 2001 to 2005, net losses on real estate
loans as a percent of average real estate loans outstanding
ranged from a high of 0.10% in 2004 and 2005, to a low of 0.04%
in 2001. In 2005, real estate loan losses were relatively flat
as compared to 2004. These losses depend, to a large degree, on
the level of interest rates, economic conditions and collateral
values, and thus, are very difficult to predict. Management
expects 2006 net real estate loan losses to increase
slightly above 2005 levels. Net losses on real estate loans in
2006 may be higher as a result of borrower defaults, risks
associated with construction loans such as cost overruns,
project completion risk, general contractor credit risk,
environmental and other hazard risks and market risks associated
with the sale of completed residential units.

Consumer.

Regions’ consumer loan portfolio consists of
$3.5 billion in consumer loans and $5.8 billion in
personal lines of credit (including home equity loans). Consumer
loans are primarily borrowings of individuals for home
improvements, automobiles and other personal and household
purposes. Regions’ consumer loan portfolio included
$335 million of indirect consumer auto loans at
December 31, 2005, $656 million at December 31,
2004 and $10 million at December 31, 2003. Indirect
consumer loans decreased significantly in 2005 due to run off of
the existing portfolio and no new origination of this category
of loans. Personal lines of credit increased $557.7 million
in 2005 due to marketing and sales initiatives promoting home
equity loans. During the past five years, the ratio of net
consumer loan losses to average consumer loans ranged from a low
of 0.27% in 2005 to a high of 0.62% in 2001. Consumer loan
losses decreased in 2005 due to a continued relatively strong
overall economic environment. Consumer loan losses are difficult
to predict but historically have tended to increase during
periods of economic weakness. Management expects net consumer
loan losses in 2006 to increase slightly above 2005 levels.


Non-Performing Assets

At December 31, 2005, non-accrual loans
totaled $341.2 million, or 0.59% of average loans, compared
to $388.4 million, or 0.68% of average loans, at
December 31, 2004. The decrease in non-accrual loans at
December 31, 2005, was primarily due to the disposition of
a single large commercial credit. Commercial loans amounted to
$93.7 million of the 2005 total, with real estate loans
accounting for $228.3 million and consumer loans
$19.2 million. Regions’ non-performing loan portfolio
is composed primarily of a number of small to medium-sized loans
that are diversified geographically throughout its franchise.
The 25 largest non-accrual loans range from $1.0 million to
$7.4 million. These loans are widely dispersed among a
number of industries and are generally highly collateralized. Of
the $341.2 million in non-accrual loans at
December 31, 2005, approximately $153.5 million (45%
of total non-accrual loans) are secured by single-family
residences, which historically have had very low loss ratios.

Other real estate totaled $65.5 million at
December 31, 2005, $63.6 million at December 31,
2004, and $52.2 million at December 31, 2003. The
increase in other real estate in 2004 compared to the prior year
resulted primarily from parcels added in connection with the
Union Planters transaction. Regions’ other real estate is
composed primarily of a number of small to medium-size
properties that are diversified geographically throughout its
franchise. The 25 largest parcels of other real estate range in
recorded value from $275,000 to $5.7 million, with only
four parcels over $1 million. Other real estate is recorded
at the lower of (1) the recorded investment in the loan or
(2) fair value less the estimated cost to sell. Although
Regions does not anticipate material loss upon disposition of
other real estate, sustained periods of adverse economic
conditions, substantial declines in real estate values in
Regions’ markets, actions by bank regulatory agencies or
other factors, could result in additional loss from other real
estate.

The amount of interest income recognized in 2005
on the $341.2 million of non-accruing loans outstanding at
year-end was approximately $11.7 million. If these loans
had been current in accordance with their original terms,
approximately $36.7 million would have been recognized on
these loans in 2005.

Loans contractually past due 90 days or more
were 0.15% of total loans at December 31, 2005, compared to
0.13% of total loans at December 31, 2004. Since
December 31, 2004, loan delinquencies have increased,
primarily related to increases in delinquencies in the consumer
loan portfolio. Loans past due 90 days or more at
December 31, 2005 consisted of $44.7 million in
commercial and real estate loans and $42.8 million in
consumer loans. Loans with temporary payment deferrals related
to Hurricane Katrina are not categorized as past due
90 days or more at December 31, 2005; however, future
periods may be impacted as payment deferrals expired in December
2005.

Funding Commitments

In the normal course of business, Regions makes
commitments under various terms to lend funds to its customers.
These commitments include (among others) revolving credit
agreements, term loan agreements and short-term borrowing
arrangements, which are usually for working capital needs. Many
of these commitments are expected to expire without being
funded; therefore, total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent future liquidity requirements. Letters of credit are
also issued, which under certain conditions could result in
loans. See Note 13 “Commitments and
Contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements for
additional information. The following table shows the amount and
duration of Regions’ funding commitments.


Loans by SIC Code

The commercial, real estate and consumer loan
portfolios are highly diversified in terms of industry
concentrations. The following table shows the largest
concentrations in terms of the customers’ Standard
Industrial Classification Code at December 31, 2005 and
2004:


Interest-Bearing Deposits In Other
Banks

Interest-bearing deposits in other banks are used
primarily as temporary investments and generally have short-term
maturities. This category of earning assets decreased from
$115.0 million at December 31, 2004, to
$92.1 million at December 31, 2005, as maturities were
not reinvested in this earning asset category.

Securities

The following table shows the carrying values of
securities by category:

In 2005, total securities decreased
$637 million, or 5%, due primarily to the government and
agency securities sold during 2005 for balance sheet management
purposes. Partially offsetting the decrease, mortgage-backed
securities increased $447.4 million, as purchases of such
securities were used to manage interest rate sensitivity.

In 2004, total securities increased
$3.5 billion, or 39%, due primarily to securities added
through the Union Planters transaction. U.S. Treasury and
Federal agency securities increased $1.8 billion due to the
Union Planters acquisition, partially offset by sales of agency
securities. Agency securities were sold in 2004 for balance
sheet management purposes. Mortgage-backed securities increased
$1.3 billion due to balances added in connection with the
merger with Union Planters, partially offset by maturities as
well as sales of mortgage-backed securities to manage interest
rate sensitivity.

Regions’ investment portfolio policy
stresses quality and liquidity. At December 31, 2005, the
average contractual maturity of U.S. Treasury and Federal
agency securities and obligations of states and political
subdivisions was 5.0 years and 6.7 years,
respectively. The average contractual maturity of
mortgage-backed securities was 16.0 years and the average
expected maturity was 3.3 years. Other securities had an
average contractual maturity of 12.9 years. Overall, the
average maturity of the portfolio was 12.3 years using
contractual maturities and 3.7 years using expected
maturities. Expected maturities differ from contractual
maturities because borrowers have the right to call or prepay
obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

The estimated fair market value of Regions’
securities held to maturity portfolio at December 31, 2005,
was $4.4 million below the amount carried on Regions’
books. Regions’ securities held to maturity at
December 31, 2005 included gross unrealized losses of
$4.4 million and no gross unrealized gains. Regions’
securities available for sale portfolio at December 31,
2005, included net unrealized losses of $139.6 million.
Regions’ securities available for sale portfolio included
gross unrealized gains of $42.9 million and gross
unrealized losses of $182.5 million at December 31,
2005. Market values of these portfolios vary significantly as
interest rates change. Management expects normal maturities from
the securities portfolios to meet liquidity needs. Of
Regions’ tax-free securities rated by Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc., 99% are rated “A” or


better. The portfolio is carefully monitored to
assure no unreasonable concentration of securities in the
obligations of a single debtor, and current credit reviews are
conducted on each security holding.

The following table shows the contractual
maturities of securities (excluding equity securities) at
December 31, 2005, the weighted average yields and the
taxable equivalent adjustment used in calculating the yields:

Note:

The weighted average yields are calculated on the
    basis of the yield to maturity based on the book value of each
    security. Weighted average yields on tax-exempt obligations have
    been computed on a fully taxable equivalent basis using a tax
    rate of 35%. Yields on tax-exempt obligations have not been
    adjusted for the non-deductible portion of interest expense used
    to finance the purchase of tax-exempt obligations.

Trading Account Assets

Trading account assets increased
$63.4 million to $992.1 million at December 31,
2005. Trading account assets are held for the purpose of selling
at a profit and are carried at market value.

The following table shows the carrying value of
trading account assets by type of security.

Loans held for sale consisted of residential real
estate mortgage loans in 2005; in the prior year, this category
also included factored accounts receivables and asset-based
loans. These loans totaled $1.5 billion at
December 31, 2005, a decrease of $252 million compared
to December 31, 2004. This decrease was due primarily to
the sale of the factored accounts receivables and asset-based
loans during 2005, as well as normal sales of mortgage loans
during the year.

Margin Receivables

Margin receivables totaled $527.3 million at
December 31, 2005, and $477.8 million at
December 31, 2004. Margin receivables represent funds
advanced to brokerage customers for the purchase of securities
that are secured by certain marketable securities held in the
customer’s brokerage account. The risk of loss from these
receivables is minimized by requiring that customers maintain
marketable securities in the brokerage account which have a fair
market value substantially in excess of the funds advanced to
the customer.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment at December 31, 2005
increased by $33.2 million from the prior year. This
increase resulted from the normal addition of premises and
equipment related to new branches added during 2005, partially
offset by a $21.5 million decrease in premises related to a
second quarter 2005 transaction whereby Regions sold certain
properties to a third party, but agreed to lease back a portion
of these properties (see Note 10 “Borrowed Funds”
and Note 12 “Leases” to the consolidated
financial statements). In addition, Regions wrote off
approximately $1.9 million of property destroyed by
Hurricane Katrina during 2005.

Excess Purchase Price

Excess purchase price at December 31, 2005
and December 31, 2004 totaled $5.0 billion. A
significant portion of this amount is related to excess purchase
price added in connection with the merger with Union Planters
(see Note 18 “Business Combinations” to the
consolidated financial statements).

Other Identifiable Intangible Assets

Other identifiable intangible assets totaled
$314.4 million at December 31, 2005, compared to
$356.9 million at December 31, 2004. The decrease from
2004 is attributable to amortization of identifiable intangible
assets. This category of assets consists primarily of core
deposit intangibles added in connection with the Union Planters
transaction.

Other Assets

Other assets decreased $31.7 million
compared to December 31, 2004. This decrease was primarily
the result of decreases in investments in low-income housing
partnerships, trading receivables due from customers, and
derivative assets.

Liquidity

General

Liquidity is an important factor in the financial
condition of Regions and affects Regions’ ability to meet
the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of its
customers. Assets, consisting principally of loans and
securities, are funded by customer deposits, purchased funds,
borrowed funds and stockholders’ equity.

The securities portfolio is one of Regions’
primary sources of liquidity. Maturities of securities provide a
constant flow of funds available for cash needs (see previous
table on Securities Maturing). Maturities in the loan portfolio
also provide a steady flow of funds (see previous table on Loans
Maturing). At December 31, 2005, commercial loans, real
estate construction loans and commercial mortgage loans with an
aggregate


balance of $15.5 billion, as well as
securities of $535 million, were due to mature in one year
or less. Additional funds are provided from payments on consumer
loans and one- to four-family residential mortgage loans.
Historically, Regions’ high levels of earnings have also
contributed to cash flow. In addition, liquidity needs can be
met by the purchase of funds in state and national money
markets. Regions’ liquidity also continues to be enhanced
by a relatively stable deposit base.

The loan to deposit ratio was 96.73% at
December 31, 2005, representing a decrease compared to
98.06% and 98.33% at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. This decrease is the result of deposit growth
exceeding loan growth in 2004 and 2005.

As reflected in the consolidated statement of
cash flows, operating activities provided significant levels of
funds in 2005, 2004 and 2003, due primarily to high levels of
net income. Investing activities were a net user of funds in
2005, primarily due to purchases of securities available for
sale and loan growth, partially offset by proceeds from the sale
and maturity of securities available for sale. Securities were
sold in 2005 to manage interest rate sensitivity. Investing
activities, primarily in loans and securities, were a net
provider of funds in 2004 and a net user of funds in 2003. Loan
growth in 2003 required a significant amount of funds for
investing activities. Funds needed for investing activities in
2003 were provided primarily by deposits, purchased funds and
borrowings.

Financing activities were a net user of funds in
2005, as cash dividends and the purchase of treasury stock
increased compared to 2004. Increased deposits provided funds in
2005 and 2004. In 2004, financing activities were a net user of
funds as payments on long-term borrowings used funding, based on
Regions’ decreased dependence on borrowed funds (excluding
borrowings added in connection with acquisitions) as a funding
source. In 2003, financing activities were a net user of funds
as a result of declining deposit balances and increased payments
on borrowed funds. Cash dividends and the open-market purchase
of Regions’ common stock also required funds in 2004 and
2003.

Regions’ financing arrangement with the
Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of Atlanta adds
additional flexibility in managing its liquidity position. The
maximum amount that could be borrowed from the FHLB under the
current borrowing agreement is approximately $24.3 billion
(see Note 10 “Borrowed Funds” to the consolidated
financial statements). Additional investment in FHLB stock is
required with each advance. The FHLB has been and is expected to
continue to be a reliable and economical source of funding and
can be used to fund debt maturities as well as other
obligations. As of December 31, 2005, Regions’
borrowings from the FHLB totaled $1.9 billion.

During the second quarter of 2005, Regions filed
a universal shelf registration statement that allows the company
to issue up to $2 billion of various debt and equity
securities at market rates for future funding and liquidity
needs. On August 3, 2005, Regions issued $750 million
of senior debt notes ($400 million of 3-year floating rate
notes and $350 million of 3-year fixed rate notes) under
the above universal shelf registration statement.

In addition, Regions’ bank subsidiary has
the requisite agreements in place to issue and sell up to
$5 billion of bank notes to institutional investors through
placement agents. As of December 31, 2005, approximately
$1 billion of bank notes were outstanding, including
$400 million under a previous agreement and
$600 million assumed through acquisitions. The issuance of
additional bank notes could provide a significant source of
liquidity and funding to meet future needs.

Morgan Keegan maintains certain lines of credit
with unaffiliated banks to manage liquidity in the ordinary
course of business (see Note 10 “Borrowed Funds”
to the consolidated financial statements).

If Regions is unable to maintain or renew its
financing arrangements, obtain funding in the capital markets on
reasonable terms or experiences a decrease in earnings, it may
be required to slow or reduce the growth of the assets on its
balance sheet which may adversely impact its earnings.


Ratings

The table below reflects the most recent debt
ratings of Regions Financial Corporation and Regions Bank by
Standard & Poor’s Corporation, Moody’s
Investors Service and Fitch IBCA:

A security rating is not a recommendation to buy,
sell or hold securities, and the ratings above are subject to
revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating
agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any
other rating.

The trust that issued the trust preferred
securities was deconsolidated on December 31, 2003, in
connection with the implementation of Financial Accounting
Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities” (FIN 46). Upon
deconsolidation, the junior subordinated notes that are owned by
the trust were included in consolidated long-term borrowings.
Payments made by the Company on the junior subordinated notes
fully fund the payments made by the trust on the rated trust
preferred securities. See Note 19 “Variable Interest
Entities” for additional discussion on the deconsolidation
of the trust.

Deposits

Deposits are Regions’ primary source of
funds, providing funding for 80% of average earning assets in
2005, 76% in 2004 and 73% in 2003. During the last five years,
average total deposits increased at a compound annual rate of
18%. Deposit growth was significantly impacted by the merger
with Union Planters in 2004. The Union Planters transaction
added $22.9 billion of total deposits (contributing
$11.5 billion of average deposits in 2004 due to the
mid-year closing of the transaction and $11.4 billion for
the full year impact in 2005).

Regions acquired Union Planters on July 1,
2004; thus, average balances in 2004 reflected only six months
of impact from the merger. Average balances in 2005, however,
reflect the full year of impact on deposits added from the
merger. The impact of deposits added in connection with the
Union Planters merger is a primary factor in the discussion of
variances between 2005 and prior years below.

Total deposits added in connection with the Union
Planters merger in 2004 are summarized in the following table.

Average deposits increased $14.7 billion, or
33%, in 2005, $12.9 billion, or 40%, in 2004 and
$755 million, or 2%, in 2003. Acquisitions contributed
average deposit growth of approximately $11.4 billion in
2005, $11.5 billion in 2004 and $14.0 million in 2003.
The $11.5 billion of deposits added through acquisitions in


2004, consisted of $2.7 billion of
non-interest-bearing deposits and $8.8 billion of
interest-bearing deposits and significantly impact comparisons
with prior periods discussed in the remainder of this section.

Regions competes with other banking and financial
services companies for a share of the deposit market.
Regions’ ability to compete in the deposit market depends
heavily on how effectively the Company meets customers’
needs. Regions employs both traditional and non-traditional
means to meet customers’ needs and enhance competitiveness.
The traditional means include providing well-designed products,
providing a high level of customer service, providing attractive
pricing and expanding the traditional branch network to provide
convenient branch locations for customers throughout the South,
Midwest and Texas. Regions also employs non-traditional
approaches to enhance its competitiveness. These include
providing centralized, high quality telephone banking services
and alternative product delivery channels such as internet
banking. Regions’ success at competing for deposits is
discussed below.

Average non-interest-bearing deposits have
increased at a compound growth rate of 35% since 2002. This
category of deposits grew 40% in 2005, 61% in 2004, and 9% in
2003. Deposit growth in 2005 in this category was primarily
attributable to an increase in free-checking deposit accounts,
the full-year impact of deposits added in connection with the
Union Planters merger (see above) and increases in deposits in
areas affected by Hurricane Katrina. Non-interest-bearing
deposits continue to be a significant funding source for
Regions, accounting for approximately 20% of average total
deposits in 2005, 19% in 2004 and 17% in 2003.

Savings account balances have increased at a 27%
compound growth rate since 2002. Average savings account
balances increased 34% in 2005 and 53% in 2004, primarily
resulting from the impact of accounts added in connection with
the Union Planters acquisition. Balances declined slightly in
2003 as rates paid on these accounts were less attractive than
other investment alternatives. Management expects savings
accounts to continue to be a stable funding source, but does not
expect significant growth, as these accounts may be less
attractive than other investment alternatives for many
investors. In 2005 and 2004, savings accounts comprised
approximately 5% of average total deposits compared to 4% of
average total deposits in 2003.

Interest-bearing transaction accounts have
increased at a 44% compound growth rate since 2002. Average
interest-bearing transaction account balances decreased 2% in
2005, as investors chose other investment alternatives, compared
to an increase of 31% in 2004 and 134% in 2003 as investors
migrated toward more liquid assets given market conditions in
those periods. Interest-bearing transaction accounts accounted
for 5% of average total deposits in 2005 and 7% in 2004 and 2003.

Money market savings accounts have increased at a
compound annual rate of 21% since 2002. In 2005, the average
balance for money market savings accounts increased 26% compared
to 2004, due to the full year impact of money market accounts
added in connection with the Union Planters merger, as well as
customers seeking liquid deposit accounts with a more attractive
rate of return. Money market savings accounts increased 42% in
2004, primarily due to acquisitions. In 2003, as Regions less
aggressively priced money market savings products, average
balances declined 2%. Money market savings products are one of
Regions’ most significant funding sources, accounting for
32% of average total deposits in 2005, 34% of average total
deposits in 2004 and 33% of average total deposits in 2003.

The average balance of certificates of deposit of
$100,000 or more accounts increased 63% in 2005, primarily due
to customer preference for higher-rate deposits, competitive
pricing on these deposit instruments, and full-year impact of
accounts added in connection with the Union Planters acquisition
in 2004. This category of deposits increased 53% in 2004, due
primarily to the deposits added in connection with the Union
Planters merger. Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more
increased 2% in 2003 due to less maturities of high cost
certificates of deposits than in prior years. Certificates of
deposit of $100,000 or more accounted for 13% of average total
deposits in 2005, 11% in 2004, and 10% in 2003.

The average balance of other interest-bearing
deposits (certificates of deposit of less than $100,000 and time
open accounts) increased 31% in 2005, due primarily to
attractive rates and the full year impact of accounts added in
connection with the Union Planters acquisition in 2004. In 2004,
this category increased 22%, primarily due to acquisitions and
internal growth in retail certificates of deposits based on more
attractive market interest rates. In 2003, this category of
deposits declined 8% as rates on these accounts were less


attractive to investors and Regions reduced
utilization of certain wholesale deposits as a funding source.
This category of deposits continues to be one of Regions’
primary funding sources; it accounted for 25% of average total
deposits in 2005 and 2004, and 29% of average total deposits in
2003.

Lower-cost deposits, which include non-interest
bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts,
savings accounts and money market savings accounts, totaled 62%
of average deposits in 2005, compared to 65% in 2004 and 61% in
2003. During 2005, customers migrated toward certificates of
deposit due to the rising interest rate environment, resulting
in a decrease in the percentage of low-cost deposits to average
deposits. During 2004 and 2003, the percentage of low-cost
deposits to average deposits increased, due to management
initiatives to increase lower-cost deposit products as a source
of funding, while reducing the company’s reliance on
higher-cost deposit products such as certificates of deposit and
wholesale deposit products.

The sensitivity of Regions’ deposit rates to
changes in market interest rates is reflected in Regions’
average interest rate paid on interest-bearing deposits. Market
interest rates declined 25 basis points in 2003, increased
125 basis points in the latter half of 2004, and increased
another 200 basis points during 2005. While Regions’
average interest rate paid on interest-bearing deposits follows
these trends, a lag period exists between the change in market
rates and the repricing of the deposits. The rate paid on
interest-bearing deposits decreased from 1.61% in 2003 to 1.37%
in 2004, but increased to 2.11% in 2005.

A detail of interest-bearing deposit balances at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the interest expense on
these deposits for the three years ended December 31, 2005,
is presented in Note 9 “Deposits” to the
consolidated financial statements. The following table presents
the average rates paid on deposits by category for the three
years ended December 31, 2005:

The following table presents the details of
interest-bearing deposits and maturities of the larger time
deposits at December 31, 2005 and 2004:


The following table presents the average amounts
of deposits outstanding by category for the three years ended
December 31, 2005:

Borrowed Funds

Regions’ short-term borrowings consist of
federal funds purchased and security repurchase agreements, FHLB
structured notes, due to brokerage customers, and other
short-term borrowings.

Federal funds purchased and security repurchase
agreements are used to satisfy daily funding needs and, when
advantageous, for rate arbitrage. Federal funds purchased and
security repurchase agreements totaled $3.9 billion at
December 31, 2005 and $4.7 billion at
December 31, 2004. Balances in these accounts can fluctuate
significantly on a day-to-day basis. The average daily balance
of federal funds purchased and security repurchase agreements,
net of federal funds sold and security reverse repurchase
agreements, decreased $353 million in 2005 due to reduced
reliance on purchased funds to support earning asset growth, and
increased $1.3 billion in 2004 as this funding source was
more widely used to support growth in earning assets.

At December 31, 2005, no FHLB structured
notes were outstanding, compared to $350 million of
structured notes outstanding at both December 31, 2004 and
2003, due to the maturities of the notes during 2005 (see
Note 10 “Borrowed Funds” to the consolidated
financial statements). During 2003, Regions prepaid
$350 million of these advances in addition to maturities of
$150 million. Regions incurred a $11.5 million charge
related to the prepayment in 2003 that is recorded in other
non-interest expense (see Note 16 “Other Income and
Expense” to the consolidated financial statements).

Morgan Keegan maintains certain lines of credit
with unaffiliated banks. As of December 31, 2005,
$129.7 million was outstanding under these agreements with
an average interest rate of 4.5%, compared to $56.4 million
outstanding at December 31, 2004, with an average interest
rate of 2.6%.

Regions maintains a due to brokerage customer
position through Morgan Keegan. This represents liquid funds in
customers’ brokerage accounts. The due to brokerage
customers totaled $547.7 million at December 31, 2005,
with an interest rate of 1.7%, as compared to
$457.7 million at December 31, 2004, with an interest
rate of 0.7%.

Regions holds cash as collateral for certain
derivative and other transactions with customers and other third
parties. Upon the expiration of these agreements, cash held as
collateral will be remitted to the counter-party. As of
December 31, 2005, these balances totaled
$22.5 million with an interest rate of 4.1%, as compared to
$75.8 million at December 31, 2004 with an interest
rate of 2.0%.

Other short-term borrowings decreased by
$37.5 million from December 31, 2004, due primarily to
a decrease in the short sale liability, which is frequently used
by Morgan Keegan to offset other market risks undertaken in the
normal course of business.


Regions’ long-term borrowings consist
primarily of subordinated notes, FHLB borrowings, senior notes
and other long-term notes payable.

As of December 31, 2005, Regions had
subordinated notes of $2.1 billion, compared to
$2.2 billion at December 31, 2004. The merger with
Union Planters added $1.0 billion in subordinated notes in
2004. Regions subordinated notes consist of five issues with
interest rates ranging from 6.375% to 7.75%. A schedule of
maturities is included in the table at the end of this section.

During 2005 and 2004, Regions utilized FHLB
structured notes with original call periods in excess of one
year. These structured notes have various stated maturities but
are callable, at the option of the FHLB, between one and two
years. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, $1.0 billion
and $1.8 billion of long-term Federal Home Loan Bank
advances were outstanding, respectively. In 2005, Regions
prepaid $600 million of these borrowings, and as a result
incurred a $10.9 million charge, which is recorded in other
non-interest expense (see Note 16 “Other Income and
Expense” to the consolidated financial statements). In
2004, Regions prepaid $1.1 billion of these notes and as a
result, incurred a $39.6 million charge which was recorded
in other non-interest expense.

Federal Home Loan Bank long-term advances
totaled $837 million at December 31, 2005, a decrease
of $109 million compared to 2004, due to maturities during
2005. Regions utilized this source of funding due to favorable
interest rates and terms during 2004, but utilized more
advantageous alternate sources of funding during 2005.
Membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system provides
access to an additional source of lower-cost funds.

Regions issued $288 million of trust
preferred securities in February 2001. These securities, which
qualify as Tier 1 capital, have an interest rate of 8.00%
and a 30-year term, but are callable after five years. In
addition, Regions assumed $4 million of trust preferred
securities in connection with a 2001 acquisition. Effective
December 31, 2003, all trust preferred securities were
deconsolidated in accordance with FIN 46 (see Note 19
“Variable Interest Entities” to the consolidated
financial statements).

As a result of the deconsolidation of trust
preferred securities, effective December 31, 2003, Regions
began reporting $301 million of junior subordinated notes.
These junior subordinated notes are issued by Regions to a
subsidiary business trust, which issued the trust preferred
securities discussed previously (see Note 19 “Variable
Interest Entities” to the consolidated financial
statements). In connection with the acquisition of Union
Planters, Regions assumed $224.3 million of 8.2% junior
subordinated notes which were issued to subsidiary business
trusts. Subsequent to December 31, 2005, the
$288 million of Regions trust preferred securities were
called and related junior subordinated notes were extinguished.
In the first quarter of 2006, Regions recorded a pre-tax charge
of approximately $7.7 million in connection with the
exercise of the call option and early extinguishment of debt.

Senior debt and bank notes totaled
$2.2 billion at December 31, 2005, compared to
$1.5 billion at December 31, 2004. The increase is
related to $350 million of 3-year fixed rate and
$400 million of 3-year floating rate senior notes issued
during 2005.

Other long-term borrowings consist of redeemable
trust preferred securities, notes issued to former stockholders
of acquired banks, notes for equipment financing, mark-to-market
adjustments related to hedged debt items, and miscellaneous
notes payable.


The following table shows the amount and maturity
of Regions’ long term borrowed funds as of
December 31, 2005.

Stockholders’ Equity

Over the past three years, stockholders’
equity has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 36%.
Stockholders’ equity has grown from $4.2 billion at
the beginning of 2003 to $10.6 billion at year-end 2005.
Equity issued in connection with acquisitions, net of treasury
share repurchases, added $5.2 billion, including
$6.0 billion in equity issued in connection with the Union
Planters merger. Internally generated retained earnings
contributed $1.1 billion of this growth and
$369.9 million was attributable to the exercise of stock
options and to the issuance of stock for employee incentive
plans. The internal capital generation rate (net income less
dividends as a percentage of average stockholders’ equity)
was 3.5% in 2005, compared to 4.3% in 2004 and 8.7% in 2003.
This ratio declined in 2005 primarily due to a significant
increase in cash dividends during the year.

On October 20, 2005, Regions’ Board of
Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional
25 million shares of Regions’ common stock from time
to time through open market transactions. This authorization was
in addition to the 6.4 million shares available for
repurchase under a previous authorization. During 2005, Regions
repurchased, under the current and previous repurchase
authorizations, 16.6 million shares at a total cost of
$552.5 million. At December 31, 2005,
27.6 million shares were available for repurchase under
current and previous repurchase authorizations.

Regions’ ratio of stockholders’ equity
to total assets was 12.52% at December 31, 2005, compared
to 12.78% at December 31, 2004, and 9.16% at
December 31, 2003. This ratio decreased slightly during
2005 due to increased share repurchases. Regions’ ratio of
tangible stockholders’ equity (stockholders’ equity
less excess purchase price and other identifiable intangibles)
to total assets was 6.64% at December 31, 2005 compared to
6.42% at December 31, 2004 and 6.92% at December 31,
2003.

Regions attempts to balance the return to
stockholders through the payment of dividends with the need to
maintain strong capital levels for future growth opportunities.
In 2005, Regions returned 63% of earnings to its stockholders in
the form of dividends. Total dividends declared by Regions in
2005 were $628.6 million, or $1.36 per share, an
increase of 2% from the $1.33 per share in 2004.

In January of 2006, the Board of Directors
declared a 2.9% increase in the quarterly cash dividend from
$.34 to $.35 per share. This is the 35th consecutive
year that Regions has increased quarterly cash dividends.


Bank Regulatory Capital Requirements

Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply
with capital adequacy standards established by banking
regulatory agencies. Currently, there are two basic measures of
capital adequacy: a risk-based measure and a leverage measure.

The risk-based capital standards are designed to
make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to
differences in risk profiles among banks and financial holding
companies, to account for off-balance sheet exposure and
interest rate risk and to minimize disincentives for holding
liquid assets. Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned
to broad risk categories, each with specified risk-weighting
factors. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a
percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet
items. Banking organizations that are considered to have
excessive interest rate risk exposure are required to maintain
additional capital.

The minimum standard for the ratio of total
capital to risk-weighted assets is 8%. At least 50% of that
capital level must consist of common equity, undivided profits
and non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, less goodwill and
certain other intangibles (“Tier 1 capital”). The
remainder (“Tier 2 capital”) may consist of a
limited amount of other preferred stock, mandatory convertible
securities, subordinated debt and a limited amount of the
allowance for loan losses. The sum of Tier 1 capital and
Tier 2 capital is “total risk-based capital.”

The banking regulatory agencies also have adopted
regulations that supplement the risk-based guidelines to include
a minimum ratio of 3% of Tier 1 capital to average assets
less goodwill (the “leverage ratio”). Depending upon
the risk profile of the institution and other factors, the
regulatory agencies may require a leverage ratio of 1% to 2%
above the minimum 3% level.

The following chart summarizes the applicable
bank regulatory capital requirements. Regions’ capital
ratios at December 31, 2005, substantially exceeded all
regulatory requirements.

At December 31, 2005, Tier 1 capital
totaled $5.9 billion, total risk-based capital totaled
$8.8 billion and risk-adjusted assets totaled
$79.8 billion.

Total capital at Regions Bank also has an
important effect on the amount of FDIC insurance premiums paid.
Institutions not considered well capitalized can be subject to
higher rates for FDIC insurance. As of December 31, 2005,
Regions Bank had the requisite capital levels to qualify as well
capitalized (see Note 22 “Regulatory Capital
Requirements” to the consolidated financial statements).


Consolidated Average Balances

The following table shows the percentage
distribution of Regions’ consolidated average balances of
assets, liabilities and stockholders’ equity as of the
dates shown:

Please refer to Item 6 of this annual report
on Form 10-K for a complete presentation of average
balances, related interest, yields and rates paid.


Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual
Obligations

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In the normal course of business, Regions enters
into certain relationships characterized as off-balance sheet
arrangements. At December 31, 2005, these relationships
included obligations under standby letters of credit and
variable interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities.
At December 31, 2005, the fair value of Regions’
obligation under loan standby letters of credit was
$46.4 million with a maximum potential obligation of
$3.1 billion (see Note 13 “Commitments and
Contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements).
At December 31, 2005, Regions’ investment in
unconsolidated variable interest entities was
$232.0 million with a maximum exposure to loss of
$249.8 million (see Note 19 “Variable Interest
Entities” to the consolidated financial statements).

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes Regions’
contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2005:

A discussion regarding liquidity related to
long-term borrowings is included in the “Liquidity”
section presented earlier. Regions intends to fund the other
contractual obligations presented in the table above primarily
through cash generated from normal operations.


Operating Results

General

Net income available to common shareholders
increased 22% in 2005, 25% in 2004 and 5% in 2003. The
accompanying table presents the dollar amount and percentage
change in the important components of income that occurred in
2004 and 2005.

Summary Of Changes In Operating
Results

Net Interest Income

Net interest income (interest income less
interest expense) is Regions’ principal source of income.
Net interest income increased 33% in 2005 and 43% in 2004. On a
taxable equivalent basis, net interest income increased 33% in
2005 and 42% in 2004. The following table “Analysis of
Changes in Net Interest Income” provides additional
information to analyze the changes in net interest income.

Regions measures its ability to produce net
interest income with a ratio called the interest margin. The
interest margin is net interest income (on a taxable equivalent
basis) as a percentage of average earning assets. The interest
margin increased from 3.49% in 2003 to 3.66% in 2004 to 3.91% in
2005. Changes in the interest margin occur primarily due to two
factors: (1) the interest rate spread (the difference
between the taxable equivalent yield on earning assets and the
rate on interest-bearing liabilities) and (2) the
percentage of earning assets funded by interest-bearing
liabilities.


The first factor affecting Regions’ interest
margin is the interest rate spread. Regions’ average
interest rate spread was 3.44% in 2005, 3.35% in 2004 and 3.19%
in 2003. Market interest rates, both the level of rates and the
slope of the yield curve (the spread between short-term rates
and longer-term rates), affect the interest rate spread by
influencing the pricing on most categories of Regions’
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

After reducing the Federal Funds rate
significantly in 2001, the Federal Reserve Board reduced the
Federal Funds rate 50 basis points in 2002 and
25 basis points in 2003. As the economy experienced growth,
the Fed increased the Federal Funds rate five times totaling
125 basis points in the second half of 2004. In 2005, the
Fed increased the Federal Funds rate eight times totaling
200 basis points in response to economic growth and
inflation concerns. These increases resulted in a Federal Funds
rate of 4.25% at December 31, 2005.

Regions’ interest-earning asset yields and
interest-bearing liability rates were both higher in 2005 as
compared to 2004, reflecting increased average market interest
rates in 2005. In 2005, Regions’ interest-earning asset
yields increased 84 basis points while interest-bearing
liability rates increased 75 basis points, resulting in an
increased interest rate spread compared to 2004.

The mix of earning assets can also affect the
interest rate spread. During 2005, loans, which are typically
Regions’ most significant and highest yielding earning
asset, increased as a percentage of earning assets. This
increase contributed to higher earning asset yields. Average
loans as a percentage of earning assets was 78.0% in 2005 and
74.9% in 2004.

During 2005 and 2004, Regions used interest rate
derivatives as cash flow and fair value hedges of certain asset
and liability positions. These contracts had the effect of
increasing net interest income by $52.1 million in 2005 and
$106.8 million in 2004.

The second factor affecting the interest margin
is the percentage of earning assets funded by interest-bearing
liabilities. Funding for Regions’ earning assets comes from
interest-bearing liabilities, non-interest-bearing liabilities
and stockholders’ equity. The net spread on earning assets
funded by non-interest-bearing liabilities and
stockholders’ equity is higher than the net spread on
earning assets funded by interest-bearing liabilities. The
percentage of earning assets funded by interest-bearing
liabilities was 81% in 2005, 82% in 2004 and 85% in 2003. This
decline positively impacted the net interest margin as compared
to prior years. In the future, management expects that an
increasing percentage of funding will be provided from
interest-bearing liabilities.

Higher spreads, combined with significant growth
in average interest-earning assets from full-year impact of the
Union Planters merger in 2004, resulted in higher net interest
income in 2005. The increase in net interest income for 2004 was
due to higher spreads, combined with significant growth in
interest-earning assets due to the Union Planters merger. In
2006, Regions anticipates moderate compression of the net
interest margin as short-term rate increases begin to slow and
the benefit from the re-pricing lag for deposits diminishes. In
addition, if interest rates continue to rise in 2006, the demand
for loans and other interest-earning assets will generally be
reduced which could adversely impact Regions’ earnings by
putting further pressure on the compression of the interest
margin.


Analysis of Changes in Net Interest
Income

Note:

The change in interest due to both rate and
    volume has been allocated to change due to volume and change due
    to rate in proportion to the absolute dollar amounts of the
    change in each.

Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from
adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due
to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices,
equity prices, or the credit quality of debt securities.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

Regions’ primary market risk is interest
rate risk, including uncertainty with respect to absolute
interest rate levels as well as uncertainty with respect to
relative interest rate levels which impact both the shape and
the slope of the various yield curves affecting the financial
products and services that the Company offers. To quantify this
risk, Regions measures the change in its net interest income in
various interest rate scenarios as compared to a base case
scenario. Net interest income sensitivity (as measured over
12 months) is a useful short-term indicator of
Regions’ interest rate risk.

Sensitivity
Measurement.

Financial simulation
models are Regions’ primary tools used to measure interest
rate exposure. Using a wide range of hypothetical deterministic
and stochastic simulations, these tools provide management with
extensive information on the potential impact to net interest
income caused by changes in interest rates.

These models are structured to simulate cash
flows and accrual characteristics of Regions’ balance
sheet. Assumptions are made about the direction and volatility
of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, and the
changing composition of the balance sheet that result from both
strategic plans and from customer behavior. Among the
assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and
composition, the pricing and maturity characteristics of
existing business and the characteristics of future business.
Interest rate related risks are expressly considered, such as
pricing spreads, the lag time in pricing administered rate
accounts, prepayments and other option risks. Regions considers
these factors, as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty
surrounding their future behavior.


Financial derivative instruments are used in
hedging the values of selected assets and liabilities against
changes in interest rates. The effect of these hedges is
included in the simulations of net interest income.

The primary objectives of Asset/Liability
Management at Regions are balance sheet coordination and the
management of interest rate risk in achieving reasonable and
stable net interest income throughout various interest rate
cycles. A standard set of alternate interest rate scenarios is
compared to the results of the base case scenario to determine
the extent of potential fluctuations and to establish exposure
limits. The standard set of interest rate scenarios includes the
traditional instantaneous parallel rate shifts of plus and minus
100 and 200 basis points. In addition, Regions includes
simulations of gradual interest rate movements that may more
realistically mimic potential interest rate movements. The
gradual scenarios include curve steepening, flattening, and
parallel movements of various magnitudes phased in over a
6 month period.

Exposure to Interest Rate
Movements.

Based on the foregoing
discussion, management has estimated the potential effect of
shifts in interest rates on net interest income. As of
December 31, 2005, Regions maintained a slight asset
sensitive position to a gradual rate shift of plus or minus 100
or 200 basis points. The following table demonstrates the
expected effect that a gradual (over six months beginning at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively) parallel interest
rate shift would have on Regions’ net interest income.

As of December 31, 2005, Regions maintained
a slight asset sensitive position to an instantaneous rate shift
of plus or minus 100 or 200 basis points. The following
table demonstrates the expected effect that an instantaneous
parallel interest rate shift would have on Regions’ net
interest income.

Derivatives

Regions uses financial derivative instruments for
management of interest rate sensitivity. The Asset and Liability
Committee, in its oversight role for the management of interest
rate sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance
sheet hedging strategies. The most common derivatives the
Company employs are interest rate swaps, interest rate options,
forward sale commitments, interest rate and foreign exchange
forward contracts and credit default swaps.

Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements
typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable streams of
interest payments. The notional principal is not exchanged but
is used as a reference for the size of the interest payments.
Interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to
purchase or sell a financial instrument at a pre-determined
price and time. Forward sale commitments are contractual
obligations to sell money market instruments at a future date
for an already agreed upon price. Foreign exchange forwards are


contractual agreements to receive or deliver a
foreign currency at an agreed upon future date and price. Credit
default swaps are contractual agreements between counterparties
whereby one party pays the other at a fixed periodic rate for
the specified life of the agreement. The other party makes no
payments unless a specified credit event occurs. Credit events
are typically defined to include a material default, bankruptcy
or debt restructuring for a specified reference asset. If such a
credit event occurs, the party makes a payment to the first
party, and the swap then terminates.

Regions has made use of interest rate swaps and
interest rate options to convert a portion of its fixed-rate
funding position to a variable rate position. Regions also uses
derivatives to manage interest rate and pricing risk associated
with its mortgage origination business. Futures contracts and
forward sales commitments are used to protect the value of the
loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest
rates and pricing. In the period of time that elapses between
the origination and sale of mortgage loans, changes in interest
rates have the potential to cause a decline in the value of the
loans in this held-for-sale portfolio. Futures and forward sale
commitment positions are used to protect the Company from the
risk of such adverse changes. Futures contracts are also used to
hedge the risks associated with customer derivatives. The change
in value of the hedging contracts is expected to be highly
effective in offsetting the change in value of specific assets
and liabilities over the life of the hedge relationship.

Regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs
of its customers. Interest rate swaps, interest rate options and
foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold
to customers. Positions with similar characteristics are used to
offset the market risk and minimize income statement volatility
associated with this portfolio. Those instruments used to
service customers are entered into the trading account with
changes in value recorded in the income statement. Refer to
Note 14 “Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging
Activities” of the consolidated financial statements for a
tabular summary of Regions’ year-end derivatives positions
in the trading portfolio.

The objective of Regions’ hedging strategies
is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes, from an
economic and accounting perspective, on net interest income and
the net present value of our balance sheet. The overall
effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market
conditions, the quality of Regions’ execution, the accuracy
of its asset valuation assumptions, counterparty credit risk and
changes in interest rates. As a result, Regions’ hedging
strategies may be ineffective in mitigating the impact of
interest rate changes on its earnings.

Brokerage and Market Making Activity

Morgan Keegan’s business activities expose
it to market risk, including its securities inventory positions
and securities held for investment.

Morgan Keegan trades for its own account in
corporate and tax-exempt securities and U.S. government,
agency and guaranteed securities. Most of these transactions are
entered into to facilitate the execution of customers’
orders to buy or sell these securities. In addition, it trades
certain equity securities in order to “make a market”
in these securities. Morgan Keegan’s trading activities
require the commitment of capital. All principal transactions
place the subsidiary’s capital at risk. Profits and losses
are dependent upon the skills of employees and market
fluctuations. In some cases, in order to economically hedge the
risks of carrying inventory, Morgan Keegan enters into a low
level of activity involving U.S. Treasury note futures.

Morgan Keegan, as part of its normal brokerage
activities, assumes short positions on securities. The
establishment of short positions exposes Morgan Keegan to
off-balance sheet risk in the event that prices increase, as it
may be obligated to cover such positions at a loss. Morgan
Keegan manages its exposure to these instruments by entering
into offsetting or other positions in a variety of financial
instruments.

Morgan Keegan will occasionally economically
hedge a portion of its long proprietary inventory position
through the use of short positions in financial future
contracts, which are included in securities sold, not yet
purchased at market value. At December 31, 2005, Morgan
Keegan had no outstanding futures contracts.

In the normal course of business, Morgan Keegan
enters into underwriting and forward and future commitments. At
December 31, 2005, the contract amounts of futures
contracts were $35 million to purchase


and $129 million to sell
U.S. Government and municipal securities. Morgan Keegan
typically settles its position by entering into equal but
opposite contracts and, as such, the contract amounts do not
necessarily represent future cash requirements. Settlement of
the transactions relating to such commitments are not expected
to have a material effect on Regions’ consolidated
financial position. Transactions involving future settlement
give rise to market risk, which represents the potential loss
that can be caused by a change in the market value of a
particular financial instrument. Regions’ exposure to
market risk is determined by a number of factors, including the
size, composition and diversification of positions held, the
absolute and relative levels of interest rates, and market
volatility.

Additionally, in the normal course of business,
Morgan Keegan enters into transactions for delayed delivery,
to-be-announced securities which are recorded on the
consolidated statement of financial condition at fair value.
Risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to
meet the terms of their contracts and from unfavorable changes
in interest rates or the market values of the securities
underlying the instruments. The credit risk associated with
these contracts is typically limited to the cost of replacing
all contracts on which the Company has recorded an unrealized
gain. For exchange-traded contracts, the clearing organization
acts as the counterparty to specific transactions and,
therefore, bears the risk of delivery to and from counterparties.

Interest rate risk at Morgan Keegan arises from
the exposure of holding interest-sensitive financial instruments
such as government, corporate and municipal bonds and certain
preferred equities. Morgan Keegan manages its exposure to
interest rate risk by setting and monitoring limits and, where
feasible, entering into offsetting positions in securities with
similar interest rate risk characteristics. Securities
inventories are marked to market, and accordingly there are no
unrecorded gains or losses in value. While a significant portion
of the securities inventories have contractual maturities in
excess of five years, these inventories, on average, turn over
in excess of twelve times per year. Accordingly, the exposure to
interest rate risk inherent in Morgan Keegan’s securities
inventories is less than that of similar financial instruments
held by firms in other industries. Morgan Keegan’s equity
securities inventories are exposed to risk of loss in the event
of unfavorable price movements. The equity securities
inventories are marked-to-market and there are no unrecorded
gains or losses.

Morgan Keegan is also subject to credit risk
arising from non-performance by trading counterparties,
customers, and issuers of debt securities owned. This risk is
managed by imposing and monitoring position limits, monitoring
trading counterparties, reviewing security concentrations,
holding and marking to market collateral and conducting business
through clearing organizations that guarantee performance.
Morgan Keegan regularly participates in the trading of some
derivative securities for its customers; however, this activity
does not involve Morgan Keegan acquiring a position or
commitment in these products and this trading is not a
significant portion of Morgan Keegan’s business.

To manage trading risks arising from interest
rate and equity price risks, Regions uses a Value at Risk
(“VAR”) model to measure the potential fair value the
Company could lose on its trading positions given a specified
statistical confidence level and time-to-liquidate time horizon.
Regions assesses market risk at a 99% confidence level over a
one-day holding period. Regions’ primary VAR model is based
upon a variance-covariance approach with delta-gamma
approximations for non-linear securities.

The end-of-period VAR was approximately $642,000
as of December 31, 2005, and approximately $407,000 as of
December 31, 2004. Maximum daily VAR utilization during
2005 was $1.2 million and average daily VAR during the same
period was $466,000.


Provision For Loan Losses

The provision for loan losses is used to
establish the allowance for loan losses. Actual loan losses, net
of recoveries, are charged directly to the allowance. The
expense recorded each year is a reflection of management’s
judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance. For an analysis
and discussion of the allowance for loan losses, refer to the
section entitled “Financial Condition — Loans and
Allowance for Loan Losses.” During 2005, the provision for
loan losses increased to $165 million (0.28% of average
loans) due to higher loan losses, slightly higher past dues, and
management’s evaluation of current economic factors,
including the impact of Hurricane Katrina. The resulting
year-end allowance for loan losses increased $28.8 million
to $783.5 million. 2004 and 2003 provisions for loan losses
were $128.5 million (0.29% of average loans) and
$121.5 million (0.39% of average loans), respectively.

Non-Interest Income

Non-interest income (excluding security
transactions) totaled $1.8 billion in 2005, compared to
$1.6 billion in 2004 and $1.3 billion in 2003. The
increase in non-interest income is due primarily to fee income
added by the Union Planters merger in mid-2004. Non-interest
income (excluding security transactions) as a percent of total
revenue equaled 39% in 2005, compared to 42% in 2004 and 46% in
2003. Non-interest income has declined as a percent of total
revenue due to much faster growth in net interest income over
the last three years, compared to the growth in non-interest
income. Acquisition activity in recent periods has added
significantly more net interest income (in comparison to
non-interest income added) to the total revenue stream.

Brokerage and Investment Banking

Brokerage and investment income increased 2% and
totaled $548.7 million in 2005, compared to
$535.3 million in 2004 and $552.7 million in 2003.
Brokerage and investment income is significantly affected by
economic and market conditions. The increase in brokerage and
investment income in 2005 resulted from strong private client,
equity capital markets, trust, and investment advisory income
streams in 2005. As of December 31, 2005, Morgan Keegan
employed slightly more than 1,000 financial advisors. Customer
assets under management totaled approximately $56.3 billion
at year-end 2005, compared to approximately $48.5 billion
at year-end 2004.

Morgan Keegan contributed $101.7 million to
net income in 2005. Revenues from the private client division
totaled $248.4 million, or 31% of Morgan Keegan’s
total revenue in 2005, and was the top revenue producing line of
business. This line of business benefited from improved equity
markets in 2005. Fixed income capital markets and equity capital
markets revenue totaled $160.1 million and
$86.5 million, in 2005, respectively. The investment
advisory services division produced $125.4 million of
revenue in 2005. Revenues generated by each division are
included in various line items in the following table. Regions
Morgan Keegan Trust division, which produced revenue of
$103.2 million in 2005, is included with Morgan Keegan.
Although Regions Morgan Keegan trust division is included with
Morgan Keegan, all trust income is reported as a separate item
in the consolidated statements of income (see next section
titled “Trust Income” for discussion of changes in
trust income).


The following table shows the components of the
contribution by Morgan Keegan for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

The following table shows the breakout of revenue
by division contributed by Morgan Keegan for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Morgan Keegan Breakout of Revenue by
Division

Trust Income

Trust income increased 25% in 2005, 47% in 2004
and 12% in 2003. The increase in 2005 was driven by higher asset
values, increased fees, and a full year of activity from trust
accounts added through the Union Planters merger in the third
quarter of 2004. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, better performance in
the financial markets and increases in trust assets contributed
to higher trust fees.


Service Charges on Deposit Accounts

Service charge income increased 24% in 2005, 45%
in 2004 and 4% in 2003. The addition of new accounts added in
connection with the Union Planters transaction during the third
quarter of 2004, partially offset by the expanded offering of
free checking products were the primary reasons for the
increases in 2005 and 2004 in comparison with prior years. Also
negatively impacting service charges on deposits were deferrals
or waivers of certain fees in the impacted areas of Hurricane
Katrina during the third and fourth quarters of 2005. Increases
in the number of deposit accounts, management initiatives and
standardization in the pricing of certain deposit accounts and
related services were the primary drivers of increases in 2003.

Mortgage Servicing and Origination
    Fees

The primary source of this category of income is
Regions’ mortgage banking divisions, Regions Mortgage and
EquiFirst. Regions Mortgage’s primary business and source
of income is the origination and servicing of mortgage loans for
long-term investors. EquiFirst typically originates mortgage
loans which are sold to third-party investors with servicing
released. Net gains or losses related to the sale of mortgage
loans are included in other non-interest income.

In 2005, mortgage servicing and origination fees
increased 13%, from $128.8 million in 2004 to
$145.3 million in 2005. Origination and servicing fees
increased in 2005 due to increased origination volume and
servicing assets added from the Union Planters merger partially
offset by a reduction in serviced loans. At December 31,
2005, Regions’ servicing portfolio totaled
$37.2 billion and included approximately 398,000 loans. At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the servicing portfolio totaled
$39.4 billion and $16.1 billion, respectively. The
decrease in the servicing portfolio in 2005 resulted primarily
from the sale of the conforming wholesale mortgage unit during
the second quarter of 2005. The increase in the servicing
portfolio in 2004 resulted from the addition of the Union
Planters mortgage division, partially offset by certain
divestitures of out-of footprint mortgage servicing rights and a
relatively high level of prepayments. The decline in the
servicing portfolio during 2003 resulted from high levels of
prepayments due to the low interest rate environment driving
record mortgage refinance activity, partially offset by higher
levels of production in 2003.

In 2004, mortgage servicing and origination fees
increased 32% to $128.8 million. Origination and servicing
fees increased in 2004 due to volume and servicing assets added
from the Union Planters merger.

In 2003, mortgage servicing and origination fees
increased 8%, to $97.4 million. Origination fees increased
in 2003 due to the significant mortgage activity resulting from
the historically low interest rate environment. Servicing fees
were lower in 2003, as compared to the prior year, due to a
smaller servicing portfolio in 2003.

Regions Mortgage and EquiFirst, through their
retail, correspondent lending and wholesale operations, produced
mortgage loans totaling $16.0 billion in 2005,
$10.8 billion in 2004 and $9.4 billion in 2003.
Regions Mortgage and EquiFirst produce loans from offices in
Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana,
Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.


A summary of mortgage servicing rights is
presented as follows. The balances shown represent the original
amounts capitalized, less accumulated amortization and valuation
adjustments, for the right to service mortgage loans that are
owned by other investors. The amortization of mortgage servicing
rights is included in other non-interest expense. The carrying
values of mortgage servicing rights are affected by various
factors, including prepayments of the underlying mortgages. A
significant change in prepayments of mortgages in the servicing
portfolio could result in significant changes in the valuation
adjustments.

The mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance
decreased by $32 million in 2005, due to a rise in mortgage
rates, resulting in a decline in prepayment speeds. In contrast,
the mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance increased by
$22 million during 2004, due to a low mortgage rate
environment, resulting in increased prepayment speeds and
increased refinancing activity. See further discussion in
“Other Expenses” below.

Securities (Losses) Gains

Regions reported net losses of $18.9 million
from the sale of available for sale securities in 2005, as
compared to net gains of $63.1 million in 2004 and
$25.7 million in 2003. These gains and losses were
primarily related to the sale of agency and mortgage-related
securities in conjunction with balance sheet management
activities.

Other Income

The components of other income consisted mainly
of fees and commissions, insurance premiums, customer derivative
fees, and net gains related to the sale of mortgage loans.

Fees and commission income increased 30% in 2005,
due primarily to a full-year of business activity related to the
Union Planters merger in 2004, including ATM switch income,
international income, and fees related to money orders, cashier
checks, and other banking fees. Fee and commission income
increased 44% in 2004 due to increased business activity related
to the Union Planters merger including standby letters of
credit, credit card fees, money orders, cashiers checks and
other banking fees.

Insurance premium and commission income decreased
7% in 2005, due primarily to a decrease in miscellaneous
insurance commissions, but increased 13% in 2004, due primarily
to increased revenues in the commercial property and casualty
business.

Regions’ customer derivative division
primarily assists existing commercial customers with capital
market products including interest rate swaps, caps and floors.
Typically, Regions enters into offsetting derivative positions
limiting its exposure related to customer derivative products.
These exposures are marked-to-market on a daily basis. Capital
market income totaled $27.7 million in 2005,
$7.8 million in 2004 and $21.9 million in 2003.
Customer derivative division revenue increased in 2005 as
penetration of the legacy Union Planters customer base continued
to produce sales of customer derivative products and as
customers swapped floating rate loans for fixed rate loans in a
flattening yield curve environment.


In 2005, net gains related to the sale of
mortgage loans held for sale totaled $157.6 million
($129.7 million related to EquiFirst and $27.9 million
related to Regions Mortgage). The increase of $20.7 million
in gains during 2005 was primarily related to higher sales
volume at EquiFirst during the year. For the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, gains totaled
$136.9 million and $106.1 million, respectively.

Non-Interest Expense

The main components of non-interest expense are
salaries and employee benefits, net occupancy expense, furniture
and equipment expenses and other non-interest expense. The
following table presents a summary of non-interest expense for
the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Total non-interest expense increased
$575.6 million, or 23%, in 2005 and $678.5 million, or
38%, in 2004, due primarily to the expense base added in
connection with the Union Planters merger, which occurred mid
year 2004. In 2003, total non-interest expense increased 4%, due
primarily to increased levels of business activity and new
branch offices. Also impacting comparisons between periods are
merger-related expenses, impairment charges related to mortgage
servicing rights (including recapture of previously recognized
impairment charges), losses related to prepayment of debt and
storm-related costs. The following tables show the impact on the
major non-interest expense components, excluding merger-related
expenses, impairment charges/recapture for mortgage servicing
assets, losses for prepayment of debt and storm-related costs.
Management believes the following tables are useful in
evaluating trends in non-interest expense. For further
discussion of non-interest expense, refer to the following
discussion of each component of non-interest expense.

2005 Non-Interest Expense

In 2005, merger and storm-related charges totaled
$176.8 million, impairment recapture on mortgage servicing
rights totaled $32.0 million and losses on early
extinguishment of debt ($600 million of Federal Home
Loan Bank structured notes) totaled $10.9 million.
During 2005, Regions received a $10 million advance from
its insurance carrier for claims expected to be filed in
connection with the damage from Hurricane Katrina. This advance
was used to partially offset expenses incurred in connection
with Hurricane Katrina. The advance was included in the
operating activities section of the consolidated statement of
cash flows. Regions recorded approximately $8.0 million in
net storm-related expenses during 2005.


In connection with the integration of Regions and
Union Planters, Regions has incurred merger-related expenses
throughout the integration process. Merger-related expenses
include costs incurred in connection with the merger,
integration and restructuring activities, including retention
and severance costs, professional fees incurred with integration
activities, contract buyouts, lease termination penalties, loss
on disposals of duplicate facilities and other direct and
incremental costs related to the transaction. Costs incurred in
connection with the merger, integration and restructuring
activities were funded from cash flows from operations.

2004 Non-Interest Expense

In 2004, merger-related and storm-related charges
totaled $55.1 million, impairment charges on mortgage
servicing rights totaled $22.0 million and losses on
prepayment of debt ($1.1 billion of Federal Home
Loan Bank advances) totaled $39.6 million.

2003 Non-Interest Expense

In 2003, a net recapture of $1.0 million on
mortgage servicing rights was recorded; additionally, Regions
chose to prepay $650 million of Federal Home loan Bank
advances, resulting in a $20.6 million charge from
prepayment of this debt.

Salaries and Employee Benefits

Total salaries and benefits increased 22% in
2005, 30% in 2004 and 9% in 2003. The increase in salaries and
benefits during 2005 and 2004 was primarily attributable to
salaries and benefits of associates added in connection with the
Union Planters merger, as well as incremental incentive costs
related to increased revenue production. Excluding
$74.3 million of merger-related charges, salaries and
benefits increased 18% in 2005 due to the above noted items.
Salaries and benefits were higher in 2003, as compared to the
prior year, due primarily to higher incentive costs associated
with Morgan Keegan, Equifirst, and Regions Mortgage, as well as
normal merit and promotional adjustments.

At December 31, 2005, Regions had
approximately 25,000 full-time equivalent employees,
compared to approximately 26,000 at December 31, 2004 and
approximately 16,000 at December 31, 2003. The decrease in


full-time equivalent employees from
December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005 was related to
streamlined processes, converted systems, and normal attrition;
the increase in employees in 2004 resulted primarily from
personnel added with the 2004 Union Planters transaction.

Salaries, excluding benefits, totaled
$985.1 million in 2005, compared to $830.8 million in
2004 and $598.5 million in 2003. Salaries increased in 2005
primarily as a result of an increase in full year headcount in
connection with the Union Planters merger. Increased salaries in
2004 resulted from higher employment levels in connection with
the Union Planters merger, while higher salary levels in 2003
were primarily the result of normal merit and promotional
adjustments.

Regions provides employees who meet established
employment requirements with a benefits package which includes
401(k), pension, and medical, life and disability insurance
plans. The total cost to Regions for fringe benefits, including
payroll taxes, equaled approximately 29% of salaries in 2005.

Regions’ 401(k) plan includes a company
match of eligible employee contributions. At December 31,
2005, this match totaled 100% of the eligible employee
contribution (up to 6% of compensation) after one year of
service and is invested in Regions common stock. Regions’
contribution to the 401(k) plan on behalf of employees totaled
$34.2 million, $25.7 million, and $16.5 million
in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Commissions and incentives expense increased to
$468.7 million in 2005, compared to $381.0 million in
2004 and $352.1 million in 2003. The increases in
commissions and incentives were primarily the result of
increased participants in various incentive programs, as well as
higher commissions paid at Morgan Keegan and EquiFirst, linked
to increased production levels and sales goals. At Morgan
Keegan, commissions and incentives are a key component of
compensation, which is typical in the brokerage and investment
banking industry. In general, incentives continue to be used to
reward employees for selling products and services, for
productivity improvements and for achievement of corporate
financial goals. Regions’ long-term incentive plan provides
for the granting of stock options, restricted stock and
performance shares (see Note 20 “Stock Option and
Long-Term Incentive Plans” to the consolidated financial
statements).

Pension expense totaled $22.0 million in
2005, $22.5 million in 2004 and $19.8 million in 2003.
Pension expense in 2006 is expected to approximate
$19.7 million.

Payroll taxes increased 28% in 2005, 37% in 2004
and 3% in 2003. Increases in the number of associates combined
with the increase in the Social Security tax base and increased
salary levels were the primary reasons for increased payroll
taxes.

Group insurance expense increased 22% in 2005,
56% in 2004 and 12% in 2003. The increases were the result of
increased levels of covered employees and higher claims costs.

Net Occupancy Expense

Net occupancy expense includes rents,
depreciation and amortization, utilities, maintenance,
insurance, taxes and other expenses of premises occupied by
Regions and its affiliates. Regions’ affiliates operate
offices primarily in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and
Virginia.

Net occupancy expense increased 40% in 2005, 51%
in 2004 and 8% in 2003 due primarily to expenses added in
connection with acquisitions, new and acquired branch offices,
expenses incurred in connection with Hurricane Katrina (2005)
and rising price levels.

Furniture and Equipment Expense

Furniture and equipment expense increased 30% in
2005 and 25% in 2004 due to expenses added in connection with
acquisitions, expenses incurred in connection with Hurricane
Katrina (specific to 2005), rising price levels and expenses
related to equipment for new branch offices (including increased
depreciation and service contract expenses associated with new
back office and branch equipment). Furniture and equipment
expense decreased 10% in 2003, due primarily to lower expenses
related to computer equipment.


Other Expenses

The significant components of other expense
include legal and other professional fees, other non-credit
losses, amortization and impairment of mortgage servicing
rights, amortization of identifiable intangibles and computer
and other outside services. Increases in this category of
expense generally resulted from acquisitions, expanded programs,
increased business activity and rising price levels. Other
expenses included costs related to the merger and other charges
totaling $73.1 million in 2005, $98.6 million in 2004
and $19.6 million in 2003, as previously discussed. Please
refer to Note 16 “Other Income and Expense” to
the consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the
significant components of other expense.

Legal and other professional fees increased
during 2005, primarily due to integration activities undertaken
and a full-year of expenses added in connection with the Union
Planters merger in July of 2004. Legal and other professional
fees increased significantly in 2004, as compared to 2003 and
2002, due to costs incurred related to the merger and
integration with Union Planters. These costs include fees paid
to attorneys, accountants and other professionals involved in
the Union Planters transaction as well as costs incurred in the
ordinary course of business.

Other non-credit losses primarily include charges
for items unrelated to the extension of credit such as fraud
losses, litigation losses, write-downs of other real estate,
insurance claims and other miscellaneous losses. Other
non-credit losses increased in 2005, primarily due to increased
write-downs in other real estate, as well as increases in fraud,
litigation and miscellaneous losses. Other non-credit losses
increased in 2004 due to higher losses related to litigation,
fraud and other expenses related to increased business activity
added by the Union Planters merger. The 2003 decrease was
primarily related to lower losses related to litigation.

Amortization of mortgage servicing rights
increased in 2005, primarily due to full-year amortization on
the servicing rights added in connection with the Union Planters
merger in July 2004. Accelerated amortization expense, due to
the low interest rate environment and increased prepayments of
underlying mortgages, combined with the addition of servicing
rights added by the Union Planters merger, resulted in
additional amortization expense in 2004 and 2003.

During 2005, Regions recognized a
$32 million recapture on impairment of mortgage servicing
rights, due to rising mortgage rates and reduced prepayment
speed assumptions related to the serviced mortgages. Regions
recognized $22 million of impairment in 2004 as mortgage
rates declined, refinancing activity increased, and prepayment
speeds increased. Regions recognized $1 million in
recapture of impairment during 2003, resulting from a slight
decrease in prepayment speeds from modest increases in mortgage
rates.

Amortization of identifiable intangible assets
increased significantly in 2005 and 2004. The increase was
related to amortization of intangible assets (primarily core
deposit intangibles) recorded in connection with the Union
Planters merger.

During 2005, Regions incurred a
$10.9 million charge on the early extinguishment of
$600 million of FHLB structured notes (classified in
long-term debt). During 2004, Regions incurred a
$39.6 million charge on the early extinguishment of
$1.1 billion of long-term Federal Home Loan Bank
advances. During 2003, in connection with the prepayment of
$650 million of Federal Home Loan Bank advances,
Regions incurred a $20.6 million loss on early
extinguishment of debt.

Applicable Income Tax

Regions’ provision for income taxes for 2005
increased $69.7 million compared to 2004 due primarily to
increased earnings resulting from the 2004 merger with Union
Planters and increased consolidated earnings in 2005, offset by
both an increase in tax credits and increased benefits from the
recapitalized mortgage-related subsidiary further described
below. Regions effective tax rate for 2005 was 29.6%, compared
to 29.9% for 2004 and 28.5% for 2003.

From time to time Regions engages in business
plans that may also have an effect on its tax liabilities. While
Regions has obtained the opinion of advisors that the tax
aspects of these strategies should prevail, examination of
Regions’ income tax returns or changes in tax law may
impact the tax benefits of these plans.

Periodically, Regions invests in pass-through
investment vehicles that generate tax credits, principally
low-income housing credits and non-conventional fuel source
credits, which directly reduce Regions’ federal


income tax liability. Congress has legislated
these tax credit programs to encourage capital inflows to these
investment vehicles. The amount of tax benefit recognized from
these tax credits was $47.6 million in 2005, compared to
$35.4 million in 2004.

During the fourth quarter of 2000, Regions
recapitalized a mortgage-related subsidiary by raising
Tier 2 capital, which resulted in a reduction in taxable
income of that subsidiary attributable to Regions. The reduction
in the taxable income of this subsidiary attributable to Regions
is expected to result in a lower effective tax rate applicable
to the consolidated taxable income before taxes of Regions for
future periods. The impact on Regions’ effective tax rate
applicable to consolidated income before taxes of the reduction
in the subsidiary’s taxable income attributable to Regions
will, however, depend on a number of factors, including, but not
limited to, the amount of assets in the subsidiary, the yield of
the assets in the subsidiary, the cost of funding the
subsidiary, possible loan losses in the subsidiary, the level of
expenses of the subsidiary, the level of income attributable to
obligations of states and political subdivisions, and various
other factors. The amount of federal and state tax benefits
recognized related to the recapitalized subsidiary was
$54.7 million in 2005 ($41.9 million federal) compared
to $42.9 million in 2004 ($33.6 million federal).

Regions has segregated a portion of its
investment securities and intellectual property into separate
legal entities in order to, among other business purposes,
protect such intangible assets from inappropriate claims of
Regions’ creditors, and to maximize the return on such
assets by the professional and focused management thereof.
Regions has recognized state tax benefits related to these legal
entities of $27.6 million in 2005 compared to
$17.4 million in 2004.

Regions’ federal and state income tax
returns for the years 1998 through 2004 are open for review and
examination by governmental authorities. In the normal course of
these examinations, Regions is subject to challenges from
governmental authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. Regions
has received notices of proposed adjustments relating to taxes
due for the years 1999 through 2003, which include proposed
adjustments relating to an increase in taxable income of the
mortgage-related subsidiary discussed above. Regions believes
adequate provision for income taxes has been recorded for all
years open for review and intends to vigorously contest the
proposed adjustments. To the extent that final resolution of the
proposed adjustments results in significantly different
conclusions from Regions’ current assessment of the
proposed adjustments, Regions’ effective tax rate in any
given financial reporting period may be materially different
from its current effective tax rate.

Management’s determination of the
realization of the deferred tax asset is based upon
management’s judgment of various future events and
uncertainties, including the timing, nature and amount of future
income earned by certain subsidiaries and the implementation of
various plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset.
Management believes that the subsidiaries will generate
sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax
benefits. However, management does not believe that it is more
likely than not to realize all of its capital loss carryforwards
nor all of its state net operating loss carryforwards.
Accordingly, it has valuation allowances of $55.2 million
and $12.6 million, respectively, against such benefits.

Note 17 “Income Taxes” to the
consolidated financial statements provides additional
information about the provision for income taxes.

Effects Of Inflation

The majority of assets and liabilities of a
financial institution are monetary in nature; therefore, a
financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and
industrial companies, which have significant investments in
fixed assets or inventories. However, inflation does have an
important impact on the growth of total assets in the banking
industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at
higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate
equity-to-assets ratio. Inflation also affects other expenses
that tend to rise during periods of general inflation.

Management believes the most significant impact
of inflation on financial results is Regions’ ability to
react to changes in interest rates. As discussed previously,
management is attempting to maintain an essentially balanced
position between rate-sensitive assets and liabilities in order
to protect net interest income from being affected by wide
interest rate fluctuations.

Note 1.

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

The accounting and reporting policies of Regions
Financial Corporation (“Regions” or “the
Company”) conform with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and with general financial
services industry practices. Regions provides a full range of
banking and bank-related services to individual and corporate
customers through its subsidiaries and branch offices located
primarily in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. The
Company is subject to intense competition from other financial
institutions and is also subject to the regulations of certain
government agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by those
regulatory authorities.

Basis of Presentation and Principles of
Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Regions and its subsidiaries. Significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. In
preparing the financial statements, management is required to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities as of the statement of condition dates
and revenues and expenses for the periods shown. Actual results
could differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the
consolidated financial statements including, but not limited to,
the estimates and assumptions related to allowance for loan
losses, intangibles and income taxes.

Certain amounts in prior-year financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.

Securities

The Company’s policies for investments in
debt and equity securities are as follows. Management determines
the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at
the time of purchase and periodically re-evaluates such
designations.

Debt securities are classified as securities held
to maturity when the Company has the positive intent and ability
to hold the securities to maturity. Securities held to maturity
are stated at amortized cost.

Debt securities not classified as securities held
to maturity or trading account assets, and marketable equity
securities not classified as trading account assets, are
classified as securities available for sale. Securities
available for sale are stated at estimated fair value, with
unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a
component of other comprehensive income. Declines in fair value
that are deemed other-than-temporary, if any, are reported in
other non-interest expense.

The amortized cost of debt securities classified
as securities held to maturity or securities available for sale
is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts to maturity, or in the case of mortgage-backed
securities, over the estimated life of the security, using the
effective yield method. Such amortization or accretion is
included in interest on securities. Realized gains and losses
are included in net securities gains (losses). The cost of the
securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

Trading Account Assets

Trading account assets, which are held for the
purpose of selling at a profit, consist of debt and marketable
equity securities and are carried at estimated fair value. Gains
and losses, both realized and unrealized, are included in
brokerage income. Trading account net gains totaled
$6.9 million (including $667,000 of net unrealized losses),
$9.5 million (including $3.2 million net unrealized
losses) and $16.0 million (including $543,000 of net
unrealized gains) in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Loans Held for Sale

At December 31, 2005, loans held for sale
included single-family real estate mortgage loans. At
December 31, 2004, this category also included factored
accounts receivables, which were sold in 2005. Mortgage loans
held for sale have been designated as one of the hedged items in
a fair value hedging relationship under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133 “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(“Statement 133”). Therefore, to the extent
changes in fair value are attributable to the interest rate risk
being hedged, the change in fair value is recognized in income
as an adjustment to the carrying amount of mortgage loans held
for sale. Otherwise, mortgage loans held for sale are accounted
for under the lower of aggregate cost or market method. The fair
values are based on quoted market prices of similar instruments,
adjusted for differences in loan characteristics. Gains and
losses on mortgages held for sale are included in other
non-interest income.

Securities Purchased Under Agreements to
Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to
Repurchase

Securities purchased under agreements to resell
and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are generally
treated as collateralized financing transactions and are
recorded at market value plus accrued interest. It is
Regions’ policy to take possession of securities purchased
under resell agreements.

Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses

Interest on loans is accrued based upon the
principal amount outstanding. Generally, Regions defers
nonrefundable loan origination fees and the direct costs of
origination loans. The net deferred amount is recognized as an
adjustment to income over the lives of the related loans.

Through provisions charged directly to operating
expense, Regions has established an allowance for loan losses.
This allowance is reduced by actual loan losses and increased by
subsequent recoveries, if any. It is Regions’ policy that
when a loss is identified, it is charged against the allowance
for loan losses in the current period. The policy regarding loan
charge-offs requires immediate recognition of a loss if
significant doubt exists as to principal repayment.

The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a
level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses
in the loan portfolio. Management’s determination of the
adequacy of the allowance is based on an evaluation of the
portfolio, historical loan loss experience, current economic
conditions, collateral values of properties securing loans,
volume, growth, quality and composition of the loan portfolio,
regulatory guidance and other relevant factors. Unfavorable
changes in any of these, or other factors, or the availability
of new information, could require that the allowance for loan
losses be increased in future periods. No portion of the
resulting allowance is restricted to any individual loan or
group of loans. The entire allowance is available to absorb
losses from any and all loans.

Loans are placed on non-accrual status when
collectibility is in doubt and the loan is not well secured or
in process of collection. On loans which are on non-accrual
status (including impaired loans), it is Regions’ policy to
reverse interest previously accrued on the loan against interest
income. Interest on such loans is thereafter recorded on a
“cash basis” and is included in earnings only when
actually received in cash and when full payment of principal is
no longer doubtful.

Regions’ determination of its allowance for
loan losses is determined in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 114 “Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan”
(“Statement 114”) and Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 5 “Accounting for
Contingencies” (“Statement 5”). In
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses,
management uses information from its ongoing loan review process
to stratify the loan portfolio into loan pools with common risk
characteristics. The higher-risk-graded loans in the portfolio
are assigned estimated amounts of loss based on several factors,
including current and historical loss experience of each
higher-risk category, regulatory guidelines for losses in each
higher-risk category and management’s judgment of economic
conditions and the


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

resulting impact on higher-risk-graded loans. All
loans deemed to be impaired, which include non-accrual loans,
excluding loans to individuals, with outstanding balances
greater than $1 million, are evaluated individually.
Because the vast majority of these loans are dependent upon
collateral for repayment, impairment is measured by evaluating
collateral value as compared to the current investment in the
loan. For all other loans, Regions compares the amount of
estimated discounted cash flows to the investment in the loan.
In the event a particular loan’s collateral value or
discounted cash flows is not sufficient to support the
collection of the investment in the loan, the loan is
specifically considered in the determination of the allowance
for loan losses or a charge is immediately taken against the
allowance for loan losses.

In addition to establishing allowance levels for
specifically identified higher-risk-graded loans, management
determines allowance levels for all other loans in the portfolio
for which historical experience indicates that certain losses
exist. These loans are categorized by loan type and assigned
estimated amounts of loss based on several factors, including
current and historical loss experience of each loan type and
management’s judgment of economic conditions and the
resulting impact on each category of loans. The amount of the
allowance related to these loans is combined with the amount of
the allowance related to the higher-risk-graded loans to
evaluate the overall level of the allowance for loan losses.

Asset Securitizations

Regions has securitized certain automobile loans
and transferred these loans into a trust to legally isolate the
assets from Regions Bank, a subsidiary of the Company. In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 140 “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities a
Replacement of FASB Statement 125”
(“Statement 140”), securitized loans are removed
from the balance sheet and a net gain or loss is recognized in
income at the time of initial sale. Net gains or losses
resulting from securitizations are recorded in other
non-interest income.

Retained interests in the subordinated tranches
and interest-only strips are recorded at fair value and included
in the available for sale securities portfolio. Subsequent
adjustments to the fair value are recorded through other
comprehensive income. The Company used assumptions and estimates
in determining the fair value allocated to the retained
interests at the time of sale in accordance with
Statement 140. These assumptions and estimates include
projections concerning rates charged to customers, the expected
life of the receivables, loan losses, prepayment rates, the cost
of funds, and discount rates associated with the risks involved.
Adverse changes related to any of the assumptions used in
determining fair value could result in a reduced yield on the
security over future periods, or, in some cases, a realized
write-down of the security carrying amount through the income
statement in the period of a decline in value.

Management reviews the historical performance of
the retained interests and the assumptions used to project
future cash flows on a quarterly basis. Upon review, assumptions
may be revised and the present value of future cash flows
recalculated.

Margin Receivables

Margin receivables, which represent funds
advanced to brokerage customers for the purchase of securities,
are carried at cost and secured by certain marketable securities
in the customer’s brokerage account.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment and leasehold improvements
are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. The provision for depreciation is computed using
the straight-line and declining-balance methods over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are
amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the improvements (or the terms of the leases if
shorter).

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets consist of (1) the excess
of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses
(excess purchase price), (2) amounts recorded related to
the value of acquired indeterminate-maturity deposits (core
deposit intangible assets), (3) amounts capitalized for the
right to service mortgage loans, (4) amounts capitalized
related to the value of acquired customer relationships and
(5) amounts recorded related to employment agreements with
certain individuals of acquired entities.

The excess of cost over the fair value of net
assets of acquired businesses totaled $5.0 billion (net of
accumulated amortization of $197.8 million) at
December 31, 2005 and 2004. The Company’s excess
purchase price, which is primarily related to banking, is tested
for impairment on an annual basis, or more often if events or
circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. Adverse
changes in the economic environment, operations of the business
unit, or other factors could result in a decline in the implied
fair value. If the implied fair value is less than the carrying
amount, a loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount
to implied fair value.

Core deposit intangible assets totaled
$301.4 million (net of accumulated amortization of
$75.0 million) and $347.4 million (net of accumulated
amortization of $29.0 million) at December 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, Regions’
amortization of core deposit intangible assets was
$46.1 million, $26.4 million and $1.3 million,
respectively. Regions’ core deposit intangible assets are
being amortized on an accelerated basis over a six year average
period. The aggregate amount of amortization expense is
estimated to be $38.7 million in 2006, $33.9 million
in 2007, $29.8 million in 2008 and $28.3 million in
2009 and 2010.

Amounts capitalized for the right to service
mortgage loans, which totaled $412.0 million at
December 31, 2005, and $396.6 million at
December 31, 2004, are being amortized over the estimated
remaining servicing life of the loans, considering appropriate
prepayment assumptions. Mortgage servicing rights are accounted
for under the lower of cost or market method. The estimated fair
values of capitalized mortgage servicing rights were
$412.0 million and $396.6 million at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. The fair value of mortgage
servicing rights is calculated by discounting estimated future
cash flows from the servicing assets, using market discount
rates, and using expected rates, servicing costs and other
factors. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, Regions capitalized
$72.0 million, $70.7 million and $60.9 million in
mortgage servicing rights, respectively. In 2005, 2004 and 2003,
Regions’ amortization of mortgage servicing rights was
$84.5 million, $62.8 million and $42.1 million,
respectively. In addition, during 2004, Regions added
$352.6 million in mortgage serving rights from the Union
Planters Corporation (“Union Planters”) transaction
and sold $68.8 million in servicing rights. Mortgage
servicing assets are evaluated periodically for impairment. For
purposes of evaluating impairment, the Company stratifies its
mortgage servicing portfolio on the basis of certain risk
characteristics including loan type and note rate. Changes in
interest rates, prepayment speeds, or other factors, could
result in impairment of the servicing asset and a charge against
earnings.

A summary of mortgage servicing rights is
presented as follows:

The changes in the valuation allowance for
servicing assets for the years ended December 31, 2005 and
2004 were as follows:

Data and assumptions used in the fair value
calculation for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004
are as follows:

In May 2004, as part of the acquisition of
Evergreen Timber Investment Management (“ETIM”),
Regions recorded intangible assets related to existing customer
relationships and employment agreements with certain individuals
in the amounts of $8.6 million and $1.5 million,
respectively. In 2005 and 2004, amortization of customer
relationships was $860,000 and $430,000, respectively and
amortization of employment agreements was $365,000 and $182,500,
respectively. These assets are being amortized on a straight
line basis over a five year and two year average period,
respectively.

In 2005, Regions acquired an oil and gas
valuation and brokerage entity as well as various insurance
production activities. As part of these acquisitions, Regions
recorded intangible assets related to employment agreements with
certain individuals in the amount of $4.4 million and
customer relationships in the amount of $1.3 million. In
2005, amortization of these intangible assets was approximately
$892,000. These assets are being amortized on a straight line
basis over a five year period.

Other identifiable intangible assets, including
core deposit intangible assets, employment agreements and
customer relationships, are reviewed at least annually for
events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of
the intangible asset, such as loss of core deposits, increased
competition or adverse changes in the economy. To the extent an
other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable, an
impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying amount to the
fair value.

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging
Activities

The Company enters into derivative financial
instruments to manage interest rate risk, facilitate
asset/liability management strategies and manage other
exposures. All derivative financial instruments are recognized
on the statement of condition as assets or liabilities at fair
value as required by Statement 133. It is Regions’
policy to enter into master netting agreements with
counterparties and to require collateral based on counterparty
credit ratings to cover exposures.

Derivative financial instruments that qualify
under Statement 133 in a hedging relationship are
designated, based on the exposure being hedged, as either fair
value or cash flow hedges. Fair value hedge relationships
mitigate exposure to the change in fair value of an asset,
liability or firm commitment. Under the fair value hedging
model, gains or losses attributable to the change in fair value
of the derivative instrument, as well as the gains and losses
attributable to the change in fair value of the hedged item, are
recognized in earnings in the period in which the change in fair
value occurs.

Cash flow hedge relationships mitigate exposure
to the variability of future cash flows or other forecasted
transactions. Under the cash flow hedging model, the effective
portion of the gain or loss related to the derivative instrument
is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. The
ineffective portion of the gain or loss related to the
derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in earnings during
the period of change. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive
income are amortized to earnings in the period or periods during
which the hedged item impacts earnings. For derivative financial
instruments not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges,
gains and losses related to the change in fair value are
recognized in earnings during the period of change in fair value.

The Company formally documents all hedging
relationships between hedging instruments and the hedged item,
as well as its risk management objective and strategy for
entering into various hedge transactions. The Company performs
periodic assessments, using the regression method, to determine
whether the hedging relationship has been highly effective in
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items
and whether they are expected to continue to be highly effective
in the future.

Income Taxes

Regions and its subsidiaries file various federal
and state income tax returns, including some returns that are
consolidated with subsidiaries. Regions accounts for the current
and future tax effects of such returns using the asset and
liability method pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109 “Accounting for Income Taxes”
(“Statement 109”). Under this method, Regions
provides deferred tax assets and liabilities by applying federal
and state tax rates currently in effect to its cumulative
temporary differences. Temporary differences are differences
between financial statement carrying amounts and the
corresponding tax bases of assets and liabilities.

From time to time Regions engages in business
plans that may also have an effect on its tax liabilities. If
the tax effects of a plan are significant, Regions’
practice is to obtain the opinion of advisors that the tax
effects of such plans should prevail if challenged. Examination
of Regions’ income tax returns or changes in tax law may
impact the tax benefits of these plans. Regions believes
adequate provisions for income tax have been recorded for all
years open for review.

Per Share Amounts

Earnings per share computations are based upon
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the
periods. Diluted earnings per share computations are based upon
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the
period plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and
stock performance awards.

Treasury Stock

The purchase of the Company’s common stock
is recorded at cost. At the date of retirement or subsequent
reissuance, the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of
such stock.

Statement of Cash Flows

Cash equivalents include cash and due from banks
and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements
to resell. Regions paid $1.5 billion in 2005,
$760 million in 2004 and $756 million in 2003 for
interest on deposits and borrowings. Income tax payments totaled
$172 million for 2005, $212 million for 2004, and
$135 million for 2003. Loans transferred to other real
estate totaled $164 million in 2005, $261 million in
2004 and $112 million in 2003. In 2004, Regions
reclassified $430 million of indirect consumer auto loans
from loans held for sale to the loan portfolio. In June 2004,
Regions retired 6.8 million shares of treasury stock, with
a cost of $207 million.

Restrictions on Cash and Due From
    Banks

Regions Bank is required to maintain reserve
balances with the Federal Reserve Bank. The average amount of

The following tables present the age of gross
unrealized losses and fair value by investment category for
securities available for sale at December 31, 2005 and 2004:


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Management does not believe any individual
unrealized loss as of December 31, 2005 represented an
other-than-temporary impairment. The unrealized losses related
primarily to the impact of changes in interest rates on
U.S. Treasury and Federal agency securities and
mortgage-backed securities.

The cost and estimated fair value of securities
held to maturity and securities available for sale at
December 31, 2005, by contractual maturity, are shown
below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual
maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or
prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

Proceeds from sales of securities available for
sale in 2005 were $5.0 billion. Gross realized gains and
losses were $61.6 million and $80.5 million,
respectively. Proceeds from sales of securities available for
sale in 2004 were $3.6 billion, with gross realized gains
and losses of $63.6 million and $463,000, respectively.
Proceeds from sales of securities available for sale in 2003
were $342 million, with gross realized gains and losses of
$25.8 million and $140,000, respectively.

A $12.3 million net security loss was
recognized in income and reclassified out of accumulated other
comprehensive income in 2005. Net gains of $41.0 million
and $18.3 million were recognized in 2004 and 2003,

Loans

The loan portfolio at December 31, 2005 and
2004 consisted of the following:

Directors and executive officers of Regions and
its principal subsidiaries, including the directors’ and
officers’ families and affiliated companies, are loan and
deposit customers and have other transactions with Regions in
the ordinary course of business. Total loans to these persons
(excluding loans which in the aggregate do not exceed
$60

,

000 to any such person) at December 31, 2005,
and 2004, were approximately $131 million and
$115 million, respectively. During 2005, $80 million
of new loans were made and repayments totaled $64 million.
These loans were made in the ordinary course of business and on
substantially the same terms, including interest rates and
collateral, as those prevailing at the same time for comparable
transactions with other persons and involve no unusual risk of
collectibility.

Regions’ recorded recourse liability, which
primarily relates to residential mortgage loans, totaled
$67.6 million and $34.2 million at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively.

The loan portfolio is diversified geographically,
primarily within Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

The recorded investment in impaired loans was
$64.3 million at December 31, 2005, and
$94.8 million at December 31, 2004. The average amount
of impaired loans during 2005 was $111.0 million and
$69.9 million during 2004. The allowance related to
impaired loans totaled $5.5 million at December 31,
2005 and $8.7 million at December 31, 2004.

At December 31, 2005, non-accrual loans
totaled $341.2 million compared to $388.4 million at
December 31, 2004. Loans contractually past due
90 days or more totaled $87.5 million and
$74.8 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

The amount of interest income recognized in 2005
on the $341.2 million of non-accruing loans outstanding at
year-end was approximately $11.7 million. If these loans
had been current in accordance with their original terms,
approximately $36.7 million would have been recognized on
these loans in 2005.

Asset Securitizations

During 2003, Regions securitized and sold
approximately $1.2 billion of indirect consumer auto loans.
The sale of these loans resulted in net gains recorded in other
non-interest income of $3.3 million and retained
interest-only strips with initial carrying values of
$45.0 million for securitizations during 2003. The
interest-only strips are classified as available for sale
securities. No loans were securitized or sold in 2004 or 2005.

During 2004, in connection with the acquisition
of Union Planters, Regions acquired approximately
$102 million of retained interest-only strips related to
mortgage loan securitizations. Currently, it is not
Regions’ practice to securitize mortgage loans.

Borrowed Funds

Following is a summary of short-term borrowings:

Federal funds purchased and securities sold under
agreements to repurchase had weighted average maturities of
forty two days, one hundred six days, and four hundred forty
four days at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Weighted average rates on these dates were 6.0%,
2.1%, and 0.9%, respectively.

During 2005, $350 million of short-term FHLB
structured notes matured, leaving no outstanding balance at
December 31, 2005. The structured notes had a weighted
average rate of 6.3% at December 31, 2004 and 2003.

Morgan Keegan maintains certain lines of credit
with unaffiliated banks that provide for maximum borrowings of
$335 million. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
$129.7 million and $56.4 million were outstanding
under these agreements, respectively. These agreements had
weighted average interest rates of 4.5% and 2.6% at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

As of December 31, 2003, commercial paper
balances outstanding were $5.5 million, weighted average
maturities were 335 days, and the weighted average interest
rate was 3.7%.

Through Morgan Keegan, Regions maintains a due to
brokerage customer position, which represents liquid funds in
the customers’ brokerage accounts. At December 31,
2005, these funds had an interest rate of 1.7%. At
December 31, 2004, these funds had an interest rate of 0.6%.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Regions holds cash as collateral for certain
derivative and other transactions with customers and other third
parties. Upon the expiration of these agreements, cash held as
collateral will be remitted to the counterparty. As of
December 31, 2005 these balances totaled
$22.5 million, with an interest rate of 4.1%. As of
December 31, 2004, these balances totaled
$75.8 million, with an interest rate of 2.0%.

The short-sale liability represents Regions’
trading obligation to deliver certain securities at a
predetermined date and price. These securities had weighted
average interest rates of 4.4%, 3.4% and 2.8% at
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Long-term borrowings consist of the following:

As of December 31, 2005, Regions had
subordinated notes of $2.1 billion, including five
issuances with interest rates ranging from 6.375% to 7.75%. The
2004 acquisition of Union Planters added $1.0 billion in
subordinated notes. All issues of these notes are subordinated
and subject in right of payment of principal and interest to the
prior payment in full of all senior indebtedness of the Company,
generally defined as all indebtedness and other obligations of
the Company to its creditors, except subordinated indebtedness.
Payment of the principal of the notes may be accelerated only in
the case of certain events involving bankruptcy, insolvency
proceedings or reorganization of the Company. The subordinated
notes described above, qualify as Tier 2 capital under
Federal Reserve guidelines.

In connection with the acquisition of Union
Planters, Regions assumed $484 million of
4.375% senior holding company notes due December 1,
2010. In addition, during 2005, Regions issued $750 million
of senior debt notes ($400 million of 3-year floating rate
notes and $350 million of 3-year fixed rate notes).

In September 2003, Regions issued
$400 million of 2.9% senior bank notes, due
December 15, 2006. These balances remained outstanding at
December 31, 2005. The acquisition of Union Planters added
$617 million of 5.125% senior bank notes, due
June 15, 2007.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Federal Home Loan Bank structured notes have
various stated maturities but are callable, by the Federal Home
Loan Bank, between one to two years. The structured notes
had a weighted average interest rate of 4.8% at
December 31, 2005.

Federal Home Loan Bank advances represent
borrowings with fixed interest rates ranging from 0.5% to 7.4%
and with maturities of one to nineteen years. These borrowings,
as well as the short-term borrowings from the Federal Home
Loan Bank, are secured by Federal Home Loan Bank stock
(carried at cost of $342.7 million) and by first mortgage
loans on one- to four-family dwellings held by Regions Bank
(approximately $6.0 billion at December 31, 2005). The
maximum amount that could be borrowed from Federal Home
Loan Banks under the current borrowing agreements is
approximately $24.3 billion.

In February 2001, Regions issued
$288 million of 8.00% trust preferred securities. These
securities have a 30-year term, are callable in five years and
qualify as Tier 1 Capital. In addition, Regions assumed
$4 million of trust preferred securities in connection with
an acquisition in 2001. Effective December 31, 2003, these
trust preferred securities were deconsolidated in accordance
with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation
No. 46 “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities” (“FIN 46”) (see Note 19
“Variable Interest Entities” to the consolidated
financial statements) and are no longer included in
Regions’ statement of condition.

As a result of the deconsolidation of trust
preferred securities, effective December 31, 2003, Regions
began reporting $301 million of junior subordinated notes.
These junior subordinated notes were issued by Regions to two
subsidiary business trusts, which issued the trust preferred
securities discussed previously (see Note 19 “Variable
Interest Entities” to the consolidated financial
statements). In connection with the acquisition of Union
Planters, Regions assumed $224.3 million of 8.2% junior
subordinated notes which were issued to subsidiary business
trusts. Subsequent to December 31, 2005, the
$288 million of Regions trust preferred securities were
called and related junior subordinated notes were extinguished.

Regions uses derivative instruments, primarily
interest rate swaps and options, to manage interest rate risk by
converting a portion of its fixed-rate debt to variable-rate.
The basis adjustments related to these hedges are included in
long-term borrowings. Further discussion of derivative
instruments is included in Note 14 “Derivative
Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the
consolidated financial statements.

Other long-term debt at December 31, 2005,
had a weighted average interest rate of 7.9% and a weighted
average maturity of 14 years. Regions has
$80.8 million included in other long-term debt in
connection with the seller-lessee transaction with continuing
involvement (see Note 12 “Leases” to the
consolidated financial statements).

The aggregate amount of maturities of all
long-term debt in each of the next five years is as follows:
2006-$1.0 billion; 2007-$258.2 million;
2008-$824.3 million; 2009-$1.1 billion; and
2010-$655.7 million.

Substantially all net assets are owned by
subsidiaries. The primary source of operating cash available to
Regions is provided by dividends from subsidiaries. Statutory
limits are placed on the amount of dividends the subsidiary bank
can pay without prior regulatory approval. In addition,
regulatory authorities require the maintenance of minimum
capital-to-asset ratios at banking subsidiaries. At
December 31, 2005, Regions Bank could pay approximately
$1.1 billion in dividends without prior approval.

Management believes that none of these dividend
restrictions will materially affect Regions’ dividend
policy. In addition to dividend restrictions, federal statutes
also prohibit unsecured loans from banking subsidiaries to the
parent company. Because of these limitations, substantially all
of the net assets of Regions’ subsidiaries are restricted,
except for the amount that can be paid to the parent in the form
of dividends.

Note 11.

Employee Benefit Plans

Regions has a defined-benefit pension plan
covering substantially all employees employed at or before
December 31, 2000. After January 1, 2001, the plan was
closed to new entrants. Benefits under the plan are based on
years of service and the employee’s highest five years of
compensation during the last ten years of employment.
Regions’ funding policy is to contribute annually at least
the amount required by IRS minimum funding standards.
Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits
attributed to service to date, but also for those expected to be
earned in the future.

The Company also sponsors a supplemental
executive retirement program, which is a non-qualified plan that
provides certain senior executive officers defined pension
benefits in relation to their compensation.

The following table sets forth the plans’
funded status, using a September 30 measurement date, and
amounts recognized in the consolidated statement of condition:

The accumulated benefit obligation at the end of
2005 and 2004 was $424.2 million and $353.3 million,
respectively. Pension liabilities for the supplemental executive
retirement program of $29.3 million and $22.1 million
were recorded at December 31, 2005 and December 31,
2004, respectively and were included in the $71.6 million
and $72.8 million prepaid pension cost, respectively.

Net pension cost included the following
components:


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The weighted average assumptions used to
determine the plans’ benefit obligations at the end of each
year and the plans’ net pension cost during each year were
as follows:

The asset allocation for the plan at the end of
2005 and 2004, and the target allocation for 2006, by asset
category, are as follows:

Regions’ investment strategy is to invest
primarily in large-cap equity securities and intermediate term
investment grade domestic fixed income securities. Regions will
invest in small-cap, mid-cap, and international equities in
smaller concentrations depending on the Company’s outlook
for growth in those sectors. The expected long-term return on
plan assets assumption is determined using the plan asset mix,
historical returns and expert opinion.

Regions’ profit sharing plan was
discontinued as of January 1, 2005; thus, there were no
contributions in 2005. Contributions in 2004 and 2003 totaled
$7.0 million and $13.9 million, respectively.

Regions’ 401(k) plan includes a company
match of eligible employee contributions. At December 31,
2005, this match totaled 100% of the eligible employee
contribution (up to 6% of compensation) after one year of
service and was invested in Regions common stock. Regions’
contribution to the 401(k) plan on behalf of employees totaled
$34.2 million, $25.7 million, and $16.5 million
in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Regions sponsors a defined-benefit postretirement
health care plan that covers certain retired employees.
Currently the Company pays a portion of the costs of certain
health care benefits for all eligible employees that retired
before January 1, 1989. No health care benefits are
provided for employees retiring at normal retirement age after
December 31, 1988. For employees retiring before normal
retirement age, the Company currently pays a portion of the
costs of certain health care benefits until the retired employee
becomes eligible for Medicare. Certain retirees, participating
in plans of acquired entities, are offered a Medicare
supplemental benefit. The plan is contributory and contains
other cost-sharing features such as deductibles and co-payments.
Retiree health care benefits, as well as similar benefits for
active employees, are provided through a group insurance program
in which premiums are based on the amount of benefits paid. The
Company’s policy is to fund the Company’s share of the
cost of health care benefits in amounts determined at the
discretion of management.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table sets forth the plan’s
funded status, using a September 30 measurement date, and
amounts recognized in the consolidated statement of condition:

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost included
the following components:

The assumed health care cost trend rate was 9.0%
for 2005 and is assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0% by 2010
and remain at that level thereafter. Increasing the assumed
health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each
year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation at December 31, 2005, by $1.9 million and
the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net
periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2005 by $147,000.
Decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one
percentage point in each year would decrease the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2005, by
$1.7 million and the aggregate of the service and interest
cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for
2005 by $136,000.

Leases

Rental expense for all leases amounted to
approximately $88.4 million, $64.0 million and
$43.4 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
approximate future minimum rental commitments as of
December 31, 2005, for all noncancelable leases with
initial or remaining terms of one year or more are shown in the
following table. Included in these amounts are all renewal
options reasonably assured of being exercised.

In 2005, Regions sold 111 properties to a third
party with an agreement to lease back a portion of certain
properties. The lease back agreement requires uneven lease
payments on certain properties, over the fifteen year lease
term. As such, Regions is deemed to have continuing involvement
with the properties and accordingly will continue to incur
depreciation expense in connection with these properties. In
addition,


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Regions recorded a long term debt obligation
totaling $83.1 million relating to these properties. The
approximate total future minimum rental commitment as of
December 31, 2005, for all leases related to this
transaction is $112.3 million, including $12.2 million
annually in 2006 through 2009 and $8.4 million in 2010.
These amounts are included in the table above and will be
recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term.

Subsequent to December 31, 2005, a Regions
subsidiary entered into a 10-year lease renewal that will result
in the following annual rental payments over the next five
years: 2006-$3.1 million; 2007-$4.1 million;
2008-$4.1 million; 2009-$4.1 million;
2010-$4.1 million; 2011 and after-$21.5 million. These
amounts are not included in the table above.

Note 13.

Commitments and Contingencies

To accommodate the financial needs of its
customers, Regions makes commitments under various terms to lend
funds to consumers, businesses and other entities. These
commitments include (among others) revolving credit agreements,
term loan commitments and short-term borrowing agreements. Many
of these loan commitments have fixed expiration dates or other
termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many
of these commitments are expected to expire without being
funded, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent future liquidity requirements. Standby letters of
credit are also issued, which commit Regions to make payments on
behalf of customers if certain specified future events occur.
Historically, a large percentage of standby letters of credit
also expire without being funded.

Both loan commitments and standby letters of
credit have credit risk essentially the same as that involved in
extending loans to customers and are subject to normal credit
approval procedures and policies. Collateral is obtained based
on management’s assessment of the customer’s credit.

Loan commitments totaled $19.8 billion at
December 31, 2005, and $17.0 billion at
December 31, 2004. Standby letters of credit were
$3.1 billion at December 31, 2005, and
$2.4 billion at December 31, 2004. Commitments under
commercial letters of credit used to facilitate customers’
trade transactions were $72.8 million at December 31,
2005, and $148.9 million at December 31, 2004.

The Company and its affiliates are subject to
litigation and claims arising out of the normal course of
business. Regions evaluates these contingencies based on
information currently available, including advice of counsel and
assessment of available insurance coverage. Although it is not
possible to predict the ultimate resolution or financial
liability with respect to these litigation contingencies,
management is of the opinion that the outcome of pending and
threatened litigation would not have a material effect on
Regions’ consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

Note 14.

Derivative Financial Instruments and
    Hedging Activities

Regions maintains positions in derivative
financial instruments to manage interest rate risk, facilitate
asset/liability management strategies, and to serve the risk
management needs of customers. The most common derivative
instruments are forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps,
credit default swaps, and put and call options. For those
derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting,
according to Statement 133, Regions designates the hedging
instrument as either a cash flow or fair value hedge. The
accounting policies associated with derivative financial
instruments are discussed further in Note 1 “Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated
financial statements.

Regions utilizes certain derivative instruments
to hedge the interest cash flows of certain variable-rate loans
and certain debt instruments. Regions reported a
$4.2 million loss in accumulated other comprehensive income
related to cash flow hedges of variable-rate loans at
December 31, 2005. These interest rate swaps mature in
2006; thus, the entire amount is expected to be reclassified
during the next twelve months. To the extent that the hedge of
future cash flows is deemed effective, changes in the fair value
of the derivative are recognized as a component of other
comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity. To the extent
that the


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

hedge of future cash flows is deemed ineffective,
changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in
earnings as a component of other non-interest expense. For the
years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, there was a gain of
approximately $40,000 related to hedge ineffectiveness
recognized in other non-interest expense attributable to cash
flow hedges on variable-rate loans. No gains or losses were
recognized during 2005 related to components of derivative
instruments that were excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness. In addition, Regions also reported a
$2.8 million loss in other comprehensive income (net of
approximately $994,000 amortized to interest expense in 2004) at
December 31, 2004 related to cash flow hedges of debt
instruments. Approximately $609,000 was amortized to interest
expense in 2005. The Company will amortize the remaining
$2.2 million loss into earnings in conjunction with the
recognition of interest payments through 2011. The amount
expected to be reclassified during the next twelve months is
$417,000.

Regions hedges the changes in fair value of
certain assets using forward contracts, which represent
commitments to sell money market instruments at a future date at
a specified price or yield. The contracts are utilized by the
Company to hedge interest rate risk positions associated with
the origination of mortgage loans held for sale. The Company is
subject to the market risk associated with changes in the value
of the underlying financial instrument as well as the risk that
the other party will fail to perform. A net loss of
$3.5 million (including approximately $129,000 of loss on
hedge ineffectiveness) was recognized during 2005 related to
these hedging instruments. For the year ended December 31,
2004, Regions recognized a net hedging gain of $2.1 million
(including approximately $12,000 of gain on hedge
ineffectiveness) associated with these hedging instruments. The
gross amount of forward contracts totaled $1.1 billion at
December 31, 2005, and 2004.

Regions has also entered into interest rate swap
agreements converting a portion of its fixed-rate long-term debt
to floating-rate. The fair values of the derivative instruments
used in these fair value hedges are included in other assets on
the statement of financial condition. For the year ended
December 31, 2005, there was ineffectiveness of
approximately $63,000 in losses recorded in earnings related to
these fair value hedges. For the year ended December 31,
2004, there was no ineffectiveness recorded in earnings related
to these fair value hedges. No gains or losses were recognized
during 2005 or 2004 related to components of derivative
instruments that were excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness.

During the first six months of 2004, Regions sold
Eurodollar futures contracts to hedge the fair value of a pool
of highly correlated indirect auto loans. This hedge
relationship was terminated on July 1, 2004, and Regions
entered into offsetting futures contracts. The futures contracts
previously used to hedge the indirect auto loans, as well as the
offsetting futures contracts, are now classified as trading.

In prior years, Union Planters, acquired by
Regions in July 2004, issued letters of credit to facilitate
business in its factored receivables division. Certain of these
assets were sold in 2005; however, the letters of credit
remained with Regions. As part of this transaction, Regions
received a $75 million notional credit default swap as
default protection related to the outstanding letters of credit.
The estimated fair value of this instrument is approximately
$1 million. Also, during 2005, Regions entered into two
$30 million notional credit default swaps. These agreements
hedge default risk associated with an interest rate swap
agreement entered into with a municipality and an offsetting
interest rate swap agreement with a counterparty.

The Company also maintains a derivatives trading
portfolio of interest rate swaps, option contracts and futures
and forward commitments used to meet the needs of its customers.
The portfolio is used to generate trading profit and help
clients manage interest rate risk. The Company is subject to the
risk that a counterparty will fail to perform. These trading
derivatives are recorded in other assets and other liabilities.
The net fair value of the trading portfolio at December 31,
2005 and 2004 was $12.1 million and $23.8 million,
respectively.

Foreign currency contracts involve the exchange
of one currency for another on a specified date and at a
specified rate. These contracts are executed on behalf of the
Company’s customers and are used to manage fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates. The notional amount of forward foreign
exchange contracts totaled


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$67 million and $25 million at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company is
subject to the risk that another party will fail to perform.

In the normal course of business, Morgan Keegan
enters into underwriting and forward and future commitments. At
December 31, 2005, the contract amount of future contracts
to purchase and sell U.S. Government and municipal
securities was approximately $35 million and
$129 million, respectively. The brokerage subsidiary
typically settles its position by entering into equal but
opposite contracts and, as such, the contract amounts do not
necessarily represent future cash requirements. Settlement of
the transactions relating to such commitments is not expected to
have a material effect on the subsidiary’s financial
position. Transactions involving future settlement give rise to
market risk, which represents the potential loss that can be
caused by a change in the market value of a particular financial
instrument. The exposure to market risk is determined by a
number of factors, including size, composition and
diversification of positions held, the absolute and relative
levels of interest rates, and market volatility.

Additionally, in the normal course of business,
Morgan Keegan enters into transactions for delayed delivery,
to-be-announced securities, which are recorded on the
consolidated statement of financial condition at fair value.
Risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to
meet the terms of their contracts and from unfavorable changes
in interest rates or the market values of the securities
underlying the instruments. The credit risk associated with
these contracts is typically limited to the cost of replacing
all contracts on which the Company has recorded an unrealized
gain. For exchange-traded contracts, the clearing organization
acts as the counterparty to specific transactions and,
therefore, bears the risk of delivery to and from counterparties.

Regions’ derivative financial instruments
are summarized as follows:

Credit Risk Amount is defined as all positive
    exposures not collateralized with cash on deposit. Any credit
    risk arising under option contracts is combined with swaps to
    reflect netting agreements.

Note 15.

Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used
by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for
financial instruments.

Cash and cash equivalents:

The carrying amount reported in the
consolidated statements of condition and cash flows approximates
the estimated fair value.

Interest-bearing deposits in other banks:

The carrying amount reported in the
consolidated statement of condition approximates the estimated
fair value.

Securities held to maturity:

Estimated fair values are based on
quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices
are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted
market prices of comparable instruments.

Securities available for sale:

Estimated fair values, which are the
amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of condition,
are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted
market prices are not available, estimated fair values are based
on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Trading account assets:

Estimated fair values, which are the
amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of condition,
are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted
market prices are not available, estimated fair values are based
on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Loans held for sale:

Loans held for sale include
single-family real estate mortgage loans, and in the prior year,
factored accounts receivables and asset-based loans. Mortgage
loans held for sale have been designated as one of the hedged
items in a fair value hedging relationship under
Statement 133. Therefore, to the extent changes in fair
value are attributable to the interest rate risk being hedged,
the change in fair value is recognized in income as an
adjustment to the carrying amount of mortgage loans held for
sale. Otherwise, mortgage loans held for sale are accounted for
under the lower of cost or market method. The fair values are
based on quoted market prices of similar instruments, adjusted
for differences in loan characteristics. In the prior year,
Regions accounted for factored accounts receivables and
asset-based loans under the lower of cost or market method. The
fair values were based on cash flow models.

Margin receivables:

The carrying amount reported in the
consolidated statement of condition approximates the estimated
fair value.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Loans:

Estimated
fair values for variable-rate loans, which reprice frequently
and have no significant credit risk, are based on carrying
value. Estimated fair values for all other loans are estimated
using discounted cash flow analyses, based on interest rates
currently offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of
similar credit quality. The carrying amount of accrued interest
reported in the consolidated statements of condition
approximates the fair value.

Derivative assets and liabilities:

Fair values for derivative instruments
are based either on cash flow projection models or observable
market prices.

Deposit liabilities:

The fair value of non-interest bearing
demand accounts, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings
accounts, money market accounts and certain other time open
accounts is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date
(i.e., the carrying amount). Fair values for certificates of
deposit are estimated by using discounted cash flow analyses,
using the interest rates currently offered for deposits of
similar maturities.

Short-term borrowings:

The carrying amount reported in the
consolidated statements of condition approximates the estimated
fair value.

Long-term borrowings:

Fair values are estimated using
discounted cash flow analyses, based on the current rates
offered for similar borrowing arrangements.

Loan commitments, standby and commercial
letters of credit:

Estimated fair
values for these off-balance-sheet instruments are based on
standard fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements.

The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of
the Company’s financial instruments are as follows:

Income Taxes

At December 31, 2005, Regions had net
operating loss carryforwards of $277.3 million
($3.3 million federal) that expire in years 2006 through
2025. In addition, Regions had federal capital loss
carryforwards of $185.0 million that will expire in years
2008 through 2009. Management does not believe that it is more
likely than not to realize all of its state net operating loss
carryforwards nor all of its capital loss carryforwards.
Accordingly, it has set up a valuation allowance of
$12.6 million and $55.2 million, respectively, against
such benefits.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects
of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
used for income tax purposes. Significant components of
Regions’ deferred tax assets and liabilities as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004 are listed below:


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Applicable income taxes for financial reporting
purposes differs from the amount computed by applying the
statutory federal income tax rate of 35% for the reasons below:

From time to time Regions engages in business
plans that may also have an effect on its tax liabilities. While
Regions has obtained the opinion of advisors that the tax
aspects of these strategies should prevail, examination of
Regions’ income tax returns or changes in tax law may
impact the tax benefits of these plans.

During the fourth quarter of 2000, Regions
recapitalized a mortgage-related subsidiary by raising
Tier 2 capital through the issuance of a new class of
participating preferred stock of this subsidiary. Regions is not
subject to tax on the portion of the subsidiary’s income
allocated to the holders of the preferred stock for federal
income tax purposes.

Regions’ federal and state income tax
returns for the years 1998 through 2004 are open for review and
examination by governmental authorities. In the normal course of
these examinations, Regions is subject to challenges from
governmental authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. Regions
has received notices of proposed adjustments relating to taxes
due for the years 1999 through 2003, which include proposed
adjustments relating to an increase in taxable income of the
mortgage-related subsidiary discussed above. Regions believes
adequate provision for income taxes has been recorded for all
years open for review and intends to vigorously contest the
proposed adjustments. To the extent that final resolution of the
proposed adjustments results in significantly different
conclusions from Regions’ current assessment of the
proposed adjustments, Regions’ effective tax rate in any
given financial reporting period may be materially different
from its current effective tax rate.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The provisions for income taxes in the
consolidated statements of income are summarized below. Included
in these amounts are income tax benefits of $6.6 million
for 2005 and income tax expenses of $22.1 million and
$9.0 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to
securities transactions.

Business Combinations

On July 1, 2004, the Company completed its
merger with Union Planters, headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee.
Both companies merged into a new holding company named Regions
Financial Corporation upon completion of the transaction. In the
transaction, each share of Union Planters common stock was
converted into one share of the new company $0.01 par value
common stock and each share of Regions’ $0.625 par
value common stock was converted into 1.2346 shares of the
new company $0.01 par value common stock. The merger was
accounted for as a purchase of Union Planters by Regions for
accounting and financial reporting purposes.

In connection with the merger, Regions Financial
Corporation issued a total of 461,842,025 shares of common
stock. The table below provides a summary of the number of
shares issued upon the completion of the merger:


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The merger is being accounted for in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,
“Business Combinations.” Accordingly, the purchase
price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on their estimated fair values at the merger date,
as summarized below.

During 2004, Regions also completed the
acquisition of ETIM. In connection with the transaction, Regions
paid $19 million in cash and recorded $10.1 million of
identifiable intangible assets as well as $7.1 million of
excess purchase price.

During 2005, Regions completed its acquisitions
of an oil and gas valuation and brokerage entity as well as
various insurance production activities. In connection with
these acquisitions, Regions paid $7.2 million in cash and
recorded $5.6 million in identifiable intangible assets as
well as $1.5 million of excess purchase price.

Variable Interest Entities

In 2003, Regions adopted FIN 46 for all
variable interest entities (“VIE”) created after
January 31, 2003, as well as VIEs created prior to
February 1, 2003 that are considered to be special-purpose
entities. FIN 46 was also adopted on March 31, 2004
for entities created prior to February 1, 2003 which are
not considered to be special-purpose entities. A summary of
Regions’ significant variable interests in VIEs is provided
below.

Regions owns the common stock of subsidiary
business trusts, which have issued mandatorily redeemable
preferred capital securities (“trust preferred
securities”). One of the trusts issued $287.5 million
in trust preferred securities in February 2001. Another trust
issued $3.0 million in trust preferred securities and was
acquired as part of a bank acquisition in November 2001. The
trusts’ only assets are junior subordinated debentures
issued by Regions, which were acquired by the trusts using the
proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities and
common stock. Prior to the adoption of FIN 46 for
special-purpose entities on December 31, 2003, Regions
consolidated the trusts and reported the trust preferred
securities in long-term debt. Regions determined that it is not
the primary beneficiary of the trusts and, accordingly,
deconsolidated the trusts upon the adoption of FIN 46 for
special-purpose entities on December 31, 2003. As of
December 31, 2004, the junior subordinated debentures were
included in long-term debt and Regions’ equity interest in
the business trusts was included in other assets. The
deconsolidation in 2003 resulted in a net increase in long-term
debt and other assets of $9.0 million. The deconsolidation
of the trusts did not impact net income. For regulatory
reporting and capital adequacy purposes, the Federal Reserve
Board has indicated that such preferred securities will continue
to constitute Tier 1 capital until further notice.

Regions invested in two grantor trusts during
2001 which are parties to leveraged lease financing
transactions. The trusts have been determined to be VIEs.
Regions’ total investment in the trusts and maximum
exposure to loss was $92.3 million as of December 31,
2005. FIN 46 did not impact Regions’ current leveraged
lease accounting for its investment in the trusts.

Regions periodically invests in single-purpose
trusts that own tax-exempt municipal bonds. These trusts were
determined to be VIEs; however, Regions is not the primary
beneficiary of the trusts. As of December 31, 2005,
Regions’ maximum exposure to loss approximates its
investment in the trusts of $1.2 million.

Regions periodically invests in various limited
partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing
the Low Income Housing Tax Credit pursuant to Section 42 of
the Internal Revenue Code. The investments are funded through a
combination of debt and equity with equity typically comprising
30% to 50% of the total partnership capital. Regions has
concluded that these partnerships are VIEs; however, Regions is
not the primary beneficiary of these partnerships. As of
December 31, 2005, Regions’ recorded investment in
these limited partnerships was $125.6 million.
Regions’ maximum exposure to loss as of December 31,
2005 was $141.4 million, which included $15.8 million
in unfunded commitments to the partnerships.

Regions has a recorded investment of
$3.9 million in non-registered investment partnerships
which were determined to be VIEs, but for which Regions has
concluded it is not the primary beneficiary. Regions’
maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2005, was
$5.9 million which includes $2.0 million in unfunded
commitments to the partnerships.

The adoption of FIN 46 for entities created
before February 1, 2003 that are not considered to be
special-purpose entities resulted in the consolidation of one
non-registered investment partnership at March 31, 2004.
The consolidation resulted in increases to cash of
$0.9 million, trading account assets of $18.4 million,
interest receivable of $0.1 million, long-term borrowings
of $5.9 million and other liabilities of $9.0 million.
The consolidation also resulted in a decrease to other assets of
$4.7 million. These increases and decreases to the non-cash
accounts are excluded for the consolidated statement of cash
flows since they represent non-cash items.

Stock Option and Long-Term Incentive
    Plans

Regions has stock option plans for certain key
employees that provide for the granting of options to purchase
up to 7,061,912 shares of Regions’ common stock
(excluding options assumed in connection with acquisitions). The
terms of options granted are determined by the compensation
committee of the Board of Directors; however, no options may be
granted after ten years from the plans’ adoption, and no
options may be exercised beyond ten years from the date granted.
The option price per share of incentive stock options cannot be
less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date
of the grant; however, the option price of non-qualified options
may be less than the fair market value of the common stock on
the date of the grant. The plans also permit the granting of
stock appreciation rights to holders of stock options. No stock
appreciation rights were attached to options outstanding at
December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003. In 2005, net shares
increased approximately 5.8 million shares due to option
exercises.

Regions’ long-term incentive plans provide
for the granting of up to 54,086,434 shares of common stock
in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
performance awards or restricted stock awards. The terms of
stock options granted under the long-term incentive plans are
generally subject to the same terms as options granted under
Regions’ stock option plans. A maximum of
6,790,300 shares of restricted stock and
37,038,000 shares of performance awards may be granted.
During 2005, 2004 and 2003, Regions granted 1,285,389, 2,097,555
and 431,530 shares, respectively, as restricted stock.
Grantees of restricted stock must remain employed with Regions
for certain periods from the date of the grant in order for the
shares to be released, or the grantees must meet the standards
of a retiree at which time the restricted shares may be prorated
and released. However, during this period the grantee is
eligible to receive dividends and exercise voting privileges on
such restricted shares. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, 590,004, 22,680
and 377,452 restricted shares, respectively, were released.
Total expense for restricted stock was $26,817,000 in 2005,
$12,933,000 in 2004 and $10,331,000 in 2003. In 2005, net shares
for released restricted stock increased by approximately
900,000 shares.

In connection with the business combinations with
other companies in years prior to 2005, Regions assumed stock
options that were previously granted by those companies and
converted those options, based on the appropriate exchange
ratio, into options to acquire Regions’ common stock. The
common stock for such options has been registered under the
Securities Act of 1933 by Regions and is not included in the
maximum number of shares that may be granted by Regions under
its existing stock option plans.

Stock option activity (including assumed options)
over the last three years is summarized as follows:

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-based Payment”
(“Statement 123(R)”) will be adopted by the
Company as of January 1, 2006. This accounting standard
revises Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”
(“Statement 123”), by requiring that all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options, be recognized in the financial statements based
on their estimated fair values at the date of grant. See
additional discussion of this new accounting standard in
Note 25 “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” to the
consolidated financial statements.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In October 1995, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement 123.
Statement 123 was effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1995, and allows for the option of
continuing to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25 “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”
(“Opinion 25”), and the related interpretations,
or selecting the fair value method of expense recognition as
described in Statement 123. The Company has elected to
follow Opinion 25 in accounting for its employee stock
options. Pro forma net income and net income per share data is
presented below for the years ended December 31 as if the
fair-value method had been applied in measuring compensation
costs:

Regions’ options outstanding have a weighted
average contractual life of 6.2 years. The weighted average
fair value of options granted was $5.09 in 2005, $4.43 in 2004
and $3.68 in 2003. The fair value of each grant is estimated on
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants
in 2005, 2004 and 2003:

Since the exercise price of the Company’s
employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying
stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is
recognized.

On December 20, 2005, the Company approved
the acceleration of vesting of certain unvested nonqualified
stock options outstanding as of that date and recognized
approximately $399,000 in compensation expense in conjunction
with the acceleration of vesting. The decision to accelerate the
vesting of the unvested nonqualified options primarily was made
to reduce noncash compensation expense that would otherwise have
been recorded in Regions’ financial statements in future
periods, in accordance with Statement 123(R). The expense
that otherwise would have been recorded in future periods,
absent the accelerated vesting, totaled approximately
$14.7 million (pre-tax).

Regulatory Capital
    Requirements

Regions and its banking subsidiaries are subject
to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal
banking agencies. These regulatory capital requirements involve
quantitative measures of the Company’s assets, liabilities
and certain off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative
judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital
requirements can subject the Company to a series of increasingly
restrictive regulatory actions. As of December 31, 2005,
the most recent notification from federal banking agencies
categorized Regions and its significant subsidiaries as
“well capitalized” under the regulatory framework.

Minimum capital requirements for all banks are
Tier 1 Capital of at least 4% of risk-weighted assets,
Total Capital of at least 8% of risk-weighted assets and a
Leverage Ratio of 3%, plus an additional 100- to 200-basis point
cushion in certain circumstances, of adjusted quarterly average
assets. Tier 1 Capital consists principally of
stockholders’ equity, excluding unrealized gains and losses
on securities available for sale, less excess purchase price and
certain other intangibles. Total Capital consists of Tier 1
Capital plus certain debt instruments and the allowance for loan
losses, subject to limitation.

Regions’ and its banking subsidiaries’
capital levels at December 31, 2005 and 2004, exceeded the
“well capitalized” levels, as shown below:


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In addition, Regions’ subsidiaries engaged
in mortgage banking must adhere to various U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development
(“HUD”) regulatory guidelines including required
minimum capital to maintain their Federal Housing Administration
approved status. Failure to comply with the HUD guidelines could
result in withdrawal of this certification. As of
December 31, 2005, Regions Mortgage (a division of Regions
Bank) and Equifirst were in compliance with HUD guidelines.
Regions Mortgage and Equifirst are also subject to various
capital requirements by secondary market investors.

Business Segment Information

Regions’ segment information is presented
based on Regions’ primary segments of business. Each
segment is a strategic business unit that serves specific needs
of Regions’ customers. The Company’s primary segment
is Community Banking. Community Banking represents the
Company’s branch banking functions and has separate
management that is responsible for the operation of that
business unit. In addition, Regions has designated as distinct
reportable segments the activity of its treasury, mortgage
banking, investment banking/brokerage/trust, and insurance
divisions. The treasury division includes the Company’s
bond portfolio, indirect mortgage lending division, and other
wholesale activities. Mortgage banking consists of origination
and servicing functions of Regions’ mortgage subsidiaries.
Investment banking includes trust activities and all brokerage
and investment activities associated with Morgan Keegan.
Insurance includes all business associated with commercial
insurance, in addition to credit life products sold to consumer
customers. The reportable segment designated “Other”
includes activity of Regions’ indirect consumer lending
division and the parent company including eliminations. Prior
period amounts have been restated to reflect changes in
methodology.

Recent Accounting
    Pronouncements

In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 115-1 and
124-1 (“FSP 115-1 and 124-1”) which codified existing
guidance addressing the determination as to when an investment
is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than
temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss. The FSP is
effective for reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2005.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued
Statement 123(R). Statement 123(R) revises
Statement 123, and supersedes Opinion 25.
Statement 123(R) requires all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be
recognized in the financial statements based on their fair
values. It uses a “modified grant-date” approach in
which the fair value of an equity award is estimated on the
grant date without regard to service or performance conditions.
The fair value is recognized as expense over the requisite
service period for all awards that vest. The requisite service
period is the period of time over which an employee must provide
service in exchange for an award under a share-based payment
arrangement, or the vesting period. Statement 123(R) is
effective for public companies in the first annual period
beginning after June 15, 2005 and allows for two transition
alternatives. The modified-prospective transition method would
require companies to recognize expense for share-based payments
to employees based on their grant-date fair value from the
beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition
provisions are first applied. In addition, expense would be
recognized for awards that were granted prior to, but not vested
as of, the date Statement 123(R) is adopted based on the
same estimate of grant-date fair value used previously under
Statement 123 for pro forma footnote disclosure purposes.
Statement 123(R) also allows the modified-retrospective
transition method in which companies will restate prior periods
by recognizing expense for the amounts previously reported in
the pro forma footnote disclosures under the provisions of
Statement 123. As permitted by Statement 123, the
Company currently accounts for share-based payments to employees
using Opinion 25’s intrinsic value method and, as such,
generally recognizes no expense for employee stock options.
Accordingly, the adoption of Statement 123(R) will have an
impact on Regions’ results of operations, although it will
have no impact on Regions’ overall financial position. The
impact of implementation of Statement 123(R) cannot be
predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of
share-based payments granted and assumptions used in the future.
However, had Regions adopted Statement 123(R) in prior
periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the
impact of Statement 123 as described in the disclosure of
pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note 20
“Stock Options and Long-Term Incentive Plans.”

On June 1, 2005, the FASB issued Statement
No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections” (“Statement 154”), a
replacement of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20,
“Accounting Changes,” and Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 3, “Reporting Accounting
Changes in Interim Financial Statements”. The Statement
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle, and
changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a
change in accounting principle. In the absence of specific
transition requirements to the contrary in the adoption of an
accounting principle, Statement 154 requires retrospective
application to prior periods’ financial statements of a
voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is
impracticable for comparability and consistency of financial
information between periods. Statement 154 is effective for
accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2005.

On July 14, 2005, the FASB issued an
Exposure Draft on Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, a
proposed interpretation of Statement 109. The proposed
interpretation requires that only benefits from tax positions
that are more-likely-than-not of being sustained under audit
should be recognized in the financial statements. These benefits
would be recorded at amounts considered to be the best estimates
of management. At the time these positions become
more-likely-than-not to be disallowed under audit, their
recognition would be reversed. Regions is currently reviewing
the potential impact of this proposed interpretation; any
cumulative effect associated with the allocation of the
provisions of the proposed interpretation will be reported as a
change in accounting principle in the period in which the
interpretation is adopted. The final interpretation is expected
to be effective as of the beginning of the first annual period
beginning after December 15, 2006.

Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation, as of the end of the
period covered by this Form 10-K, under the supervision and
with the participation of Regions’ management, including
its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that Regions’ disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Act of
1934) are effective. During the fourth fiscal quarter of the
year ended December 31, 2005, there have been no changes in
Regions’ internal control over financial reporting that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, Regions’ control over financial reporting.

Report on Management’s Assessment of
Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of Regions is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. Regions’ internal control system was
designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s
management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and
fair presentation of the Company’s financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

All internal control systems, no matter how well
designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or
detect misstatements in the Company’s financial statements.
Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

Regions’ management assessed the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this
assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) in its Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based
on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31,
2005, the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Regions’ independent registered public
accounting firm has issued an audit report on our assessment of
the Company’s internal control over financing reporting.
This report appears on the following page.


Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm

Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Regions Financial Corporation

We have audited management’s assessment,
included in the accompanying Report on Management’s
Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that
Regions Financial Corporation maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
based on criteria established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
Regions Financial Corporation’s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that
Regions Financial Corporation maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO
criteria. Also, in our opinion, Regions Financial Corporation
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on
the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated statements of condition of
Regions Financial Corporation as of December 31, 2005 and
2004, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2005, and our report
dated March 3, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
