Item 1.

Business

Regions Financial Corporation (together with its
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, “Regions” or
“Company”), is a financial holding company
headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama which operates primarily
within the southeastern United States. Regions’ operations
consist of banking, brokerage and investment services, mortgage
banking, insurance brokerage, credit life insurance, commercial
accounts receivable factoring and specialty financing. At
December 31, 2004, Regions had total consolidated assets of
approximately $84.1 billion, total consolidated deposits of
approximately $58.7 billion, and total consolidated
stockholders’ equity of approximately $10.7 billion.

Regions is a Delaware corporation that on
July 1, 2004, became the successor by merger to Union
Planters Corporation (“Union Planters”) and the former
Regions Financial Corporation. Regions’ principal executive
offices are located at 417 North 20th Street, Birmingham,
Alabama 35203, and its telephone number at such address is
(205) 944-1300.

Banking Operations

Regions Financial Corporation conducts its
banking operations through Regions Bank, an Alabama chartered
commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System,
and Union Planters Bank, National Association
(“UPBNA”), a national bank. At December 31, 2004,
Regions operated 1,323 full service banking offices in Alabama,
Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.



The following chart reflects the distribution of
total assets, loans, deposits and branches in each of the states
in which Regions conducts its banking operations.

Other Financial Services Operations

In addition to its banking operations, Regions
provides additional financial services through the following
subsidiaries or divisions:

Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.
(“Morgan Keegan”), acquired in 2001 and a subsidiary
of Regions Financial Corporation, is a full-service regional
brokerage and investment banking firm. Morgan Keegan offers
products and services including securities brokerage, asset
management, financial planning, mutual funds, securities
underwriting, sales and trading, and investment banking. Morgan
Keegan, one of the largest investment firms in the South,
employs approximately 1,000 financial advisors offering
products and services from 244 offices located in Alabama,
Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts,
Mississippi, New York, Louisiana, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia as well as Toronto,
Canada.

Regions Mortgage, a division of UPBNA, and
EquiFirst Corporation (“EquiFirst”), a subsidiary of
Regions Bank, are engaged in mortgage banking. Regions
Mortgage’s primary business and source of income is the
origination and servicing of mortgage loans for long-term
investors. EquiFirst typically originates mortgage loans which
are sold to third-party investors. Regions Mortgage’s
servicing portfolio totaled approximately $39.4 billion and
included approximately 445,000 real estate mortgages at
December 31, 2004. Regions Mortgage and EquiFirst operate
loan production offices in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida,
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee
and Texas.

Rebsamen Insurance, Inc., acquired in 2001 and a
subsidiary of Regions Financial Corporation, acts as a general
insurance broker for a full-line of insurance products,
primarily focusing on commercial property and casualty insurance
customers.

Regions Agency, Inc., a subsidiary of
Regions Financial Corporation, acts as an insurance agent or
broker with respect to credit life and accident and health
insurance and other types of insurance relating to extensions of
credit by Regions Bank or Regions’ banking-related
subsidiaries.



Regions Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary of
Regions Financial Corporation, acts as a re-insurer of credit
life and accident and health insurance in connection with the
activities of certain affiliates of Regions.

Regions Interstate Billing Service, Inc.
(“RIBS”), a subsidiary of Regions Financial
Corporation, factors commercial accounts receivable and performs
billing and collection services. RIBS primarily serves clients
related to the trucking and automotive service industry.

Acquisition Program

In July 2004, Regions and Union Planters
completed a merger of the two companies. Union Planters was a
$32.2 billion bank holding company headquartered in
Memphis, Tennessee. UPBNA now operates as a banking subsidiary
of Regions. The merger was accounted for as a purchase of Union
Planters by Regions for accounting and financial reporting
purposes.

A substantial portion of the growth of Regions
from its inception as a bank holding company in 1971 to the
merger with Union Planters has been through the acquisition of
other financial institutions, including commercial banks and
thrift institutions, and the assets and deposits thereof. Prior
to the merger with Union Planters, Regions had completed
103 acquisitions of financial institutions and financial
service providers representing in aggregate (at the time the
acquisitions were completed) approximately $28.4 billion in
assets. As part of its ongoing strategic plan, Regions
continually evaluates business combination opportunities. Any
future business combination or series of business combinations
that Regions might undertake may be material, in terms of assets
acquired or liabilities assumed, to Regions’ financial
condition. Recent business combinations in the financial
services industry have typically involved the payment of a
premium over book and market values. This practice could result
in dilution of book value and net income per share for the
acquirer.

Segment Information

Reference is made to Note 24 “Business
Segment Information” to the consolidated financial
statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for information required by this item.

Supervision And Regulation

General.

Regions is
a financial holding company, registered with the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System under the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”). As such,
Regions and its subsidiaries are subject to the supervision,
examination, and reporting requirements of the BHC Act and the
regulations of the Federal Reserve.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, adopted in 1999
(“GLB Act”), significantly relaxed previously existing
restrictions on the activities of banks and bank holding
companies. Under such legislation, an eligible bank holding
company may elect to be a “financial holding company”
and thereafter may engage in a range of activities that are
financial in nature and that were not previously permissible for
banks and bank holding companies. A financial holding company
may engage directly or through a subsidiary in the statutorily
authorized activities of securities dealing, underwriting, and
market making, insurance underwriting and agency activities,
merchant banking, and insurance company portfolio investments. A
financial holding company also may engage in any activity that
the Federal Reserve determines by rule or order to be financial
in nature, incidental to such financial activity, or
complementary to a financial activity and that does not pose a
substantial risk to the safety and soundness of an institution
or to the financial system generally.

In addition to these activities, a financial
holding company may engage in those activities permissible for a
bank holding company including factoring accounts receivable,
acquiring and servicing loans, leasing personal property,
performing certain data processing services, acting as agent or
broker in selling credit life insurance and certain other types
of insurance in connection with credit transactions, and
conducting certain insurance underwriting activities. The BHC
Act does not place territorial limitations on permissible
nonbanking activities of bank holding companies. Despite prior
approval, the Federal Reserve has the power to order any bank
holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or
to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the
Federal Reserve has reasonable grounds to believe that
continuation of



such activity or such ownership or control
constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety,
or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.

The GLB Act also permits securities brokerage
firms and insurance companies to own banks and bank holding
companies. The GLB Act also seeks to streamline and coordinate
regulation of integrated financial holding companies, providing
generally for “umbrella” regulation of financial
holding companies by the Federal Reserve, and for functional
regulation of banking activities by bank regulators, securities
activities by securities regulators, and insurance activities by
insurance regulators.

For a bank holding company to be eligible for
financial holding company status, all of its subsidiary insured
depository institutions must be well-capitalized and
well-managed. A bank holding company may become a financial
holding company by filing a declaration with the Federal Reserve
that it elects to become a financial holding company. The
Federal Reserve must deny expanded authority to any bank holding
company with a subsidiary insured depository institution that
received less than a satisfactory rating on its most recent
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the “CRA”) review
as of the time it submits its declaration. If, after becoming a
financial holding company and undertaking activities not
permissible for a bank holding company, the company fails to
continue to meet any of the prerequisites for financial holding
company status, the company must enter into an agreement with
the Federal Reserve to comply with all applicable capital and
management requirements. If the company does not return to
compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve may order
the company to divest its subsidiary banks or the company may
discontinue or divest its non-permissible activities.

The BHC Act requires every bank holding company
to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before:
(1) it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control
of any voting shares of any bank if, after such acquisition, the
bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control
more than 5.0% of the voting shares of the bank; (2) it or
any of its subsidiaries, other than a bank, may acquire all or
substantially all of the assets of any bank; or (3) it may
merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company.

The BHC Act further provides that the Federal
Reserve may not approve any transaction that would result in a
monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or
conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business
of banking in any section of the United States, or the effect of
which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to
create a monopoly in any section of the country, or that in any
other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the
anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly
outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and
needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also
required to consider the financial and managerial resources and
future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks
concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be
served. Consideration of financial resources generally focuses
on capital adequacy, and consideration of convenience and needs
issues includes the parties’ performance under the CRA,
both of which are discussed below.

Regions Bank and UPBNA are members of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), and as such,
their deposits are insured by the FDIC to the extent provided by
law. They are also subject to numerous statutes and regulations
that affect their business activities and operations, and are
supervised and examined by one or more state or federal bank
regulatory agencies.

Regions Bank is a state-chartered bank. Regions
Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to
supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve and the state
banking authority of Alabama, the state in which it is
headquartered. The Federal Reserve and the Alabama Department of
Banking regularly examine the operations of Regions Bank and are
given authority to approve or disapprove mergers,
consolidations, the establishment of branches, and similar
corporate actions. The federal and state banking regulators also
have the power to prevent the continuance or development of
unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law.

UPBNA is a banking association chartered under
the National Bank Act and is subject to supervision and
examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(the “OCC”). The OCC regularly examines the operations
of UPBNA and has authority to approve or disapprove mergers,
consolidations, the



establishment of branches, and similar corporate
actions. The OCC also has the power to prevent the continuance
or development of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other
violations of law.

Community Reinvestment
Act.

Regions Bank and UPBNA are
subject to the provisions of the CRA. Under the terms of the
CRA, the banks have a continuing and affirmative obligation
consistent with safe and sound operation to help meet the credit
needs of their entire communities, including low- and
moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish
specific lending requirements or programs for financial
institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion
to develop the types of products and services that it believes
are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the
CRA. The CRA requires each appropriate federal bank regulatory
agency, in connection with its examination of a subsidiary
depository institution, to assess such institution’s record
in assessing and meeting the credit needs of the community
served by that institution, including low- and moderate-income
neighborhoods. The regulatory agency’s assessment of the
institution’s record is made available to the public. The
assessment also is part of the Federal Reserve’s and the
OCC’s consideration of applications to acquire, merge or
consolidate with another banking institution or its holding
company, to establish a new branch office that will accept
deposits or to relocate an office. In the case of a bank holding
company applying for approval to acquire a bank or other bank
holding company, the Federal Reserve will assess the records of
each subsidiary depository institution of the applicant bank
holding company, and such records may be the basis for denying
the application. Regions Bank and UPBNA received a
“satisfactory” CRA rating in their most recent
examinations.

Patriot Act.

In
2001, President Bush signed into law comprehensive
anti-terrorism legislation known as the USA Patriot Act.
Title III of the USA Patriot Act requires financial
institutions, including Regions’ banking, broker-dealer,
and insurance subsidiaries, to help prevent, detect and
prosecute international money laundering and the financing of
terrorism. Regions’ banking, broker-dealer and insurance
subsidiaries have augmented their systems and procedures to meet
the requirements of these regulations.

Payment of
Dividends.

Regions Financial
Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its
banking and other subsidiaries. The principal source of cash
flow of Regions Financial Corporation, including cash flow to
pay dividends to its stockholders, is dividends from Regions
Bank and UPBNA. There are statutory and regulatory limitations
on the payment of dividends by the banks to Regions Financial
Corporation as well as by Regions Financial Corporation to its
stockholders.

As to the payment of dividends, Regions Bank is
subject to the laws and regulations of the state of Alabama and
to the regulations of the Federal Reserve, and UPBNA is subject
to federal law and regulations of the OCC.

If, in the opinion of a federal regulatory
agency, an institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or
is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which,
depending on the financial condition of the institution, could
include the payment of dividends), such agency may require,
after notice and hearing, that such institution cease and desist
from such practice. The federal banking agencies have indicated
that paying dividends that deplete an institution’s capital
base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound
banking practice. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), an
insured institution may not pay any dividend if payment would
cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is
undercapitalized. See “Regulatory Remedies under
FDICIA.” Moreover, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the
FDIC have issued policy statements stating that bank holding
companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends only
out of current operating earnings.

At December 31, 2004, under dividend
restrictions imposed under federal and state laws, Regions Bank
and UPBNA, without obtaining governmental approvals, could
declare aggregate dividends to Regions Financial Corporation of
approximately $907 million.

The payment of dividends by Regions Financial
Corporation and its subsidiary banks may also be affected or
limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain
adequate capital above regulatory guidelines.

Capital Adequacy.

Regions Financial Corporation and its subsidiary banks are
required to comply with the applicable capital adequacy
standards established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. There
are two basic measures of capital adequacy for bank holding
companies that have been promulgated by the Federal



Reserve: a risk-based measure and a leverage
measure. All applicable capital standards must be satisfied for
a financial holding company to be considered in compliance.

The risk-based capital standards are designed to
make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to
differences in credit and market risk profile among banks and
bank holding companies, to account for off-balance-sheet
exposure, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid
assets. Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad
risk categories, each with appropriate weights. The resulting
capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total
risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items.

The minimum guideline for the ratio of total
capital (“Total Capital”) to risk-weighted assets
(including certain off-balance-sheet items, such as standby
letters of credit) is 8.0%. At least half of the Total Capital
must be composed of common equity, undivided profits, minority
interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries,
noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, and a limited amount of
cumulative perpetual preferred stock, less goodwill and certain
other intangible assets (“Tier 1 Capital”). The
remainder may consist of subordinated debt, other preferred
stock, and a limited amount of allowance for loan losses. The
minimum guideline for Tier 1 Capital is 4.0%. At
December 31, 2004, Regions’ consolidated Tier 1
Capital ratio was 9.04% and its Total Capital ratio was 13.51%.

In addition, the Federal Reserve has established
minimum leverage ratio guidelines for financial holding
companies. These guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of
Tier 1 Capital to average assets, less goodwill and certain
other intangible assets (the “Leverage Ratio”), of
3.0% for bank holding companies that meet certain specified
criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating. All
other bank holding companies generally are required to maintain
a Leverage Ratio of at least 3.0%, plus an additional cushion of
100 to 200 basis points. Regions’ Leverage Ratio at
December 31, 2004, was 7.47%. The guidelines also provide
that bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or
making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital
positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels
without significant reliance on intangible assets. Furthermore,
the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will consider a
“tangible Tier 1 Capital leverage ratio”
(deducting all intangibles) and other indicators of capital
strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities.

The subsidiary banks are subject to substantially
similar risk-based and leverage capital requirements as those
applicable to Regions. Regions Bank and UPBNA were in compliance
with applicable minimum capital requirements as of
December 31, 2004. Neither Regions nor its subsidiary banks
has been advised by any federal banking agency of any specific
minimum capital ratio requirement applicable to it.

Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject
a bank to a variety of enforcement remedies, including the
termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, and to certain
restrictions on its business. See “Regulatory Remedies
under FDICIA.”

Support of Subsidiary
Banks.

Under Federal Reserve policy,
Regions Financial Corporation is expected to act as a source of
financial strength to, and to commit resources to support, its
subsidiary banks. This support may be required at times when,
absent such Federal Reserve policy, Regions may not be inclined
to provide it. In addition, any capital loans by a financial
holding company to its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right
of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such
subsidiary banks. In the event of a financial holding
company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the financial
holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain
the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the
bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.

Regulatory Remedies under
FDICIA.

FDICIA establishes a system of
regulatory remedies to resolve the problems of undercapitalized
institutions. Under this system, which became effective in 1992,
the federal banking regulators are required to establish five
capital categories (“well capitalized,”
“adequately capitalized,”
“undercapitalized,” “significantly
undercapitalized,” and “critically
undercapitalized”) and to take certain mandatory
supervisory actions, and are authorized to take other
discretionary actions, with respect to institutions in the three
undercapitalized categories, the severity of which will depend
upon the capital category in which the institution is placed.
Generally, subject to a narrow exception, FDICIA requires the



banking regulator to appoint a receiver or
conservator for an institution that is critically
undercapitalized. The federal banking agencies have specified by
regulation the relevant capital level for each category.

Under the agencies’ rules implementing
FDICIA’s remedy provisions, an institution that
(1) has a Total Capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a
Tier 1 Capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, and a Leverage
Ratio of 5.0% or greater and (2) is not subject to any
written agreement, order, capital directive, or regulatory
remedy directive issued by the appropriate federal banking
agency is deemed to be “well capitalized.” An
institution with a Total Capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a
Tier 1 Capital ratio of 4.0% or greater, and a Leverage
Ratio of 4.0% or greater is considered to be “adequately
capitalized.” A depository institution that has a Total
Capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 Capital ratio of
less than 4.0%, or a Leverage Ratio of less than 4.0% is
considered to be “undercapitalized.” An institution
that has a Total Capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1
Capital ratio of less than 3.0%, or a Leverage Ratio of less
than 3.0% is considered to be “significantly
undercapitalized,” and an institution that has a tangible
equity capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2.0% is
deemed to be “critically undercapitalized.” For
purposes of the regulation, the term “tangible equity”
includes core capital elements counted as Tier 1 Capital
for purposes of the risk-based capital standards plus the amount
of outstanding cumulative perpetual preferred stock (including
related surplus), minus all intangible assets with certain
exceptions. A depository institution may be deemed to be in a
capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its
actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory
examination rating.

An institution that is categorized as
undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically
undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital
restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency.
Under FDICIA, a bank holding company must guarantee that a
subsidiary depository institution meets its capital restoration
plan, subject to certain limitations. The obligation of a
controlling bank holding company under FDICIA to fund a capital
restoration plan is limited to the lesser of 5.0% of an
undercapitalized subsidiary’s assets or the amount required
to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized
institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its
average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any
branches, or engaging in any new line of business, except in
accordance with an accepted capital restoration plan or with the
approval of the FDIC. In addition, the appropriate federal
banking agency is given authority with respect to any
undercapitalized depository institution to take any of the
actions it is required to or may take with respect to a
significantly undercapitalized institution as described below if
it determines “that those actions are necessary to carry
out the purpose” of FDICIA.

For those institutions that are significantly
undercapitalized or undercapitalized and either fail to submit
an acceptable capital restoration plan or fail to implement an
approved capital restoration plan, the appropriate federal
banking agency must require the institution to take one or more
of the following actions: sell enough shares, including voting
shares, to become adequately capitalized; merge with (or be sold
to) another institution (or holding company), but only if
grounds exist for appointing a conservator or receiver; restrict
certain transactions with banking affiliates as if the
“sister bank” exception to the requirements of
Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act did not exist;
otherwise restrict transactions with bank or nonbank affiliates;
restrict interest rates that the institution pays on deposits to
“prevailing rates” in the institution’s
“region;” restrict asset growth or reduce total
assets; alter, reduce, or terminate activities; hold a new
election of directors; dismiss any director or senior executive
officer who held office for more than 180 days immediately
before the institution became undercapitalized, provided that in
requiring dismissal of a director or senior officer, the agency
must comply with certain procedural requirements, including the
opportunity for an appeal in which the director or officer will
have the burden of proving his or her value to the institution;
employ “qualified” senior executive officers; cease
accepting deposits from correspondent depository institutions;
divest certain nondepository affiliates which pose a danger to
the institution; or be divested by a parent holding company. In
addition, without the prior approval of the appropriate federal
banking agency, a significantly undercapitalized institution may
not pay any bonus to any senior executive officer or increase
the rate of compensation for such an officer without regulatory
approval.

At December 31, 2004, Regions Bank and UPBNA
had the requisite capital levels to qualify as well capitalized.



FDIC Insurance
Assessments.

Pursuant to FDICIA, the
FDIC adopted a risk-based assessment system for insured
depository institutions that takes into account the risks
attributable to different categories and concentrations of
assets and liabilities. The risk-based system, which went into
effect in 1994, assigns an institution to one of three capital
categories: (1) well capitalized; (2) adequately
capitalized; and (3) undercapitalized, as determined by
capital reported by the institution in the quarterly report
issued before each assessment period. Each institution also is
assigned by the FDIC to one of three supervisory subgroups
within each capital group. The supervisory subgroup to which an
institution is assigned is based on a supervisory evaluation
provided to the FDIC by the institution’s primary federal
regulator and information which the FDIC determines to be
relevant to the institution’s financial condition and the
risk posed to the deposit insurance funds (which may include, if
applicable, information provided by the institution’s state
supervisor). An institution’s insurance assessment rate is
then determined based on the capital category and supervisory
subgroup to which it is assigned. Under the final risk-based
assessment system, there are nine assessment risk
classifications (i.e., combinations of capital groups and
supervisory subgroups) to which different assessment rates are
applied.

Regions Bank and UPBNA are assessed at the
well-capitalized level where the premium rate is currently zero.
Like all insured banks, the subsidiary banks also must pay a
quarterly assessment of approximately $.02 per $100 of
assessable deposits to pay off bonds that were issued in the
late 1980’s by a mixed-ownership government corporation,
the Financing Corporation, to raise funds to cover costs of the
resolution of the savings and loan crisis.

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act
(“FDIA”), insurance of deposits may be terminated by
the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in
unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound
condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable
law, regulation, rule, order, or condition imposed by the FDIC.

Safety and Soundness
Standards.

The FDIA, as amended by
FDICIA and the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory
Improvement Act of 1994, requires the federal bank regulatory
agencies to prescribe standards, by regulations or guidelines,
relating to internal controls, information systems and internal
audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest
rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, stock
valuation and compensation, fees and benefits and such other
operational and managerial standards as the agencies deem
appropriate. In 1995, the federal bank regulatory agencies
adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards
pursuant to FDICIA, as amended. The guidelines establish general
standards relating to internal controls and information systems,
internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting,
interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, fees and
benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other
things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage
the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. The
guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and
unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the
amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the
services performed by an executive officer, employee, director,
or principal stockholder. In addition, the agencies adopted
regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to
order an institution that has been given notice by an agency
that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness
standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so
notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable
compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an
acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order
directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an
order directing other actions of the types to which an
undercapitalized institution is subject under the “prompt
corrective action” provisions of FDICIA. See
“Regulatory Remedies under FDICIA.” If an institution
fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to
enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil
money penalties. The federal bank regulatory agencies also
proposed guidelines for asset quality and earnings standards.

Depositor
Preference.

The Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993 provides that deposits and certain
claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation
against an insured depository institution would be afforded a
priority over other general unsecured claims against such an
institution in the “liquidation or other resolution”
of such an institution by any receiver.



Regulation of Morgan
Keegan.

As a registered investment
adviser and broker-dealer, Morgan Keegan is subject to
regulation and examination by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”), the National Association of
Securities Dealers (“NASD”), the New York Stock
Exchange (“NYSE”), and other self regulatory
organizations (“SROs”), which may affect its manner of
operation and profitability. Such regulations cover a broad
range of subject matter. Rules and regulations for registered
broker-dealers cover such issues as: capital requirements; sales
and trading practices; use of client funds and securities; the
conduct of directors, officers, and employees; record-keeping
and recording; supervisory procedures to prevent improper
trading on material non-public information; qualification and
licensing of sales personnel; and limitations on the extension
of credit in securities transactions. Rules and regulations for
registered investment advisers include the limitations on the
ability of investment advisers to charge performance-based or
non-refundable fees to clients, record-keeping and reporting
requirements, disclosure requirements, limitations on principal
transactions between an adviser or its affiliates and advisory
clients, and anti-fraud standards.

Morgan Keegan is subject to the net capital
requirements set forth in Rule 15c3-1 of the Exchange Act.
The net capital requirements measure the general financial
condition and liquidity of a broker-dealer by specifying a
minimum level of net capital that a broker-dealer must maintain,
and by requiring that a significant portion of its assets be
kept liquid. If Morgan Keegan failed to maintain its minimum
required net capital, it would be required to cease executing
customer transactions until it came back into compliance. This
could also result in Morgan Keegan losing its NASD membership,
its registration with the SEC, or require a complete liquidation.

The SEC’s risk assessment rules also apply
to Morgan Keegan as a registered broker-dealer. These rules
require broker-dealers to maintain and preserve records and
certain information, describe risk management policies and
procedures, and report on the financial condition of affiliates
whose financial and securities activities are reasonably likely
to have a material impact on the financial and operational
condition of the broker-dealer. Certain “material
associated persons” of Morgan Keegan, as defined in the
risk assessment rules, may also be subject to SEC regulation.

In addition to federal registration, state
securities commissions require the registration of certain
broker-dealers and investment advisers. Morgan Keegan is
registered as a broker-dealer with every state, the District of
Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Morgan Keegan is registered as an
investment adviser in the following states: Alabama, Arkansas,
California, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia,
Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan,
Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina,
Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South
Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont,
Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

Violations of federal, state, and SRO rules or
regulations may result in the revocation of broker-dealer or
investment adviser licenses, imposition of censures or fines,
the issuance of cease and desist orders, and the suspension or
expulsion of officers and employees from the securities business
firm. In addition, Morgan Keegan’s business may be
materially affected by new rules and regulations issued by the
SEC or SROs as well as any changes in the enforcement of
existing laws and rules that affect its securities business.

Other.

The United
States Congress continues to consider a number of wide-ranging
proposals for altering the structure, regulation, and
competitive relationships of the nation’s financial
institutions. It cannot be predicted whether or in what form
further legislation may be adopted or the extent to which
Regions’ business may be affected thereby.



Competition

All aspects of Regions’ business are highly
competitive. Regions’ subsidiaries compete with other
financial institutions located in the states in which they
operate and other adjoining states, as well as large banks in
major financial centers and other financial intermediaries, such
as savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer
finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies,
investment companies, mutual funds, other mortgage companies and
financial service operations of major commercial and retail
corporations.

Customers for banking services and other
financial services offered by Regions’ subsidiaries are
generally influenced by convenience, quality of service,
personal contacts, price of services, and availability of
products. Although Regions’ position varies in different
markets, Regions believes that its affiliates effectively
compete with other financial services companies in their
relevant market areas.

Employees

As of December 31, 2004, Regions and its
subsidiaries had approximately 26,000 full-time-equivalent
employees.

damages are routinely claimed in these cases. Regions continues
to be concerned about the general trend in litigation involving
large damage awards against financial service company defendants.

Notwithstanding these concerns, Regions believes,
based on consultation with legal counsel, that the outcome of
pending litigation will not have a material effect on
Regions’ consolidated financial position but could impact
operating results for a particular reporting period.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operation

Introduction

General

The following discussion and financial
information is presented to aid in understanding Regions
Financial Corporation’s (“Regions” or the
“Company”) financial position and results of
operations. The emphasis of this discussion will be on the years
2002, 2003 and 2004; in addition, financial information for
prior years will also be presented when appropriate. Certain
amounts in prior year financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

On July 1, 2004, Regions merged with Union
Planters Corporation (“Union Planters”) headquartered
in Memphis, Tennessee. The combination with Union Planters added
approximately $35.7 billion of assets, $22.3 billion
of loans, and $22.9 billion of deposits. This transaction
was accounted for as a purchase of Union Planters by Regions and
accordingly prior period financial statements have not been
restated, except certain share and per share amounts related to
the exchange of Regions common stock. Union Planters’
results of operations were included in Regions’ results
beginning July 1, 2004. Comparisons with prior periods are
significantly impacted by the merger with Union Planters (see
Note 18 “Business Combinations” to the
consolidated financial statements).

Regions’ primary business is providing
traditional commercial and retail banking services to customers
throughout its geographic footprint. Regions’ banking
subsidiaries, Regions Bank and Union Planters Bank, National
Association (“UPBNA”), have operations in Alabama,
Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. In 2004, Regions’ banking
operations, excluding trust activities, contributed
approximately $723 million to consolidated net income.

In addition to providing traditional commercial
and retail banking services, Regions provides other financial
services in the fields of investment banking, asset management,
trust, mutual funds, securities brokerage, mortgage banking,
insurance, leasing and other specialty financing. Regions
provides investment banking and brokerage services through 244
offices of Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc. (“Morgan
Keegan”). Morgan Keegan contributed approximately
$83.6 million to net income in 2004, including trust
activities. Regions Morgan Keegan Trust, FSB, a federal savings
bank subsidiary of Morgan Keegan, acts as fiduciary for certain
Morgan Keegan trust clients and does not accept retail insured
deposits. Regions’ mortgage banking divisions, Regions
Mortgage and EquiFirst Corporation (“EquiFirst”),
provide residential mortgage loan origination and servicing
activities for customers and contributed $55.1 million to
net income in 2004. Regions Mortgage services approximately
$39.4 billion in mortgage loans as of December 31,
2004. Regions provides full-line insurance brokerage services
primarily through Rebsamen Insurance, Inc., one of the 50
largest insurance brokers in the country. Credit life insurance
services for customers are provided through other Regions’
affiliates. Insurance activities contributed approximately
$14.2 million to net income in 2004.

Regions’ profitability, like that of many
other financial institutions, is dependent on its ability to
generate revenue from net interest income and non-interest
income sources. Net interest income is the difference between
the interest income Regions receives on earning assets, such as
loans and securities, and the interest expense Regions pays on
interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and
borrowings. Regions’ net interest income is impacted by the
size and mix of its balance sheet components and the interest
rate spread between interest earned on its assets and interest
paid on its liabilities. Non-interest income includes fees from
service charges on deposit accounts, trust and securities
brokerage activities, mortgage origination and servicing,
insurance and other customer services which Regions provides.
Results of operations are also affected by the provision for
loan losses and non-interest expenses such as salaries and
employee benefits, occupancy and other operating expenses,
including income taxes.

Economic conditions, competition and the monetary
and fiscal policies of the Federal government in general,
significantly affect financial institutions, including Regions.
Lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are
influenced by the level of business spending and investment,
consumer income, spending and savings, capital market
activities, competition among financial institutions, customer
prefer-



ences, interest rate conditions and prevailing
market rates on competing products in Regions’ primary
market areas.

Regions’ business strategy has been and
continues to be focused on providing a competitive mix of
products and services, delivering quality customer service and
maintaining a branch distribution network with offices in
convenient locations. Regions believes that its merger with
Union Planters will be beneficial in the continued
implementation of this strategy.

The Company’s principal market areas are
located in the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri,
Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and
Texas. Morgan Keegan also operates offices in New York,
Massachusetts and Virginia as well as Toronto, Canada.

2004 Highlights

Regions’ most significant accomplishment in
2004 was the successful completion of the merger with Union
Planters. This transaction dramatically increased Regions’
customer base and geographic footprint resulting in a stronger,
better positioned franchise. The combination with Union Planters
resulted in improved market share in attractive markets
including Texas, Florida and Tennessee. Considering aggregate
deposits, in the six core states (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia,
Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee) of the franchise, Regions
has the 2nd largest overall deposit market share.

Regions reported net income available to common
shareholders of $2.19 per diluted share in 2004, including
a reduction of $.10 per diluted share related to
$39 million (net of tax) in merger-related expenses. Net
income available to common shareholders was $2.35 per
diluted share in 2003.

Net interest income for 2004 was
$2.1 billion, compared to $1.5 billion in 2003. The
net interest margin for 2004 was 3.66%, up from 3.49% in 2003.
The increase in the net interest margin was due in part to a
shift in the mix of earning assets. Loans, typically
Regions’ highest yielding asset, increased as a percentage
of total earning assets. Reduced balance sheet leverage
contributed to the shift in mix of earning assets as certain
maturities from the securities portfolio were not reinvested but
rather were used to reduce borrowings. In addition, the benefit
resulting from the early retirement of Federal Home
Loan Bank advances in the second quarter of 2004 also
contributed to a higher net interest margin. As of
December 31, 2004, interest rate sensitivity analysis
indicated Regions’ balance sheet remains in a slightly
asset sensitive position, which should be beneficial in a rising
rate environment.

Regions’ banking unit showed positive signs
in 2004. Excluding the effect of the Union Planters merger,
loans increased 8% due to increases in commercial real estate
lending and consumer lines of credit. Deposits increased 9%,
excluding the effect of the merger with Union Planters, due
primarily to growth in interest-free and money market deposits.

Net charge-offs totaled $131.0 million or
0.29% of average loans in 2004, compared to 0.33% in 2003.
Non-performing assets including loans past due 90 days
increased $188.4 million to $527.0 million at
December 31, 2004 but declined as a percentage of total
loans and other real estate compared to year-end 2003. In 2004,
Regions successfully completed the integration of the credit
policy functions of Regions and Union Planters.

Non-interest income totaled 42% of total revenue
in 2004, as Regions continues to benefit from a diversified
revenue steam. Brokerage and investment revenues declined
slightly in 2004 as a slow down from record levels of fixed
income production in prior years was not completely offset by
improved private client revenues related to improved equity
markets and two closed end fund offerings. Equity capital
markets and investment advisory fees were also higher in 2004.
Residential mortgage servicing and origination fees were higher
in 2004, due to business activity added in connection with the
Union Planters merger. The mortgage industry continues to face a
number of market challenges. Regions continues to evaluate its
mortgage division for the optimal business mix as well as
improved operating efficiencies.



Non-interest expense totaled $2.5 billion in
2004 compared to $1.8 billion in 2003. Included in 2004 are
merger-related charges of $55.1 million. In connection with
the integration of Regions and Union Planters, Regions has and
will continue to incur merger-related expenses throughout the
integration process. As the integration of Regions and Union
Planters progresses, Regions expects to realize merger
efficiencies in the banking units as well as other lines of
business. Regions intends to continue to invest in many areas of
the franchise, including personnel, technology and product
delivery channels in order to increase revenue and improve
efficiencies while continuing to provide superior customer
service.

Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing financial information, management is
required to make significant estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses for the periods shown. The accounting principles
followed by Regions and the methods of applying these principles
conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States and general banking practices. Estimates and
assumptions most significant to Regions are related primarily to
allowance for loan losses, intangibles (excess purchase price,
other identifiable intangible assets and mortgage serving
rights) and income taxes, and are summarized in the following
discussion and notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Management’s determination of the adequacy
of the allowance for loan losses, which is based on the factors
and risk identification procedures discussed in the following
pages, requires the use of judgments and estimates that may
change in the future. Changes in the factors used by management
to determine the adequacy of the allowance, or the availability
of new information, could cause the allowance for loan losses to
be increased or decreased in future periods. In addition, bank
regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, may
require that additions be made to the allowance for loan losses
based on their judgments and estimates.

Regions’ excess purchase price (the amount
in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired) is tested
for impairment annually, or more often if events or
circumstances indicate impairment may exist. Adverse changes in
the economic environment, operations of acquired business units,
or other factors could result in a decline in implied fair value
of excess purchase price. If the implied fair value is less than
the carrying amount, a loss would be recognized to reduce the
carrying amount to implied fair value.

Other identifiable intangible assets, primarily
core deposits intangibles, are reviewed at least annually for
events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of
the intangible asset, such as loss of core deposits, increased
competition or adverse changes in the economy. To the extent an
other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable, an
impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount
to the fair value.

For purposes of evaluating mortgage servicing
impairment, Regions must estimate the value of its mortgage
servicing rights (MSR). MSR do not trade in an active market
with readily observable market prices. Although sales of MSR do
occur, the exact terms and conditions of sales may not be
readily available. As a result, Regions stratifies its mortgage
servicing portfolio on the basis of certain risk
characteristics, including loan type and contractual note rate,
and values its MSR using discounted cash flow modeling
techniques which require management to make estimates regarding
future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration
historical and forecasted mortgage loan prepayment rates and
discount rates. Changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or
other factors could result in impairment of the servicing asset
and a charge against earnings to reduce the recorded carrying
amount. Based on a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, Regions
estimates that a reduction in the primary mortgage market rates
of 25 basis points and 50 points would reduce the
December 31, 2004 fair value of MSR by 14%
($56 million) and 30% ($111 million), respectively.
Management mitigates risk associated with declines in the
estimated value of MSR by purchasing agency securities to create
economic hedges.



Management’s determination of the
realization of the deferred tax asset is based upon
management’s judgment of various future events and
uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income
earned by certain subsidiaries and the implementation of various
tax plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset.
Management believes that the subsidiaries will generate
sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax
benefits. Regions’ 1998 to 2003 consolidated federal income
tax returns are open for examination. From time to time Regions
engages in business plans that may also have an effect on its
tax liabilities. While Regions has obtained the opinion of
advisors that the tax aspects of these plans should prevail,
examination of Regions’ income tax returns or changes in
tax law may impact these plans and resulting provisions for
income taxes.

Acquisitions

The acquisitions of banks and other financial
service companies historically have contributed significantly to
Regions’ growth. The acquisitions of other financial
service companies have also allowed Regions to better diversify
its revenue stream and to offer additional products and services
to its customers. Regions, from time to time, evaluates
potential bank and non-bank acquisition candidates; however, no
transactions were pending at December 31, 2004.

On July 1, 2004, Regions completed its
merger with Union Planters Corporation, headquartered in
Memphis, Tennessee. Union Planters provided traditional
commercial and retail banking services and other financial
services in the fields of mortgage banking, insurance, trust,
securities brokerage and investments, professional employment
services and specialty financing. Union Planters’ banking
subsidiary, UPBNA, serves customers through over 700 branches
covering the midsouth. The combination with Union Planters,
while adding $35.7 billion in assets, $22.3 billion in
loans and $22.9 billion in deposits, significantly expanded
Regions geographic footprint as well as its customer base.
Through the merger, Regions expanded its banking presence into
new markets in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi
and Missouri and strengthened its banking presence in existing
markets in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Tennessee and
Texas.

Additionally in 2004, Regions acquired Evergreen
Timber Investment Management (“ETIM”). ETIM manages
timber assets for third parties and produces annual revenue of
approximately $10 million.

In 2003, Regions consummated the purchase of
three branches from Inter Savings Bank, FSB, which strengthened
its community banking franchise in central Florida. These
branches combined added $185 million in assets,
$5 million in loans and $185 million in deposits:

In 2002, Regions consummated two acquisitions,
which strengthened its community banking franchise in Texas
while adding an insurance firm headquartered in New Iberia,
Louisiana. These acquisitions combined added $280 million
in assets, $156 million in loans and $253 million in
deposits:

•

Regions expanded its insurance division though
    the acquisition of ICT Group, LLC, headquartered in New Iberia,
    Louisiana.

•

Regions expanded into the Dallas, Texas, market
    through the acquisition of Brookhollow Bancshares, Inc., with
    $167 million in assets.

•

Regions expanded its presence in the Houston,
    Texas, market through the acquisition of Independence Bank,
    National Association, with $112 million in assets.



Regions’ business combinations over the last
three years are summarized in the following charts. Each of
these transactions was accounted for as a purchase.

Financial Condition

Regions’ financial condition depends
primarily on the quality and nature of its assets, liabilities
and capital structure, the market and economic conditions, and
the quality of its personnel.

Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses

Loan Portfolio

Regions’ primary investment is loans. At
December 31, 2004, loans represented 78% of Regions’
earning assets.

Lending at Regions is generally organized along
three functional lines: commercial loans (including financial
and agricultural), real estate loans and consumer loans. The
composition of the portfolio by these major categories is
presented below (with real estate loans further broken down
between construction and mortgage loans):

As the above table demonstrates, over the last
five years loans increased a total of $26.2 billion, a
compound growth rate of 16%. In 2001, loan balances declined
$491 million due primarily to increased prepayments of
residential mortgage loans. In 2002, total loans increased
$100 million primarily due to growth in the commercial
portfolio, partially offset by the reclassification of
$1.1 billion of indirect auto loans to the loans held for
sale category on September 30, 2002. Excluding the effect
of the reclassification, total loans would have increased
$1.2 billion, or 4%, in 2002. Loans increased
$1.2 billion or 4% in 2003, due primarily to growth in the
real estate portfolio partially offset by a decline in the
commercial portfolio. Loans increased significantly in 2004 due
to $22.3 billion of loans which were added by the Union
Planters merger, $430 million of indirect auto loans
reclassified to the loan portfolio from the loans held for sale
category and internally generated loan growth. Excluding loans
added from the merger and reclassification, loans increased 8%
in 2004.



Loans added in connection with the Union Planters
merger are summarized in the following table.

All major categories in the loan portfolio have
increased significantly over the last five years due primarily
to the merger with Union Planters. Over the last five years,
commercial, financial and agricultural loans increased
$6.0 billion, or 66%. Real estate construction loans
increased $2.2 billion, or 67%, over the same period. Real
estate mortgage loans increased $14.5 billion, or 111%, and
consumer loans increased $3.4 billion, or 58%, over the
last five years.

In 2004, as economic factors improved, internally
generated loan growth increased, primarily in the real estate
and consumer categories. Average total loans were
$30.9 billion in 2002, compared to $31.5 billion in
2003 and $44.7 billion in 2004. The modest internal loan
growth trend experienced in prior years was a result of lower
loan demand resulting from weaker economic conditions,
significant prepayments of mortgage loans, management
initiatives to focus on higher margin loans, combined with the
reclassification of indirect auto loans in 2002. Regions expects
modest loan growth in 2005.

Regions’ residential real estate mortgage
portfolio totaled $8.7 billion at December 31, 2004,
an increase of approximately $3.1 billion from a year
earlier. Mortgages added in connection with the Union Planters
merger accounted for most of the increase. The portfolio
contained approximately $5.4 billion of adjustable rate
mortgages (ARM) and $3.3 billion of fixed rate
mortgages at year end.

The fixed rate residential mortgage
portfolio’s weighted average coupon increased to 5.90% from
5.73% the previous year, while the weighted average remaining
maturity decreased slightly to 170 months from
172 months. The residential ARM portfolio also exhibited a
yield increase with rates averaging 5.37% in 2004 compared to
5.10% a year earlier. At December 31, 2004, the weighted
average months to reprice was 35, up from 31 months at year
end 2003.

The amounts of total gross loans (excluding
residential mortgages and consumer loans) outstanding at
December 31, 2004, based on remaining scheduled repayments
of principal, due in (1) one year or less, (2) more
than one year but less than five years and (3) more than
five years, are shown in the following table. The amounts due
after one year are classified according to sensitivity to
changes in interest rates.



A sound credit policy and careful, consistent
credit review are vital to a successful lending program. All
affiliates of Regions operate under written loan policies that
attempt to maintain a consistent lending philosophy, provide
sound traditional credit decisions, provide an adequate
risk-adjusted return and render service to the communities in
which the banks are located. Regions’ lending policy
generally confines loans to local customers or to national firms
doing business locally. Credit reviews and loan examinations
help confirm that affiliates are adhering to these loan policies.

Allowance for Loan Losses

Every loan carries some degree of credit risk.
This risk is reflected in the consolidated financial statements
by the allowance for loan losses, the amount of loans charged
off and the provision for loan losses charged to operating
expense. It is Regions’ policy that when a loss is
identified, it is charged against the allowance for loan losses
in the current period. The policy regarding recognition of
losses requires immediate recognition of a loss if significant
doubt exists as to principal repayment.

Regions’ provision for loan losses is a
reflection of actual losses experienced during the year and
management’s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance
for loan losses. Some of the factors considered by management in
determining the amount of the provision and resulting allowance
include: (1) detailed reviews of individual loans;
(2) gross and net loan charge-offs in the current year;
(3) the current level of the allowance in relation to total
loans and to historical loss levels; (4) past due and
non-accruing loans; (5) collateral values of properties
securing loans; (6) the composition of the loan portfolio
(types of loans) and risk profiles; and
(7) management’s analysis of economic conditions and
the resulting impact on Regions’ loan portfolio.

A coordinated effort is undertaken to identify
credit losses in the loan portfolio for management purposes and
to establish the loan loss provision and resulting allowance for
accounting purposes. A regular, formal and ongoing loan review
is conducted to identify loans with unusual risks or possible
losses. The primary responsibility for this review rests with
the management of the individual banking offices. Their work is
supplemented with reviews by Regions’ internal audit staff
and corporate loan examiners. This process provides information
that helps in assessing the quality of the portfolio, assists in
the prompt identification of problems and potential problems,
and aids in deciding if a loan represents a probable loss that
should be recognized or a risk for which an allowance should be
maintained.

If it is determined that payment of interest on a
loan is questionable, it is Regions’ policy to classify the
loan as non-accrual and reverse interest previously accrued on
the loan against interest income. Interest on such loans is
thereafter recorded on a “cash basis” and is included
in earnings only when actually received in cash and when full
payment of principal is no longer doubtful.

Although it is Regions’ policy to
immediately charge off as a loss all loan amounts judged to be
uncollectible, historical experience indicates that certain
losses exist in the loan portfolio that have not been
specifically identified. To anticipate and provide for these
unidentifiable losses, the allowance for loan losses is
established by charging the provision for loan losses expense
against current earnings. No portion of the resulting allowance
is in any way allocated or restricted to any individual loan or
group of loans. The entire allowance is available to absorb
losses from any and all loans.

Regions determines its allowance for loan losses
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 114 (Statement 114) and Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 5 (Statement 5). In
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses,
management uses information from its ongoing loan review process
to stratify the loan portfolio into risk grades. The
higher-risk-graded loans in the portfolio are assigned estimated
amounts of loss based on several factors, including current and
historical loss experience of each higher-risk category,
regulatory guidelines for losses in each higher-risk category
and management’s judgment of economic conditions and the
resulting impact on the higher-risk-graded loans. All loans
deemed to be impaired, which include all non-accrual loans
greater than $1 million, excluding loans to individuals,
are evaluated individually. Impaired loans totaled approximately
$95 million at December 31, 2004 and $94 million
at December 31, 2003. The vast majority of Regions’
impaired loans are dependent upon collateral for repayment. For
these loans, impairment is measured by evaluating collateral
value as compared



to the current investment in the loan. For all
other loans, Regions compares the amount of estimated discounted
cash flows to the investment in the loan. In the event a
particular loan’s collateral value or discounted cash flows
are not sufficient to support the collection of the investment
in the loan, the loan is specifically considered in the
determination of the allowance for loan losses or a charge is
immediately taken against the allowance for loan losses. The
amount of the allowance for loan losses related to the
higher-risk loans was approximately 55% at December 31,
2004, compared to approximately 69% at December 31, 2003.
Higher-risk loans, which include impaired loans, consist of
loans classified as OLEM (other loans especially mentioned) and
below and loans in other loan categories that are significantly
past due.

In addition to establishing allowance levels for
specifically identified higher-risk-graded loans, management
determines allowance levels for all other loans in the portfolio
for which historical experience indicates that losses exist.
These loans are categorized by loan type and assigned estimated
amounts of loss based on several factors, including current and
historical loss experience of each loan type and
management’s judgment of economic conditions and the
resulting impact on each category of loans. The amount of the
allowance for loan losses related to all other loans in the
portfolio for which historical experience indicates that losses
exist was approximately 45% of Regions’ allowance for loan
losses at December 31, 2004, compared to approximately 31%
at December 31, 2003. The amount of the allowance related
to these loans is combined with the amount of the allowance
related to the higher-risk-graded loans to evaluate the overall
level of the allowance for loan losses.

As a part of the integration of Regions and Union
Planters, the loan review, grading and rating systems were
combined throughout the combined organization. The result is a
consistent approach of review and rating for loans originated
from both organizations.

Over the last five years, the year-end allowance
for loan losses as a percentage of loans ranged from a low of
1.20% at December 31, 2000 to a high of 1.41% at
December 31, 2003 and 2002. As of December 31, 2004,
the allowance as a percentage of loans was 1.31%. Management
considers the current level of the allowance for loan losses
adequate to absorb probable losses from loans in the portfolio.
Management’s determination of the adequacy of the allowance
for loan losses, which is based on the factors and risk
identification procedures previously discussed, requires the use
of judgments and estimations that may change in the future.
Changes in the factors used by management to determine the
adequacy of the allowance or the availability of new information
could cause the allowance for loan losses to be increased or
decreased in future periods. In addition, bank regulatory
agencies, as part of their examination process, may require that
additions be made to the allowance for loan losses based on
their judgments and estimates.



The following table presents information on
non-performing loans and real estate acquired in settlement of
loans:

The analysis of loan loss experience, as
reflected in the following table, shows that net loan losses
over the last five years ranged from a high of
$131.0 million in 2004 to a low of $94.1 million in
2000. Net loan losses were $104.6 million in 2003,
$111.8 million in 2002, and $126.8 million in 2001.
Over the last five years, net loan losses averaged 0.34% of
average loans and were 0.29% of average loans in 2004. Compared
to the prior year, in 2004, Regions experienced a lower
charge-off percentage for commercial credits, partially offset
by higher levels of losses in the consumer category.



The following analysis presents a five-year
history of the allowance for loan losses and loan loss data:

Risk
Characteristics of Loan Portfolio

In order to assess the risk characteristics of
the loan portfolio, it is appropriate to consider the economy of
Regions’ primary banking markets as well as the three major
categories of loans — commercial, real estate and
consumer.



Economy of Regions’ primary banking
markets.

The Alabama economy has
experienced relatively stable growth over the last several
years. Industries important in the Alabama economy include
vehicle and vehicle parts manufacturing and assembly, lumber and
wood products, health care services, and steel production. High
technology and defense-related industries are important in the
northern part of the state. Agriculture, particularly poultry,
beef cattle and cotton, are also important to the state’s
economy.

Tennessee’s economy is heavily influenced by
automobile manufacturing, tourism, entertainment and recreation,
health care and other service industries. With one out of four
Tennesseeans employed in service industries, the state’s
economy is dependent on this sector.

The economy of northern Georgia, where the
majority of Regions’ Georgia franchise is located, is
diversified with a strong presence in poultry production, carpet
manufacturing, automotive manufacturing-related industries,
tourism, and various service sector industries. A well-developed
transportation system has contributed to the growth in north
Georgia. This area has experienced rapid population growth and
has favorable household income characteristics relative to many
of Regions’ other markets.

In the southern region of Georgia, while
agriculture is important, other industries play a significant
role in the economy as well. Georgia ranks as one of the
nation’s top producers of paper and paper board products.
Albany and Valdosta, Regions’ primary market areas in
southern Georgia, are hubs for retail trade and health care for
the entire South Georgia market. These markets are also home to
numerous manufacturing and production facilities of Fortune 500
Companies.

Florida has also experienced excellent economic
growth during the last several years. Tourism and space research
are very important to the Florida economy, and military payrolls
are significant in the panhandle area. Florida has experienced
strong in-migration, contributing to strong construction
activity and a growing retirement-age population. Citrus fruit
production is also important in the state.

The Arkansas economy is supported in part by the
forest products industry, due to the abundance of
corporate-owned forests and public forest lands. In recent
years, retail trade, transportation and steel production have
become increasingly important to the state’s economy.

Natural resources are very important to the
Louisiana economy. Energy and petrochemical industries play a
significant role in the economy. Shipping, shipbuilding, and
other transportation equipment industries are strong in the
state’s durable goods industries. Tourism, amusement and
recreation, service, and health care industries are also
important to the Louisiana economy. Cotton, rice and sugarcane
are among Louisiana’s most important agricultural
commodities, while Louisiana’s fishing industry is one of
the largest in the nation.

The economy in the state of Texas has been among
the strongest in the nation in recent years. In addition to oil,
gas and agriculture, the Texas economy is supported by
telecommunications, computer and technology research, and the
health care industry.

Manufacturing and agriculture primarily drive the
Indiana economy. Steel, transportation equipment, and food
products are the leading manufactures in Indiana. Indiana’s
production of corn and wheat support its livestock and
meatpacking industries as well as its dairy industry.

Missouri’s economy relies mainly on
industry. Aerospace and transportation equipment production as
well as printing and publishing are important to the economic
growth. Missouri’s mining concerns are also vital to the
economy. Missouri is a leading producer of coal, zinc and lead.

The economy along the I-85 corridor in South
Carolina is home to numerous multinational manufacturers,
resulting in one of the highest per capita foreign investment
areas in the nation. Auto manufacturing has become increasingly
important in recent years.

The economy in Iowa is heavily influenced by
agriculture. Iowa is one of the leaders in the production of
corn and soybeans. In recent years manufacturing has become
increasingly important. Top products include farm machinery,
tires and chemicals.



The economy of Kentucky is primarily industrial,
including manufacturing of electrical equipment, automobiles and
food products. Tourism has become increasingly important in
recent years. Kentucky is also a leading producer of coal.

Timber products and agriculture continue to be
important to the Mississippi economy, although tourism and
entertainment have become important in recent years.
Mississippi’s primary agricultural products include
poultry, catfish and dairy.

The North Carolina economy is diversified with
manufacturing, agriculture, financial services and textiles as
its primary industries. North Carolina has experienced
population growth well in excess of the national average in
recent years. The economy is further supported by three state
universities, which provide stable employment and serve as
research centers in the area.

The Illinois economy is diversified with
manufacturing, mining, textiles and agriculture. Illinois’
manufactured products include food products, fabricated and
primary metal products, chemicals and published materials.
Illinois ranks high among the states in the production of coal
as well as corn, soybeans hay and wheat.

The economies in the markets served by Regions
continue to be among the best in the nation. General economic
conditions deteriorated throughout the nation in 2001 and did
not show significant recovery in 2002. In 2003, various sectors
of the economy reported growth, while others continued the slow
growth trends of 2002. Generally, economic conditions continued
to improve during 2004.

Commercial.

Regions’ commercial loan portfolio is highly diversified
within the markets it serves. Geographically, the largest
concentration is the 19% of the portfolio in the state of
Alabama. Loans in Tennessee account for 13% of the commercial
loan portfolio, while Florida and Georgia each account for 11%.
Arkansas accounts for 10% of the commercial loan portfolio,
followed by Louisiana with 8%, Texas with 6%, Indiana, Missouri
and Mississippi with 5% each, South Carolina with 3%, and
Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky and North Carolina with 1% each. A
small portion of these loans is secured by properties outside
Regions’ banking market areas.

Included in the commercial loan classification
are $1.4 billion of syndicated loans. Syndicated loans are
typically made to national companies and are originated through
an agent bank. Regions’ syndicated loans are primarily to
national companies with operations in Regions’ banking
footprint.

From 2000 to 2004, net commercial loan losses as
a percent of average commercial loans outstanding ranged from a
low of 0.41% in 2000 to a high of 0.88% in 2001. Commercial loan
losses in 2004 totaled $77.8 million, or 0.61% of average
commercial loans compared to 0.71% in 2003. The lower percentage
of commercial loan losses in 2004 compared to 2003 resulted
primarily from lower losses related to agribusiness customers.
Future losses are a function of many variables, of which general
economic conditions are the most important. Assuming moderate to
slow economic growth during 2005 in Regions’ market areas,
net commercial loan losses in 2005 are expected to be near the
2004 level.

Real Estate.

Regions’ real estate loan portfolio consists of
construction and land development loans, loans to businesses for
long-term financing of land and buildings, loans on one-to
four-family residential properties, loans to mortgage banking
companies (which are secured primarily by loans on one-to
four-family residential properties and are known as warehoused
mortgage loans) and various other loans secured by real estate.

Real estate construction loans increased
$2.0 billion in 2004 to $5.5 billion or 9.5% of
Regions’ total loan portfolio. Over the last five years
real estate construction loans averaged 10.7% of Regions’
total loan portfolio. During 2002 and 2003, construction loan
demand declined as the economy exhibited signs of weakness. In
2004, as the economic conditions improved, loan demand increased
as new construction projects increased. Most of the construction
loans relate to shopping centers, apartment complexes,
commercial buildings and residential property development. These
loans are normally secured by land and buildings and are
generally backed by commitments for long-term financing from
other financial institutions. Real estate construction loans are
closely monitored by management, since these loans are generally
considered riskier than other types



of loans and are particularly vulnerable in
economic downturns and in periods of high interest rates.
Regions generally requires higher levels of borrower equity
investment in addition to other underwriting requirements for
this type of lending as compared to other real estate lending.
Regions has not been an active lender to real estate developers
outside its market areas.

The loans to businesses for long-term financing
of land and buildings are primarily to commercial customers
within Regions’ markets. Total loans secured by non-farm,
non-residential properties totaled $11.2 billion at
December 31, 2004. Although some risk is inherent in this
type of lending, Regions attempts to minimize this risk by
generally making a significant amount of these type loans only
on owner-occupied properties, and by requiring collateral values
that exceed the loan amount, adequate cash flow to service the
debt, and in most cases, the personal guarantees of principals
of the borrowers.

Regions also attempts to mitigate the risks of
real estate lending by adhering to standard loan underwriting
policies and by diversifying the portfolio both geographically
within its market area and within industry groups.

Loans on one- to four-family residential
properties, which total approximately 55% of Regions’ real
estate mortgage portfolio, are principally on single-family
residences. These loans are geographically dispersed throughout
Regions’ market areas, and some are guaranteed by
government agencies or private mortgage insurers. Historically,
this category of loans has not produced sizable loan losses;
however, it is subject to some of the same risks as other real
estate lending. Warehoused mortgage loans, since they are
secured primarily by loans on one- to four-family residential
properties, are similar to these loans in terms of risk.

From 2000 to 2004, net losses on real estate
loans as a percent of average real estate loans outstanding
ranged from a high of 0.10% in 2004, to a low of .04% in 2001.
In 2004 real estate loan losses were relatively flat as compared
to 2003. These losses depend, to a large degree, on the level of
interest rates, economic conditions and collateral values, and
thus, are very difficult to predict. Management expects
2005 net real estate loan losses to be near the 2004 level.

Consumer.

Regions’ consumer loan portfolio consists of
$4.2 billion in consumer loans and $5.2 billion in
personal lines of credit (including home equity loans). Consumer
loans are primarily borrowings of individuals for home
improvements, automobiles and other personal and household
purposes. Regions’ consumer loan portfolio includes
$656 million of indirect consumer auto loans at
December 31, 2004, $10 million at December 31,
2003 and $30 million at December 31, 2002. Indirect
consumer loans increased significantly in 2004 due to the
reclassification, at fair value, of $430 million of
indirect auto loans from the loans held for sale category and
loans added through the Union Planters merger. Personal lines of
credit increased $3.3 billion in 2004 due to the Union
Planters merger and home equity loan promotions, which included
a low introductory interest rate and reduced closing costs.
During the past five years, the ratio of net consumer loan
losses to average consumer loans ranged from a low of 0.29% in
2003 to a high of 0.82% in 2000. Net consumer loan losses were
0.36% of average consumer loans in 2004. Consumer loan losses
increased slightly in 2004 due to higher losses associated with
the additional indirect auto loans included in the portfolio.
Consumer loan losses declined from 2000 to 2003. The lower
levels of net consumer loan losses were primarily due to
improvements in the collection and recovery process,
standardizing and improvement of underwriting procedures,
reduced credit card charge-offs resulting from the sale of the
credit card portfolio in 2000 and reduced indirect consumer loan
charge-offs resulting from the reclassification and subsequent
securitization and sale of indirect consumer loans. Consumer
loan losses are difficult to predict but historically have
tended to increase during periods of economic weakness.
Management expects net consumer loan losses in 2005 to be
slightly higher than the 2004 level.

Non-Performing Assets

At December 31, 2004, non-accrual loans
totaled $388.4 million, or 0.68% of loans, compared to
$250.3 million, or 0.78% of loans, at December 31,
2003. The increase in non-accrual loans at December 31,
2004, was due to non-accrual loans added in connection with the
Union Planters transaction, partially offset by lower levels of
commercial loans being placed on non-accrual status. Commercial
loans comprised $142.6 million of the 2004 total, with real
estate loans accounting for $234.3 million and consumer
loans $11.5 million.



Regions’ non-performing loan portfolio is
composed primarily of a number of small to medium-sized loans
that are diversified geographically throughout its franchise.
The 25 largest non-accrual loans range from $1.5 million to
$10.8 million, with only one non-accrual loan greater than
$10 million. These loans are widely dispersed among a
number of industries and are generally highly collateralized. Of
the $388.4 million in non-accrual loans at
December 31, 2004, approximately $140.9 million (36%
of total non-accrual loans) are secured by single-family
residences, which historically have had very low loss ratios.

Subsequent to year end 2004, a customer in the
marine construction industry filed for bankruptcy. The aggregate
indebtedness of this customer to Regions totals approximately
$60 million. This credit is well secured and is current on
all principal and interest payments, and consequently was not
included as a non-accrual loan as of December 31, 2004.
Management will continue to closely monitor this credit in 2005.

Loans contractually past due 90 days or more
were 0.13% of total loans at December 31, 2004, compared to
0.11% of total loans at December 31, 2003. Since
December 31, 2003, loan delinquencies have increased,
primarily in the commercial and real estate category, due to
past due loans added in connection with the Union Planters
transaction. Loans past due 90 days or more at
December 31, 2004, consisted of $45.0 million in
commercial and real estate loans and $29.8 million in
consumer loans.

Renegotiated loans totaled $279,000 at
December 31, 2004, compared to $886,000 at
December 31, 2003. Renegotiated loan balances continue to
represent a de minimus amount of total non-performing
assets.

Other real estate totaled $63.6 million at
December 31, 2004, $52.2 million at December 31,
2003, and $59.6 million at December 31, 2002. The
increase in 2004 resulted primarily from parcels added in
connection with the Union Planters transaction. The decline in
other real estate in 2003 compared to the prior year resulted
primarily from management initiatives to reduce other real
estate levels through increased sales. In 2003, sales of other
real estate totaled $119.4 million. Regions’ other
real estate is composed primarily of a number of small to
medium-size properties that are diversified geographically
throughout its franchise. The 25 largest parcels of other real
estate range in recorded value from $329,000 to
$2.4 million, with only six parcels over $1 million.
Other real estate is recorded at the lower of (1) the
recorded investment in the loan or (2) fair value less the
estimated cost to sell. Although Regions does not anticipate
material loss upon disposition of other real estate, sustained
periods of adverse economic conditions, substantial declines in
real estate values in Regions’ markets, actions by bank
regulatory agencies, or other factors, could result in
additional loss from other real estate.

The amount of interest income recognized in 2004
on the $388.4 million of non-accruing loans outstanding at
year-end was approximately $11.4 million. If these loans
had been current in accordance with their original terms,
approximately $27.2 million would have been recognized on
these loans in 2004.

Funding Commitments

In the normal course of business, Regions makes
commitments under various terms to lend funds to its customers.
These commitments include (among others) revolving credit
agreements, term loan agreements and short-term borrowing
arrangements, which are usually for working capital needs.
Letters of credit are also issued, which under certain
conditions could result in loans. See Note 13
“Commitments and Contingencies” to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information. The following
table shows the amount and duration of Regions’ funding
commitments.



The commercial, real estate and consumer loan
portfolios are highly diversified in terms of industry
concentrations. The following table shows the largest
concentrations in terms of the customers’ Standard
Industrial Classification Code at December 31, 2004 and
2003:



Interest-Bearing Deposits In Other
Banks

Interest-bearing deposits in other banks are used
primarily as temporary investments and generally have short-term
maturities. This category of earning assets increased from
$96.5 million at December 31, 2003, to
$115.0 million at December 31, 2004, as investments in
this earning asset category were added through the merger with
Union Planters.

Securities

The following table shows the carrying values of
securities by category:

In 2004, total securities increased
$3.5 billion, or 39%. The significant increase was related
to securities added through the Union Planters transaction.
U.S. Treasury and Federal agency securities increased
$1.8 billion due to the Union Planters acquisition,
partially offset by sales of agency securities. Agency
securities were sold in 2004 to offset declines in the fair
value of Regions’ mortgage servicing assets, as security
values respond inversely to a change in interest rates.
Mortgage-backed securities increased $1.3 billion due to
balances added in connection with the merger with Union Planters
partially offset by maturities as well as sales of mortgage
backed securities to manage interest rate sensitivity.

In 2003, total securities increased
$93 million, or 1%. U.S. Treasury and Federal agency
securities increased $610 million due to purchases of
agency securities to better balance Regions’ interest rate
sensitivity and to offset possible declines in the fair value of
Regions’ mortgage servicing assets, as security values
respond inversely to a change in interest rates. Mortgage-backed
securities decreased $445 million due to sales, prepayments
and other maturities in 2003. Obligations of states and
political subdivisions decreased $94 million or 17% in 2003
due to calls, sales and maturities. Other securities increased
in 2003 due to interest-only residual securities and other
securities retained in auto loan securitizations (see
Note 6 “Asset Securitizations” to the
consolidated financial statements).

Regions’ investment portfolio policy
stresses quality and liquidity. At December 31, 2004, the
average contractual maturity of U.S. Treasury and Federal
agency securities was 4.8 years and that of obligations of
states and political subdivisions was 7.1 years. The
average contractual maturity of mortgage-backed securities was
14.5 years and their expected maturity was 3.0 years.
Other securities had an average contractual maturity of
10.2 years. Overall, the average maturity of the portfolio
was 10.7 years using contractual maturities and
3.6 years using expected maturities. Expected maturities
differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the
right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or
prepayment penalties.



The estimated fair market value of Regions’
securities held to maturity portfolio at December 31, 2004,
was $778,000 below the amount carried on Regions’ books.
Regions’ securities held to maturity at December 31,
2004, included unrealized losses of $778,000 and no unrealized
gains. Regions’ securities available for sale portfolio at
December 31, 2004, included net unrealized gains of
$80 million. Regions’ securities held to maturity and
securities available for sale portfolios included gross
unrealized gains of $144.4 million and gross unrealized
losses of $65.2 million at December 31, 2004. Market
values of these portfolios vary significantly as interest rates
change. Management expects normal maturities from the securities
portfolios to meet liquidity needs. Of Regions’ tax-free
securities rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., 99%
are rated “A” or better. The portfolio is carefully
monitored to assure no unreasonable concentration of securities
in the obligations of a single debtor, and current credit
reviews are conducted on each security holding.

The following table shows the contractual
maturities of securities (excluding equity securities) at
December 31, 2004, the weighted average yields and the
taxable equivalent adjustment used in calculating the yields:

Note:

The weighted average yields are calculated on the
    basis of the yield to maturity based on the book value of each
    security. Weighted average yields on tax-exempt obligations have
    been computed on a fully taxable equivalent basis using a tax
    rate of 35%. Yields on tax-exempt obligations have not been
    adjusted for the non-deductible portion of interest expense used
    to finance the purchase of tax-exempt obligations.



Trading Account Assets

Trading account assets increased
$112.6 million to $928.7 million at December 31,
2004. Trading account assets are held for the purpose of selling
at a profit and are carried at market value.

The following table shows the carrying value of
trading account assets by type of security.

Loans Held for Sale

Loans held for sale include residential real
estate mortgage loans, as well as factored accounts receivable
and asset based loans. These loans totaled $1.8 billion
($1.6 billion of residential mortgage loans and
$176 million of factored receivables and asset based loans)
at December 31, 2004, an increase of $541 million
compared to December 31, 2003. This increase was due to
loans held for sale added through the merger with Union
Planters, partially offset by a reclassification, at fair value,
of $430 million of indirect consumer auto loans. The
indirect consumer auto loans were reclassified from loans held
for sale to consumer loans since Regions is no longer
originating and securitizing these type loans.

Margin Receivables

Margin receivables totaled $477.8 million at
December 31, 2004, and $503.6 million at
December 31, 2003. Margin receivables represent funds
advanced to brokerage customers for the purchase of securities
that are secured by certain marketable securities held in the
customer’s brokerage account. The risk of loss from these
receivables is minimized by requiring that customers maintain
marketable securities in the brokerage account which have a fair
market value substantially in excess of the funds advanced to
the customer.

Excess Purchase Price

Excess purchase price at December 31, 2004,
totaled $5.0 billion compared to $1.1 billion at
December 31, 2003. The increase is related to excess
purchase price added in connection with the merger with Union
Planters (see Note 18 “Business Combinations” to
the consolidated financial statements).

Other Identifiable Intangible Assets

Other identifiable intangible assets totaled
$356.9 million at December 31, 2004, compared to
$4.1 million at December 31, 2003. This balance
consists primarily of core deposit intangibles added in
connection with the Union Planters transaction.

Other Assets

Other assets increased $441 million compared
to December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the
result of assets added through the Union Planters merger as well
as increases in derivative asset balances.

Liquidity

General

Liquidity is an important factor in the financial
condition of Regions and affects Regions’ ability to meet
the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of its
customers. Assets, consisting principally of



loans and securities, are funded by customer
deposits, purchased funds, borrowed funds and stockholders’
equity.

The securities portfolio is one of Regions’
primary sources of liquidity. Maturities of securities provide a
constant flow of funds available for cash needs (see previous
table on Securities Maturing). Maturities in the loan portfolio
also provide a steady flow of funds (see previous table on Loans
Maturing). At December 31, 2004, commercial loans, real
estate construction loans and commercial mortgage loans with an
aggregate balance of $14.1 billion, as well as securities
of $293 million, were due to mature in one year or less.
Additional funds are provided from payments on consumer loans
and one- to four-family residential mortgage loans.
Historically, Regions’ high levels of earnings have also
contributed to cash flow. In addition, liquidity needs can be
met by the purchase of funds in state and national money
markets. Regions’ liquidity also continues to be enhanced
by a relatively stable deposit base.

The loan to deposit ratio was 98.06% and 98.33%
at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, representing
an increase compared to 94.11% at December 31, 2002. This
increase is the result of loan growth exceeding deposit growth
in 2003.

As shown in the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows, operating activities provided significant levels of funds
in 2004, 2003 and 2002, due primarily to high levels of net
income. Investing activities were a net provider of funds in
2004 primarily due to maturities and sale of securities
available for sale. Securities were sold in 2004 to manage
interest rate sensitivity. Investing activities, primarily in
loans and securities, were a net user of funds in 2003 and 2002.
Loan growth in 2003 and 2002 required a significant amount of
funds for investing activities. Funds needed for investing
activities in 2003 and 2002 were provided primarily by deposits,
purchased funds and borrowings.

Financing activities were a net user of funds in
2004, as payments on long-term borrowings used funding in 2004
as Regions (excluding borrowings added in connection with
acquisitions) was less dependent on borrowed funds as a funding
source. Increased deposits provided funds in 2004. In 2003,
financing activities were a net user of funds as a result of
declining deposit balances and increased payments on borrowed
funds. In 2002, financing activities were a significant provider
of funds as a result of strong deposit growth and proceeds from
long-term borrowings. Cash dividends and the open-market
purchase of Regions’ common stock also required funds in
2004, 2003 and 2002.

Regions’ financing arrangement with the
Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta adds additional
flexibility in managing its liquidity position. The maximum
amount that could be borrowed from the Federal Home
Loan Bank under the current borrowing agreement is
approximately $14.8 billion. Additional investment in
Federal Home Loan Bank stock is required with each advance.
The Federal Home Loan Bank has been and is expected to
continue to be a reliable and economical source of funding and
can be used to fund debt maturities as well as other
obligations. As of December 31, 2004, Regions’
borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank totaled
$3.1 billion.

Regions has two shelf registration statements
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under these
registration statements, as of December 31, 2004,
$1.1 billion of various debt securities could be registered
and subsequently issued, at market rates, to satisfy future
liquidity and funding needs (see Note 10 “Borrowed
Funds” to the consolidated financial statements).

In addition, Regions’ bank subsidiaries have
the requisite agreements in place to issue and sell up to
$5 billion of bank notes to institutional investors through
placement agents. As of December 31, 2004, approximately
$1 billion of bank notes were outstanding, including
$400 million of bank notes issued by Regions Bank under the
agreement referenced above. Additionally, approximately
$600 million of bank notes issued by UPBNA, which were
assumed by Regions in connection with the Union Planters
transaction, are also outstanding. The issuance of additional
bank notes could provide a significant source of liquidity and
funding to meet future needs.

Morgan Keegan maintains certain lines of credit
with unaffiliated banks to manage liquidity in the ordinary
course of business.



Ratings

The table below reflects the most recent debt
ratings of Regions Financial Corporation, Regions Bank and UPBNA
by Standard & Poor’s Corporation, Moody’s
Investors Service and Fitch IBCA:

In connection with the merger of Union Planters
with Regions, UPBNA’s ratings were upgraded to match those
of Regions Bank. Regions and Regions Bank’s ratings remain
unchanged from the prior year.

A security rating is not a recommendation to buy,
sell or hold securities, and the ratings above are subject to
revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating
agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any
other rating.

The trust that issued the trust preferred
securities was deconsolidated on December 31, 2003, in
connection with the implementation of Financial Accounting
Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46). Upon
deconsolidation, the junior subordinated notes that are owned by
the trust were included in consolidated long-term borrowings.
Payments made by the Company on the junior subordinated notes
fully fund the payments made by the trust on the rated trust
preferred securities. See Note 19 “Variable Interest
Entities” for additional discussion on the deconsolidation
of the trust.

Deposits

Deposits are Regions’ primary source of
funds, providing funding for 76% of average earning assets in
2004, 73% in 2003 and 74% in 2002. During the last five years,
average total deposits increased at a compound annual rate of
9%. Deposit growth was significantly impacted by the merger with
Union Planters. The Union Planters transaction added
$22.9 billion of total deposits ($11.5 billion of
average deposits due to the mid-year closing of the transaction).

Total deposits added in connection with the Union
Planters merger are summarized in the following table.

Average deposits increased $12.9 billion, or
40% in 2004, $755 million, or 2% in 2003 and
$318 million, or 1% in 2002. Acquisitions contributed
average deposit growth of $11.5 billion in 2004,
$14 million in 2003 and



$176 million in 2002. The $11.5 billion
of deposits, added through acquisitions in 2004, are comprised
of $2.7 billion of non-interest-bearing deposits and
$8.8 billion of interest-bearing deposits and significantly
impact comparisons with prior periods discussed in the remainder
of this section.

Regions competes with other banking and financial
services companies for a share of the deposit market.
Regions’ ability to compete in the deposit market depends
heavily on how effectively the Company meets customers’
needs. Regions employs both traditional and non-traditional
means to meet customers’ needs and enhance competitiveness.
The traditional means include providing well-designed products,
providing a high level of customer service, providing attractive
pricing and expanding the traditional branch network to provide
convenient branch locations for customers throughout
Regions’ geographic footprint. Regions also employs
non-traditional approaches to enhance its competitiveness. These
include providing centralized, high quality telephone banking
services and alternative product delivery channels like internet
banking. Regions’ success at competing for deposits is
discussed below.

Average non-interest-bearing deposits have
increased at a compound growth rate of 23% since 2001. This
category of deposits grew 61% in 2004, 9% in 2003 and 6% in
2002. Non-interest-bearing deposits continue to be a significant
funding source for Regions, accounting for 19% of average total
deposits in 2004, 17% in 2003 and 16% in 2002.

Savings account balances have increased at a 20%
compound growth rate since 2001. Savings accounts increased 53%
in 2004, due to the Union Planters acquisition, but declined
slightly in 2003 as rates paid on these accounts were less
attractive than other investment alternatives. In 2002, as
investors migrated to traditional, more liquid investments,
savings accounts increased 13%. Management expects savings
accounts to continue to be a stable-funding source, but does not
expect any significant growth given the current interest rate
expectations. In 2004, savings accounts accounted for
approximately 5% of average total deposits, compared to
approximately 4% of average total deposits in 2003.

Interest-bearing transaction accounts have
increased at a 74% compound growth rate since 2001.
Interest-bearing transaction accounts increased 31% in 2004,
134% in 2003 and 72% in 2002 as investors migrated toward more
liquid assets given recent market conditions. Interest-bearing
transaction accounts accounted for 7% of average total deposits
in 2004 and 2003.

Money market savings accounts have increased at a
compound annual rate of 16% since 2001. Money market savings
accounts increased 42% in 2004 due to acquisitions. In 2003, as
Regions less aggressively priced money market savings products,
average balances declined 2%. Money market savings increased 13%
in 2002. Money market savings products are one of Regions’
most significant funding sources, accounting for 34% of average
total deposits in 2004, 33% of average total deposits in 2003
and 34% of average total deposits in 2002.

Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more
increased 53% in 2004 due to acquisitions and increased 2% in
2003 due to less maturities of high cost certificates of
deposits than in prior years. Certificates of deposit of
$100,000 or more declined 22% in 2002 as these products were
priced less aggressively. Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or
more accounted for 11% of average total deposits in 2004 and 10%
in 2003 and 2002.

Other interest-bearing deposits (certificates of
deposit of less than $100,000 and time open accounts) increased
22% in 2004 due to acquisitions and internal growth in retail
certificates of deposits due to more attractive market interest
rates. In 2003 and 2002, this category of deposits declined 8%
as rates on these accounts were less attractive to investors and
Regions’ reduced utilization of certain wholesale deposits
as a funding source. This category of deposits continues to be
one of Regions’ primary funding sources; it accounted for
25% of average total deposits in 2004, 29% of average total
deposits in 2003 and 32% of average total deposits in 2002.

During recent years, management has increased
lower-cost deposit products as a source of funding, while
reducing the company’s reliance on higher-cost deposit
products such as certificates of deposit and wholesale deposit
products. This effort has been accomplished through pricing and
other initiatives which have increased lower-cost deposit
products and reduced higher-cost, single product certificates of
deposit as a percentage of Regions’ deposit funding
sources. Lower-cost deposits, which include non-interest bearing
demand deposits,



interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings
accounts and money market savings accounts, totaled 65% of
average deposits in 2004, compared to 61% in 2003 and 58% in
2002.

The sensitivity of Regions’ deposit rates to
changes in market interest rates is reflected in Regions’
average interest rate paid on interest-bearing deposits. Since
2001, market interest rates declined 50 basis points in
2002 and 25 basis points in 2003, but increased
125 basis points in the latter half of 2004. While
Regions’ average interest rate paid on interest-bearing
deposits follows these trends, a lag period exists between the
change in market rates and the repricing of the deposits. The
rate paid on interest-bearing deposits decreased from 2.47% in
2002 and 1.61% in 2003 to 1.37% in 2004.

A detail of interest-bearing deposit balances at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the interest expense on
these deposits for the three years ended December 31, 2004,
is presented in Note 9 “Deposits” to the
consolidated financial statements. The following table presents
the average rates paid on deposits by category for the three
years ended December 31, 2004:

The following table presents the details of
interest-bearing deposits and maturities of the larger time
deposits at December 31, 2004 and 2003:

The following table presents the average amounts
of deposits outstanding by category for the three years ended
December 31, 2004:



Borrowed Funds

Regions’ short-term borrowings consist of
federal funds purchased and security repurchase agreements,
commercial paper, Federal Home Loan Bank structured notes,
due to brokerage customers, and other short-term borrowings.

Federal funds purchased and security repurchase
agreements are used to satisfy daily funding needs and, when
advantageous, for rate arbitrage. Federal funds purchased and
security repurchase agreements totaled $4.7 billion at
December 31, 2004 and $3.0 billion at
December 31, 2003. Balances in these accounts can fluctuate
significantly on a day-to-day basis. The average daily balance
of federal funds purchased and security repurchase agreements,
net of federal funds sold and security reverse repurchase
agreements, increased $1.3 billion in 2004 and 2003 due to
increased reliance on purchased funds to support earning asset
growth.

Throughout 2004 and 2003, Federal Home
Loan Bank structured notes were used as a short-term
funding source, primarily due to their favorable interest rates.
These structured notes have original stated maturities in excess
of one year, but are callable, at the option of the Federal Home
Loan Bank, at various times less than one year. Because of
the call feature, the structured notes are considered
short-term. The amount of structured notes outstanding was
$350 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and
$850 million at December 31, 2002. During 2003,
Regions prepaid $350 million of these advances in addition
to maturities of $150 million. Regions incurred a
$11.5 million charge related to the prepayment in 2003 that
is recorded in other non-interest expense (see Note 16
“Other Income and Expense” to the consolidated
financial statements).

Morgan Keegan maintains certain lines of credit
with unaffiliated banks. As of December 31, 2004,
$56.4 million was outstanding under these agreements with
an average interest rate of 2.6%, compared to $91.2 million
outstanding at December 31, 2003, with an average interest
rate of 1.4%.

From time to time, Regions issues commercial
paper through its private placement commercial paper program. No
commercial paper balances were outstanding as of
December 31, 2004. Regions policy limits total commercial
paper outstanding, at any time, to $75 million. The level
of commercial paper outstanding depends on the funding
requirements of Regions and the cost of commercial paper
compared to alternative borrowing sources. As of
December 31, 2003, $5.5 million in commercial paper
was outstanding, which matured during 2004.

Regions maintains a due to brokerage customer
position through Morgan Keegan. This represents liquid funds in
customers’ brokerage accounts. The due to brokerage
customers totaled $457.7 million at December 31, 2004,
with an interest rate of 0.7%, as compared to
$544.8 million at December 31, 2003, with an interest
rate of 0.4%.

Regions holds cash as collateral for certain
derivative and other transactions with customers and other third
parties. Upon the expiration of these agreements, cash held as
collateral will be remitted to the counter-party. As of
December 31, 2004, these balances totaled
$75.8 million with an interest rate of 2.0%, as compared to
$68.3 million at December 31, 2003 with an interest
rate of 0.9%.

Other short-term borrowings increased
$40.3 million from December 31, 2003, to
December 31, 2004, due primarily to an increase in the
short-sale liability, which is frequently used by Morgan Keegan
to offset other market risks, which are undertaken in the normal
course of business.

Regions’ long-term borrowings consist
primarily of subordinated notes, Federal Home Loan Bank
borrowings, senior notes and other long-term notes payable.

As of December 31, 2004, Regions had
subordinated notes of $2.2 billion compared to
$1.2 billion at December 31, 2003. The merger with
Union Planters added $1.0 billion in subordinated notes.
Regions subordinated notes consist of six issues with interest
rates ranging from 6.375% to 7.75%. A schedule of maturities is
included in the table at the end of this section.

During 2004 and 2003, Regions utilized Federal
Home Loan Bank structured notes with original call periods
in excess of one year. These structured notes have various
stated maturities but are callable, at the option of the Federal
Home Loan Bank, between one and two years. As of
December 31, 2004 and 2003,



$1.8 billion and $2.8 billion of
long-term Federal Home Loan Bank advances were outstanding,
respectively. In 2004, Regions prepaid $1.1 billion of
these advances and as a result incurred a $39.6 million
charge which is recorded in other non-interest expense. In 2003,
Regions prepaid $300 million of these advances and incurred
a $9.1 million charge (see Note 16 “Other Income
and Expense” to the consolidated financial statements).

Federal Home Loan Bank long-term advances
totaled $946 million at December 31, 2004, an increase
of $139 million compared to 2003. Regions utilized this
source of funding due to favorable interest rates and terms
during 2004 and 2003. Membership in the Federal Home
Loan Bank system provides access to an additional source of
lower-cost funds.

Regions issued $288 million of trust
preferred securities in February 2001. These securities, which
qualify as Tier 1 capital, have an interest rate of 8.00%
and a 30-year term, but are callable after five years. In
addition, Regions assumed $4 million of trust preferred
securities in connection with a 2001 acquisition. Effective
December 31, 2003, all trust preferred securities were
deconsolidated in accordance with FIN 46 (see Note 19
“Variable Interest Entities” and Note 25
“Recent Accounting Pronouncements” to the consolidated
financial statements).

As a result of the deconsolidation of trust
preferred securities, effective December 31, 2003, Regions
began reporting $301 million of junior subordinated notes.
These junior subordinated notes are issued by Regions to a
subsidiary business trust, which issued the trust preferred
securities discussed previously (see Note 19 “Variable
Interest Entities” to the consolidated financial
statements). In 2004, $224 million of junior subordinated
notes were assumed in connection with the Union Planters
transaction.

Senior debt and bank notes totaled
$1.5 billion at December 31, 2004, an increase of
$1.1 billion related to notes assumed in the Union Planters
transaction.

Other long-term borrowings consist of redeemable
trust preferred securities, notes issued to former stockholders
of acquired banks, notes for equipment financing, mark-to-market
adjustments related to hedged debt items, and miscellaneous
notes payable.

The following table shows the amount and maturity
of Regions’ long term borrowed funds as of
December 31, 2004.



Stockholders’ Equity

Over the past three years, stockholders’
equity has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 39%.
Stockholders’ equity has grown from $4.0 billion at
the beginning of 2002 to $10.7 billion at year-end 2004.
Equity issued in connection with acquisitions, net of treasury
share repurchases, added $5.4 billion, including
$6.0 billion in equity issued in connection with the Union
Planters merger. Internally generated retained earnings
contributed $1.1 billion of this growth and
$218 million was attributable to the exercise of stock
options and to the issuance of stock for employee incentive
plans. The internal capital generation rate (net income less
dividends as a percentage of average stockholders’ equity)
was 4.3% in 2004, compared to 8.7% in 2003 and 8.9% in 2002.
This ratio declined in 2004 primarily due to a significant
increase in cash dividends in 2004.

Regions has a current board of directors
authorization to repurchase up to 20.0 million shares of
common stock. During 2004, Regions repurchased, under the
current and previous repurchase authorizations, 6.0 million
shares at a total cost of $186.3 million. At
December 31, 2004, 19.2 million shares were available
for repurchase under the current authorization.

Regions’ ratio of stockholders’ equity
to total assets was 12.78% at December 31, 2004, compared
to 9.16% at December 31, 2003, and 8.72% at
December 31, 2002. This ratio increased in 2004 due to the
equity added from the Union Planters merger. Regions’ ratio
of tangible stockholders’ equity (stockholders’ equity
less excess purchase price and other identifiable intangibles)
to total assets was 6.42% at December 31, 2004 compared to
6.92% at December 31, 2003 and 6.49% at December 31,
2002.

Regions attempts to balance the return to
stockholders through the payment of dividends, with the need to
maintain strong capital levels for future growth opportunities.
In 2004, Regions returned 61% of earnings to its stockholders in
the form of dividends. Total dividends declared by Regions in
2004 were $489.8 million or $1.33 per share, an
increase of 33% from the $1.00 per share in 2003.

In January 2005, the Board of Directors declared
a 2.0% increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $.3334 to
$.34 per share. This is the 34th consecutive year that
Regions has increased quarterly cash dividends.

Bank Regulatory Capital Requirements

Regions, Regions Bank and UPBNA are required to
comply with capital adequacy standards established by banking
regulatory agencies. Currently, there are two basic measures of
capital adequacy: a risk-based measure and a leverage measure.

The risk-based capital standards are designed to
make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to
differences in risk profiles among banks and financial holding
companies, to account for off-balance sheet exposure and
interest rate risk, and to minimize disincentives for holding
liquid assets. Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned
to broad risk categories, each with specified risk-weighting
factors. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a
percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet
items. Banking organizations that are considered to have
excessive interest rate risk exposure are required to maintain
additional capital.

The minimum standard for the ratio of total
capital to risk-weighted assets is 8%. At least 50% of that
capital level must consist of common equity, undivided profits
and non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, less goodwill and
certain other intangibles (“Tier 1 capital”). The
remainder (“Tier 2 capital”) may consist of a
limited amount of other preferred stock, mandatory convertible
securities, subordinated debt and a limited amount of the
allowance for loan losses. The sum of Tier 1 capital and
Tier 2 capital is “total risk-based capital.”



The banking regulatory agencies also have adopted
regulations that supplement the risk-based guidelines to include
a minimum ratio of 3% of Tier 1 capital to average assets
less goodwill (the “leverage ratio”). Depending upon
the risk profile of the institution and other factors, the
regulatory agencies may require a leverage ratio of 1% to 2%
above the minimum 3% level.

The following chart summarizes the applicable
bank regulatory capital requirements. Regions’ capital
ratios at December 31, 2004, substantially exceeded all
regulatory requirements.

At December 31, 2004, Tier 1 capital
totaled $5.9 billion, total risk-based capital totaled
$8.8 billion, and risk-adjusted assets totaled
$78.8 billion.

Total capital at Regions Bank and UPBNA also has
an important effect on the amount of FDIC insurance premiums
paid. Institutions not considered well capitalized can be
subject to higher rates for FDIC insurance. As of
December 31, 2004, Regions Bank and UPBNA had the requisite
capital levels to qualify as well capitalized.



Consolidated Average Balances

The following table shows the percentage
distribution of Regions’ consolidated average balances of
assets, liabilities and stockholders’ equity as of the
dates shown:

Please refer to Item 6 of this annual report
on Form 10-K for a complete presentation of average
balances, related interest, yields and rates paid.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual
Obligations

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In the normal course of business, Regions enters
into certain relationships characterized as off-balance sheet
arrangements. At December 31, 2004, these relationships
included obligations under standby letters of credit and
variable interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities.
At December 31, 2004, the fair value of Regions’
obligation under loan standby letters of credit was
$35.7 million with a maximum potential obligation of
$2.4 billion (see Note 13 “Commitments and
Contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements).
At December 31, 2004, Regions’ investment in
unconsolidated variable interest entities was
$265.9 million with a maximum exposure to loss of
$287.9 million (see Note 19 “Variable Interest
Entities” to the consolidated financial statements).

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes Regions’
contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2004:

A discussion regarding liquidity related to
long-term borrowings is included in the “Liquidity”
section presented earlier. Regions intends to fund the other
contractual obligations presented in the table above primarily
through cash generated from normal operations.



Operating Results

General

Net income available to common shareholders
increased 25% in 2004, 5% in 2003, and 22% in 2002. The
accompanying table presents the dollar amount and percentage
change in the important components of income that occurred in
2003 and 2004.

Summary Of Changes In Operating
Results

Net Interest Income

Net interest income (interest income less
interest expense) is Regions’ principal source of income.
Net interest income increased 43% in 2004, but decreased 2% in
2003. On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest income
increased 42% in 2004, but decreased 2% in 2003. The following
table “Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income”
provides additional information to analyze the changes in net
interest income.

Higher spreads, combined with significant growth
in interest-earning assets due to the Union Planters merger,
resulted in higher net interest income in 2004. The decrease in
net interest income for 2003 was due to lower spreads, partially
offset by modest growth in interest-earning assets.

Regions measures its ability to produce net
interest income with a ratio called the interest margin. The
interest margin is net interest income (on a taxable equivalent
basis) as a percentage of average earning assets. The interest
margin declined from 3.73% in 2002 to 3.49% in 2003, but
increased to 3.66% in 2004. Changes in the interest margin occur
primarily due to two factors: (1) the interest rate spread
(the difference between the taxable equivalent yield on earning
assets and the rate on interest-bearing liabilities) and
(2) the percentage of earning assets funded by
interest-bearing liabilities.



The first factor affecting Regions’ interest
margin is the interest rate spread. Regions’ average
interest rate spread was 3.35% in 2004, 3.19% in 2003 and 3.30%
in 2002. Market interest rates, both the level of rates and the
slope of the yield curve (the spread between short-term rates
and longer-term rates), affect the interest rate spread by
influencing the pricing on most categories of Regions’
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

After reducing the Federal Funds rate
significantly in 2001, the Fed reduced the Federal Funds rate
another 50 basis points in 2002. Rates were reduced again in
mid-2003 by 25 basis points. As the economy experienced
growth, the Fed increased the Federal Funds rate five times
totaling 125 basis points in the second half of 2004. These
increases resulted in a Federal Funds rate of 2.25% at
December 31, 2004.

Regions’ interest-earning asset yields and
interest-bearing liability rates were both lower in 2004 as
compared to 2003, reflecting lower average market interest rates
in 2004. In 2004, Regions’ interest-earning asset yields
decreased 10 basis points while interest-bearing liability
rates declined 26 basis points, resulting in an increased
interest rate spread, compared to 2003.

The mix of earning assets can also affect the
interest rate spread. During 2004, loans, which are typically
Regions’ most significant highest yielding earning asset,
increased as a percentage of earning assets. This increase
contributed to higher earning asset yields. Reduced balance
sheet leverage contributed to the shift in asset mix as certain
maturities of the securities portfolio were not reinvested but
were used to reduce borrowings. Average loans as a percentage of
earning assets were 74.9% in 2004 and 71.1% in 2003.

During 2004 and 2003, Regions used interest rate
derivatives as cash flow and fair value hedges of certain asset
and liability positions. These contracts had the effect of
increasing net interest income by $106.8 million in 2004
and $108.7 million in 2003.

The second factor affecting the interest margin
is the percentage of earning assets funded by interest-bearing
liabilities. Funding for Regions’ earning assets comes from
interest-bearing liabilities, non-interest-bearing liabilities
and stockholders’ equity. The net spread on earning assets
funded by non-interest-bearing liabilities and
stockholders’ equity is higher than the net spread on
earning assets funded by interest-bearing liabilities. The
percentage of earning assets funded by interest-bearing
liabilities was 82% in 2004 and 85% in 2003 and 2002. This
decline positively impacted the net interest margin as compared
to prior years. The trend has been for a greater percentage of
new funding for earning assets to come from interest-bearing
sources. In the future, management expects that an increasing
percentage of funding will be provided from interest-bearing
liabilities.



Analysis of Changes in Net Interest
Income

Note:

The change in interest due to both rate and
    volume has been allocated to change due to volume and change due
    to rate in proportion to the absolute dollar amounts of the
    change in each.

Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from
adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due
to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices,
equity prices, or the credit quality of debt securities.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

Regions’ primary market risk is interest
rate risk, including uncertainty with respect to absolute
interest rate levels as well as uncertainty with respect to
relative interest rate levels which impact both the shape and
the slope of the various yield curves affecting the financial
products and services that the Company offers. To quantify this
risk Regions measures the change in its net interest income in
various interest rate scenarios as compared to a base case
scenario. Net interest income sensitivity (as measured over
12 months) is a useful short-term indicator of
Regions’ interest rate risk.

Sensitivity
Measurement.

Financial simulation
models are Regions’ primary tools used to measure interest
rate exposure. Using a wide range of hypothetical deterministic
and stochastic simulations, these tools provide management with
extensive information on the potential impact to net interest
income caused by changes in interest rates.

These models are structured to simulate cash
flows and accrual characteristics of Regions’ balance
sheet. Assumptions are made about the direction and volatility
of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, and the
changing composition of the balance sheet that result from both
strategic plans and from customer behavior. Among the
assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and
composition, the pricing and maturity characteristics of
existing business and the characteristics of future business.
Interest rate related risks are expressly considered, such as
pricing spreads, the lag time in pricing administered rate
accounts, prepayments and other option risks. Regions considers
these factors, as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty
surrounding their future behavior.



Financial derivative instruments are used in
hedging the values of selected assets and liabilities against
changes in interest rates. The effect of these hedges is
included in the simulations of net interest income.

The primary objectives of Asset/ Liability
Management at Regions are balance sheet coordination and the
management of interest rate risk in achieving reasonable and
stable net interest income throughout various interest rate
cycles. A standard set of alternate interest rate scenarios is
compared to the results of the base case scenario to determine
the extent of potential fluctuations and to establish exposure
limits. The standard set of interest rate scenarios includes the
traditional instantaneous parallel rate shifts of plus and minus
100 and 200 basis points. In addition, Regions includes
simulations of gradual interest rate movements that may more
realistically mimic potential interest rate movements. The
gradual scenarios include curve steepening, flattening, and
parallel movements of various magnitudes phased in over a
6 month period.

Exposure to Interest Rate
Movements.

Based on the foregoing
discussion, management has estimated the potential effect of
shifts in interest rates on net interest income. As of
December 31, 2004, Regions maintains a slight asset
sensitive position to a gradual rate shift of plus or minus 100
or 200 basis points. The following table demonstrates the
expected effect that a gradual (over six months beginning at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively) parallel interest
rate shift would have on Regions’ net interest income.

As of December 31, 2004, Regions maintains a
slight asset sensitive position to an instantaneous rate shift
of plus or minus 100 or 200 basis points. The following
table demonstrates the expected effect that an instantaneous
parallel interest rate shift would have on Regions’ net
interest income.

Derivatives

Regions uses financial derivative instruments for
management of interest rate sensitivity. The Asset and Liability
Committee in its oversight role for the management of interest
rate sensitivity approves the use of derivatives in balance
sheet hedging strategies. The most common derivatives the
Company employs are interest rate swaps, interest rate options,
forward sale commitments, and interest rate and foreign exchange
forward contracts.

Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements
typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable streams of
interest payments. The notional principal is not exchanged but
is used as a reference for the size of the interest payments.
Interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to
purchase or sell a financial instrument at a pre-determined
price and time. Forward sale commitments are contractual
obligations to sell



money market instruments at a future date for an
already agreed upon price. Foreign exchange forwards are
contractual agreements to receive or deliver a foreign currency
at an agreed upon future date and price.

Regions has made use of interest rate swaps and
interest rate options to convert a portion of its fixed-rate
funding position to a variable rate. Regions also uses
derivatives to manage interest rate and pricing risk associated
with its mortgage origination business. Futures contracts and
forward sales commitments are used to protect the value of the
loan pipeline from changes in interest rates. In the period of
time that elapses between the origination and sale of mortgage
loans, changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a
decline in the value of the loans in this held-for-sale
portfolio. Futures and forward sale commitment positions are
used to protect the Company from the risk of such adverse
changes. The change in value of the hedging contracts is
expected to be highly effective in offsetting the change in
value of specific assets and liabilities over the life of the
hedge relationship.

Regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs
of its customers. Interest rate swaps, interest rate options and
foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold
to customers. Positions with similar characteristics are used to
offset the market risk and minimize income statement volatility
associated with this portfolio. Those instruments used to
service customers are entered into the trading account with
changes in value recorded in the income statement. Refer to
Note 14 “Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging
Activities” of the consolidated financial statements for a
tabular summary of Regions’ year-end derivatives positions
in the trading portfolio.

Brokerage and Market Making Activity

Morgan Keegan’s business activities expose
it to market risk, including its securities inventory positions
and securities held for investment.

Morgan Keegan trades for its own account in
corporate and tax-exempt securities and U.S. government,
agency and guaranteed securities. Most of these transactions are
entered into to facilitate the execution of customers’
orders to buy or sell these securities. In addition, it trades
certain equity securities in order to “make a market”
in these securities. Morgan Keegan’s trading activities
require the commitment of capital. All principal transactions
place the subsidiary’s capital at risk. Profits and losses
are dependent upon the skills of employees and market
fluctuations. In some cases, in order to economically hedge the
risks of carrying inventory, Morgan Keegan enters into a low
level of activity involving U.S. Treasury note futures.

Morgan Keegan, as part of its normal brokerage
activities, assumes short positions on securities. The
establishment of short positions exposes Morgan Keegan to
off-balance sheet risk in the event that prices increase, as it
may be obligated to cover such positions at a loss. Morgan
Keegan manages its exposure to these instruments by entering
into offsetting or other positions in a variety of financial
instruments.

Morgan Keegan will occasionally economically
hedge a portion of its long proprietary inventory position
through the use of short positions in financial future
contracts, which are included in securities sold, not yet
purchased at market value. At December 31, 2004, Morgan
Keegan had no outstanding futures contracts.

In the normal course of business, Morgan Keegan
enters into underwriting and forward and future commitments. At
December 31, 2004, the contract amounts of futures
contracts were $22 million to purchase and
$228 million to sell U.S. Government and municipal
securities. Morgan Keegan typically settles its position by
entering into equal but opposite contracts and, as such, the
contract amounts do not necessarily represent future cash
requirements. Settlement of the transactions relating to such
commitments are not expected to have a material effect on
Regions’ consolidated financial position. Transactions
involving future settlement give rise to market risk, which
represents the potential loss that can be caused by a change in
the market value of a particular financial instrument.
Regions’ exposure to market risk is determined by a number
of factors, including the size, composition and diversification
of positions held, the absolute and relative levels of interest
rates, and market volatility.



Interest rate risk at Morgan Keegan arises from
the exposure of holding interest-sensitive financial instruments
such as government, corporate and municipal bonds and certain
preferred equities. Morgan Keegan manages its exposure to
interest rate risk by setting and monitoring limits and, where
feasible, entering into offsetting positions in securities with
similar interest rate risk characteristics. Securities
inventories are marked to market, and accordingly there are no
unrecorded gains or losses in value. While a significant portion
of the securities inventories have contractual maturities in
excess of five years, these inventories, on average, turn over
in excess of twelve times per year. Accordingly, the exposure to
interest rate risk inherent in Morgan Keegan’s securities
inventories is less than that of similar financial instruments
held by firms in other industries. Morgan Keegan’s equity
securities inventories are exposed to risk of loss in the event
of unfavorable price movements. The equity securities
inventories are marked to market and there are no unrecorded
gains or losses.

Morgan Keegan is also subject to credit risk
arising from non-performance by trading counterparties,
customers, and issuers of debt securities owned. This risk is
managed by imposing and monitoring position limits, monitoring
trading counterparties, reviewing security concentrations,
holding and marking to market collateral and conducting business
through clearing organizations that guarantee performance.
Morgan Keegan regularly participates in the trading of some
derivative securities for its customers; however, this activity
does not involve Morgan Keegan acquiring a position or
commitment in these products and this trading is not a
significant portion of Morgan Keegan’s business.

To manage trading risks arising from interest
rate and equity price risks, Regions uses a Value at Risk
(“VAR”) model to measure the potential fair value the
Company could lose on its trading positions given a specified
statistical confidence level and time-to-liquidate time horizon.
Regions assesses market risk at a 99% confidence level over a
one-day holding period. Regions’ primary VAR model is based
upon a variance-covariance approach with delta-gamma
approximations for non-linear securities. For fixed income
securities and equities, the Bloomberg Trading System VAR
analytics are used. For interest rate derivatives the Company
implements its VAR analysis through the OpenLink trading system.

The end-of-period VAR was approximately $407,000
as of December 31, 2004, and approximately $903,000 as of
December 31, 2003. Maximum daily VAR utilization during
2004 was $1.5 million and average daily VAR during the same
period was $605,000.

Provision For Loan Losses

The provision for loan losses is used to fund the
allowance for loan losses. Actual loan losses, net of
recoveries, are charged directly to the allowance. The expense
recorded each year is a reflection of management’s judgment
as to the adequacy of the allowance. For an analysis and
discussion of the allowance for loan losses, refer to the
section entitled “Financial Condition — Loans and
Allowance for Loan Losses.” The provision for loan losses
totaled $127.5 million (.41% of average loans), in 2002, a
$37.9 million decrease compared to the prior year. The
lower provision was due to lower loan losses in 2002 and
management’s assessment of current economic conditions. The
2003 provision for loan losses was decreased to
$121.5 million (.39% of average loans) due to lower loan
losses, lower levels of nonperforming loans and
management’s evaluation of current economic factors. During
2004, the provision for loan losses increased to
$128.5 million (.29% of average loans) due to higher loan
losses and management’s evaluation of current economic
factors. The resulting year-end allowance for loan losses
increased $300.7 million ($303.1 million added in
connection with the Union Planters transaction) to
$754.7 million.



Non-Interest Income

Brokerage and Investment Banking

Brokerage and investment income decreased 3% and
totaled $535.3 million in 2004, compared to
$552.7 million in 2003 and $499.7 million in 2002.
Brokerage and investment income is significantly affected by
economic and market conditions. The slight decline in brokerage
and investment income in 2004 resulted from the slow down in the
record levels of fixed income production in prior years not
being completely offset by improved private client, equity
capital markets and investment advisory fees in 2004. As of
December 31, 2004, Morgan Keegan employed approximately
1,000 financial advisors. Customer assets, under management,
totaled approximately $48.5 billion at year-end 2004,
compared to approximately $40.4 billion at year-end 2003.

The addition of Morgan Keegan in 2001
significantly diversified Regions’ revenue stream.
Non-interest income, net of security gains, as a percent of
total revenue equaled 42% in 2004, compared to 46% in 2003 and
43% in 2002. Morgan Keegan contributed $83.6 million to net
income in 2004. Revenues from the private client division
totaled $228.7 million, or 31% of Morgan Keegan’s
total revenue in 2004, and was the top revenue producing line of
business. This line of business benefited from improved equity
markets and two closed end fund offerings in 2004. Fixed income
capital markets and equity capital markets revenue totaled
$188.0 million and $70.0 million, respectively. The
investment advisory services division produced
$92.8 million of revenue in 2004. Revenues generated by
each division are included in various line items in the table
below. In addition, beginning in 2003, Regions Morgan Keegan
Trust division, which produced revenue of $87.0 million in
2004, is included with Morgan Keegan. Although Regions Morgan
Keegan trust division is included with Morgan Keegan, all trust
income is reported as a separate item in the consolidated
statements of income (see next section titled “Trust
Income” for discussion of changes in trust income). Prior
period 2002 information has been adjusted as well for
comparative purposes.

The following table shows the components of the
contribution by Morgan Keegan for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.



The following table shows the breakout of revenue
by division contributed by Morgan Keegan for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Morgan Keegan Breakout of Revenue by
Division

Trust Income

Trust income increased 47% in 2004, 12% in 2003
and 10% in 2002. The increase in 2004 was driven by the addition
of trust accounts from Union Planters. In addition, trust fees
are also affected by the securities markets, as many trust fees
are calculated as a percentage of trust asset values. In 2004,
2003 and 2002, better performance in the financial markets and
increases in trust assets contributed to higher trust fees.

Service Charges on Deposit Accounts

Service charge income increased 45% in 2004 and
4% in 2003 and 2002. The addition of new accounts added in
connection with the Union Planters transaction resulted in the
significant increase in 2004. Increases in the number of deposit
accounts, management initiatives and standardization in the
pricing of certain deposit accounts and related services were
the primary drivers of increases in 2003 and 2002.

Mortgage Servicing and Origination
    Fees

The primary source of this category of income is
Regions’ mortgage banking divisions, Regions Mortgage and
EquiFirst. In 2004, Regions Mortgage was combined with the Union
Planters mortgage division. Regions Mortgage’s primary
business and source of income is the origination and servicing
of mortgage loans for long-term investors. EquiFirst typically
originates mortgage loans which are sold to third-party
investors with servicing released. Net gains or losses related
to the sale of mortgage loans are included in other non-interest
income.

In 2004, mortgage servicing and origination fees
increased 32%, from $97.4 million in 2003 to
$128.8 million in 2004. Origination and servicing fees
increased in 2004 due to volume and servicing assets added from
the Union Planters mortgage division. At December 31, 2004,
Regions’ servicing portfolio totaled $39.4 billion and
included approximately 445,000 loans. At December 31, 2003
and 2002, the servicing portfolio totaled $16.1 billion and
$17.3 billion, respectively. The increase in the servicing
portfolio in 2004 resulted from the addition of the Union
Planters mortgage division, partially offset by certain
divestitures of out-of-footprint mortgage servicing rights as
well as relatively high levels of prepayments. The decline in
the servicing portfolio during 2003 resulted from high levels of
prepayments due to the low interest rate environment driving
record mortgage refinance activity, partially offset by higher
levels of production in 2003.



In 2003, mortgage servicing and origination fees
increased 8%, from $90.0 million in 2002 to
$97.4 million in 2003. Origination fees increased in 2003
due to the significant mortgage activity resulting from the
historically low interest rate environment. Servicing fees were
lower in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to a smaller servicing
portfolio in 2003.

In 2002, mortgage servicing and origination fees
increased 4%, from $86.9 million in 2001. Origination fees
increased in 2002 due to an increase in the number of loans
closed as the result of lower mortgage interest rates. Servicing
fees were lower in 2002 as compared to 2001 due to a smaller
servicing portfolio in 2002.

Regions Mortgage and EquiFirst, through their
retail, correspondent lending, and wholesale operations,
produced mortgage loans totaling $10.8 billion in 2004,
$9.4 billion in 2003 and $6.6 billion in 2002. Regions
Mortgage and EquiFirst produce loans from 246 offices in
Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana,
Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.

A summary of mortgage servicing rights is
presented as follows. The balances shown represent the original
amounts capitalized, less accumulated amortization and valuation
adjustments, for the right to service mortgage loans that are
owned by other investors. The amortization of mortgage servicing
rights is included in other non-interest expense. The carrying
values of mortgage servicing rights are affected by various
factors, including prepayments of the underlying mortgages. A
significant change in prepayments of mortgages in the servicing
portfolio could result in significant changes in the valuation
adjustments.

Securities Gains

Regions reported net gains of $63.1 million
from the sale of available for sale securities in 2004, as
compared to net gains of $25.7 million in 2003 and
$51.7 million in 2002. These gains were primarily related
to the sale of agency and mortgage-related securities, used to
economically hedge MSR and were sold to offset impairment
charges related to mortgage servicing assets.

Other Income

The components of other income consist mainly of
fees and commissions, insurance premiums, customer derivative
fees, factoring fees, employment service fees and gains related
to the sale of mortgage loans.

Fee and commission income increased 44% in 2004
due to increased business activity related to the Union Planters
merger including standby letters of credit, credit card fees,
money orders, cashiers checks and other banking fees. Fees and
commissions increased in 2003 primarily due to higher fees from
standby letters of credit and higher revenue from credit card
fees.

Insurance premium and commission income increased
13% in 2004 and 16% in 2003, due primarily to increased revenues
in the commercial property and casualty business. In 2002,
insurance and commission income increased 49% due primarily to
the acquisition of ICT Group, LLC. This income results primarily
from the sale of property and casualty, liability and workers
compensation insurance to commercial customers as well as credit
life and accident and health insurance to consumer loan
customers.



Regions’ customer derivative division
primarily assists existing commercial customers with capital
market products including interest rate swaps, caps and floors.
Typically, Regions enters into offsetting derivative positions
limiting its exposure related to customer derivative products.
These exposures are marked-to-market on a daily basis. Capital
market income totaled $7.8 million in 2004,
$21.9 million in 2003 and $14.3 million in 2002.
Customer derivative division revenue declined in 2004 due to
lower volumes driven by slower commercial loan growth and a less
favorable interest rate environment for customer derivative
business.

Regions operates a receivables-based factoring
and related fee-based credit, collection and management
information services subsidiary, serving small- and medium-sized
clients. This subsidiary, acquired in connection with the Union
Planters merger, produced fee income of $18.5 million in
2004.

A professional employment service subsidiary was
also added in connection with the Union Planters transaction.
Services provided include insurance and employee benefits
management, safety and risk assessment services, human resource
administration and related compliance services. This subsidiary
generated fee income of $26.1 million in 2004.

In 2004, gains related to the sale of mortgage
loans held for sale totaled $128.8 million
($124.9 million related to EquiFirst and $3.9 million
related to Regions Mortgage). For the years ended
December 31, 2003, and December 31, 2002, gains
totaled $107.0 million and $66.5 million, respectively.

Non-Interest Expense

The main components of non-interest expense are
salaries and employee benefits, net occupancy expense, furniture
and equipment expenses and other non-interest expense. The
following table presents a summary of non-interest expense for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Total non-interest expense increased
$669.5 million, or 37%, in 2004, due primarily to the
expense base added by the merger with Union Planters. In 2003,
total non-interest expense increased 4% due primarily to
increased levels of business activity and new branch offices.
Also impacting comparisons between periods are merger-related
expenses, impairment charges related to mortgage servicing
rights, losses related to prepayment of debt and costs related
to damage caused by the four destructive gulf coast hurricanes
of 2004. The following tables show the impact on the major
components of non-interest expense of merger-related expenses,
impairment charges for mortgage servicing assets, losses for
prepayment of debt and hurricane related costs. Management
believes the following tables are useful in evaluating trends in
non-interest expense.



For further discussion of non-interest expense,
refer to the following discussion of each component of
non-interest expense.

2004 Non-Interest Expense

In 2004, merger-related and disaster charges
totaled $55.1 million, impairment charges on mortgage
servicing rights totaled $22.0 million and losses on
prepayment of higher cost debt ($1.1 billion of Federal
Home Loan Bank advances) totaled $39.6 million.

2003 Non-Interest Expense

In 2003, a net recapture of $1.0 million on
mortgage servicing rights was recorded as a result of changes in
interest rates and a slowdown in prepayment speeds. Also in
2003, Regions chose to pay off $650 million of Federal Home
loan Bank advances early, resulting in a $20.6 million
charge from prepayment of this debt.

2002 Non-Interest Expense

In 2002, impairment charges on mortgage servicing
rights totaled $36.7 million and losses on prepayment of
higher costs debt ($250 million of Federal Home Loan Bank
advances) totaled $5.2 million.



In connection with the integration of Regions and
Union Planters, Regions has and will continue to incur
merger-related expenses throughout the integration process.
Merger-related expenses include costs incurred in connection
with the merger, integration and restructuring activities,
including retention and severance costs, professional fees
incurred with integration activities, contract buyouts, lease
termination penalties, loss on disposals of duplicate facilities
and other direct and incremental costs related to the
transaction. Costs incurred in connection with the merger,
integration and restructuring activities are expected to be
funded from cash flows from operations.

Salaries and Employee Benefits

Total salaries and benefits increased 30% in
2004, 9% in 2003 and 17% in 2002. Excluding $16.3 million
of merger-related charges, salaries and benefits increased 29%
due to the addition of approximately 10,000 Union Planters’
associates. Salaries and benefits were higher in 2003, as
compared to 2002, due primarily to higher incentive costs
associated with Morgan Keegan and mortgage banking. Increased
production and achievement of other goals at Morgan Keegan,
Regions Mortgage and EquiFirst resulted in increased incentive
compensation in 2003. In addition to increased incentive
compensation in 2003, normal merit and promotional adjustments,
and higher benefit costs resulted in increased salaries and
benefits expense in 2003.

At December 31, 2004, Regions had
approximately 26,000 full-time equivalent employees,
compared to approximately 16,000 at December 31, 2003 and
2002. The increase in employees in 2004 resulted primarily from
personnel added with the 2004 Union Planters transaction.

Salaries, excluding benefits, totaled
$830.8 million in 2004, compared to $598.5 million in
2003 and $583.2 million in 2002. Increased salaries in 2004
resulted from higher employment levels, while higher salary
levels in 2003 and 2002 were primarily the result of normal
merit and promotional adjustments.

Regions provides employees who meet established
employment requirements with a benefits package which includes
401(k), pension, profit sharing, and medical, life and
disability insurance plans. The total cost to Regions for fringe
benefits, including payroll taxes, equals approximately 29% of
salaries.

Regions’ 401(k) plan includes a company
match of employee contributions. At December 31, 2004, this
match ranged from 150% to 200% of the employee contribution (up
to 3% of compensation) based on length of service and is
invested in Regions common stock. Regions’ contribution to
the 401(k) plan on behalf of employees totaled
$25.7 million, $16.5 million, and $16.0 million
in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

As part of Regions’ profit sharing plan,
eligible employees can elect to have their profit sharing award
paid in cash or contributed to their 401(k) plan. The
combination of the cash payments and contributions to employee
401(k) plans was equal to approximately 1% of after-tax income
in 2004, and 2% in 2003 and 2002.

Commissions and incentives expense increased to
$381.0 million in 2004, compared to $352.1 million in
2003 and $301.3 million in 2002. The increases in
commissions and incentives were primarily the result of
increased participants in various incentive programs as well as
higher commissions paid at Morgan Keegan and EquiFirst, which
were related to increased production levels and sales goals. At
Morgan Keegan, commissions and incentives are a key component of
compensation, which is typical in the brokerage and investment
banking industry. In general, incentives continue to be used to
reward employees for selling products and services, for
productivity improvements and for achievement of corporate
financial goals. Regions’ long-term incentive plan provides
for the granting of stock options, restricted stock and
performance shares (see Note 20 “Stock Option and
Long-Term Incentive Plans” to the consolidated financial
statements).

Pension expense totaled $22.5 million in
2004, $19.8 million in 2003 and $7.1 million in 2002.
Higher pension costs in 2004 and 2003 are the result of lower
asset returns and discount rate assumptions. Pension expense in
2005 is expected to be approximately $19.6 million.

Payroll taxes increased 37% in 2004, 3% in 2003
and 19% in 2002. Increases in the number of associates combined
with the increase in the Social Security tax base and increased
salary levels were the primary reasons for increased payroll
taxes.



Group insurance expense increased 56% in 2004,
12% in 2003 and 1% in 2002. The increases were the result of
increased levels of covered employees and higher claims cost.
Excluding the impact of the merger with Union Planters, group
insurance expense would have increased 11%.

Net Occupancy Expense

Net occupancy expense includes rents,
depreciation and amortization, utilities, maintenance,
insurance, taxes and other expenses of premises occupied by
Regions and its affiliates. Regions’ affiliates operate
offices primarily in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri,
Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and
Texas.

Net occupancy expense increased 51% in 2004, 8%
in 2003 and 13% in 2002 due to acquisitions, new and acquired
branch offices, rising price levels, and increased business
activity.

Furniture and Equipment Expense

Furniture and equipment expense increased 25% in
2004 due to acquisitions, rising price levels and expenses
related to equipment for new branch offices. Furniture and
equipment expense decreased 10% in 2003 due primarily to lower
expenses related to computer equipment. In 2002, furniture and
equipment expense increased 4%. These increases resulted from
expenses related to equipment for new branch offices, and
increased depreciation and service contract expenses associated
with other new back office and branch equipment.

Other Expenses

The significant components of other expense
include legal and other professional fees, other non-credit
losses, amortization and impairment of mortgage servicing
rights, amortization of identifiable intangibles and computer
and other outside services. Increases in this category of
expense generally resulted from acquisitions, expanded programs,
increased business activity and rising price levels. Other
expenses included $98.6 million in 2004, $19.6 million
in 2003 and $41.9 million in 2002 of costs related to the
merger and other charges, previously discussed. Please refer to
Note 16 “Other Income and Expense” to the
consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the
significant components of other expense.

Legal and other professional fees increased
significantly in 2004 as compared to 2003 and 2002 due to costs
incurred related to the merger and integration with Union
Planters. These costs include fees paid to attorneys,
accountants and other professionals involved in the Union
Planters transaction as well as costs incurred in the ordinary
course of business.

Other non-credit losses primarily include charges
for items unrelated to the extension of credit such as fraud
losses, litigation losses, write-downs of other real estate,
insurance claims and miscellaneous losses. Other non-credit
losses increased in 2004 due to higher losses related to
litigation, fraud and other expenses related to increased
business activity added by the Union Planters merger. Other
non-credit losses decreased in 2003 from levels in 2002. The
2003 decrease was primarily related to lower losses related to
litigation.

Amortization of mortgage servicing rights
increased in 2004 and 2003. Accelerated amortization expense,
due to the low interest rate environment and increased
prepayments of the underlying mortgages, combined with the
addition of servicing rights added by the Union Planters merger,
resulted in additional amortization expense in 2004 and 2003.

Amortization of identifiable intangible assets
increased significantly in 2004. The increase related to
amortization of intangible assets (primarily core deposit
intangibles) recorded in connection with the Union Planters
merger.

In addition, Regions incurred in 2004, a
$39.6 million charge on the early extinguishment of
$1.1 billion of long-term Federal Home Loan Bank advances,
as well as $22.0 million of mortgage servicing rights
impairment.



In the second quarter of 2003 Regions incurred
charges of $19.0 million related to the impairment of
mortgage servicing rights. In the third quarter of 2003,
$20.0 million of impairment recapture on mortgage servicing
rights was recorded as a result of changes in interest rates and
a slowdown in prepayment speeds.

Also in 2003, in connection with the prepayment
of $650 million of Federal Home Loan Bank advances
($350 million classified as short-term and
$300 million classified as long-term), Regions incurred a
$20.6 million loss on early extinguishment of debt.

In 2002, Regions incurred charges totaling
$36.7 million related to the impairment of mortgage
servicing rights due primarily to the historically low interest
rate environment, as well as a $5.2 million charge related
to the prepayment of $250 million of Federal Home
Loan Bank advances.

Applicable Income Tax

Regions’ provision for income taxes
increased 35% in 2004 and 4% in 2003. These increases were
caused primarily by a 29% increase in income before taxes in
2004 and a 5% increase in 2003. Regions’ effective income
tax rates were 29.9% for 2004, 28.5% for 2003 and 28.7% for
2002. The effective tax rate increased in 2004 compared to 2003
primarily due to higher levels of income before taxes resulting
from the merger with Union Planters and an increase in state
taxes, partially offset by a higher level of tax credits
realized.

From time to time Regions engages in business
plans that may also have an effect on its tax liabilities. While
Regions has obtained the opinion of advisors that the tax
aspects of these plans should prevail, examination of
Regions’ income tax returns or changes in tax law may
impact the tax benefits of these plans.

Periodically, Regions invests in pass-through
investment vehicles that generate tax credits, principally
low-income housing and non-conventional fuel source credits,
which directly reduce Regions’ federal income tax
liability. Congress has legislated these tax credit programs to
encourage capital inflows to these investment vehicles. The
amount of tax benefit recognized from these tax credits was
$35.4 million in 2004 and $25.8 million in 2003.

During the fourth quarter of 2000, Regions
recapitalized a mortgage-related subsidiary by raising
Tier 2 capital, which resulted in a reduction in taxable
income of that subsidiary attributable to Regions. The reduction
in the taxable income of this subsidiary attributable to Regions
is expected to result in a lower effective tax rate applicable
to the consolidated taxable income before taxes of Regions for
future periods. The impact on Regions’ effective tax rate
applicable to consolidated income before taxes of the reduction
in the subsidiary’s taxable income attributable to Regions
will, however, depend on a number of factors, including, but not
limited to: the amount of assets in the subsidiary, the yield of
the assets in the subsidiary, the cost of funding the
subsidiary, possible loan losses in the subsidiary, the level of
expenses of the subsidiary, the level of income attributable to
obligations of states and political subdivisions, and various
other factors. The amount of federal and state tax benefits
recognized related to the recapitalized subsidiary was
$42.9 million in 2004 ($33.6 million federal) and
$43.7 million in 2003 ($34.5 million federal).

Regions has segregated a portion of its
investment securities and intellectual property into separate
legal entities in order to, among other business purposes,
protect such intangible assets from inappropriate claims of
Regions’ creditors, and to maximize the return on such
assets by the professional and focused management thereof.
Regions has recognized state tax benefits related to these legal
entities of $17.4 million in 2004 and $13.8 million in
2003.

Regions’ federal and state income tax
returns for the years 1998 through 2003 are open for review and
examination by governmental authorities. In the normal course of
these examinations, Regions is subject to challenges from
governmental authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. Regions
has received notices of proposed adjustments relating to taxes
due for the years 1999 through 2001, which include proposed
adjustments relating to an increase in taxable income of the
mortgage-related subsidiary discussed above. Regions believes
adequate provision for income taxes has been recorded for all
years open for review and intends to vigorously contest the
proposed adjustments. To the extent that final resolution of the
proposed adjustments results in significantly different
conclusions from Regions’ current assessment of the
proposed adjustments, Regions’ effective tax rate in any
given financial reporting period may be materially different
from its current effective tax rate.



Management’s determination of the
realization of the deferred tax asset is based upon
management’s judgment of various future events and
uncertainties, including the timing, nature and amount of future
income earned by certain subsidiaries and the implementation of
various plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset.
Management believes that the subsidiaries will generate
sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax
benefits. However, management does not believe that it is more
likely than not to realize all of its capital loss carryforwards
nor all of its state net operating loss carryforwards.
Accordingly, it has established valuation allowances of
$63.8 million and $7.6 million, respectively, against
such benefits.

Note 17 “Income Taxes” to the
consolidated financial statements provides additional
information about the provision for income taxes.

Effects Of Inflation

The majority of assets and liabilities of a
financial institution are monetary in nature; therefore, a
financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and
industrial companies, which have significant investments in
fixed assets or inventories. However, inflation does have an
important impact on the growth of total assets in the banking
industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at
higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate
equity-to-assets ratio. Inflation also affects other expenses
that tend to rise during periods of general inflation.

Management believes the most significant impact
of inflation on financial results is Regions’ ability to
react to changes in interest rates. As discussed previously,
management is attempting to maintain an essentially balanced
position between rate-sensitive assets and liabilities in order
to protect net interest income from being affected by wide
interest rate fluctuations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of Directors and Shareholders of Regions
Financial Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
statements of financial condition of Regions Financial
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and
2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash
flows, and changes in stockholders’ equity for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Regions Financial Corporation
and subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the effectiveness of Regions Financial
Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our

Note 1.

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

The accounting and reporting policies of Regions
Financial Corporation (“Regions” or “the
Company”), conform with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and with general financial
services industry practices. Regions provides a full range of
banking and bank-related services to individual and corporate
customers through its subsidiaries and branch offices located
primarily in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. The Company is
subject to intense competition from other financial institutions
and is also subject to the regulations of certain government
agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory
authorities.

Basis of Presentation and Principles of
Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Regions and its subsidiaries. Significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. In
preparing the financial statements, management is required to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities as of the statement of condition dates
and revenues and expenses for the periods shown. Actual results
could differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the
consolidated financial statements including, but not limited to,
the estimates and assumptions related to allowance for loan
losses, intangibles and income taxes.

Certain amounts in prior-year financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.

Securities

The Company’s policies for investments in
debt and equity securities are as follows. Management determines
the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at
the time of purchase and periodically re-evaluates such
designations.

Debt securities are classified as securities held
to maturity when the Company has the positive intent and ability
to hold the securities to maturity. Securities held to maturity
are stated at amortized cost.

Debt securities not classified as securities held
to maturity or trading account assets, and marketable equity
securities not classified as trading account assets, are
classified as securities available for sale. Securities
available for sale are stated at estimated fair value, with
unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a
component of other comprehensive income. Declines in fair value
that are deemed other-than-temporary, if any, are reported in
other non-interest expense.

The amortized cost of debt securities classified
as securities held to maturity or securities available for sale
is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts to maturity, or in the case of mortgage-backed
securities, over the estimated life of the security, using the
effective yield method. Such amortization or accretion is
included in interest on securities. Realized gains and losses
are included in securities gains (losses). The cost of the
securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

Trading Account Assets

Trading account assets, which are held for the
purpose of selling at a profit, consist of debt and marketable
equity securities and are carried at estimated market value.
Gains and losses, both realized and unrealized, are included in
brokerage income. Trading account net gains totaled
$9.5 million, $16.0 million and $19.6 million in
2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Loans Held for Sale

Loans held for sale include both single-family
real estate mortgage loans as well as factored accounts
receivable and asset backed loans.

Mortgage loans held for sale have been designated
as one of the hedged items in a fair value hedging relationship
under Statement 133. Therefore, to the extent changes in
fair value are attributable to the interest rate risk being
hedged, the change in fair value is recognized in income as an
adjustment to the carrying amount of mortgage loans held for
sale. Otherwise, mortgage loans held for sale are accounted for
under the lower of aggregate cost or market method. The fair
values are based on quoted market prices of similar instruments,
adjusted for differences in loan characteristics. Gains and
losses on mortgages held for sale are included in other
non-interest income.

Other loans in this category are accounted for
under the lower of cost or market method. Fair values are based
on cash flow models. In 2004, Regions reclassified
$430 million of indirect consumer auto loans to the loan
portfolio, as Regions no longer originates or securitizes these
types of loans.

Securities Purchased Under Agreements to
Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to
Repurchase

Securities purchased under agreements to resell
and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are generally
treated as collateralized financing transactions and are
recorded at market value plus accrued interest. It is
Regions’ policy to take possession of securities purchased
under resell agreements.

Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses

Interest on loans is accrued based upon the
principal amount outstanding.

Through provisions charged directly to operating
expense, Regions has established an allowance for loan losses.
This allowance is reduced by actual loan losses and increased by
subsequent recoveries, if any. It is Regions’ policy that
when a loss is identified, it is charged against the allowance
for loan losses in the current period. The policy regarding
recognition of losses requires immediate recognition of a loss
if significant doubt exists as to principal repayment.

The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a
level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses
in the loan portfolio. Management’s determination of the
adequacy of the allowance is based on an evaluation of the
portfolio, historical loan loss experience, current economic
conditions, collateral values of properties securing loans,
volume, growth, quality and composition of the loan portfolio
and other relevant factors. Unfavorable changes in any of these,
or other factors, or the availability of new information, could
require that the allowance for loan losses be increased in
future periods. No portion of the resulting allowance is
restricted to any individual loan or group of loans. The entire
allowance is available to absorb losses from any and all loans.

Loans are placed on non-accrual status when
collectability is in doubt and the loan is not well secured or
in process of collection. On loans which are on non-accrual
status (including impaired loans), it is Regions’ policy to
reverse interest previously accrued on the loan against interest
income. Interest on such loans is thereafter recorded on a
“cash basis” and is included in earnings only when
actually received in cash and when full payment of principal is
no longer doubtful.

Regions’ determination of its allowance for
loan losses is determined in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 114 (Statement 114)
and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5
(Statement 5). In determining the amount of the allowance
for loan losses, management uses information from its ongoing
loan review process to stratify the loan portfolio into risk
grades. The higher-risk-graded loans in the portfolio are
assigned estimated amounts of loss based on several factors,
including current and historical loss experience of each
higher-risk category, regulatory guidelines for losses in each
higher-risk category and management’s judgment of economic
conditions and the resulting impact on higher-risk-graded



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

loans. All loans deemed to be impaired, which
include non-accrual loans, excluding loans to individuals, with
outstanding balances greater than $1 million, are evaluated
individually. Impaired loans totaled approximately
$94.8 million at December 31, 2004 and
$93.6 million at December 31, 2003. Because the vast
majority of these loans are dependent upon collateral for
repayment, impairment is measured by evaluating collateral value
as compared to the current investment in the loan. For all other
loans, Regions compares the amount of estimated discounted cash
flows to the investment in the loan. In the event a particular
loan’s collateral value or discounted cash flows is not
sufficient to support the collection of the investment in the
loan, the loan is specifically considered in the determination
of the allowance for loan losses or a charge is immediately
taken against the allowance for loan losses. The allowance
related to impaired loans totaled $8.7 million at
December 31, 2004.

In addition to establishing allowance levels for
specifically identified higher-risk-graded loans, management
determines allowance levels for all other loans in the portfolio
for which historical experience indicates that certain losses
exist. These loans are categorized by loan type and assigned
estimated amounts of loss based on several factors, including
current and historical loss experience of each loan type and
management’s judgment of economic conditions and the
resulting impact on each category of loans. The amount of the
allowance related to these loans is combined with the amount of
the allowance related to the higher-risk-graded loans to
evaluate the overall level of the allowance for loan losses.

Asset Securitizations

In 2003 and 2002, Regions used the securitization
of automobile loans as a source of funding. Automobile loans
were transferred into a trust to legally isolate the assets from
Regions Bank, a subsidiary of the Company. In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140
(Statement 140), securitized loans are removed from the
balance sheet and a net gain or loss is recognized in income at
the time of initial sale. Net gains or losses resulting from
securitizations are recorded in other non-interest income.

Retained interests in the subordinated tranches
and interest-only strips are recorded at fair value and included
in the available for sale securities portfolio. Subsequent
adjustments to the fair value are recorded through other
comprehensive income. The Company used assumptions and estimates
in determining the fair value allocated to the retained
interests at the time of sale in accordance with
Statement 140. These assumptions and estimates include
projections concerning rates charged to customers, the expected
life of the receivables, loan losses, prepayment rates, the cost
of funds, and discount rates associated with the risks involved.
Adverse changes related to any of the assumptions used in
determining fair value could result in a reduced yield on the
security over future periods, or, in some cases, a write-down of
the security carrying amount in the period of a decline in value.

Management reviews the historical performance of
the retained interest and the assumptions used to project future
cash flows on a quarterly basis. Upon review, assumptions may be
revised and the present value of future cash flows recalculated.

Margin Receivables

Margin receivables, which represent funds
advanced to brokerage customers for the purchase of securities,
are carried at cost and secured by certain marketable securities
in the customer’s brokerage account.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment and leasehold improvements
are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. The provision for depreciation is computed using
the straight-line and declining-balance methods over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are
amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the improvements (or the terms of the leases if
shorter).

Estimated useful lives generally are as follows:

Premises and leasehold improvements

10-40 years

Furniture and equipment

3-12 years

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets consist of (1) the excess
of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses
(excess purchase price), (2) amounts recorded related to
the value of acquired indeterminate-maturity deposits (core
deposit intangible assets), (3) amounts capitalized for the
right to service mortgage loans, (4) amounts capitalized
related to the value of acquired customer relationships and
(5) amounts recorded related to employment agreements with
certain individuals of acquired entities.

The excess of cost over the fair value of net
assets of acquired businesses totaled $5.0 billion (net of
accumulated amortization of $197.8 million) at
December 31, 2004, and $1.1 billion (net of
accumulated amortization of $197.8 million) at
December 31, 2003. Upon the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 in 2002, the Company
no longer amortizes excess purchase price. The Company’s
excess purchase price is tested for impairment on an annual
basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that
there may be impairment. Adverse changes in the economic
environment, operations of the business unit, or other factors
could result in a decline in the implied fair value. If the
implied fair value is less than the carrying amount, a loss
would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to implied
fair value.

Core deposit intangible assets totaled
$347.4 million and $4.1 million at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2004, 2003 and 2002,
Regions’ amortization of core deposit intangible assets was
$26.4 million, $1.3 million and $1.4 million,
respectively. Regions’ core deposit intangible assets are
being amortized on an accelerated basis over a six year average
period. The aggregate amount of amortization expense is
estimated to be $44.4 million in 2005, $38.7 million
in 2006, $33.9 million in 2007, $29.8 million in 2008,
and $28.3 million in 2009. Other identifiable intangible
assets are reviewed annually for events or circumstances which
could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset. To the
extent an other identifiable intangible asset is deemed
unrecoverable, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the
carrying amount to the fair value.

Amounts capitalized for the right to service
mortgage loans, which totaled $396.6 million at
December 31, 2004, and $126.8 million at
December 31, 2003, are being amortized over the estimated
remaining servicing life of the loans, considering appropriate
prepayment assumptions. Mortgage servicing rights are accounted
for under the lower of cost or market method. The estimated fair
values of capitalized mortgage servicing rights were
$396.6 million and $126.8 million at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. The fair value of mortgage
servicing rights is calculated by discounting estimated future
cash flows from the servicing assets, using market discount
rates, and using expected future prepayment rates. In 2004, 2003
and 2002, Regions capitalized $70.7 million,
$60.9 million and $41.0 million in mortgage servicing
rights, respectively. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, Regions’
amortization of mortgage servicing rights was
$62.8 million, $42.1 million and $33.9 million,
respectively. In addition, during 2004, Regions added
$352.6 million in mortgage serving rights from the Union
Planters transaction and sold $68.8 million in servicing
rights. Mortgage servicing assets are evaluated periodically for
impairment. For purposes of evaluating impairment, the Company
stratifies its mortgage servicing portfolio on the basis of
certain risk characteristics including loan type and note rate.
Changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds, or other factors,
could result in impairment of the servicing asset and a charge
against earnings.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

A summary of mortgage servicing rights is
presented as follows:

The changes in the valuation allowance for
servicing assets for the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2003 were as follows:

Data and assumptions used in the fair value
calculation for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003
are as follows:

In May 2004, as part of the acquisition of
Evergreen Timber Investment Management, Regions recorded
intangible assets related to existing customer relationships and
employment agreements with certain individuals in the amounts of
$8.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively. In 2004,
amortization of customer relationships was $430,000 and
amortization of employment agreements was $182,500. These assets
are being amortized on a straight line basis over a five year
and two year average period, respectively.

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging
Activities

The Company enters into derivative financial
instruments to manage interest rate risk, facilitate
asset/liability management strategies, and manage other
exposures. All derivative financial instruments are recognized
on the statement of condition as assets or liabilities at fair
value as required by Statement 133. It is Regions’
policy to enter into master netting agreements with
counterparties and to require collateral based on counterparty
credit ratings to cover exposures.

Derivative financial instruments that qualify
under Statement 133 in a hedging relationship are
designated, based on the exposure being hedged, as either fair
value or cash flow hedges. Fair value hedge relationships
mitigate exposure to the change in fair value of an asset,
liability or firm commitment. Under the fair value hedging
model, gains or losses attributable to the change in fair value
of the derivative instrument, as well as the gains and losses
attributable to the change in fair value of the hedged item, are
recognized in earnings in the period in which the change in fair
value occurs.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Cash flow hedge relationships mitigate exposure
to the variability of future cash flows or other forecasted
transactions. Under the cash flow hedging model, the effective
portion of the gain or loss related to the derivative instrument
is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. The
ineffective portion of the gain or loss related to the
derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in earnings during
the period of change. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive
income are amortized to earnings in the period or periods during
which the hedged item impacts earnings. For derivative financial
instruments not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges,
gains and losses related to the change in fair value are
recognized in earnings during the period of change in fair value.

The Company formally documents all hedging
relationships between hedging instruments and the hedged item,
as well as its risk management objective and strategy for
entering into various hedge transactions. The Company performs
periodic assessments, using the regression method, to determine
whether the hedging relationship has been highly effective in
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items
and whether they are expected to continue to be highly effective
in the future.

Profit-Sharing, 401(k) and Pension
Plans

Regions has profit-sharing and 401(k) plans
covering eligible employees. Regions’ pension plan covers
substantially all employees employed prior to January 1,
2001. Annual contributions to the profit-sharing plans are
determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
Regions’ contributions to the 401(k) plan for 2004 were
determined using a multiple of the employee’s contribution
to the plan (up to 3% of total compensation), based on the
employee’s length of service. The 401(k) match is invested
in Regions’ common stock. Pension expense is computed using
the projected unit credit (service prorate) actuarial cost
method and the pension plan is funded using the aggregate
actuarial cost method. Annual contributions to all the plans do
not exceed the maximum amounts allowable for federal income tax
purposes.

Income Taxes

Regions and its subsidiaries file a consolidated
federal income tax return. Regions accounts for income taxes
using the liability method pursuant to Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting for Income
Taxes.” Under this method, the Company’s deferred tax
assets and liabilities were determined by applying federal and
state tax rates currently in effect to its cumulative temporary
book/tax differences. Temporary differences are differences
between financial statement carrying amounts and the
corresponding tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred
taxes are provided as a result of such temporary differences.

From time to time the Company engages in business
plans that may also have an effect on its tax liabilities. If
the tax effects of a plan are significant, the Company’s
practice is to obtain the opinion of advisors that the tax
effects of such plans should prevail if challenged.

Regions has obtained the opinion of advisors that
the tax aspects of certain plans should prevail. Examination of
Regions’ income tax returns or changes in tax law may
impact the tax benefits of these plans. Regions believes
adequate provisions for income tax have been recorded for all
years open for review.

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Per Share Amounts

Earnings per share computations are based upon
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the
periods. Diluted earnings per share computations are based upon
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the
period plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and
stock performance awards. All prior year per-share amounts have
been converted in connection with the Union Planters transaction
using a 1.2346 share exchange ratio (see Note 18
“Business Combinations” to the consolidated financial
statements for further discussion).

Treasury Stock

The purchase of the Company’s common stock
is recorded at cost. At the date of retirement or subsequent
reissuance, the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of
such stock.

Statement of Cash Flows

Cash equivalents include cash and due from banks
and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements
to resell. Regions paid $760 million in 2004,
$756 million 2003 and $1.1 billion in 2002 for
interest on deposits and borrowings. Income tax payments totaled
$212 million for 2004, $135 million for 2003, and
$128 million for 2002. Loans transferred to other real
estate totaled $261 million in 2004, $112 million in
2003 and $126 million in 2002. In 2004, Regions
reclassified $430 million of indirect consumer auto loans
from loans held for sale to the loan portfolio. In June 2004,
Regions retired 6.8 million shares of treasury stock, with
a cost of $207 million, and in December 2002, Regions
retired 13.1 million shares of treasury stock, with a cost
of $358 million.

Restrictions on Cash and Due From
    Banks

Regions’ banking subsidiaries are required
to maintain reserve balances with the Federal Reserve Bank. The
average amount of the reserve balances maintained for the years
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, was approximately
$152.9 million and $82.9 million, respectively.

The following table presents the age of gross
unrealized losses and fair value by investment category for
securities available for sale at December 31, 2004:

Management does not believe any individual
unrealized loss as of December 31, 2004 represents an
other-than-temporary impairment. The unrealized losses relate

Loans

The loan portfolio at December 31, 2004 and
2003, consisted of the following:

Directors and executive officers of Regions and
its principal subsidiaries, including the directors’ and
officers’ families and affiliated companies, are loan and
deposit customers and have other transactions with Regions in
the ordinary course of business. Total loans to these persons
(excluding loans which in the aggregate do not exceed $60,000 to
any such person) at December 31, 2004, and 2003, were
approximately $115 million and $135 million,
respectively. During 2004, $156 million of new loans were
made, including $100 million of loans acquired in the
transaction with Union Planters, and repayments totaled
$176 million. These loans were made in the ordinary course
of business and on substantially the same terms, including
interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the same
time for comparable transactions with other persons and involve
no unusual risk of collectibility.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Regions’ recorded recourse liability, which
primarily relates to residential mortgage loans, totaled
$34.2 million and $925,000 at December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

The loan portfolio is diversified geographically,
primarily within Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.

The recorded investment in impaired loans was
$94.8 million at December 31, 2004, and
$93.6 million at December 31, 2003. The average amount
of impaired loans during 2004 was $69.9 million. The
allowance related to impaired loans totaled $8.7 million at
December 31, 2004.

At December 31, 2004, non-accrual loans
totaled $388.4 million compared to $250.3 million at
December 31, 2003. Loans contractually past due
90 days or more totaled $74.8 million and
$35.2 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

The amount of interest income recognized in 2004
on the $388.4 million of non-accruing loans outstanding at
year-end was approximately $11.4 million. If these loans
had been current in accordance with their original terms,
approximately $27.2 million would have been recognized on
these loans in 2004.

Asset
Securitizations

During 2003 and 2002, Regions securitized and
sold approximately $1.2 billion and $800 million,
respectively, of indirect consumer auto loans. The sale of these
loans resulted in net gains recorded in other non-interest
income of $3.3 million in 2003 and $7.5 million in
2002. Regions retained interest-only strips with initial
carrying values of $45.0 million for securitizations during
2003 and $35.1 million for the securitization during 2002.
The interest-only strips are classified as available for sale
securities. No loans were securitized or sold in 2004.
Additionally, in 2004, Regions reclassified $430 million of
indirect consumer auto loans from loans held for sale to
consumer loans as Regions no longer securitizes these types of
loans.

During 2004, in connection with the acquisition
of Union Planters, Regions acquired approximately
$102 million of retained interest-only strips related to
mortgage loan securitizations. Currently, it is not
Regions’ practice to securitize mortgage loans.

Following is a summary of short-term borrowings:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Federal funds purchased and securities sold under
agreements to repurchase had weighted average maturities of one
hundred six days, four hundred forty four days and nine days at
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Weighted
average rates on these dates were 2.1%, 0.9%, and 1.1%,
respectively.

Federal Home Loan Bank structured notes have
a remaining maturity ranging from five to six months. The
structured notes had a weighted average rate of 6.3%, 6.3%, and
6.4% at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Morgan Keegan maintains certain lines of credit
with unaffiliated banks that provide for maximum borrowings of
$365 million. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
$56.4 million and $91.2 million were outstanding under
these agreements, respectively. These agreements had weighted
average interest rates of 2.6% and 1.4% at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

No commercial paper balances were outstanding as
of December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2003 and
2002, commercial paper balances were $5.5 million and
$17.3 million, respectively. Commercial paper maturities
ranged from 4 days to 53 days at December 31,
2003 and from 218 days to 419 days at
December 31, 2002, respectively. Weighted average
maturities were 18 days and 335 days at
December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002. The weighted
average interest rates on these dates were 3.7%.

Through Morgan Keegan, Regions maintains a due to
brokerage customer position, which represents liquid funds in
the customers’ brokerage accounts. At December 31,
2004, these funds had an interest rate of 0.6%. At
December 31, 2003, these funds had an interest rate of 0.4%.

Regions holds cash as collateral for certain
derivative and other transactions with customers and other third
parties. Upon the expiration of these agreements, cash held as
collateral will be remitted to the counterparty. As of
December 31, 2004 these balances totaled
$75.8 million, with an interest rate of 2.0%. As of
December 31, 2003, these balances totaled
$68.3 million, with an interest rate of 0.9%.

The short-sale liability represents Regions’
trading obligation to deliver certain securities at a
predetermined date and price. These securities had weighted
average interest rates of 3.4%, 2.8% and 2.8% at
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Long-term borrowings consist of the following:

As of December 31, 2004, Regions had
subordinated notes of $2.2 billion. The acquisition of
Union Planters added $1.0 billion in subordinated notes.
Regions subordinated notes consist of six issues with interest
rates ranging from 6.375% to 7.75%. All issues of these notes
are subordinated and subject in right of payment of principal
and interest to the prior payment in full of all senior
indebtedness of the Company, generally defined as all
indebtedness and other obligations of the Company to its
creditors, except subordinated indebtedness. Payment of the
principal of the notes may be accelerated only in the case of
certain events involving bankruptcy, insolvency proceedings or
reorganization of the Company. The subordinated notes described
above, qualify as “Tier 2 capital” under Federal
Reserve guidelines.

In connection with the acquisition of Union
Planters, Regions assumed $484 million of
4.375% senior holding company notes due December 1,
2010.

In September 2003, Regions issued
$400 million of 2.9% senior bank notes, due
December 15, 2006. These balances remain outstanding at
December 31, 2004. The acquisition of Union Planters added
$617 million of 5.125% senior bank notes, due
June 15, 2007.

Federal Home Loan Bank structured notes have
various stated maturities but are callable, by the Federal Home
Loan Bank, between one to two years. The structured notes
had a weighted average interest rate of 5.5% at
December 31, 2004.

Federal Home Loan Bank advances represent
borrowings with fixed interest rates ranging from 0.5% to 7.4%
and with maturities of one to nineteen years. These borrowings,
as well as the short-term borrowings from the Federal Home
Loan Bank, are secured by Federal Home Loan Bank stock
(carried at cost of $382.2 million) and by first mortgage
loans on one- to four-family dwellings held by Regions Bank and
UPNBA (approximately $7.5 billion at December 31,
2004). The maximum amount that could be borrowed from Federal
Home Loan Banks under the current borrowing agreements is
approximately $14.8 billion.

In February 2001, Regions issued
$288 million of 8.00% trust preferred securities. These
securities have a 30-year term, are callable in five years and
qualify as Tier 1 Capital. In addition, Regions assumed
$4 million of trust preferred securities in connection with
an acquisition in 2001. Effective December 31, 2003, these
trust preferred securities were deconsolidated in accordance
with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpre-



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

tation No. 46 (FIN 46) (see
Note 19 “Variable Interest Entities” and
Note 25 “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” to the
consolidated financial statements) and are no longer included in
Regions statement of condition.

As a result of the deconsolidation of trust
preferred securities, effective December 31, 2003, Regions
began reporting $301 million of junior subordinated notes.
These junior subordinated notes are issued by Regions to two
subsidiary business trusts, which issued the trust preferred
securities discussed previously (see Note 19 “Variable
Interest Entities” and Note 25 “Recent Accounting
Pronouncements” to the consolidated financial statements).
In connection with the acquisition of Union Planters, Regions
assumed $224.3 million of 8.2% junior subordinated notes
which were issued to subsidiary business trusts.

The industrial development revenue bonds mature
on July 1, 2008, with annual principal payments of $300,000
payable annually through 2007 and $800,000 payable in 2008 and
interest at a tax effected prime rate payable monthly.

Regions uses derivative instruments, primarily
interest rate swaps and options, to manage interest rate risk by
converting a portion of its fixed-rate debt to variable-rate.
The basis adjustments related to these hedges are included in
long-term borrowings. Further discussion of derivative
instruments is included in Note 14 “Derivative
Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the
consolidated financial statements.

Other long-term debt at December 31, 2004,
had a weighted average interest rate of 7.7% and a weighted
average maturity of 15 years.

The aggregate amount of maturities of all
long-term debt in each of the next five years is as follows:
2005-$979.9 million; 2006-$1.0 billion;
2007-$620.0 million; 2008-$69.0 million; and
2009-$1.1 billion.

Substantially all net assets are owned by
subsidiaries. The primary source of operating cash available to
Regions is provided by dividends from subsidiaries. Statutory
limits are placed on the amount of dividends the subsidiary
banks can pay without prior regulatory approval. In addition,
regulatory authorities require the maintenance of minimum
capital-to-asset ratios at banking subsidiaries. At
December 31, 2004, the banking subsidiaries could pay
approximately $907 million in dividends without prior
approval.

Management believes that none of these dividend
restrictions will materially affect Regions’ dividend
policy. In addition to dividend restrictions, federal statutes
also prohibit unsecured loans from banking subsidiaries to the
parent company. Because of these limitations, substantially all
of the net assets of Regions’ subsidiaries are restricted,
except for the amount that can be paid to the parent in the form
of dividends.

Note 11.

Employee Benefit Plans

Regions has a defined-benefit pension plan
covering substantially all employees employed at or before
December 31, 2000. After January 1, 2001, the plan is
closed to new entrants. Benefits under the plan are based on
years of service and the employee’s highest five years of
compensation during the last ten years of employment.
Regions’ funding policy is to contribute annually at least
the amount required by IRS minimum funding standards.
Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits
attributed to service to date, but also for those expected to be
earned in the future.

The Company also sponsors a supplemental
executive retirement program, which is a non-qualified plan that
provides certain senior executive officers defined pension
benefits in relation to their compensation.

The following table sets forth the plans’
funded status, using a September 30 measurement date, and
amounts recognized in the consolidated statement of condition:

The accumulated benefit obligation at the end of
2004 and 2003 was $353.3 million and $304.3 million,
respectively. Pension liabilities for the supplemental executive
retirement program of $22.1 million and $10.1 million
were recorded at December 31, 2004 and December 31,
2003, respectively and were included in the $72.8 million
and $63.4 million prepaid pension cost, respectively.

Net pension cost included the following
components:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The weighted average assumptions used to
determine the plans’ benefit obligations at the end of each
year and the plans’ net pension cost during each year were
as follows:

The asset allocation for the plan at the end of
2004 and 2003, and the target allocation for 2005, by asset
category, are as follows:

Regions’ investment strategy is to invest
primarily in large-cap equity securities and intermediate term
investment grade domestic fixed income securities. Regions will
invest in small-cap, mid-cap, and international equities in
smaller concentrations depending on the Company’s outlook
for growth in those sectors. The expected long-term return on
plan assets assumption is determined using the plan asset mix,
historical returns, and expert opinion.

As a part of Regions’ profit sharing plan,
eligible employees can elect to receive their profit sharing
contribution as a cash payment or defer it into their 401(k)
account. Contributions in 2004, 2003 and 2002 totaled
$7.0 million, $13.9 million and $13.9 million,
respectively.

Regions’ 401(k) plan includes a company
match of employee contributions. At December 31, 2004, this
match ranged from 150% to 200% of the employee contribution (up
to 3% of compensation) based on length of service and was
invested in Regions common stock. Regions’ contribution to
the 401(k) plan on behalf of employees totaled
$25.7 million, $16.5 million, and $16.0 million
in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Regions sponsors a defined-benefit postretirement
health care plan that covers certain retired employees.
Currently the Company pays a portion of the costs of certain
health care benefits for all eligible employees that retired
before January 1, 1989. No health care benefits are
provided for employees retiring at normal retirement age after
December 31, 1988. For employees retiring before normal
retirement age, the Company currently pays a portion of the
costs of certain health care benefits until the retired employee
becomes eligible for Medicare. The plan is contributory and
contains other cost-sharing features such as deductibles and
co-payments. Retiree health care benefits, as well as similar
benefits for active employees, are provided through a group
insurance program in which premiums are based on the amount of
benefits paid. The Company’s policy is to fund the
Company’s share of the cost of health care benefits in
amounts determined at the discretion of management.

The following table sets forth the plan’s
funded status, using a September 30 measurement date, and
amounts recognized in the consolidated statement of condition:

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost included
the following components:

The assumed health care cost trend rate was 10.0%
for 2004 and is assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0% by 2010
and remain at that level thereafter. Increasing the assumed
health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each
year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation at December 31, 2004, by $2.0 million and
the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net
periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2004 by
$0.4 million. Decreasing the assumed health care cost trend
rates by one percentage point in each year would decrease the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at
December 31, 2004, by $1.9 million and the aggregate
of the service and interest cost components of net periodic
postretirement benefit cost for 2004 by $0.4 million.

Commitments and Contingencies

To accommodate the financial needs of its
customers, Regions makes commitments under various terms to lend
funds to consumers, businesses and other entities. These
commitments include (among others) revolving credit agreements,
term loan commitments and short-term borrowing agreements. Many
of these loan commitments have fixed expiration dates or other
termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many
of these commitments are expected to expire without being
funded, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent future liquidity requirements. Standby letters of
credit are also issued, which commit Regions to make payments on
behalf of customers if certain specified future events occur.
Historically, a large percentage of standby letters of credit
also expire without being funded.

Both loan commitments and standby letters of
credit have credit risk essentially the same as that involved in
extending loans to customers and are subject to normal credit
approval procedures and policies. Collateral is obtained based
on management’s assessment of the customer’s credit.

Loan commitments totaled $17.0 billion at
December 31, 2004, and $7.8 billion at
December 31, 2003. Standby letters of credit were
$2.4 billion at December 31, 2004, and
$1.3 billion at December 31, 2003. Commitments under
commercial letters of credit used to facilitate customers’
trade transactions were $148.9 million at December 31,
2004, and $51.9 million at December 31, 2003.

The Company and its affiliates are defendants in
litigation and claims arising from the normal course of
business. Based on consultation with legal counsel, management
is of the opinion that the outcome of pending and threatened
litigation will not have a material effect on Regions’
consolidated financial statements.

Note 14.

Derivative Financial Instruments and
    Hedging Activities

Regions maintains positions in derivative
financial instruments to manage interest rate risk, facilitate
asset/ liability management strategies, and to serve the risk
management needs of our customers. The most common derivative
instruments are forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps,
and put and call options. For those derivative contracts that
qualify for hedge accounting, according to Statement 133,
Regions designates the hedging instrument as either a cash flow
or fair value hedge. The accounting policies associated with
derivative financial instruments are discussed further in
Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

Regions utilizes certain derivatives to hedge the
variability of interest cash flows on debt instruments. On
July 1, 2004, Regions also designated several interest rate
swaps to hedge the variability of future cash flows associated
with certain variable-rate loans. These interest rate swaps and
variable-rate loans were acquired in the merger with Union
Planters. To the extent that the hedge of future cash flows is
effective, changes in the fair value of the derivative are
recognized as a component of other comprehensive income in
stockholders’ equity. At December 31, 2003, Regions
reported a $3.7 million loss in other comprehensive income
related to cash flow hedges of debt instruments, of which
approximately $994,000 was amortized to interest expense in
2004. The Company will amortize the remaining $2.8 million
loss into earnings in conjunction with the recognition of
interest payments through 2011. The amount expected to be
reclassified during the next twelve months is $609,000. At
December 31, 2004, Regions also reported a
$1.8 million gain in accumulated other comprehensive income
related to cash flow hedges of variable-rate loans. To the
extent that the hedge of future cash flows is ineffective,
changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in
earnings as a component of other non-interest expense. For the
year ended December 31, 2004 there was a gain of
approximately $40,000 related to hedge ineffectiveness
recognized in other non-interest expense attributable to cash
flow hedges on variable-rate loans. For the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, there was no ineffectiveness
recognized in other non-interest expense attributable to cash
flow hedges. No gains or losses were recognized during 2004
related to components of derivative instruments that were
excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Regions hedges the changes in fair value of
assets using forward contracts, which represent commitments to
sell money market instruments at a future date at a specified
price or yield. The contracts are utilized by the Company to
hedge interest rate risk positions associated with the
origination of mortgage loans held for sale. The Company is
subject to the market risk associated with changes in the value
of the underlying financial instrument as well as the risk that
the other party will fail to perform. For the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, Regions recognized a net
hedging gain of $2.1 million and a net hedging loss of
$2.8 million, respectively, associated with these hedging
instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the
Company recorded a $5.2 million net hedging gain. The gross
amount of forward contracts totaled $1.1 billion and
$111 million at December 31, 2004, and 2003,
respectively.

Regions has also entered into interest rate swap
agreements converting a portion of its fixed-rate long-term debt
to floating-rate. In addition to the hedges previously
designated by Regions, on July 1, 2004, Regions also
designated several interest rate swaps acquired in the merger
with Union Planters as fair value hedges. These interest rate
swaps are converting a portion of the fixed rate long-term debt
acquired in the merger with Union Planters to floating rate. The
fair values of the derivative instruments used in these fair
value hedges are included in other assets on the statement of
financial condition. For the year ended December 31, 2004,
there was no ineffectiveness recorded in earnings related to
these fair value hedges. For the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002, there was a $503,000 loss and $2.0 million
loss, respectively, recorded in earnings due to hedge
ineffectiveness. No gains or losses were recognized during 2004
related to components of derivative instruments that were
excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

During the first six months of 2004, Regions sold
Eurodollar futures contracts to hedge the fair value of a pool
of highly correlated indirect auto loans. For the year ended
December 31, 2004, an $89,000 loss was recorded in earnings
due to hedge ineffectiveness. This hedge relationship was
terminated on July 1, 2004, and Regions entered into
offsetting futures contracts. The futures contracts previously
used to hedge the indirect auto loans, as well as the offsetting
futures contracts, are now classified as trading.

The Company also maintains a derivatives trading
portfolio of interest rate swaps, option contracts and futures
and forward commitments used to meet the needs of its customers.
The portfolio is used to generate trading profit and help
clients manage interest rate risk. The Company is subject to the
risk that a counterparty will fail to perform. These trading
derivatives are recorded in other assets and other liabilities.
The net fair value of the trading portfolio at December 31,
2004 and 2003 was $23.8 million and $37.2 million,
respectively.

Foreign currency contracts involve the exchange
of one currency for another on a specified date and at a
specified rate. These contracts are executed on behalf of the
Company’s customers and are used to manage fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates. The notional amount of forward foreign
exchange contracts totaled $25 million and $20 million
at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company is
subject to the risk that another party will fail to perform.

In the normal course of business, Morgan Keegan
enters into underwriting and forward and future commitments. At
December 31, 2004, the contract amount of future contracts
to purchase and sell U.S. Government and municipal
securities was approximately $22 million and
$228 million, respectively. The brokerage subsidiary
typically settles its position by entering into equal but
opposite contracts and, as such, the contract amounts do not
necessarily represent future cash requirements. Settlement of
the transactions relating to such commitments is not expected to
have a material effect on the subsidiary’s financial
position. Transactions involving future settlement give rise to
market risk, which represents the potential loss that can be
caused by a change in the market value of a particular financial
instrument. The exposure to market risk is determined by a
number of factors, including size, composition and
diversification of positions held, the absolute and relative
levels of interest rates, and market volatility.

consolidated statement of condition approximates the estimated
fair value.

Securities held to maturity:

Estimated fair values are based on
quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices
are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted
market prices of comparable instruments.

Securities available for sale:

Estimated fair values, which are the

on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Loans held for sale:

Loans held for sale include
single-family real estate mortgage loans, factored accounts
receivable and asset backed loans and, in prior years, indirect
consumer auto loans. Mortgage loans held for sale have been
designated as one of the hedged items in a fair value hedging
relationship under Statement 133. Therefore, to the extent
changes in fair value are attributable to the interest rate risk
being hedged, the change in fair value is recognized in income
as an adjustment to the carrying amount of mortgage loans held
for sale. Otherwise, mortgage loans held for sale are accounted
for under the lower of cost or market method. The fair values
are based on quoted market prices of similar instruments,
adjusted for differences in loan characteristics. All other
loans held for sale are accounted for under the lower of cost or
market method. The fair values are based on cash flow models.

Loans:

Estimated
fair values for variable-rate loans, which reprice frequently
and have no significant credit risk, are based on carrying
value. Estimated fair values for all other loans are estimated
using discounted cash flow analyses, based on interest rates
currently offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of
similar credit quality. The carrying amount of accrued interest
reported in the consolidated statements of condition
approximates the fair value.

Derivative assets and liabilities:

Fair values for derivative instruments
are based either on cash flow projection models or observable
market prices.

Deposit liabilities:

The fair value of non-interest bearing
demand accounts, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings
accounts, money market accounts and certain other time open
accounts is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date
(i.e., the carrying amount). Fair values for certificates of
deposit are estimated by using discounted cash flow analyses,
using the interest rates currently offered for deposits of
similar maturities.

Short-term borrowings:

The carrying amount reported in the
consolidated statements of condition approximates the estimated
fair value.

Long-term borrowings:

Fair values are estimated using
discounted cash flow analyses, based on the current rates
offered for similar borrowing arrangements.

Loan commitments, standby and commercial
letters of credit:

Estimated fair
values for these off-balance-sheet instruments are based on

Income Taxes

At December 31, 2004, Regions has net
operating loss carryforwards of $159.6 million
($4.4 million federal) that expire in years 2005 through
2024. In addition, Regions has federal capital loss
carryforwards of $219.1 million that will expire in years
2008 through 2009. Management does not believe that it is more
likely than not to realize all of its state net operating loss
carryforwards nor all of its capital loss carryforwards.
Accordingly, it has set up a valuation allowance of
$7.6 million and $63.8 million, respectively, against
such benefits.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects
of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
used for income tax purposes. Significant components of
Regions’ deferred tax assets and liabilities as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003 are listed below:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Applicable income taxes for financial reporting
purposes differs from the amount computed by applying the
statutory federal income tax rate of 35% for the reasons below:

From time to time Regions engages in business
plans that may also have an effect on its tax liabilities. While
Regions has obtained the opinion of advisors that the tax
aspects of these strategies should prevail, examination of
Regions’ income tax returns or changes in tax law may
impact the tax benefits of these plans.

During the fourth quarter of 2000, Regions
recapitalized a mortgage-related subsidiary by raising Tier 2
capital through issuance of a new class of participating
preferred stock of this subsidiary. Regions is not subject to
tax on the portion of the subsidiary’s income allocated to
the holders of the preferred stock for federal income tax
purposes.

Regions’ federal and state income tax
returns for the years 1998 through 2003 are open for review and
examination by governmental authorities. In the normal course of
these examinations, Regions is subject to challenges from
governmental authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. Regions
has received notices of proposed adjustments relating to taxes
due for the years 1999 through 2001, which includes proposed
adjustments relating to an increase in taxable income allocated
to Regions from the mortgage-related subsidiary discussed above.
Regions believes adequate provisions for income taxes have been
recorded for all years open for review and intends to vigorously
contest the proposed adjustments. To the extent that final
resolution of the proposed adjustments results in significantly
different conclusions from Regions’ current assessment of
the proposed adjustments, Regions’ effective tax rate in
any given financial reporting period may be materially different
from its current effective tax rate.

The provisions for income taxes in the
consolidated statements of income are summarized below. Included
in these amounts are income taxes of $22.1 million,
$9.0 million and $18.1 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, related to securities transactions.

Business
Combinations

On July 1, 2004, the Company completed its
merger with Union Planters Corporation, headquartered in
Memphis, Tennessee. Both companies merged into a new holding
company named Regions Financial Corporation upon completion of
the transaction. In the transaction, each share of Union
Planters Corporation common stock was converted into one share
of the new company $0.01 par value common stock and each share
of Regions’ $0.625 par value common stock was converted
into 1.2346 shares of the new company $0.01 par value common
stock. The merger was accounted for as a purchase of Union
Planters by Regions for accounting and financial reporting
purposes. Additional information about the reasons for the
merger and factors that contributed to the purchase price are
included in Regions’ Form S-4 filed as of
April 29, 2004.

In connection with the merger, Regions Financial
Corporation issued a total of 461,842,025 shares of common
stock. The table below provides a summary of the number of
shares issued upon the completion of the merger:

The merger is being accounted for in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,
“Business Combinations.” Accordingly, the purchase
price was preliminarily allocated to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the
merger date, as summarized below. The final allocation of the
purchase price may be adjusted after completion of additional
analysis relating to the fair values of Union Planters’
tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, and
final decisions regarding integration activities.

During 2004, Regions also completed the
acquisition of Evergreen Timber Investment Management, formerly
a division of Wachovia Corporation. In connection with the
transaction, Regions paid $19 million in cash and recorded
$10.1 million of identifiable intangible assets as well as
$7.1 million of excess purchase price.

During 2003, Regions completed its acquisition of
three branches of Inter Savings Bank, FSB, located in Palm City,
Indiatlantic, and Okeechobee, Florida. In connection with the
acquisition, the Company paid approximately $170 million in
cash in exchange for approximately $185 million in assets.

Restructuring Liability

On July 1, 2004, $20.3 million of
liabilities were recorded related to Union Planters as purchase
accounting adjustments resulting in an increase in excess
purchase price. Included in the $20.3 million are
$11.3 million for tax payments for certain employees’
compensation related to the acquisition and $9.0 million
for contract terminations. Through December 31, 2004, cash
payments of $17.4 million have been charged against this
liability including $10.4 million of tax payments and
$7.1 million of contract terminations.

As of December 31, 2004, Regions had no

Variable Interest Entities

In 2003, Regions adopted Financial Accounting
Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities” (FIN 46) for all
variable interest entities (“VIE”) created after
January 31, 2003 as well as VIEs created prior to
February 1, 2003 that are considered to be special-purpose
entities. FIN 46 was also adopted on March 31, 2004 for
entities created prior to February 1, 2003 which are not
considered to be special-purpose entities. A summary of
Regions’ significant variable interests in VIEs is provided
below.

Regions owns the common stock of subsidiary
business trusts, which have issued mandatorily redeemable
preferred capital securities (“trust preferred
securities”). One of the trusts issued $287.5 million
in trust preferred securities in February 2001. Another trust
issued $3.0 million in trust preferred securities and was
acquired as part of a bank acquisition in November 2001. The
trusts’ only assets are junior subordinated debentures
issued by Regions, which were acquired by the trusts using the
proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities and
common stock. Prior to the adoption of FIN 46 for
special-purpose entities on December 31, 2003, Regions
consolidated the trusts and reported the trust preferred
securities in long-term debt. Regions determined that it is not
the primary beneficiary of the trusts and, accordingly,
deconsolidated the trusts upon the adoption of FIN 46 for
special-purpose entities on December 31, 2003. As of
December 31, 2004, the junior subordinated debentures were
included in long-term debt and Regions’ equity interest in
the business trusts was included in other assets. The
deconsolidation in 2003 resulted in a net increase in long-term
debt and other assets of $9.0 million. The deconsolidation
of the trusts did not impact net income. For regulatory
reporting and capital adequacy purposes, the Federal Reserve
Board has indicated that such preferred securities will continue
to constitute Tier 1 capital until further notice.

Regions invested in two grantor trusts during
2001 which are parties to leveraged lease financing
transactions. The trusts have been determined to be VIEs.
Regions’ total investment in the trusts and maximum
exposure to loss was $85.3 million as of December 31,
2004. FIN 46 did not impact Regions’ current leveraged
lease accounting for its investment in the trusts.

Regions periodically invests in single-purpose
trusts that own tax-exempt municipal bonds. These trusts were
determined to be VIEs; however, Regions is not the primary
beneficiary of the trusts. As of December 31, 2004, Regions
maximum exposure to loss approximates its investment in the
trusts of $13.7 million.

Regions periodically invests in various limited
partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing
the Low Income Housing Tax Credit pursuant to Section 42 of
the Internal Revenue Code. The investments are funded through a
combination of debt and equity with equity typically comprising
30% to 50% of the total partnership capital. Regions has
concluded that these partnerships are VIEs; however, Regions is
not the primary beneficiary of these partnerships. As of
December 31, 2004, Regions’ recorded investment in
these limited partnerships was $154.1 million.
Regions’ maximum exposure to loss as of December 31,
2004 was $173.9 million, which includes $19.8 million
in unfunded commitments to the partnerships.

Regions has a recorded investment of
$3.8 million in non-registered investment partnerships
which were determined to be VIEs, but for which Regions has
concluded it is not the primary beneficiary. Regions’
maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2004, was
$6.0 million which includes $2.2 million in unfunded
commitments to the partnerships.

The adoption of FIN 46 for entities created
before February 1, 2003 that are not considered to be
special-purpose entities resulted in the consolidation of one
non-registered investment partnership at March 31, 2004.
The consolidation resulted in increases to cash of
$0.9 million, trading account assets of $18.4 million,
interest receivable of $0.1 million, long-term borrowings
of $5.9 million and other liabilities of $9.0 million.
The consolidation also resulted in a decrease to other assets of
$4.7 million. These increases and decreases to the non-cash
accounts are excluded for the consolidated statement of cash
flows since they represent non-cash items.

Stock Option and Long-Term Incentive
    Plans

Regions has stock option plans for certain key
employees that provide for the granting of options to purchase
up to 7,061,912 shares of Regions’ common stock (excluding
options assumed in connection with acquisitions). The terms of
options granted are determined by the compensation committee of
the Board of Directors; however, no options may be granted after
ten years from the plans’ adoption, and no options may be
exercised beyond ten years from the date granted. The option
price per share of incentive stock options cannot be less than
the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the
grant; however, the option price of non-qualified options may be
less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date
of the grant. The plans also permit the granting of stock
appreciation rights to holders of stock options. No stock
appreciation rights were attached to options outstanding at
December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002.

Regions’ long-term incentive plans provide
for the granting of up to 54,086,434 shares of common stock in
the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
performance awards or restricted stock awards. The terms of
stock options granted under the long-term incentive plans are
generally subject to the same terms as options granted under
Regions’ stock option plans. A maximum of 6,790,300 shares
of restricted stock and 37,038,000 shares of performance awards
may be granted. During 2004, 2003, and 2002, Regions granted
2,097,555; 431,530, and 471,876 shares, respectively, as
restricted stock. Grantees of restricted stock must remain
employed with Regions for certain periods from the date of the
grant at the same or a higher level in order for the shares to
be released, or the grantees must meet the standards of a
retiree at which time the restricted shares may be prorated and
released. However, during this period the grantee is eligible to
receive dividends and exercise voting privileges on such
restricted shares. In 2004, 2003, and 2002, 22,680; 377,452 and
292,472 restricted shares, respectively, were released. Total
expense for restricted stock was $12,933,000 in 2004,
$10,331,000 in 2003, and $8,738,000 in 2002. All prior year
share and per-share amounts have been adjusted in connection
with the Union Planters transaction using a 1.2346 share
exchange ratio (see Note 18 “Business
Combinations” to the consolidated financial statements for
further discussion).

In connection with the business combinations with
other companies in years prior to 2004, Regions assumed stock
options that were previously granted by those companies and
converted those options, based on the appropriate exchange
ratio, into options to acquire Regions’ common stock. The
common stock for such options has been registered under the
Securities Act of 1933 by Regions and is not included in the
maximum number of shares that may be granted by Regions under
its existing stock option plans.

Stock option activity (including assumed options)
over the last three years is summarized as follows:

In October 1995, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting
and Disclosure of Stock-Based Compensation” (Statement
123). Statement 123 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1995, and allows for the option of
continuing to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25 (APB 25), “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees”, and the related interpretations, or selecting
the fair value method of expense recognition as described in
Statement 123. The Company has elected to follow APB 25 in
accounting for its employee stock options. Pro forma net income
and net income per share data is presented below for the years
ended December 31 as if the fair-value method had been
applied in measuring compensation costs:

Regions’ options outstanding have a weighted
average contractual life of 6.7 years. The weighted average
fair value of options granted was $4.43 in 2004, $3.68 in 2003
and $3.73 in 2002. The fair value of each grant is

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted
average assumptions used for grants in 2004, 2003 and 2002:

Since the exercise price of the Company’s
employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying
stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is
recognized.

In 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Standards No. 123 (revised 2004) (Statement 123(R))
“Share-Based Payment.” Statement 123(R) requires all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options, to be expensed based on their fair values. See

Regulatory Capital
    Requirements

Regions and its banking subsidiaries are subject
to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal
banking agencies. These regulatory capital requirements involve
quantitative measures of the Company’s assets, liabilities
and certain off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative
judgments by the regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital
requirements can subject the Company to a series of increasingly
restrictive regulatory actions. As of December 31, 2004,
the most recent notification from federal banking agencies
categorized Regions and its significant subsidiaries as
“well capitalized” under the regulatory framework.

Minimum capital requirements for all banks are
Tier 1 Capital of at least 4% of risk-weighted assets, Total
Capital of at least 8% of risk-weighted assets and a Leverage
Ratio of 3%, plus an additional 100- to 200- basis point cushion
in certain circumstances, of adjusted quarterly average assets.
Tier 1 Capital consists principally of stockholders’
equity, excluding unrealized gains and losses on securities
available for sale, less excess purchase price and certain other
intangibles. Total Capital consists of Tier 1 Capital plus
certain debt instruments and the allowance for loan losses,
subject to limitation.

Regions’ and its banking subsidiaries’
capital levels at December 31, 2004 and 2003, exceeded the
“well capitalized” levels, as shown below:

In addition, Regions subsidiaries engaged in
mortgage banking must adhere to various U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) regulatory guidelines
including required minimum capital to maintain their Federal
Housing Administration approved status. Failure to comply with
the HUD guidelines

Recent Accounting
    Pronouncements

In April 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 149 (Statement 149), “Amendment of
FASB Statement No. 133 on Derivative and Hedging
Transactions.” Statement 149 amends and clarifies
accounting for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities under Statement 133. Statement 149
was effective for contracts entered into or modified after
June 30, 2003. The adoption of Statement 149 did not
have a material effect on Regions’ financial position or
results of operations.

In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 150
(Statement 150), “Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity.” Statement 150 established standards for how
an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments
with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires
that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

within its scope as a liability (or an asset in
some circumstances). Many of those instruments were previously
classified as equity. Statement 150 was effective for financial
instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003,
and otherwise became effective at the beginning of the first
interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption
of Statement 150 did not have a material effect on
Regions’ financial position or results of operations.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
Interpretation of ARB 51.” In December 2003, the FASB
revised FIN 46 to incorporate several FASB Staff Positions
and change the effective date. FIN 46 addresses consolidation by
business enterprises of variable interest entities (VIE). In
general, FIN 46 defines a VIE as any legal structure used
for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity
investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors
that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the
entity to support its activities. FIN 46 excludes certain
interests from its scope including transferors to qualifying
special purpose entities subject to Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 140, “Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments
of Liabilities” and employee benefit plans subject to
specific accounting requirements in existing FASB Statements.
FIN 46 was effective immediately to VIEs created after
January 31, 2003. For variable interests in entities
created before February 1, 2003, that are considered to be
special-purpose entities, FIN 46 was effective on
December 31, 2003, for calendar-year companies. For
variable interests in other entities created before
February 1, 2003, FIN 46 was effective on
March 31, 2004, for calendar-year companies. Regions
adopted the provisions of FIN 46 for all variable interests
in entities created or modified after January 31, 2003. In
addition, Regions adopted FIN 46 on December 31, 2003,
for entities created before February 1, 2003, that are
considered to be special-purpose entities. The adoption of
FIN 46 for special-purpose entities resulted in the
deconsolidation of two subsidiary business trusts, which have
issued trust-preferred securities. Significant variable
interests in VIEs and the impact of the deconsolidation of the
two subsidiary business trusts are disclosed in Note 19.
FIN 46 was adopted on March 31, 2004, for entities
created before February 1, 2003, that are not considered to
be special-purpose entities. The adoption of FIN 46 for
these entities did not have a material effect on Regions’
financial position or results of operations.

In December 2003, the FASB revised Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 132
(Statement 132), “Employers’ Disclosures about
Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits.” The revision
was made to improve financial statement disclosures for defined
benefit plans. Statement 132, as revised, requires
companies to provide more details about their plan assets,
benefit obligations, cash flows, benefit costs and other
relevant information. In addition to increased annual
disclosures, Statement 132, as revised, requires companies
to report the various elements of pension and other
postretirement benefit costs on a quarterly basis. The revision
to Statement 132 is effective for financial statements with
fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. The
interim-period disclosures of Statement 132, as revised,
are effective for interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2003. Regions has adopted the revisions to
Statement 132 and the increased required disclosures are in
Note 11 “Employee Benefit Plans.”

In December 2003, the Accounting Standards
Executive Committee of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 03-3
(SOP 03-3), “Accounting for Certain Loans and Debt
Securities Acquired in a Transfer.” SOP 03-3 addresses
accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and
cash flows expected to be collected from an investor’s
initial investment in loans or debt securities acquired in a
transfer if those differences are attributable, at least in
part, to credit quality. It includes such loans acquired in
purchase business combinations and applies to all
nongovernmental entities. SOP 03-3 does not apply to loans
originated by the entity. SOP 03-3 limits the yield that
may be accreted (accretable yield) to the excess of the
investor’s estimate of cash flows expected at acquisition
to be collected over the investor’s initial investment of
the loan. SOP 03-3 requires that the excess of contractual
cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected
(nonaccretable difference) not be recognized as an adjustment of
yield, loss accrual, or valuation allowance. SOP 03-3
prohibits investors from displaying accretable yield and
nonaccretable difference in the balance sheet. Subsequent
increases in cash flows expected to be collected generally
should be recognized prospectively through adjustment of the
loan’s yield over its remaining life.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Decreases in cash flows expected to be collected
should be recognized as impairment. SOP 03-3 also prohibits
carrying over or creation of valuation allowances in the initial
accounting of all loans acquired in a transfer that are within
the scope of SOP 03-3. The prohibition of the valuation
allowance carryover applies to the purchase of an individual
loan, a pool of loans, a group of loans, and loans acquired in a
purchase business combination. SOP 03-3 is effective for
loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2004. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any,
SOP 03-3 will have on the results of operations and
financial position.

In December 2003, President Bush signed into law
a bill that expands Medicare benefits, primarily adding a
prescription drug benefit for Medicare-eligible retirees
beginning in 2006. The law also provides a federal subsidy to
companies which sponsor postretirement benefit plans that
provide prescription drug coverage. FASB Staff
Position 106-1, “Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” permitted
deferring the recognition of the new Medicare provisions’
impact due to lack of specific authoritative guidance on
accounting for the federal subsidy. The Company elected to defer
accounting for the effects of this new legislation until the
specific authoritative guidance was issued. During the second
quarter of 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 106-2
(FSP 106-2), “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003.” FSP 106-2 provides the
final accounting and disclosure requirements related to the new
Medicare provisions and was effective for the first interim
period beginning after June 15, 2004. The adoption of
FAS 106-2 did not have a material effect on Regions’
financial position or results of operations.

On March 9, 2004, the SEC released Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 105 (SAB 105),
“Application of Accounting Principles to Loan
Commitments” that requires all registrants to account for
mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments related to loans
held for sale as written options, effective not later than for
commitments entered into after March 31, 2004. The Company
enters into such commitments with customers in connection with
residential mortgage loan applications. SAB 105 requires
the Company to recognize a liability on its balance sheet equal
to the fair value of the commitment at the time the loan
commitment is issued. As a result, SAB 105 delays the
recognition of any revenue related to these commitments until
such time as the loan is sold, however, it will have no effect
on the ultimate amount of revenue or cash flows recognized over
time. The adoption of SAB 105 did not have a material
effect on Regions’ financial position or results of
operations.

At its March 31, 2004 meeting, the FASB
ratified several consensuses reached by the Emerging Issues Task
Force in EITF Issue No. 03-1 (EITF 03-1), “The
Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments and Its Application
to Certain Investments.” The consensuses ratified include
application guidance for determining whether an
other-than-temporary impairment has occurred on certain
investments. The application guidance in EITF 03-1 was
initially effective in reporting periods beginning after
June 15, 2004. On September 15, 2004, the FASB issued
proposed FASB Staff Position EITF Issue 03-1-a
(FSP 03-1-a) to address the application of EITF 03-1
to debt securities that are impaired solely because of
interest-rate and/or sector-spread increases and that are
analyzed for impairment under paragraph 16 of
EITF 03-1. FSP 03-1-a would be effective for other
than temporary impairment evaluations of interest-rate impaired
and sector-spread impaired debt securities that are analyzed
under paragraph 16 of EITF 03-1 on the last reporting
date for the reporting periods ending after the final FSP is
posted to the FASB website. On September 30, 2004, the FASB
issued FASB Staff Position 03-1-1, which delayed the
effective date of paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue 03-1.
Application of those paragraphs is deferred pending issuance of
proposed FSP 03-1-a. Regions is currently assessing the
potential impact of the application guidance in EITF 03-1
and the proposed FSP 03-1-a on its securities portfolio.

At its March 31, 2004 meeting, the FASB
ratified the consensuses reached by the Emerging Issues Task
Force in EITF Issue No. 03-6 (EITF 03-6),
“Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method
under FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share.”
EITF 03-6 concludes that a forward contract to issue an
entity’s own shares that has a provision that reduces the
contract price per share when dividends are declared on the
issuing entity’s common stock is a participating security,
and therefore, earnings per share must be

calculated using the two-class method under FASB
Statement No. 28. EITF 03-6 must be applied in the
first reporting period beginning after March 31, 2004, by
restating previously reported earnings per share to apply the
two-class method to any participating securities that were
outstanding for any period presented in comparative financial
statements. Regions has adopted the provisions of EITF 03-6
and 2002 net income available to common shareholders has been
restated from $619.9 million to $614.5 million.

On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
(revised 2004) (Statement 123(R)), “Share-Based
Payment.” Statement 123(R) revises Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
(Statement 123), “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” and supersedes Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25 (Opinion 25), “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees.” Statement 123(R) requires
all share-based payments to employees, including grants of
employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial
statements based on their fair values. It uses a “modified
grant-date” approach in which the fair value of an equity
award is estimated on the grant date without regard to service
or performance conditions. The fair value is recognized as
expense over the requisite service period for all awards that
vest. The requisite service period is the period of time over
which an employee must provide service in exchange for an award
under a share-based payment arrangement, or the vesting period.
Statement 123(R) is effective for public companies in the
first interim or annual period beginning after June 15,
2005 and allows for two transition alternatives. The
modified-prospective-transition method would require companies
to recognize expense for share-based payments to employees based
on their grant-date fair value from the beginning of the fiscal
period in which the recognition provisions are first applied. In
addition, expense would be recognized for awards that were
granted prior to, but not vested as of, the date
Statement 123(R) is adopted based on the same estimate of
grant-date fair value used previously under Statement 123 for
pro forma footnote disclosure purposes. Statement 123(R)
also allows the modified-retrospective-transition method in
which companies will restate prior periods by recognizing
expense for the amounts previously reported in the pro forma
footnote disclosures under the provisions of Statement 123.
As permitted by Statement 123, the Company currently
accounts for share-based payments to employees using
Opinion 25’s intrinsic value method and, as such,
generally recognizes no expense for employee stock options.
Accordingly, the adoption of Statement 123(R) will have an
impact on Regions results of operations, although it will have
no impact on Regions overall financial position. The impact of
adoption of Statement 123(R) cannot be predicted at this
time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments
granted in the future. However, had Regions adopted
Statement 123(R) in prior periods, the impact of that
standard would have approximated the impact of
Statement 123 as described in the disclosure of
pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note 20
“Stock Options and Long-Term Incentive Plans.”

Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation, as of the end of the
period covered by this Form 10-K, under the supervision and
with the participation of Regions’ management, including
its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that Regions’ disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Act of
1934) are effective. During the fourth fiscal quarter of the
year ended December 31, 2004, there have been no changes in
Regions’ internal control over financial reporting that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, Regions’ control over financial reporting.

Report on Management’s Assessment of
Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of Regions is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. Regions’ internal control system was
designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s
management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and
fair presentation of the Company’s financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

All internal control systems, no matter how well
designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or
detect misstatements in the Company’s financial statements.
Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

Regions’ management assessed the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this
assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) in its Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based
on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31,
2004, the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Regions’ independent registered public
accounting firm has issued an audit report on our assessment of
the Company’s internal control over financing reporting.
This report appears on the following page.



Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm

Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Regions Financial Corporation

We have audited management’s assessment,
included in the accompanying Report on Management’s
Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that
Regions Financial Corporation maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004,
based on criteria established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
Regions Financial Corporation’s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that
Regions Financial Corporation maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004,
is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO
criteria. Also, in our opinion, Regions Financial Corporation
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated statements of condition of
Regions Financial Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of income, cash flows, and changes in
stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2004, and our report dated March
10, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
