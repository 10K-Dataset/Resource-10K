UNION PACIFIC CORPORATION



PART I

Item 1.

Business

GENERAL

Union Pacific Corporation operates primarily as a rail
transportation provider through Union Pacific Railroad Company, its principal operating company. The largest railroad in North America, Union Pacific Railroad Company, serves 23 states across the western two-thirds of the United States. Union
Pacific Corporation was incorporated in Utah in 1969 and maintains its principal executive offices at 1400 Douglas Street, Omaha, NE 68179. The telephone number at that address is (402) 544-5000. The common stock of Union Pacific
Corporation is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol “UNP”.

For purposes of this report, unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to “UPC”, “Corporation”, “we”, “us”, and “our” shall
mean Union Pacific Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Union Pacific Railroad Company, which we separately refer to as “UPRR” or the “Railroad”.

Our operating results include Southern Pacific Rail Corporation, which we acquired in October 1996. During
1997, the Railroad acquired an ownership interest in a consortium that was granted a 50-year concession to operate the Pacific-North and Chihuahua Pacific lines in Mexico. The Railroad made an additional investment in the consortium in 1999 and
currently holds a 26% ownership interest. In November 2003, we completed the sale of our entire trucking interest through an underwritten initial public offering of all the common stock of Overnite Corporation, leaving the Railroad as our only
operating segment and the principal source of our revenues.

OPERATIONS

The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable operating segment. Although revenue is
analyzed by commodity, we analyze the net financial results of the Railroad as one segment due to the



integrated nature of the rail network. The Consolidated Financial Statements for 2003 also include our discontinued trucking operations, consisting of
Overnite Transportation Company (OTC) and Motor Cargo Industries, Inc. (Motor Cargo). We reclassified our trucking segment as a discontinued operation in 2003, reflecting the disposition of these assets. Additional information regarding our
operations is presented in Selected Financial Data, Item 6; Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 7; and the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8.

Continuing Operations

– UPRR is a Class I railroad operating in the United States. We have 32,426 route miles, linking Pacific Coast and Gulf Coast ports with the
Midwest and eastern United States gateways and providing several corridors to key Mexican gateways. We serve the western two-thirds of the country and maintain coordinated schedules with other rail carriers to move freight to and from the Atlantic
Coast, the Pacific Coast, the Southeast, the Southwest, Canada, and Mexico. Export and import traffic moves through Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast ports and across the Mexican and Canadian borders. UPRR’s freight traffic consists of bulk,
manifest, and premium business. Bulk traffic is primarily coal, grain, rock, or soda ash in unit trains - trains transporting a single commodity from one source to one destination. Manifest traffic is individual carload or less than train-load
business, including commodities such as lumber, steel, paper, and food. The transportation of finished vehicles and intermodal containers is part of the Railroad’s premium business. In 2005, the Railroad generated commodity revenue totaling $13
billion from the following six commodity groups:

Agricultural

–

Transporting agricultural products, including whole grains, commodities produced from these grains, and food and beverage products, provided 15% of the Railroad’s 2005 commodity revenue. With access to most major grain markets, the
Railroad provides a critical link between the Midwest and western producing areas and export terminals in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) and Gulf ports, as well as Mexico. Unit trains of grain efficiently shuttle between producers and export terminals
or domestic markets. UPRR also serves significant domestic markets, including grain processors, animal feeders, and ethanol producers in the Midwest, West, South, and Rocky Mountain states. Primary food commodities consist of a variety of fresh and
frozen fruits and vegetables, dairy products, and beverages, which are moved to major U.S. population centers for consumption. Express Lane, our premium perishables service that moves fruits and vegetables from the PNW and California with priority
service to destinations in the East, competes with the trucking industry. We transport frozen meat and poultry to the West Coast ports for export, while beverages, primarily beer, enter the U.S. from Mexico.

Automotive

–

UPRR is the largest automotive carrier west
of the Mississippi River, serving seven vehicle assembly plants and distributing imported vehicles from six West Coast ports and Houston. The Railroad off-loads finished vehicles at 38 vehicle distribution centers for delivery by truck to all major
western U.S. cities. In addition to transporting finished vehicles, UPRR provides expedited handling of automobile parts in both boxcars and intermodal containers to several assembly plants, some of which are in Mexico. The Railroad carries
automobile materials bound for assembly plants in Mexico, the U.S., and Canada and transports finished vehicles from manufacturing facilities in Mexico. In 2005, transportation of finished vehicles and automobile materials accounted for 10% of the
Railroad’s total commodity revenue.



Chemicals

– Transporting chemicals provided 14% of UPRR’s 2005 commodity revenue. The
Railroad’s franchise enables it to serve the chemical producing areas along the Gulf Coast, as well as the Rocky Mountain region. More than two-thirds of the chemicals business consists of liquid and dry chemicals, plastics, and liquid
petroleum products. In addition to transporting plastics, customers also leverage UPRR’s industry-leading storage-in-transit yards for intermediate storage of plastic resins. Soda ash shipments originate in southwestern Wyoming and California
and are consumed primarily in glass producing markets in the East, the West, and abroad. Fertilizer movements originate primarily in the Gulf Coast region, as well as the West and Canada, bound for major agricultural users in the Midwest and the
western U.S.

Energy

– Coal transportation
accounted for 20% of UPRR’s 2005 commodity revenue. The Railroad’s geographic network allows it to transport coal destined for utilities and industrial facilities in 27 states, as well as to the Gulf and rail/barge/ship facilities on the
Mississippi and Ohio Rivers and the Great Lakes. UPRR serves mines located in the Southern Powder River Basin of Wyoming (SPRB), Colorado, Utah, southern Wyoming, and southern Illinois. SPRB coal represents the largest growth segment of the market,
as utilities continue to favor its lower cost and low-sulfur content. The Railroad also carries high-BTU, low-sulfur coal from Colorado and Utah for export to Mexico.

Industrial Products

– The Railroad’s extensive network enables the industrial products group to move
numerous commodities between thousands of origin and destination points throughout North America. Lumber shipments originate primarily in the PNW and Canada for destinations throughout the United States for new home construction and repair and
remodeling markets. Commercial and highway construction drive shipments of steel and construction products, consisting of rock, cement, and roofing. Paper and consumer goods, including furniture and appliances, are shipped to major metropolitan
areas for consumers. Nonferrous metals and industrial minerals are moved for industrial manufacturing. In addition, the Railroad provides efficient and safe transportation for government entities and waste companies. In 2005, transporting industrial
products provided 22% of the Railroad’s total commodity revenue.

Intermodal

– UPRR’s intermodal business, which represents 19% of the Railroad’s 2005 commodity revenue, comprises international, domestic, and premium shipments. International business consists of international
container traffic that arrives at West Coast ports via steamship for destinations throughout the United States. Domestic business includes domestic container and trailer traffic for intermodal marketing companies (primarily shipper agents and
consolidators) and truckload carriers. Less-than-truckload and package carriers with time-sensitive business requirements account for the majority of our premium service.

Working Capital

– We currently have, and historically have had, a working capital deficit, which is common in
our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity or financial stability. We maintain adequate resources to meet our daily cash requirements, and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities.

Competition

– We are subject to competition from other railroads,
motor carriers, and barge operators. Our main rail competitor is Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation. Its rail subsidiary, BNSF Railway Company, operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors. In addition, we operate in
corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers. Motor carrier competition is particularly strong for five of our six commodity groups. Because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and Gulf Coast waterways, barge competition can be
particularly effective, especially for grain and bulk commodities. In addition to price competition, we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service. While we must build or acquire and maintain our rail
system, trucks and barges are able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation, or
legislation releasing motor carriers from their size or weight limitations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Equipment Suppliers

– We depend on two key domestic suppliers of locomotives. Due to the capital intensive
nature and sophistication of this equipment, high barriers to entry face potential new suppliers. Therefore, if one



of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives, we could experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the
locomotives that are necessary to our operations.

Employees

– Approximately 87% of our 49,747 full-time-equivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions. Under the collective bargaining round that began on November 1, 1999, all unions reached new labor
agreements with the railroads in 2005. In January 2005, we began the next round of negotiations with the unions. Existing agreements remain in effect and will continue to remain in effect until new agreements are reached or the Railway Labor
Act’s procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods, and the possibility of Presidential intervention) are exhausted. Contract negotiations with the various unions generally take place over an extended period of time, and we rarely
experience work stoppages during negotiations. The current agreements provide for periodic cost of living wage increases until new agreements are reached.

Discontinued Operations

– In November 2003, we completed the sale of our entire trucking interest, and, as a result, included the operations
of OTC and Motor Cargo in discontinued operations (see note 13 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8).

GOVERNMENTAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

Governmental Regulation

– Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local regulations, generally applicable to all
businesses (see also the discussion of certain regulatory proceedings in Legal Proceedings, Item 3).

The operations of the Railroad are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (STB) of the United States
Department of Transportation (DOT) and other federal and state agencies. The operations of the Railroad are also subject to the regulations of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) of the DOT. The STB has jurisdiction over rates charged on
certain regulated rail traffic; freight car compensation; transfer, extension, or abandonment of rail lines; and acquisition of control of rail common carriers.

DOT and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, along with other federal agencies, have jurisdiction over certain aspects of
safety, movement of hazardous materials, movement and disposal of hazardous waste, emissions requirements, and equipment standards. Various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of
hazardous materials in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law.

Environmental Regulation

– We are subject to extensive federal and state environmental statutes and regulations pertaining to public health and the environment. The statutes and regulations are administered and monitored by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and by various state environmental agencies. The primary laws affecting our operations are the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes; the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties; the Clean Air Act, regulating air emissions; and the Clean Water Act, regulating waste water discharges.

Information concerning environmental claims and contingencies
and estimated remediation costs is set forth in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Environmental, Item 7.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

We Must Manage Significant Demand for Our Services on Limited Network Capacity

– Due to continuing demand for rail service and capacity constraints, we may experience network difficulties, including congestion and reduced
velocity, which may compromise the level of service we provide to our customers. This level of demand may compound the impact of weather and weather-related events on our operations and velocity. We recently experienced varying degrees of
disruptions, congestion, and reduced velocity due to a variety of factors, including



significant demand and weather events, and the extensive maintenance and restoration program on the SPRB line that is jointly-owned with BNSF (SPRB Joint
Line). The weather events affected both our operations and operations of certain of our customers. Although we have recovered from these events, further network improvement will be driven by the ongoing redesign of our transportation plan to better
manage traffic on our system and adding more capacity. We cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address any service shortcomings. We also cannot be sure that we will not experience other difficulties related to network
capacity, dramatic and unplanned increases of demand for rail service in one or more of our commodity groups, or other events that could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

We May Be Subject to Various Claims and Lawsuits That Could Result in Significant Expenditures

– The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal
injury, property damage, environmental liability, and other matters. Any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving property damage, personal injury, or environmental liability could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

We Are Subject to Significant Governmental Regulation

– We are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal, state, and local authorities covering a variety of health, safety,
labor, environmental (as discussed below), and other matters. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. Governments may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we
operate without providing us with any recourse for any adverse effects on our business. Economic re-regulation of the rail industry would negatively impact our ability to determine prices for rail services and reduce capital spending on our rail
network, resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Also, some laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses, permits, and other authorizations, and we cannot
guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so. In addition, one or more consolidations of Class I railroads could lead to future re-regulation of the rail industry.

We Are Required to Transport Hazardous Materials –

Federal laws require railroads, including UPRR, to transport
hazardous materials. Any rail accident involving the release of hazardous materials could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury, property damage, and environmental penalties and remediation, which could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

We Are Subject to Significant Environmental Laws and Regulations

– Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things,
emissions to the air; discharges to waters; handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and other materials; and hazardous material or petroleum releases. We generate and transport hazardous and non-hazardous waste in our operations,
and we did so in our former operations. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties, leased properties, and properties owned by third parties, as well as to properties we currently own. Environmental liabilities
have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation. We have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated, or are strictly liable under, these laws or
regulations. We could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing, and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown, or future environmental contamination, which could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Severe Weather Could Result in Significant Business Interruptions and Expenditures

– Severe weather conditions, events, and other natural phenomena, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods,
extreme temperatures, and significant precipitation may cause business interruptions, including line outages on our rail network, that can adversely affect our entire rail network, and result in increased costs, increased liabilities, and decreased
revenues, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Rising Fuel Costs Could Materially and Adversely Affect Our Business

– Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses. Diesel fuel prices are subject to
dramatic fluctuations. Significant price increases may



have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Additionally, international, political, and economic circumstances affect fuel prices and supplies.
Weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity. If a fuel supply shortage were to arise from OPEC production curtailments, a disruption of oil imports, or other causes, higher fuel prices could, despite our fuel surcharge
programs, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

The Majority of Our Employees Belong to Labor Unions, and Labor Agreements, Strikes, or Work Stoppages Could Adversely Affect Our Operations

– We are a party to collective bargaining
agreements with various labor unions. Under the collective bargaining round that began on November 1, 1999, all unions reached new labor agreements with the railroads in 2005. In January 2005, we began the next round of negotiations with the
unions. Disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages, or other slowdowns by the affected workers. If
unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, or other employees were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs, either of which could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Additionally, future national labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, could compromise our service
reliability and significantly increase our costs for healthcare, wages, and other benefits, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

The Availability of Qualified Personnel Could Adversely Affect Our
Operations

– Changes in demographics, training requirements, and the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and trainmen, could negatively impact our ability to meet demand for rail service. Unpredictable increases in
demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and
liquidity.

We Face Competition from Other Railroads and
Other Transportation Providers

– We face competition from other railroads, motor carriers and, to a lesser extent, ships, barges, and pipelines. In addition to price competition, we face competition with respect to transit times and quality
and reliability of service. While we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system, trucks and barges are able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality
or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation, or legislation releasing motor carriers from their size or weight limitations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
Additionally, any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect the competitive environment in which we operate.

We Utilize Capital Markets

– We rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements, including the issuance of commercial
paper from time to time and the sale of certain of our receivables. Market instability or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to commercial paper and reduce our credit
ratings below investment grade, which would prohibit us from utilizing our sale of receivables program and significantly increase the cost of issuing debt.

We May Be Affected by General Economic Conditions

– Prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions affecting the
producers and consumers of the commodities carried by us may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

We Are Dependent on Two Key Domestic Suppliers of Locomotives

– Due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive
equipment, high barriers to entry face potential new suppliers. Therefore, if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives, we could experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives
that are necessary to our operations.

We Rely on Technology
and Technology Improvements in our Business Operations

– We rely on information technology in all aspects of our business. If we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are



unable to implement new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of
transportation service, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Additionally, if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology
systems, including computer hardware, software, and communications equipment, we could experience a service interruption, safety failure, or security breach, or other operational difficulties, which could have a material adverse impact on our
results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

We May Be Affected by Acts of Terrorism, War, or Risk of War

– Our rail lines, facilities, and equipment, including rail cars carrying hazardous materials, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks.
Terrorist attacks, or other similar events, any government response thereto, and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In addition, insurance premiums for some or all of our current
coverages could increase dramatically, or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future.

Properties

With operations in 23 states, we employ a variety of assets in the management and operation of our rail business. These assets include real estate, track and track structure, equipment, and facilities. We own and lease real estate that we
use in our operations, and we also own real estate that is not required for our business, which we sell from time to time. Our equipment includes owned and leased locomotives and rail cars; heavy maintenance equipment and machinery; other equipment
and tools in our shops, offices and facilities; and vehicles for maintenance, transportation of crews, and other activities. We operate numerous facilities, including terminals for intermodal and other freight; rail yards for train-building,
switching, storage-in-transit (the temporary storage of customer goods in rail cars prior to shipment) and other activities; offices to administer and manage our operations; dispatch centers to direct traffic on our rail network; crew quarters to
house train crews along our network; and shops and other facilities for fueling, maintenance, and repair of locomotives and repair and maintenance of rail cars and other equipment. We spent approximately $2.2 billion in cash capital during 2005 for,
among other things, building and maintaining track, structures and infrastructure, upgrading and augmenting equipment, and implementing new technologies (see the capital expenditures table in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financial Condition, Item 7).

Certain of our properties are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment (see
discussion of environmental issues in Business – Governmental and Environmental Regulation, Item 1, and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies –
Environmental, Item 7).

Legal Proceedings

Environmental Matters

As we reported in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2003, the United States Attorney for the Central District of California notified the Railroad that the office intended to pursue criminal charges against us for alleged violations of federal environmental laws,
including the federal Clean Water Act, in connection with releases of oil contaminated wastewater from our Taylor Yard in 2001 and 2003. In April 2004, the Railroad settled the State of California’s claims arising from these releases for
$45,020.

As we reported in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for 2003, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) threatened civil prosecution against us in November 2003, after a series of protracted negotiations, relating to our failure to register as a hazardous waste
transporter under California law from April 2000 to August 2001. We contend that we are exempt from the registration requirements due to federal preemption. The DTSC proposed civil penalties of $125,160 for the alleged violation. We settled this
matter on September 14, 2005 for $55,000.

As we reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2001, on January 30, 2002, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) issued to the Railroad a notice of a proposed penalty assessment in the amount of $195,700. The
proposed penalty relates to the derailment of one of our trains carrying hazardous materials near Eunice, Louisiana, on May 27, 2000. We met with the LDEQ regarding this matter to demonstrate that no penalty should be assessed. On
December 28, 2005, the LDEQ amended the proposed penalty to $47,113.

As we reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, the San Joaquin County District Attorney filed an action against the Railroad on February 3, 2003, in the San Joaquin
County Superior Court alleging claims under the California Business and Professions Code section 17200 (unfair business practices), Fish and Game Code section 5650 and 5650.1, California Health and Safety Code section 25189(d), and Public Nuisance,
California Civil Code section 3480. The claims arise from a February 16, 2000, derailment in Stockton, California, in which a locomotive struck an object on the tracks, puncturing a fuel tank.



The District Attorney alleged that diesel fuel from this spill entered waters of the State of California. The complaint also asserted claims under the above
referenced statutes for any other diesel spill that may have occurred in the State of California between 2000 and 2003, in which diesel may have passed into waters of the State of California. It sought injunctive relief and civil penalties of
$25,000 for the alleged February 16, 2000, diesel spill and total penalties of not less than $250,000 for all diesel spills that may have occurred since 2000. The District Attorney filed an amended complaint on April 10, 2003, which
narrowed the claims to the incident of February 16, 2000. The amended complaint seeks both injunctive relief and daily penalties for each day that fuel was in the affected waterway, which could exceed $100,000.

As we reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2003,
the District Attorneys of Merced, Madera, and Stanislaus Counties in California filed a criminal case against the Railroad relating to a series of alleged releases of calcium oxide (lime). The criminal case was dismissed in the last quarter of 2003
and was subsequently refiled as a civil action by several counties in the San Joaquin County Superior Court. The refiled suit sought civil penalties against the Railroad in connection with the release of lime from an unidentified rail car between
Chowchilla and Sacramento, California, on December 27, 2001, and another incident in which lime leaked from a rail car between Chowchilla and Stockton, California, on February 21, 2002. The suit contended that regulatory violations
occurred by virtue of the Railroad’s alleged failure to timely report the release of a “hazardous material,” its alleged disposal of hazardous waste, and the alleged release of material into the waters of the State of California. On
September 20, 2004, the Court dismissed the suit with prejudice. The State appealed this decision and the appeal remains pending.

As we reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, the Illinois Attorney General’s
office filed an Agreed Order and Complaint and a Complaint for Injunctive and Other Relief on October 7, 2004, in the Circuit Court for the Twentieth Judicial Circuit (St. Clair County) against The Alton & Southern Railway Company, a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Railroad, as a result of a collision and derailment on September 21, 2004. The state seeks to enjoin The Alton & Southern from further violations, as well as a monetary penalty. The amount of the proposed
penalty is uncertain but could exceed $100,000.

In 2001 we received information indicating EPA considered the Railroad a potentially responsible party for the Omaha Lead Site. The Omaha Lead Site consists of approximately 12,800 acres of residential property in the eastern part of Omaha,
Nebraska, allegedly impacted by air emissions from two former lead smelters/refineries. One refinery was operated by ASARCO. EPA identified the Railroad as a potentially responsible party, because more than 60 years ago, we owned land that was
leased to ASARCO. The Railroad disputes both the legal and technical base for EPA’s allegations. It has nonetheless engaged in extensive negotiations with EPA. These negotiations have reached an apparent impasse. EPA issued a Unilateral
Administrative Order with an effective date of December 16, 2005, directing the Railroad to implement an interim remedy at the site at an estimated cost of $50 million. Failure to comply with the order without just cause could subject the
Railroad to penalties of up to $32,500 per day and triple EPA’s costs in performing the work. The Railroad believes it has just cause not to comply with the order, but it offered to perform some of the work specified in the order as a
compromise. If EPA rejects the offer, the Railroad will vigorously contest liability and the imposition of any penalties.

On December 12, 2005, the Illinois Attorney General’s office filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for the Twenty-First
Judicial Circuit (St. Clair County) seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties against the Railroad relating to a collision between UPRR and Norfolk Southern (NS) trains near Momence, Illinois, on November 24, 2005. The collision derailed
approximately five locomotives and 30 railcars. Two of the UPRR locomotives and two of the NS locomotives caught fire and four of the locomotives released approximately 16,000 gallons of diesel fuel. Other cars carrying food products derailed and
released an unknown amount of product. The Railroad promptly responded and remediation is ongoing. The State seeks a permanent injunction against the Railroad ordering UPRR to continue remediation. The State seeks to enjoin UPRR from further
violations and a monetary penalty. The amount of the proposed penalty is uncertain.

The Illinois Attorney General’s office filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for the Twentieth Judicial Circuit (St. Clair County) for injunctive and other relief on November 28, 2005,
against the Railroad, alleging a diesel fuel



spill from an above-ground storage tank for storm water with a secondary containment area in a railyard in Dupo, St. Clair County, Illinois. The State seeks
to enjoin UPRR from further violations and a monetary penalty. The amount of the proposed penalty is uncertain.

On October 25, 2005, the State of Washington Department of Ecology notified us that it had assessed a $106,000 penalty against the
Railroad as a result of a November 15, 2003, incident near Kelso, Washington. In that incident, one of our trains collided with a BNSF train, derailing three of our locomotives. The Department of Ecology contends that diesel fuel and lube oil
from the derailed locomotives entered waters of the State of Washington. We have asked the state to reconsider the penalty amount.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District (the District) issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to UPRR on or about August 20,
2003, and November 2, 2003, asserting that we violated our air permit relating to locomotive diesel fueling at our Dolores Yard in Carson, California, by dispensing fuel in excess of permit limits over the course of 21 months. The District
proposed that we pay $105,000 to settle this NOV. We settled this matter and others in July 2005 for $78,000 as part of a group of alleged violations.

We received notices from EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are or may be liable under federal or state environmental
laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the United States, including sites on the Superfund National Priorities List or state superfund lists. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits because of the number
of potentially responsible parties involved, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs.

Information concerning environmental claims and contingencies
and estimated remediation costs is set forth in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Environmental, Item 7.

Other Matters

As we reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, we were notified that a

qui tam

, or private citizen, complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against, among other parties, the City of Long Beach, City of Long Beach Harbor Department, Port of Long Beach (the
Port), Union Pacific Corporation, Union Pacific Railroad Company, and Union Pacific Resources Company, also known as Union Pacific Resources Group Inc. (Resources), a former subsidiary of UPC. A private citizen filed the action because the federal
government and the State of California elected not to pursue the claims. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the Federal Civil False Claims Act and the California False Claims Act by conspiring to use public funds to (1) shift
environmental cleanup liability to the Port when Resources sold its Terminal Island oil field property to the Port in 1994 and (2) effect the acquisition by the Port of the Terminal Island property in which the Port (or the State of California)
allegedly already held certain incidents of title. The complaint, which has not been served on us, seeks damages of $2.405 billion, unspecified costs for remediating groundwater contamination, and triple damages and civil penalties of $10,000 per
day. The plaintiff’s extended time to serve the complaint expired on April 4, 2005, and the Corporation filed a motion to dismiss for plaintiff’s failure to make timely service. However, the Court extended the plaintiff’s time to
provide service. On December 7, 2005, we learned that a summons for service of the Complaint had been issued, but we have not been sued. We dispute the factual and legal bases of the complaint. We notified Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
(Anadarko), as successor to Resources after its acquisition in 2000, that an indemnification agreement between Resources and the Corporation obligates Anadarko to indemnify us for all damages, costs, and expenses related to the complaint.

As we reported in a report on Form 8-K filed
on April 12, 2005, we received a complaint in a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit, which names as defendants all the current directors and one former director of the Corporation. The complaint, filed in state court in Salt Lake County,
Utah, on April 4, 2005, alleges that the director defendants breached their fiduciary duty to the Corporation and its shareholders by, among other things,



disregarding problems relating to railroad safety; compliance with governmental regulations, including reporting requirements with respect to rail accidents;
and the handling of evidence in rail accident cases. The complaint contends that, as a consequence of such alleged breach of duty, the Corporation suffered substantial monetary losses and other injuries and seeks, among other things, an award of
compensatory damages, other non-monetary remedies and relief, and the plaintiff’s reasonable expenses and attorneys’ fees.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and applicable notes to the Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data, Item 8, and other information in this report, including Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A and Critical Accounting Policies and Cautionary Information at the end of this Item 7.

The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail
affiliates, is our one reportable operating segment. Although revenue is analyzed by commodity, we analyze the net financial results of the Railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of the rail network. The Consolidated Financial
Statements in 2003 also include discontinued trucking operations, consisting of OTC and Motor Cargo, which were subsidiaries of Overnite, Inc., formerly an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of UPC. In 2003, we reclassified our trucking operations as
discontinued operations.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

2005 Results

·

Safety

– We experienced mixed safety results during 2005. While the overall employee injury incident rate per 200,000 man-hours decreased, the lost
workday case rate increased by 1%. The number of derailments declined 8%, and associated costs declined 12%. These improvements reflect our use of technology such as train simulators and improved training and testing programs. In the area of public
safety, we closed 400 grade crossings to reduce exposure and installed 750 video cameras in locomotives to better analyze grade crossing incidents. The number of grade crossing incidents, however, increased 9% during the year, driven in part by the
combination of increasing highway and rail traffic.

·

Commodity Revenue Growth

– Our commodity revenues grew 11% year-over-year to $13 billion, the highest level in our history, as continued economic
growth led to unprecedented demand for our services. We achieved record revenue levels in all of our six commodity groups, primarily driven by fuel surcharges and better pricing. By year-end, we repriced approximately 55% of our business in the
current market of significant transportation demand. Although volume increased 1% to record levels in 2005, weather-related disruptions limited volume growth.

·

Network Improvement

– We continued to address the resource shortages that led to operational challenges throughout 2004 by aggressive hiring and
training of train crews, along with the acquisition of locomotives and freight cars through both long- and short-term leasing programs. In 2005, network operations improved in spite of significant weather-related challenges. We handled record
volumes and maintained velocity by strengthening our operational recoverability. We began implementing the Unified Plan in 2005, streamlining the automotive, manifest, and intermodal transportation plans by eliminating switching and work events.
Through the year we reduced our rate of train stops by 16% and achieved a 12% reduction of our car switching rate. Productivity improved, as demonstrated by a 6% lower average terminal dwell time, a 2.5% improvement in car utilization, and a 2.4%
decrease in the fuel consumption rate. Additionally, we piloted an operational productivity initiative called CIMS (Customer Inventory Management System). CIMS complements the Unified Plan by reducing the number of cars in our terminals. We also
expanded capacity and continued to use industrial engineering techniques to further improve network fluidity, ease capacity constraints, and improve asset utilization.



·

Significant Weather Events

– In 2005, we faced a year filled with significant weather-related challenges:

·

Fuel Prices

– Fuel prices increased dramatically in 2005, raising our average system fuel price by 45% and adding $740 million of operating expenses
compared to 2004. Fuel prices soared in the latter part of the year, as crude oil prices topped out over $70 per barrel in September, compounded by high diesel conversion spreads and large, regional spreads resulting from refinery shutdowns
following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Prices decreased slightly in November and December, but to levels considerably higher than 2004. Although we had no fuel hedges in place in 2005, our fuel surcharge programs helped mitigate the impact of these
higher fuel prices. Our fuel surcharge programs allow us to recover from customers a portion of the increase in fuel expense in the form of higher revenue. In addition, our fuel conservation efforts allowed us to handle a 1% increase in gross ton
miles while burning 2% less fuel.

·

Free Cash Flow

– Cash generated by operating activities totaled a record $2.6 billion, yielding free cash flow of $234 million in 2005. Free cash
flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities, less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid.



Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC Regulation G. We
believe free cash flow is important in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financings. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, cash
provided by operating activities. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure):

2006 Outlook

·

Safety

– Operating a safe railroad benefits our employees, our customers, and the public. Our 2006 employee safety program addresses the key drivers
of 2005 performance. The large number of new employees and managers will be trained, tested, and participate in quality assurance activities. We continue to apply technology to enhance safety. From a public safety standpoint, we will continue our
efforts to upgrade and close crossings, install video cameras on locomotives, and educate the public on crossing safety, along with other activities. We will continue our derailment prevention efforts, emphasizing the use of key factor analysis.

·

Commodity Revenue Growth

– We expect record revenue levels to continue in 2006 based on current economic indicators, forecasted demand, and the
opportunity to reprice 13% of our business. We have established a target for year-over-year commodity revenue growth over 10% percent. We are projecting yield increases in all of our major commodity groups and we intend to manage total volume growth
to 3% in an effort to improve returns. Volume growth is expected to occur in the energy, intermodal, and industrial products commodity groups.

·

Transportation Plan

– In 2005, we continued to implement the Unified Plan, which streamlined segments of our transportation plan. In 2006, we will
continue to evaluate traffic flows and network logistic patterns to identify additional opportunities to simplify operations and improve network efficiency. We plan to maintain adequate manpower and locomotives, improve productivity using industrial
engineering techniques, and improve our operating margins.

·

Fuel Prices

– We expect that fuel prices will remain high, with crude oil prices hovering in the range of $60 to $65 per barrel throughout the year.
To reduce the impact of fuel price on earnings, we will continue to increase the amount of traffic subject to fuel surcharge programs.

·

Capital Plan

– In 2006, we expect our cash capital expenditures to be approximately $2.2 billion and the net present value of additional long-term
operating leases to be approximately $500 million. These expenditures will be used to maintain track and structures, continue capacity expansions on our main lines in constrained corridors, remove bottlenecks, upgrade and augment equipment to better
meet customer needs, build and improve facilities and terminals, and develop and implement new technologies. Major capital projects in 2006 include expanding double track on the Sunset Corridor; continuing enhancements on the SPRB Joint Line;
improving the freight car terminal infrastructure in San Antonio, Dallas/Fort Worth, and Houston; and continuing installation of centralized track control across Iowa. We expect to fund our 2006 cash capital expenditures through cash generated from
operations, the sale or lease of various operating and



non-operating properties, and cash on hand at December 31, 2005. This focused capital plan will help us improve network velocity and facilitate revenue
growth.

·

Financial Expectations

– We anticipate revenue growth and continued network improvement in 2006, and financial results should exceed 2005 levels. Our
expectations include generating diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.60 to $4.80 and improving our operating ratio by 2.5 to 3.0 percentage points compared to 2005. Free cash flow for the year should exceed $300 million. Our free cash flow
target reflects approximately $450 to $500 million of higher cash tax payments resulting from the impact of higher cash tax rates and higher expected earnings.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Operating Revenue

Operating revenue
includes commodity revenue and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of revenue earned by our subsidiaries, revenue from our commuter rail operations, and accessorial revenue, which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or
controlled by the Railroad. We recognize commodity revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis as freight moves from origin to destination. We allocate commodity revenue between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting
period with expenses recognized as incurred. We recognize other revenue as service is performed or contractual obligations are met.

Commodity revenue improved in all six business groups during 2005, with double-digit growth in the agricultural, industrial products, and
intermodal commodity groups. Fuel surcharges, price increases, and index-based contract escalators, which are formulas in our shipping contracts that correlate price adjustments to certain economic indexes, all contributed to higher average revenue
per car (ARC). In 2005, our fuel surcharge programs generated $1 billion in commodity revenue, which represents approximately 74% of the additional expense incurred above the base fuel price for our fuel surcharge programs (currently, $0.75 per
gallon). Although volume grew 1% for the year, the severe weather and maintenance and restoration on the SPRB Joint Line constrained volume growth.

The commodity revenue increase in 2004 was driven by growth in the industrial products, intermodal and chemical groups. Fuel surcharges,
price increases, and index-based contract escalators contributed to the increase in ARC. In 2004, our fuel surcharge programs generated $330 million in commodity revenue, which represented 52% of the additional expense incurred above the base fuel
price of $0.75 per gallon. ARC improved 3% to $1,236, while revenue carloads increased 2%.

Subsidiary and accessorial revenue increased other revenue in 2005, mainly driven by higher volumes. In addition, we generated higher subsidiary revenue due to the acquisition of our joint
venture partner’s interest in Bay Pacific Financial L.L.C. (Bay Pacific), an intermodal equipment leasing entity. Passenger and subsidiary revenue increased other revenue in 2004, although accessorial revenue declined.



The following tables summarize the year-over-year changes in commodity revenue, revenue
carloads, and average revenue per car by commodity type.







Mexico Business
–

Each commodity group discussed above includes revenue from shipments to and from Mexico, which increased 15% to $1.1 billion in 2005 compared to 2004. Revenue growth resulted primarily from price increases and fuel surcharges. Carloads
were flat versus 2004, as fewer auto parts, energy, and intermodal shipments offset higher agricultural and industrial shipments.

In 2004, revenue grew 9% to $970 million, resulting from increased volume in the industrial products, intermodal, chemical, and automotive
business groups, particularly cement, newsprint and wood fiber, liquid and dry chemicals, soda ash, and automotive materials. Revenue generated from agricultural shipments also improved due to higher wheat exports and beer imports. Lower export
shipments of corn and feed grains, as well as reduced energy carloads, partially offset the increases.



Operating Expenses

Operating expenses increased $863 million in 2005 versus 2004. Excluding the asbestos charge of $247 million (pre-tax) in 2004,
operating expenses increased $1.1 billion, or 10%. Significantly higher locomotive fuel prices accounted for $740 million of this increase (our fuel surcharge programs helped offset these expenses in the form of higher revenue). Inflation in wages,
benefits, materials, and services, as well as a larger workforce, resulted in most of the additional increase. Also driving higher operating expenses were increased contract services and clean-up and restoration costs associated with the West Coast
storm in January.

Higher fuel
prices, the asbestos charge of $247 million (pre-tax), higher crew and asset utilization costs resulting from slower network velocity, and volume-related costs all contributed to higher operating expenses in 2004. Expenses were also negatively
impacted by wage and benefit inflation, training expenses associated with hiring additional trainmen, increased depreciation expense, and higher casualty costs. A jury verdict upheld against the Railroad in 2004 for a 1998 crossing accident and a
derailment in San Antonio, Texas, increased casualty costs. Slower network velocity and service difficulties, and increased hiring and training efforts added approximately $300 million in operating expenses during 2004.

Salaries, Wages,
and Employee Benefits

– Several factors drove higher employment expenses in 2005. General wage and benefit inflation continued to increase expenses, reflecting higher salaries and wages and the year-over-year impact of higher healthcare and
other benefits costs. We also incurred higher expenses for management bonuses in 2005, as executive bonuses were not awarded for 2004 and bonuses for the professional workforce were significantly reduced. A 3% increase in our workforce and higher
demand during the year also contributed to the increases. Additionally, labor expenses, in the form of higher train crew costs and labor incurred for repair and clean-up activities, increased due to the hurricanes in the third quarter and the West
Coast storm in the first quarter. Reduced severance and relocation costs, increased network efficiency, and reduced training expenses



partially offset these increases. Transferring various support personnel to Omaha, Nebraska, resulted in higher severance and relocation costs in 2004.

The increase in 2004 also resulted from a
number of factors, including higher wages and training expenses associated with hiring additional trainmen, increased crew costs due to slower network velocity, inflation, volume-related expenses, and severance and relocation costs. Because we did
not award executive bonuses for 2004, lower performance-based compensation expense for management partially offset these increases. Lower protection costs also offset these increased expenses. Protection cost represents the differential payment when
the wage earned for active employment is lower than an employee’s “protected” rate of pay. The STB mandates protected rates for employees adversely affected by a merger, and collective bargaining agreements with our labor unions also
establish these rates. Finally, a smaller non-transportation workforce yielded cost savings during the year.

Fuel and Utilities

Fuel and utilities
include locomotive fuel, utilities other than telephone, and gasoline and other fuels. Higher diesel fuel prices, which averaged $1.77 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2005 compared to $1.22 per gallon in 2004, increased
expenses by $740 million. A 1% increase in gross ton-miles resulted in $8 million of additional expenses. We offset $39 million of these increases with a 2% improvement in our consumption rate in 2005 versus 2004. The Railroad had no fuel hedges in
place during 2005, and has none in place for 2006. Gasoline, utilities, and propane expenses increased $37 million in 2005 versus 2004 due to higher prices.

The increase in 2004 compared to 2003 was driven by higher diesel fuel prices, which averaged $1.22 per gallon and $0.92 per gallon in
2004 and 2003, respectively (including taxes and transportation costs), and higher gallons consumed. Higher fuel prices contributed $416 million to the increase; however, we recovered approximately 52% of these costs through our fuel surcharge
programs, which were included in operating revenues. The increase in gross ton-miles in 2004 drove consumption higher, resulting in an additional $24 million in fuel expense for the year. The Railroad hedged approximately 9% of its fuel usage in
2004, which decreased fuel costs by $14 million. Gasoline, utilities, and propane expenses increased $13 million in 2004 due to higher prices.

Equipment and Other Rents

– Equipment and other rents includes primarily rental expense the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other
railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases; other specialty equipment leases; and office and other rentals. In 2005, the number of leased locomotives and freight cars increased, resulting in additional lease
expenses. Higher carloads also increased 2005 expenses. Improved car-cycle times partially offset these increases reflecting increased network efficiency, which lowered our short-term freight car rental expense.

Expenses increased in 2004 due to carload volume growth and
longer car cycle times, resulting in higher expenses for locomotive and car rentals. Higher locomotive expense included additional costs associated with leasing short-term, or surge, locomotive power, which is more costly than long-term locomotive
leases, and the increased leasing of new locomotives.

Depreciation

– The majority of depreciation relates to track structure, including rail, ties, and other track material. A higher depreciable asset base, reflecting higher capital spending in recent years, increased our
depreciation expense in 2005 and 2004.



Materials and Supplies

– Materials used to maintain the Railroad’s lines, structures,
and equipment are the principal components of materials and supplies expense. This expense item also includes small tools, office supplies, other materials, and the costs of freight services to ship Railroad supplies and materials. During 2005,
materials and supplies expense increased, primarily due to locomotive and freight car maintenance. We used more repair materials to maintain a larger fleet of locomotives, including a growing number of units not covered by warranties. Additionally,
we incurred higher costs for car wheel sets, traction motors, and lube oil. Conversely, we incurred lower freight charges for shipping Railroad materials and stationary and office supplies.

We incurred higher expenses in 2004 due to increased use of
locomotive repair materials required to maintain a larger fleet that includes older units not covered by warranties. We also performed more freight car repairs, incurred higher materials costs, and experienced increased freight charges for shipment
of Railroad material.

Casualty Costs

– Personal
injury expense, freight and property damage, insurance, and environmental costs are the primary components of casualty costs. Casualty costs in 2005 were lower than the previous year primarily due to higher expenses incurred in 2004 for an asbestos
charge, a costly derailment near San Antonio, and a large jury verdict – affirmed in 2004 – for a 1998 crossing accident. Lower freight and property damage expense and lower costs for destruction of foreign or leased equipment also reduced
casualty costs. Conversely, we incurred higher insurance costs and increased costs for third-party personal injuries related to long-term environmental exposures.

In 2004, costs rose due to the asbestos charge of $247 million (pre-tax), a costly derailment near San
Antonio, and a large jury verdict – affirmed in 2004 – for a 1998 crossing accident. Partially offsetting these increases were lower insurance expenses and reduced personal injury expense, which resulted from lower than anticipated
settlement costs and fewer employee injuries in 2004 than previously assumed.

Purchased Services and Other Costs

– Purchased services and other costs include the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, state and local taxes, net costs of operating facilities jointly
used by UPRR and other railroads, transportation and lodging for train crew employees, trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers, leased automobile maintenance expenses, telephone and cellular phone expense, employee travel expense,
and computer and other general expenses. Expenses decreased in 2005 versus 2004 because we incurred higher relocation costs associated with moving support personnel to Omaha, Nebraska during 2004. In 2005, we experienced higher volume-related costs
for freight car and locomotive contract maintenance and crew transportation and lodging. Although our intermodal carloadings increased over 4% in 2005, costs for trucking services provided by intermodal carriers remained flat as we substantially
reduced expenses associated with network inefficiencies. Higher diesel fuel prices increased sales and use taxes in 2005, which resulted in higher state and local taxes. Other contract services increased in 2005. The 2005 January West Coast
storm and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita also contributed to higher expenses in 2005 (net of insurance reimbursements received).

In 2004, higher locomotive contract maintenance services, state and local taxes, and relocation costs drove expenses higher. In addition,
we incurred increased trucking expenses for intermodal carriers and crew transportation costs due to slower network velocity and additional volume.

– Other income increased in 2005 largely as a result of higher gains from real
estate sales partially offset by higher expenses due to rising interest rates associated with our sale of receivables program. In addition, other income in 2004 included income recognized from the sale of a technology subsidiary’s assets.

Other income improved in 2004 due to higher
costs in 2003 associated with premium payments for early retirement of $1.5 billion of Convertible Preferred Securities (CPS) and income recognized in 2004 from the sale of assets of a technology subsidiary. These were partially offset by lower
gains from real estate sales in 2004 compared to 2003.

Interest Expense

– Lower interest expense in 2005 and 2004 was primarily due to declining weighted-average debt levels of $7.8 billion, $8.1 billion, and $8.9 billion in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Our effective interest
rate was 6.5% in both 2005 and 2004, compared to 6.4% in 2003.

Income Taxes

– Income taxes were greater in 2005 due to higher 2005 pre-tax income, which was partially offset by a previously reported reduction in income tax expense. In our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
June 30, 2005, we reported that the Corporation had undertaken an analysis of the impact that final settlements of tax liabilities for pre-1995 tax years with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had on previously recorded estimates of deferred
tax assets and liabilities. The completed analysis of the final settlements for pre-1995 tax years, along with IRS Examination Reports for tax years 1995 through 2002 were considered, among other things, in a review and re-evaluation of the
Corporation’s estimated deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2005, resulting in an income tax expense reduction of $118 million in 2005.

Income tax expense decreased in 2004, driven by lower pre-tax income, a reduction in the deferred state
income tax liability primarily attributable to relocating support operations to Omaha, Nebraska, state income tax credits earned in connection with the new headquarters building in Omaha, and an increase in foreign tax credits resulting from the
passage of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On November 5, 2003, we completed the sale of our
entire trucking interest. In 2003, revenue and income from discontinued operations were $1.2 billion and $255 million, respectively. Income from discontinued operations in 2003 included the net gain from the sale of our trucking interest of $211
million, including an income tax benefit of $126 million.

OPERATING AND
FINANCIAL STATISTICS

Railroad Performance Measures

We report key Railroad performance measures weekly to the American
Association of Railroads, including carloads, average daily inventory of rail cars on our system, average train speed, and average terminal dwell time. This operating data is available on our website at www.up.com/investors/reports/index.shtml.

Operating Statistics



Average Train Speed

– Average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours
operated on our main lines between terminals. In 2005, the West Coast storm, disruptions on the SPRB Joint Line, business interruptions caused by Hurricane Rita, and the Kansas washouts in October hampered efforts to improve our average train speed.
In 2004, unprecedented demand for our services and crew and locomotive shortages negatively impacted operational efficiency and average train speed.

Average Terminal Dwell Time

– Average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals. Lower average terminal
dwell time is favorable. The 6% improvement in dwell time in 2005 resulted from strategic network management initiatives and efforts to more timely deliver rail cars to our interchange partners and customers. Record demand levels and operational
challenges experienced in 2004 affected network performance including average terminal dwell time.

Gross and Revenue Ton-Miles

– Gross ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded or empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled. Revenue ton-miles are based on
tariff miles and do not include the weight of freight cars. In 2005, gross and revenue ton-miles grew 1% and 0.5%, in relation to a 1% increase of carloadings. Gross and revenue ton-miles increased 2% and 3% respectively in 2004, with 2% growth of
carloadings during the same period. The increase in gross and revenue ton-miles was also positively impacted by volume growth experienced in the higher density commodity groups of industrial products and chemicals, combined with a minimal increase
in automotive carloads, which is a lower density commodity.

Average Full-Time Equivalent Employees

– The 2005 increase includes the addition of employees needed to complete increased track repair and replacement programs, more train crew personnel both to handle the increased demand and
to improve service, and the hiring of operations management personnel, including an expanded management training program. The 2004 average number of full-time equivalent employees increased as we added train crew personnel, who were hired to handle
increased customer demand and improve service. These additions were partially offset by increased productivity in the non-transportation functions, employee attrition, and fewer employees at our technology subsidiaries.

Other Financial Statistics

Debt to
Capital/Lease Adjusted Debt to Capital

– Debt to capital is computed by dividing total debt by total debt plus equity. Lease adjusted debt to capital is derived by dividing total debt plus the net present value of operating leases by total
debt plus equity plus the net present value of operating leases. We believe these measures are important in managing our capital structure to allow efficient access to the debt market while minimizing our cost of capital. In 2005, our debt to
capital ratio improved due to a $715 million reduction in our debt level and an increase in equity resulting from earnings. Our lease adjusted debt to capital improved to a lesser extent due to an increase in the present value of operating leases,
which were approximately $3.2 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, using a discount rate of 8%.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of December 31, 2005, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents, the sale of receivables, and our revolving credit
facilities, as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets. We had $2 billion of credit facilities available, of which there were no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2005. The
sale of receivables program is subject to certain requirements, including the maintenance of an investment grade bond rating. If our bond rating were to deteriorate, it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. The value of the outstanding
undivided interest held by investors under the



program was $600 million as of December 31, 2005. Access to commercial paper is dependent on market conditions. Deterioration of our operating results
or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of liquidity. Liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a working capital
deficit of $1,059 million and $226 million, respectively. A working capital deficit is common in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. We maintain adequate resources to meet our daily cash requirements, and we have sufficient
financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities.

Financial Condition

Cash Provided by
Operating Activities

– Higher income, lower management incentive payments in 2005 (executive bonuses, which would have been paid to individuals in 2005, were not awarded based on company performance in 2004 and bonuses for the professional
workforce were significantly reduced), and working capital performance generated higher cash from operating activities in 2005. A voluntary pension contribution of $100 million in 2004 also augmented the positive year-over-year variance. This
improvement was partially offset by cash received in 2004 for income tax refunds. Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2004 driven by lower income from continuing operations, the pension contribution, and cash from discontinued
operations recognized in 2003, which were partially offset by working capital performance.

Cash Used in Investing Activities

– Increased capital spending, partially offset by higher proceeds from asset sales, increased the amount of cash used in investing activities in 2005. The comparative
increase in 2004 primarily resulted from the beneficial impact of the $620 million received in 2003 for the sale of our trucking interest, which reduced cash used in investing activities in 2003. The permanent financing of locomotives and freight
cars under long-term operating leases (as referenced in the Operating Lease Activities section in this Item 7) had no impact on investing cash flows during the period as all financings were completed in 2005.

Cash Used in Financing Activities

– The increase in cash used in
financing activities results from no cash inflows from the issuance of debt in 2005 (compared to $745 million in 2004) and higher debt repayments ($699 million in 2005 compared to $588 million in 2004), partially offset by higher net proceeds from
equity compensation plans ($262 million in 2005 compared to $80 million in 2004). The decrease in 2004 resulted from lower debt repayments of $588 million in 2004 compared to $2.1 billion in 2003 (including $1.5 billion of CPS), partially offset by
a decrease in net proceeds from equity compensation plans ($80 million in 2004 compared to $216 million in 2003) and higher dividend payments ($310 million in 2004 compared to $234 million in 2003) due to the increase of our dividend rate from $0.99
per share in 2003 to $1.20 per share in 2004.



The table below details cash capital expenditures for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004, and 2003, including non-cash capital lease financings of $188 million in 2003. There were no non-cash capital lease financings in 2005 or 2004.

In
2006, we expect our cash capital expenditures to be approximately $2.2 billion. Additionally, we expect to enter into long-term operating leases for equipment with a net present value of approximately $500 million. These expenditures will be used to
maintain track and structures, continue capacity expansions on our main lines in constrained corridors, remove bottlenecks, upgrade and augment equipment to better meet customer needs, build and improve facilities and terminals, and develop and
implement new technologies. We expect to fund our 2006 cash capital expenditures through cash generated from operations, the sale or lease of various operating and non-operating properties, and cash on hand at December 31, 2005. We expect that
these sources will continue to provide sufficient funds to meet our expected capital requirements for 2006.

For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 2.9, 2.1, and 3.2, respectively.
The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis. Earnings represent income from continuing operations, less equity earnings net of distributions, plus fixed charges and income taxes. Fixed charges represent interest
charges, amortization of debt discount, and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges.

Financing Activities

Credit Facilities

– On December 31, 2005, we had $2 billion in revolving credit facilities available, including $1 billion under a five-year facility expiring in March 2010 and
$1 billion under a five-year facility expiring in March 2009 (collectively, the “facilities”). The facilities are designated for general corporate purposes and support the issuance of commercial paper. Neither of the facilities were drawn
as of December 31, 2005. The five-year facility expiring in March 2010 replaced a $1 billion 364-day revolving credit facility that expired in March 2005, while the five-year facility expiring in March 2009 was put in place in 2004 to replace a
five-year revolving credit facility that was due to expire in March 2005. Commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facilities are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investment-grade borrowers. These facilities allow
for borrowings at floating London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR)-based rates, plus a spread, depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings. The facilities require the maintenance of a minimum net worth and a debt to net worth coverage ratio. At
December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with these covenants. The facilities do not include any other financial restrictions, credit rating triggers (other than rating-dependent pricing), or any other provision that could require the posting
of collateral. In addition to our revolving credit facilities, we also had $150 million in uncommitted lines of credit that were unused at December 31, 2005. We established two $75 million uncommitted lines of credit in May and July 2005, which
will expire in May and July 2006, respectively.

At December 31, 2004, approximately $440 million of short-term borrowings that we intended to refinance were reclassified as long-term debt. This reclassification reflected our ability and intent to refinance these short-term
borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt on a long-term basis. At December 31, 2005, we did not reclassify any short-term debt to a long-term basis.

Dividend Restrictions

– We are subject to certain restrictions related to the payment of cash dividends to our
shareholders due to minimum net worth requirements under our credit facilities. Retained earnings available for



dividends increased to $6.2 billion at December 31, 2005, from $5.2 billion at December 31, 2004. We do not expect that these restrictions will
have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

Shelf Registration Statement

– Under a current shelf registration statement, we may issue any combination of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, or warrants for debt
securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings. At December 31, 2005, we had $500 million remaining for issuance under the current shelf registration statement. We have no immediate plans to issue any securities; however, we routinely
consider and evaluate opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under this shelf registration, and, therefore, we may issue debt securities at any time.

Operating Lease Activities

As of December 31, 2005, our contractual obligations for operating
leases totaled approximately $4.9 billion. Discounted at 8%, the present value of this obligation was approximately $3.2 billion. The Railroad entered into lease arrangements during 2005 to finance its new equipment acquisition program. In 2005, the
Railroad, as lessee, entered into long-term operating lease arrangements covering 317 locomotives and approximately 2,900 freight cars. The lessors under these lease arrangements purchased the locomotives and freight cars from the Corporation
through various financing transactions that totaled approximately $838 million, with a present value of $690 million. These new lease arrangements provide for minimum total rental payments of approximately $1.2 billion, which are reflected in the
contractual obligations table as of December 31, 2005.

The lessors financed the purchase of the locomotives and freight cars, in part, by the issuance of equipment notes that are non-recourse to the Railroad and are secured by an assignment of the underlying leases and a
security interest in the equipment. Neither the Railroad nor UPC guarantees payment of the equipment notes. The Railroad’s obligations to make operating lease payments under the leases are recourse obligations and are not recorded in the
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

The Railroad has certain renewal and purchase options with respect to the locomotives and freight cars. If the Railroad elects not to exercise any such options, the equipment will be returned to the lessors at the end of the lease term.

On July 8, 2005, the Railroad completed
the acquisition of its partner’s interest in Bay Pacific Financial L.L.C., a joint venture established to assist in the acquisition of containers and chassis for use by the Railroad in intermodal service, for a purchase price of $51 million. As
a result of the acquisition, the Railroad owns 100% of the joint venture. Total minimum rental payments for operating leases acquired in the acquisition were $202 million at the time of acquisition.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, and Commitments

As described in the notes to the Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data, Item 8, and as referenced in the tables below, we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition. However, based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our
material contractual obligations and commercial commitments, including material sources of off-balance sheet and structured finance arrangements, there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event, or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur
that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. In addition, the commercial obligations, financings, and commitments made by us are customary transactions that are similar to
those of other comparable corporations, particularly within the transportation industry.



The following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of
December 31, 2005:

[a]

Excludes capital lease obligations of $1,318 million, unamortized discount of $142 million, and market value adjustments of $(16) million for debt with
qualifying hedges that are recorded as assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Includes an interest component of $3,826 million.

[b]

Represents total obligations, including interest component of $782 million.

[c]

Purchase obligations include locomotive maintenance contracts; purchase commitments for locomotives, ties, ballast, and track; and agreements to purchase
other goods and services.

[d]

Includes estimated other postretirement, medical, and life insurance payments and payments made under the unfunded pension plan for the next ten years. No
amounts are included for funded pension as no contributions are currently required.

[a]

None of the credit facilities were used as of December 31, 2005.

[b]

$600 million of the facility was utilized at December 31, 2005.

[c]

Includes guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building, equipment financings, and affiliated operations.

[d]

None of the letters of credit were drawn upon as of December 31, 2005.

Sale of Receivables

– The Railroad transfers most of its accounts
receivable to Union Pacific Receivables, Inc. (UPRI), a bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, as part of a sale of receivables facility. UPRI sells, without recourse on a 364-day revolving basis, an undivided interest in such accounts receivable to
investors. The total capacity to sell undivided interests to investors under the facility was $600 million at December 31, 2005. The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was $600 million and $590
million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors is not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The value of the undivided interest held by investors was supported
by $1,226 million and $1,089 million of accounts receivable held by UPRI at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the value of the interest retained by UPRI was $626 million and $499 million,
respectively. This retained interest is included in accounts receivable in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The interest sold to investors is sold at carrying value, which approximates fair value, and there is no gain or loss recognized from
the transaction.

The value of the outstanding
undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks, including default and



dilution. If default or dilution percentages were to increase one percentage point, the amount of eligible receivables would decrease by $6 million. Should
our credit rating fall below investment grade, the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced, and, in certain cases, the investors would have the right to discontinue the facility.

The Railroad services the sold receivables; however, the
Railroad does not recognize any servicing asset or liability as the servicing fees adequately compensate the Railroad for its responsibilities. The Railroad collected approximately $13.4 billion and $12.2 billion during the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. UPRI used certain of these proceeds to purchase new receivables under the facility.

The costs of the sale of receivables program are included in other income and were $23 million, $11 million, and $10 million for 2005,
2004, and 2003, respectively. The costs include interest, program fees paid to banks, commercial paper issuing costs, and fees for unused commitment availability.

The investors have no recourse to the Railroad’s other assets except for customary warranty and
indemnity claims. Creditors of the Railroad have no recourse to the assets of UPRI. On August 11, 2005, the sale of receivables program was renewed for an additional 364-day period without any significant changes in terms.

Guarantees

– At December 31, 2005, we were contingently
liable for $486 million in guarantees. We recorded a liability of $7 million for the fair value of these obligations as of December 31, 2005. We entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business, and they include
guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building, equipment financings, and affiliated operations. The final guarantee expires in 2022. We are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees.
We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

OTHER MATTERS

Inflation

– The cumulative effect of long periods of inflation significantly increases asset replacement costs for capital-intensive companies. As a result, assuming that we replace
all operating assets at current price levels, depreciation charges (on an inflation-adjusted basis) would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts.

Derivative Financial Instruments

– We use derivative financial instruments in limited instances for other than
trading purposes to manage risk related to changes in fuel prices and to achieve our interest rate objectives. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged period. We formally document the nature and
relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions, and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. We may use swaps, collars, futures,
and/or forward contracts to mitigate the downside risk of adverse price movements and to hedge the exposure to variable cash flows. The use of these instruments also limits future benefits from favorable movements. The purpose of these programs is
to protect our operating margins and overall profitability from adverse fuel price changes or interest rate fluctuations.

Market and Credit Risk

– We address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations
that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item. Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments, which is minimal, is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements. At December 31, 2005
and 2004, we were not required to provide collateral, nor had we received collateral, relating to our hedging activities.

In addition, we enter into secured financings in which the debtor pledges collateral. The nature of the financing and the credit risk of
the debtor determine the collateral. These arrangements generally prohibit us from selling or repledging the collateral unless the debtor defaults.



Determination of Fair Value

– We determined the fair values of our derivative financial
instrument positions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or developed based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the applicable U.S. Treasury rate, LIBOR, or
swap spread.

Sensitivity Analyses

– The
sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition. These hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact
actual results.

Interest Rate Fair Value Hedges

–
We manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period. We generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt
through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings. We employ derivatives as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix. In addition, we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and
the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixed-rate debt securities.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had variable-rate debt representing approximately 10% and 9%, respectively, of our total debt. If
variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2006 than our December 31, 2005 variable rate, which was approximately 7%, our interest expense would increase by approximately $7 million. If variable interest rates averaged one
percentage point higher in 2005 than our December 31, 2004 variable rate, which was approximately 5%, our interest expense would have increased by approximately $8 million. These amounts were determined by considering the impact of the
hypothetical interest rates on the balances of our variable-rate debt at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt’s fair value
attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate (LIBOR). We accounted for the swaps as fair value hedges using the short-cut method pursuant to FASB Statement No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities;

therefore, we did not record any ineffectiveness within our Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had interest rate swaps hedging debt of $750 million.

Market risk for fixed-rate debt is estimated as the potential
increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2005, and amounts to approximately $535 million at December 31, 2005. Market risk resulting from a hypothetical one
percentage point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2004, amounted to approximately $599 million at December 31, 2004. We estimated the fair values of our fixed-rate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest
rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates.

Interest Rate Cash Flow Hedges

– We report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item affects earnings.

In 2004, we entered into treasury lock transactions, which
are accounted for as cash flow hedges. These treasury lock transactions resulted in a payment of $11 million that is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 years, ending September 30, 2014. The unamortized portion of the payment is
recorded as a $6 million after-tax reduction to common shareholders’ equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding.

Fuel Cash Flow Hedges

– Fuel costs are a
significant portion of our total operating expenses. In 2005 and 2004, our primary means of mitigating the impact of adverse fuel price changes was our fuel surcharge programs. However, we may use swaps, collars, futures and/or forward contracts to
further mitigate the impact of adverse fuel price changes. We hedged 120 million gallons of fuel during 2004 using collars with average cap, floor, and ceiling prices of $0.74, $0.64, and $0.86 per gallon, respectively. At December 31,
2004, there were no fuel hedges outstanding, and we did not have any fuel hedges in place during 2005.



Accounting Pronouncements

– In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123(R)

,
Share-Based Payment.

The statement requires that we recognize compensation expense equal to the fair value of stock options or other share-based payments starting January 1, 2006. We adopted the statement on a modified prospective basis,
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options. We expect that the incremental, full-year compensation expense in 2006 related to the adoption of the statement will be approximately $13 million for new
awards granted after January 1, 2006 and an additional $2 million for the unvested portion of awards granted in prior years. The expense for awards granted after implementation of the statement will be based upon their grant-date fair value.
The expense for those awards will be based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. That estimate will be revised if subsequent information indicates that the actual number of awards to vest will differ from the estimate. The
estimate does not materially impact our calculation of compensation expense.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143

(FIN 47). This interpretation
clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligations, as used in FASB Statement No. 143, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing or method of settlement, or both, are conditional on a
future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. An entity must recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. We assessed
the impact of the interpretation on our financial statements, determined that we have a legal obligation to properly dispose of asbestos-containing materials, and recorded a $5 million liability at December 31, 2005, for the fair value of this
obligation.

In May 2005, the FASB issued FAS
154,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3.

This statement requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of changes in accounting
principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. It carries forward without change the previous guidance for reporting the correction of an error and a change in accounting
estimate. FAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005.

In July 2005, the FASB issued an exposure draft,

Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, an Interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109

. As drafted, the interpretation would require companies to recognize the best estimate of the impact of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained during a tax audit. However, in November 2005 the FASB voted
to replace the probable threshold with a more-likely-than-not criterion when determining if the impact of a tax position should be recorded. The FASB expects to issue a final interpretation in the first quarter of 2006. When it is available, we will
review the final interpretation to determine the impact it may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In September 2005, the FASB issued an exposure draft,

Earnings per Share, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 128

. The draft
clarifies guidance for the treasury stock method, contracts that may be settled in cash or shares, and contingently issuable shares. The FASB expects to issue a final statement in the first quarter of 2006. We are currently reviewing this proposed
exposure draft to determine the impact it may have on our calculation of earnings per share.

In December 2005, the FASB deliberated issues relating to the limited-scope, first phase of its project to reconsider the accounting for postretirement benefits, including pensions. The FASB
decided that the objectives and scope of this phase include, among other items, recognizing the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or a liability in the statement of financial position. The FASB
expects to issue an exposure draft for the initial phase in the first quarter of 2006. In the second multi-year phase of the project, the FASB expects to comprehensively consider a variety of issues related to the accounting for postretirement
benefits, including expense recognition, obligation measurement, and whether postretirement benefit trusts should be consolidated by the plan sponsor. We will review the proposed standards when they are available to determine the impact they may
have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.



Commitments and Contingencies

– Various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and
certain of our subsidiaries. We are also subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, pursuant to which we are currently participating in the investigation and remediation of various sites. We do not expect that
any known lawsuits, claims, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity after taking into account
liabilities previously recorded for these matters.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Our
Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported
amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in the notes to the Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8. These critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on
our Consolidated Financial Statements may be material.

– We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees allege exposure to asbestos. Additionally, we have received claims for asbestos exposure that have not been litigated. A liability for
resolving both asserted and unasserted asbestos-related claims through 2034 has been estimated and recorded. During 2004, we engaged a third-party with extensive experience in estimating resolution costs for asbestos-related claims to assist us in
assessing our potential liability. The liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions:

Ÿ

The number of claims received in 2005 will be consistent with average claims received between 2000 and 2003.

Ÿ

The number of claims to be filed against us will decline each year after 2005.

Ÿ

The average settlement values for asserted and unasserted claims will be equivalent to those experienced between 2002 and 2004.

Ÿ

The percentage of claims dismissed between 2002 and 2004 will continue through 2034.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, $311 million and $324
million, respectively, was classified as liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, of which $16 million and $17 million, respectively, was classified as current accrued casualty costs. Approximately 16% of the recorded
liability related to asserted claims and approximately 84% related to unasserted claims. These claims are expected to be paid out over the next 29 years. We have insurance coverage for a portion of the costs incurred to resolve asbestos-related
claims, and we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries.

Our asbestos-related claims activity was as follows:



We believe that our liability for asbestos-related claims and the estimated insurance
recoveries reflect reasonable and probable estimates. The amounts recorded for asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts. However, future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed
each year, average settlement costs, and insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts. Estimates may also vary due to changes in the litigation environment, federal
and state law governing compensation of asbestos claimants, and the level of payments made to claimants by other defendants.

Additionally, we have a legal obligation to properly dispose of asbestos-containing materials. The estimated fair value of this obligation
is $5 million at December 31, 2005, which is recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position pursuant to FIN 47

.

Environmental

– We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. We identified 370 sites at which we are or may
be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements. This includes 43 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the U.S. government, 23 of which are currently on the Superfund
National Priorities List. Certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites; consequently, our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties, in
addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site.

When we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned, leased, or otherwise used in the conduct of our business, we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on the property. We expense
the cost of the assessments as incurred. We accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and we can reasonably estimate such costs. We do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments
is not fixed or readily determinable.

Environmental expenses for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $45 million, $46 million, and $26 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a liability of $213 million and $201 million,
respectively, accrued for future environmental costs, of which $46 million and $50 million, respectively, were recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites,
as well as ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties. Cost estimates are based on information available for each site, financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, and existing technology,
laws, and regulations. The ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved, site-specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the degree
of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs. Current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

Personal Injury

– The cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. We use third-party actuaries to
assist us with measuring the expense and liability, including unasserted claims. The Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA) governs compensation for work-related accidents. Under FELA, damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through
litigation or out-of-court settlements. We offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work. Annual expenses for personal injury-related events were $247 million in 2005, $288 million in
2004, and $250 million in 2003. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had accrued liabilities of $619 million and $639 million for future personal injury costs, respectively, of which $274 million was recorded in current liabilities as accrued
casualty costs in both years. Estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation.



Our personal injury claims activity was as follows:

Depreciation

– The railroad industry is capital intensive. Properties are carried at cost. Provisions for depreciation are computed principally on the straight-line method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property. The lives are calculated
using a separate composite annual percentage rate for each depreciable property group, based on the results of a depreciation study. We are required to submit a report on depreciation studies and proposed depreciation rates every three years for
equipment property and every six years for road property to the STB for review and approval. The cost (net of salvage) of depreciable railroad property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation,
and no gain or loss is recognized. A gain or loss is recognized in other income for all other property upon disposition because the gain or loss is not part of rail operations. The cost of internally developed software is capitalized and amortized
over a five-year period. An obsolescence review of capitalized software is performed on a periodic basis.

Capital spending in recent years has increased the total value of our depreciable assets. Cash capital spending totaled $2.2 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2005. In 2003, we implemented depreciation studies, approved by the STB, resulting in lower depreciation expense of $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, due to a reduction in depreciation rates for
certain track assets (effective January 1, 2003), partially offset by increased rates for locomotives and other assets (effective July 1, 2003). For the year ended December 31, 2005, depreciation expense was $1.2 billion. Various
methods are used to estimate useful lives for each group of depreciable property. Due to the capital intensive nature of the business and the large base of depreciable assets, variances to those estimates could have a material effect on our
Consolidated Financial Statements. If the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year, annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately $40 million. If the estimated useful lives of all assets to be
depreciated were decreased by one year, annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately $43 million.

Income Taxes

– As required under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

, we account for income taxes by recording taxes
payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. These expected future tax consequences are measured
based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted; the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated. Future tax law changes, such as a change in the corporate tax rate, could have a material impact on our financial condition or
results of operations. For example, a 1% increase in the federal income tax rate would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately $240 million.

When appropriate, we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized. In
determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, based in part on management’s judgments regarding the best
available evidence about future events. Based on that analysis, we have recorded a valuation allowance of $5 million and $11 million against certain deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Insurance Subsidiaries

– We have two consolidated, wholly-owned
subsidiaries that provide insurance coverage for certain risks, including physical loss or property damage and certain other claims that are subject to reinsurance. At December 31, 2005, current accounts receivable and current accrued casualty
costs included $65 million for reinsurance receivables and reinsured liability, respectively, held by one of our insurance subsidiaries



related to losses sustained during the West Coast storm in January 2005. This amount may change in the future as facts and circumstances surrounding the
claim and the reinsurance are finalized and settled. We collected a partial recovery of our claim from reinsurance of $25 million during the fourth quarter of 2005.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

– We use third-party actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the
liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and defined contribution medical and life insurance benefits (OPEB) to eligible employees. In order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses we must make several
assumptions. The critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets. For other postretirement benefits, the critical assumptions are the discount rate and
healthcare cost trend rate.

We evaluate our
critical assumptions at least annually, and selected assumptions are based on the following factors:

Ÿ

Discount rate is based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows matching our plans’ expected benefit payments.

Ÿ

Expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return, taking into consideration current and expected market conditions.

Ÿ

Healthcare cost trend rate is based on our historical rates of inflation and expected market conditions.

The following tables present the key assumptions used to
measure pension and OPEB expense for 2005 and the estimated impact on 2005 pension and OPEB expense relative to a change in those assumptions:

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Union Pacific Corporation, its Directors, and Shareholders:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Union Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary
Companies (the Corporation) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in common shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005.
Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedule listed in the Table of Contents at Part IV, Item 15. These consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Union Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such
consolidated financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Corporation changed its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations in 2003.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness
of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated February 17, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Union Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies

For purposes of this report, unless the context otherwise requires, all
references herein to the “Corporation”, “UPC”, “we”, “us”, and “our” mean Union Pacific Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Union Pacific Railroad Company, which will be separately referred
to herein as “UPRR” or the “Railroad”.

Significant
Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

– The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Union Pacific Corporation and all of its subsidiaries. Investments in affiliated companies (20% to 50% owned) are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. All
significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. The Corporation evaluates its less than majority-owned investments for consolidation pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46 (Revised 2003),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51

(FIN 46(R)). The Corporation adopted the provisions of FIN 46(R) in June of 2003. We currently have no less than majority owned
investments that require consolidation under FIN 46(R).

Cash and Cash Equivalents

– Cash equivalents consist of investments with original maturities of three months or less.

Materials and Supplies

– Materials and supplies are carried at the lower of average cost or market.

Property and Depreciation

– Properties are carried at cost.
Provisions for depreciation are computed principally on the straight-line method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property. The cost (net of salvage) of depreciable rail property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business
is charged to accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized. A gain or loss is recognized in other income for all other property upon disposition because the gain or loss is not part of rail operations. The cost of internally developed
software is capitalized and amortized over a five-year period. An obsolescence review of capitalized software is performed on a periodic basis.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

– We review long-lived assets, including identifiable intangibles, for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the long-lived assets, the carrying value
is reduced to the estimated fair value as measured by the discounted cash flows.

Revenue Recognition

– We recognize commodity revenues on a percentage-of-completion basis as freight moves from origin to destination. The allocation of revenue between reporting periods is based on the
relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred. Other revenue is recognized as service is performed or contractual obligations are met.

Translation of Foreign Currency

– Our portion of the assets and liabilities related to foreign investments are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Unrealized adjustments are reflected within shareholders’
equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.

Financial Instruments

– The carrying value of our non-derivative financial instruments approximates fair value. The fair value of financial instruments is generally determined by reference to market values as quoted by
recognized dealers or developed based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the applicable U.S. Treasury rate, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), or swap spread.

We periodically use derivative financial instruments, for
other than trading purposes, to manage risk related to changes in fuel prices and interest rates.



Stock-Based Compensation

– We have several stock-based employee compensation plans, which are
described more fully in note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. We have accounted for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,

and related interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation expense related to stock option grants is reflected in net income, as all options granted under those plans had a grant price equal to the market value of our common
stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense related to retention shares, stock units, and other incentive plans is reflected in net income. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(FAS 123), to stock-based employee compensation. See note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of FASB
Statement No. 123 (R),

Share-Based Payment

(FAS 123(R)), related to the treatment of stock options. See note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for reconciliation between basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share.

[a]

Stock options for executives granted in 2003 and 2002 included a reload feature. This reload feature allowed executives to exercise their options using shares
of Union Pacific Corporation common stock that they already owned and obtain a new grant of options in the amount of the shares used for exercise plus any shares withheld for tax purposes. The reload feature of these option grants could only be
exercised if the price of our common stock increased at least 20% from the price at the time of the reload grant. During the year ended December 31, 2005, reload option grants represented $19 million of the pro forma expense noted above. There
were no reload options exercised during 2004 or 2003 and no pro forma expense for reload option grants in 2004 or 2003. Stock options exercised after the January 1, 2006 effective date of FAS 123(R) will not be eligible for the reload feature.

Earnings Per Share

– Basic
earnings per share (EPS) are calculated on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted EPS include shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, stock-based awards, and the potential conversion
of the preferred securities where the conversion of such instruments would be dilutive.

Use of Estimates

– Our Consolidated Financial Statements include estimates and assumptions regarding certain assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of certain contingent assets and
liabilities. Actual future results may differ from such estimates.

Income Taxes

– As required under FASB Statement No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

, we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. These expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted; the effects of future changes in
tax laws are not anticipated. Future tax law changes, such as a change in the corporate tax rate, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.



When appropriate, we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset
future tax benefits that may not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, based in part on
management’s judgments regarding the best available evidence about future events.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

– We incur certain employment-related expenses associated with pensions and postretirement health benefits. In order to measure the expense associated with these
benefits, we must make various assumptions including discount rates used to value certain liabilities, expected return on plan assets used to fund these expenses, salary increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and expected
future healthcare costs. The assumptions used by us are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. We use third-party actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the expense and liability associated with these
benefits.

Personal Injury

– The cost of injuries
to employees and others on our property is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. We use third-party actuaries to assist us in properly measuring the expense and liability. Legal fees are
expensed as incurred.

Environmental

– When
environmental issues have been identified with respect to property currently or formerly owned, leased, or otherwise used in the conduct of our business, we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on such property. We expense the cost
of the assessments as incurred. We accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated. We do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not
fixed or readily determinable. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.

Asbestos

– We estimate a liability for asserted and unasserted asbestos-related claims based on an assessment of the number and value of those claims. We use an external consulting firm to assist us in properly measuring the
expense and liability. Our liability for asbestos-related claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.

Differences in Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Surface
Transportation Board (STB) Accounting

– STB accounting rules require that railroads accrue the cost of removing track structure over the expected useful life of these assets. Railroads historically used this prescribed accounting for
reports filed with both the STB and SEC. In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

(FAS 143). This statement was effective for us beginning January 1, 2003, and prohibits the
accrual of removal costs unless there is a legal obligation to remove the track structure at the end of its life. We concluded that we did not have a legal obligation to remove the track structure, and under generally accepted accounting principles
we could not accrue the cost of removal in advance. As a result, reports filed with the SEC reflect the expense of removing these assets in the period in which they are removed.

Change in Presentation

– Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2005 Consolidated
Financial Statement presentation. These reclassifications were not material, individually or in aggregate, with the exception of reclassifications made to appropriately reflect the discontinued operations as discussed in note 13.

1. Operations and Segmentation

The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one
reportable operating segment. Although revenue is analyzed by commodity, we analyze the net financial results of the Railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of the rail network. The Consolidated Financial Statements for 2003 also
include discontinued trucking operations, consisting of Overnite Transportation Company (OTC) and Motor Cargo Industries, Inc. (Motor Cargo) (see note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the reclassification of our trucking segment
as a discontinued operation).

Continuing Operations

– UPRR is a Class I railroad that operates in the United States. We have 32,426 route miles, linking Pacific Coast and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest and eastern United States gateways and



providing several corridors to key Mexican gateways. We serve the western two-thirds of the country and maintain coordinated schedules with other rail
carriers for the handling of freight to and from the Atlantic Coast, the Pacific Coast, the Southeast, the Southwest, Canada, and Mexico. Export and import traffic is moved through Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast ports and across the Mexican and
Canadian borders. Railroad freight is comprised of six commodity groups (percent of total commodity revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005: agricultural (15%), automotive (10%), chemicals (14%), energy (20%), industrial products (22%),
and intermodal (19%)).

Discontinued Operations

–
The discontinued operations represent the operations of OTC and Motor Cargo, which were sold through an initial public offering in 2003.

2. Financial Instruments

Strategy and Risk

– We may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances for other than trading purposes to assist in managing risk related to changes in fuel prices and
to achieve our interest rate objectives. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a
specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged period. We formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as
well as our risk-management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions, and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. We may use swaps, collars, futures, and/or forward contracts to mitigate the downside risk of adverse
price movements and to hedge the exposure to variable cash flows. The use of these instruments also limits future benefits from favorable movements.

The purpose of these programs is to assist in protecting our operating margins and overall profitability from adverse fuel price changes or interest rate
fluctuations.

Market and Credit Risk

– We address
market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item. Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments, which is minimal, is managed by
requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we were not required to provide collateral, nor had we received collateral, relating to our hedging activities.

Determination of Fair Value

– We determined the fair values of
our derivative financial instrument positions at December 31, 2005 and 2004 based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or developed based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the applicable U.S.
Treasury rate, LIBOR, or swap spread.

Interest Rate Fair
Value Hedges

– We manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period. We generally manage the mix of fixed and
floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings. We employ derivatives as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix. In addition, we also obtain flexibility in managing
interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixed-rate debt securities.

Swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt’s fair value
attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate (LIBOR). We accounted for the swaps as fair value hedges using the short-cut method pursuant to FASB Statement No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities;

therefore, we did not record any ineffectiveness within our Consolidated Financial Statements.



The following is a summary of our interest rate derivatives qualifying as fair value
hedges:

Interest Rate Cash
Flow Hedges

– We report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item affects earnings.

In 2004, we entered into treasury lock transactions, which are accounted for as cash flow hedges. These treasury lock transactions
resulted in a payment of $11 million that is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 years, ending September 30, 2014. The unamortized portion of the payment is recorded as a $6 million after-tax reduction to common shareholders’
equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding.

Fuel Cash Flow Hedges

– Fuel costs are a significant portion of our total operating expenses. In 2005 and 2004,
our primary means of mitigating the impact of adverse fuel price changes was our fuel surcharge programs. However, we may use swaps, collars, futures and/or forward contracts to further mitigate the impact of adverse fuel price changes. We hedged
120 million gallons of fuel during 2004 using collars with average cap, floor, and ceiling prices of $0.74, $0.64, and $0.86 per gallon, respectively. At December 31, 2004, there were no fuel hedges outstanding, and we did not have any
fuel hedges in place during 2005.

Earnings Impact

– Our use of derivative financial instruments had the following impact on pre-tax income for the years ended December 31:

Fair Value of Debt
Instruments

– The fair value of our short- and long-term debt was estimated using quoted market prices, where available, or current borrowing rates. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the fair value of total debt exceeded the carrying
value by approximately $460 million and $673 million, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, approximately $169 million and $282 million, respectively, of fixed-rate debt securities contained call provisions that allowed us to retire the
debt instruments prior to final maturity, with the payment of fixed call premiums, or in certain cases, at par.

Sale of Receivables

– The Railroad transfers most of its accounts receivable to Union Pacific Receivables, Inc. (UPRI), a bankruptcy-remote subsidiary, as part of a sale of
receivables facility. UPRI sells, without recourse, an undivided interest in such accounts receivable to investors. The total capacity to sell undivided interests to investors under the facility was $600 million at December 31, 2005. The value
of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was $600 million and $590 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors is not included in our
Consolidated Financial Statements. The value of the undivided interest held by investors was supported by $1,226 million and $1,089 million of accounts receivable held by UPRI at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December 31,



2005 and 2004, the value of the interest retained by UPRI was $626 million and $499 million, respectively. This retained interest is included in accounts
receivable in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The interest sold to investors is sold at carrying value, which approximates fair value, and there is no gain or loss recognized from the transaction.

The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by
investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks, including default and dilution. Should our credit rating fall below investment grade, the value of
the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced, and, in certain cases, the investors would have the right to discontinue the facility.

The Railroad has been designated to service the sold receivables; however, no servicing asset or liability has been recognized as the
servicing fees adequately compensate the Railroad for its responsibilities. The Railroad collected approximately $13.4 billion and $12.2 billion during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. UPRI used such proceeds to
purchase new receivables under the facility.

The costs of the sale of receivables program are included in other income and were $23 million, $11 million, and $10 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The costs include interest, program fees paid to banks, commercial paper
issuance costs, and fees for unused commitment availability.

The investors have no recourse to the Railroad’s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims. Creditors of the Railroad have no recourse to the assets of UPRI. In August 2005, the sale of
receivables program was renewed for an additional 364-day period without any significant changes in terms.

3. Income Taxes

Components of income tax expense for continuing operations were as follows for the years ended December 31:

For
the years ended December 31, reconciliation between statutory and effective tax rates for continuing operations is as follows:



Deferred income tax liabilities (assets) were comprised of the following at
December 31:

All
federal income tax years prior to 1995 are closed. Federal income tax liabilities for tax years 1986 through 1994 have been resolved. Interest calculations for these years are in process and may take several years to resolve with the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS has begun its examination of the Corporation’s federal income tax returns for tax years 2003 and 2004, and has completed its examinations and issued notices of deficiency for tax years 1995 through 2002. As
previously reported, among their proposed adjustments is the disallowance of tax deductions claimed in connection with certain donations of property. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the IRS National Office issued a Technical Advice Memorandum that
left unresolved whether the deductions were proper, pending further factual development by the IRS Examination Team. We continue to dispute the donation issue, as well as many of the other proposed adjustments, and will contest the associated tax
deficiencies through the IRS Appeals process, and, if necessary, litigation.

As reported in the Corporation’s Forms 10-Q for quarters ended June 30, 2005, and September 30, 2005, the final settlements for pre-1995 tax years, along with the IRS Examination Reports for tax years
1995 through 2002, among other things, were considered in a review and re-evaluation of the Corporation’s estimated deferred tax assets and liabilities. This review resulted in a reduction of deferred income tax liabilities and income tax
expense of $118 million in the third quarter of 2005.

The Corporation believes it has adequately reserved for federal and state income taxes, and does not expect that resolution of these examinations will have a material adverse effect on its operating results, financial condition, or
liquidity.

4. Debt

Total debt as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, including interest rate
swaps designated as hedges, is summarized below:

[a]

2005 and 2004 include a collective write-down of $16 million and write-up of $2 million, respectively, due to market value adjustments for debt with
qualifying hedges that are recorded as liabilities and assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.



Debt Maturities

– The following table presents aggregate debt maturities as of
December 31, 2005, excluding market value adjustments.

Debt Redemption

– In May 2005, we redeemed approximately $113 million of 8.35% debentures with a maturity date of May 1, 2025.

Mortgaged Properties

– Equipment with a carrying value of approximately $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, serves as collateral for capital leases and other types of equipment obligations in accordance with the secured financing arrangements utilized to acquire such railroad equipment.

As a result of the merger of Missouri Pacific Railroad
Company (MPRR) with and into UPRR on January 1, 1997, and pursuant to the underlying indentures for the MPRR mortgage bonds, UPRR must maintain the same value of assets after the merger in order to comply with the security requirements of the
mortgage bonds. As of the merger date, the value of the MPRR assets that secured the mortgage bonds was approximately $6.0 billion. In accordance with the terms on the indentures, this collateral value must be maintained during the entire term of
the mortgage bonds irrespective of the outstanding balance of such bonds.

Credit Facilities

– On December 31, 2005, we had $2 billion in revolving credit facilities available, including $1 billion under a five-year facility expiring in March 2010 and $1 billion under a
five-year facility expiring in March 2009 (collectively, the “facilities”). The facilities are designated for general corporate purposes and support the issuance of commercial paper. Neither of the facilities were drawn as of
December 31, 2005. The five-year facility expiring in March 2010 replaced a $1 billion 364-day revolving credit facility that expired in March 2005, while the five-year facility expiring in March 2009 was put in place in 2004 to replace a
five-year revolving credit facility that was due to expire in March 2005. Commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facilities are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investment-grade borrowers. These facilities allow
for borrowings at floating (LIBOR-based) rates, plus a spread, depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings. The facilities require the maintenance of a minimum net worth and a debt to net worth coverage ratio. At December 31, 2005, we were
in compliance with these covenants. The facilities do not include any other financial restrictions, credit rating triggers (other than rating-dependent pricing), or any other provision that could require the posting of collateral.

In addition to our revolving credit facilities, we also had
$150 million in uncommitted lines of credit that were unused at December 31, 2005. We established two $75 million uncommitted lines of credit in May and July 2005, which will expire in May and July 2006, respectively.

At December 31, 2004, approximately $440 million of
short-term borrowings that we intended to refinance were reclassified as long-term debt. This reclassification reflected our ability and intent to refinance these short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt on a long-term basis.
At December 31, 2005, we did not reclassify any short-term debt to a long-term basis.

Dividend Restrictions

– We are subject to certain restrictions related to the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders due to minimum net worth requirements under the credit facilities referred to
above. The amount of



retained earnings available for dividends was $6.2 billion and $5.2 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We do not expect that these
restrictions will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. We declared dividends of $316 million in 2005 and $312 million in 2004.

Shelf Registration Statement

– Under a current shelf registration
statement, we may issue any combination of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings. At December 31, 2005, we had $500 million remaining for issuance under the
current shelf registration statement. We have no immediate plans to issue any securities; however, we routinely consider and evaluate opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under this shelf
registration, and, therefore, we may issue debt securities at any time.

5.
Leases

We lease certain locomotives, freight cars, and
other property. Future minimum lease payments for operating and capital leases with initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2005 were as follows:

Rent
expense for operating leases with terms exceeding one month was $728 million in 2005, $651 million in 2004, and $586 million in 2003. When rental payments are not made on a straight-line basis, we recognize rental expense on a straight-line basis
over the lease term. Contingent rentals and sub-rentals are not significant.

6. Retirement Plans

Pension and Other Postretirement
Benefits

Pension Plans

– We provide defined
benefit retirement income to eligible non-union employees through qualified and non-qualified (supplemental) pension plans. Qualified and non-qualified pension benefits are based on years of service and the highest compensation during the latest
years of employment, with specific reductions made for early retirements.

Other Postretirement Benefits (OPEB)

– We provide defined contribution medical and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees. These benefits are funded as medical claims and life insurance premiums are
paid.

See note 11 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for discussion of the FASB’s project to reconsider the accounting for postretirement benefits, including pensions.

Funded Status

Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO)

– The PBO of our pension plans is the present value of benefits earned to date by plan participants, including the effect of assumed future
salary increases. The PBO of the OPEB plan is equal to



the accumulated benefit obligation, as the present value of OPEB liabilities is not affected by salary increases. Changes in our projected benefit obligation
are as follows for the years ended December 31:

Assets

– Plan assets are measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of our plan assets are as follows for the years ended December 31:

Funded Status

– The funded status represents the difference between the PBO and the fair value of the plan assets. Below is a reconciliation of the funded status of the benefit plans to the net amounts recognized for the years ended December 31:



Amounts Recorded in Consolidated Statement of Financial Position

– The net amounts represent
the amount previously accrued by us for pension and OPEB costs. The following table presents the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at December 31:

At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, $42 million and $43 million, respectively, of the total pension and other postretirement liabilities were classified as current.

Underfunded Accumulated Benefit Obligation

– The accumulated benefit obligation is the present value of benefits
earned to date, assuming no future salary growth. The underfunded accumulated benefit obligation represents the difference between the accumulated benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. The projected benefit obligation, accumulated
benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the fair value of the plan assets were as follows for the years ended December 31:

The
accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $2 billion at both December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Assumptions

– The weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31:

Expense

Both pension and OPEB expense are determined based upon the annual service
cost of benefits (the actuarial cost of benefits earned during a period) and the interest cost on those liabilities, less the expected return on plan assets. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is applied to a calculated value of
plan assets that recognizes



changes in fair value over a five-year period. This practice is intended to reduce year-to-year volatility in pension expense, but it can have the effect of
delaying the recognition of differences between actual returns on assets and expected returns based on long-term rate of return assumptions. The expected rate of return on assets was 8% for both 2005 and 2004. Differences in actual experience in
relation to assumptions are not recognized immediately, but are deferred and, if necessary, amortized as pension or OPEB expense.

The components of our net periodic pension and other postretirement costs were as follows for the years ended December 31:

Assumptions

– The weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine expense were as follows for the years ended December 31:

The
discount rate is based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows matching our plans’ expected benefit payments. The expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return, taking
into account current and expected market conditions. The actual return on pension plan assets, net of fees, was approximately 7% in 2005, compared to 12% in 2004. Our historical annualized ten-year rate of return on plan assets is approximately 9%.

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a
significant effect on the expense and liabilities reported for healthcare plans. The healthcare cost trend rate is based on historical rates and expected market conditions. A one-percentage point change in the expected healthcare cost trend rates
would have the following effects on OPEB:



Equity Adjustment

An additional minimum pension liability adjustment is required when our accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of our plan assets, and that
difference exceeds the net pension liability recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The liability was recorded as a $211 million and $212 million after-tax reduction to common shareholders’ equity as part of
accumulated other comprehensive loss in 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The equity reduction may be restored to the balance sheet in future periods if the fair value of plan assets exceeds the accumulated benefit obligations. This reduction to equity does not affect net income or cash
flow and has no impact on compliance with debt covenants.

Cash
Contributions

The following table details our cash
contributions for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the expected contributions for 2006:

Our
policy with respect to funding the qualified plans is to fund at least the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and not more than the maximum amount deductible for tax purposes. We do not currently
have minimum funding requirements under applicable employee benefit and tax laws. All contributions made to the funded pension plans for 2004 were voluntary and were made with cash generated from operations. In January 2006, we made a $50 million
voluntary contribution to the funded pension plan. No further contributions are expected during 2006.

All benefit payments for other postretirement benefits are voluntary, as the postretirement plans are not funded, and are not subject to
any minimum regulatory funding requirements. Benefit payments for each year represent claims paid for medical and life insurance, and we anticipate our 2006 OPEB payments will be made from cash generated from operations.

Benefit Payments

The following table details expected benefit payments for the years 2006 though 2015:



Asset Allocation Strategy

Our pension plan asset allocation at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and target allocation for 2006, are as follows:

The
investment strategy for pension plan assets is to maintain a broadly diversified portfolio designed to achieve our target of an average long-term rate of return of 8%. While we believe we can achieve a long-term average rate of return of 8%, we
cannot be certain that the portfolio will perform to our expectations. Assets are strategically allocated between equity and debt securities in order to achieve a diversification level that mitigates wide swings in investment returns. To further
improve diversification, a target allocation to real estate investments has been established for future time periods. Asset allocation target ranges for equity, debt, and other portfolios are evaluated at least every three years with the assistance
of an external consulting firm. Actual asset allocations are monitored monthly, and rebalancing actions are executed at least quarterly, if needed.

The majority of the plan’s assets are invested in equity securities, because equity portfolios have historically provided higher
returns than debt and other asset classes over extended time horizons, and are expected to do so in the future. Correspondingly, equity investments also entail greater risks than other investments. The risk of loss in the plan’s equity
portfolio is mitigated by investing in a broad range of equity types. Equity diversification includes large-capitalization and small-capitalization companies, growth-oriented and value-oriented investments, and U.S. and non-U.S. securities.

Equity risks are further balanced by investing
a significant portion of the plan’s assets in high quality debt securities. The average quality rating of the debt portfolio exceeded AA as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. The debt portfolio is also broadly diversified and invested
primarily in U.S. Treasury, mortgage, and corporate securities with an intermediate average maturity. The weighted-average maturity of the debt portfolio was 6.5 years and 6.3 years at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The investment of pension plan assets in our securities is
specifically prohibited for both the equity and debt portfolios, other than through index fund holdings.

Other Retirement Programs

Thrift Plan

– We provide a defined contribution plan (thrift plan) to eligible non-union employees and make matching contributions to the thrift plan. We match 50 cents for each dollar contributed by employees up to the first
six percent of compensation contributed. Our thrift plan contributions were $12 million per year in 2005, 2004, and 2003.

Railroad Retirement System

– All Railroad employees are covered by the Railroad Retirement System (the System). Contributions made to the
System are expensed as incurred and amounted to approximately $595 million in 2005, $569 million in 2004, and $562 million in 2003.

Collective Bargaining Agreements

– Under collective bargaining agreements, we provide certain postretirement healthcare and life insurance
benefits for eligible union employees. Premiums under the plans are expensed as incurred and amounted to $41 million in 2005, $30 million in 2004, and $27 million in 2003.



7. Stock Options and Other Stock Plans

We have 2,938,450 options outstanding under the 1993 Stock Option and Retention Stock Plan of Union Pacific Corporation
(1993 Plan). There are 7,140 restricted shares outstanding under the 1992 Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Union Pacific Corporation. We no longer grant options or awards of restricted stock or retention shares and units under
these plans.

The UP Shares Stock Option Plan
of Union Pacific Corporation (UP Shares Plan

)

was approved by our Board of Directors on April 30, 1998. The UP Shares Plan reserved 12,000,000 shares of our common stock for issuance. The UP Shares Plan was a broad-based option program
that granted options to purchase 200 shares of our common stock at $55.00 per share to eligible active employees on April 30, 1998. All options granted were non-qualified options that became exercisable on May 1, 2001, and remain
exercisable until April 30, 2008. If an optionee’s employment terminates for any reason, the option remains exercisable for a period of one year after the date of termination, but no option is exercisable after April 30, 2008. No
further options may be granted under the UP Shares Plan. As of December 31, 2005, there were 2,096,681 options outstanding under the UP Shares Plan.

We adopted the Executive Stock Purchase Incentive Plan (ESPIP), effective October 1, 1999, in order to encourage and facilitate
ownership of our common stock by our officers and other key executives. Under the ESPIP, participants purchased a total of 1,008,000 shares of our common stock with the proceeds of 6.02% interest-bearing, full recourse loans from the Corporation.
Loans totaled $47 million and had a final maturity date of January 31, 2006. Deferred cash payments were to be awarded to the participants to repay interest and the loan principal if certain performance and retention criteria were met within a
40-month period ending January 31, 2003. Following satisfaction of the various performance criteria during the term of the ESPIP and continued employment with the Corporation through January 31, 2003, participants received a deferred cash
payment equal to two-thirds of the outstanding principal balance of their loan plus the net accrued interest on January 31, 2003. Such payments were applied against the participants’ outstanding loan balance pursuant to the terms of the
ESPIP. The remaining loan balances were repaid in three equal installments on January 31, 2004, January 31, 2005, and January 31, 2006. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the total outstanding balance of the remaining loans was
$0.4 million and $1 million, respectively. All remaining loan balances were repaid as of January 31, 2006.

In April 2000, the shareholders approved the Union Pacific Corporation 2000 Directors Plan (Directors Plan) whereby 550,000 shares of our
common stock were reserved for issuance to our non-employee directors. Under the Directors Plan, each non-employee director, upon his or her initial election to the Board of Directors, receives a grant of 1,000 shares of restricted shares or
restricted stock units. Additionally, each non-employee director receives annually an option to purchase at fair value a number of shares of our common stock, not to exceed 5,000 shares during any calendar year, determined by dividing 60,000 by 1/3
of the fair market value of one share of our common stock on the date of such Board of Directors meeting, with the resulting quotient rounded up or down to the nearest 50 shares. As of December 31, 2005, 5,000 restricted shares were outstanding
under the Directors Plan and 155,800 options were outstanding under the Directors Plan.

The Union Pacific Corporation 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (2001 Plan) was approved by the shareholders in April 2001. The 2001 Plan reserved 12,000,000 shares of our common stock for issuance to
eligible employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries in the form of non-qualified options, incentive stock options, retention shares, stock units, and incentive bonus awards. Non-employee directors are not eligible for awards under the 2001
Plan. As of December 31, 2005, 5,007,628 options and 880,526 retention shares and stock units were outstanding under the 2001 Plan.

The Union Pacific Corporation 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (2004 Plan) was approved by shareholders in April 2004. The 2004 Plan reserved
21,000,000 shares of our common stock for issuance, plus any shares subject to awards made under the 2001 Plan and the 1993 Plan that were outstanding on April 16, 2004, and became available for regrant pursuant to the terms of the 2004 Plan.
Under the 2004 Plan, non-qualified options, stock



appreciation rights, retention shares, stock units, and incentive bonus awards may be granted to eligible employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries.
Non-employee directors are not eligible for awards under the 2004 Plan. As of December 31, 2005, 2,237,650 options and 124,750 retention shares and stock units were outstanding under the 2004 Plan.

In January 2006, our Board of Directors approved a new Long
Term Plan (LTP). Participants were awarded stock units subject to the attainment of certain performance targets and continued employment through January 31, 2009. The LTP performance criteria used to determine the number of stock units that
will be earned during the 37-month performance period is annual return on invested capital (ROIC), calculated by the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors, which may be adjusted to reflect the effect of special transactions
or events such as significant gains on the sale of real estate, tax adjustments, accounting changes or reclassifications. At the end of year one of the performance period, a participant may earn up to one-third of the target number of stock units
granted to him or her based on the first year of ROIC performance achieved. At the end of year two, the participant may earn additional stock units up to a total of two-thirds of the target number of stock units granted to him or her based on the
average of the first two years of ROIC performance achieved. During year three of the performance period, the participant may earn up to 200% of the target number of stock units granted to him or her based on the average of all three years of ROIC
performance achieved. Stock units that are earned under the LTP will be paid out in shares of our common stock.

Pursuant to the above plans, 19,303,495; 21,571,309; and 6,899,211 shares of our common stock were available for grant at
December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Options

– Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock as of the date of the grant. Options are granted with a 10-year term and are generally exercisable one to two years
after the date of the grant. A summary of the stock options issued under the 1993 Plan, the UP Shares Plan, the Directors Plan, the 2001 Plan, and the 2004 Plan, and changes during the years ending December 31 are as follows:



The following table summarizes information about our outstanding stock options as of
December 31, 2005:

The
fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following weighted-average assumptions for options granted in 2005, 2004, and 2003.

Restricted Stock
and Other Stock Incentive Plans

– Our plans provide for awarding retention shares of common stock or stock units to eligible employees. These awards are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates during the prescribed retention period,
generally three or four years. Restricted stock awards are issued to non-employee directors and are subject to forfeiture if certain service requirements are not met. During the year ended December 31, 2005, 115,600 retention shares, stock
units, and restricted shares were issued at a weighted-average fair value of $59.35. During the year ended December 31, 2004, 276,575 retention shares, stock units, and restricted shares were issued at a weighted-average fair value of $64.75.
During the year ended December 31, 2003, 380,786 retention shares, stock units, and restricted shares were issued at a weighted-average fair value of $55.99. The cost of retention and restricted awards is amortized to expense over the retention
period.

During the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, we expensed $21 million, $21 million, and $46 million, respectively, related to the restricted stock and other incentive plans described above.



8. Earnings Per Share

The following table provides a reconciliation between basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31:

Common
stock options totaling 1.4 million and 3.3 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices of these options exceeded the average market price of our
common stock for the respective periods, and the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. All stock options were dilutive for 2003.

9. Commitments and Contingencies

Unasserted Claims

– Various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries. It is not possible at this time for us
to determine fully the effect of all unasserted claims on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity; however, to the extent possible, where unasserted claims can be estimated and where such claims are considered
probable, we have recorded a liability. We do not expect that any known lawsuits, claims, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of
operations, or liquidity after taking into account liabilities previously recorded for these matters.

Personal Injury

– The cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents
each year. We use third-party actuaries



to assist us in measuring the expense and liability, including unasserted claims. Compensation for work-related accidents is governed by the Federal
Employers’ Liability Act (FELA). Under FELA, damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out-of-court settlements.

Our personal injury liability activity was as follows:

Our
personal injury liability is discounted to present value using applicable U.S. Treasury rates. Personal injury accruals were higher in 2004 due to a 1998 crossing accident verdict upheld in 2004 and a 2004 derailment near San Antonio.

Asbestos

– We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which
current and former employees allege exposure to asbestos. Additionally, we have received claims for asbestos exposure that have not been litigated. The claims and lawsuits (collectively referred to as “claims”) allege occupational illness
resulting from exposure to asbestos-containing products. In most cases, the claimants do not have credible medical evidence of physical impairment resulting from the alleged exposures. Additionally, most claims filed against us do not specify an
amount of alleged damages.

The greatest
potential for asbestos exposure in the railroad industry existed while steam locomotives were used. The railroad industry, including UPRR and its predecessors, phased out steam locomotives between 1955 and 1960. The use of asbestos-containing
products in the railroad industry was substantially reduced after steam locomotives were discontinued, although it was not completely eliminated. Some asbestos-containing products were still manufactured in the building trade industry and were used
in isolated component parts on locomotives and railroad cars during the 1960s and 1970s. By the early 1980s, manufacturers of building materials and locomotive component parts developed non-asbestos alternatives for their products and ceased
manufacturing asbestos-containing materials.

Prior to 2004, we concluded it was not possible to reasonably estimate the cost of disposing of asbestos-related claims that might be filed against us in the future, due to a lack of sufficient comparable history from which to reasonably
estimate unasserted asbestos-related claims. As a result, we recorded a liability for asbestos-related claims only when the claims were asserted.

During 2004, we determined we could reasonably estimate our liability for unasserted asbestos-related claims because we had sufficient
comparable loss data and there was no immediate legislative solution to asbestos litigation. During 2004, we engaged a third-party with extensive experience in estimating resolution costs for asbestos-related claims to assist us in assessing the
number and value of these unasserted claims through 2034, based on our average claims experience over a multi-year period. As a result, we increased our liability for asbestos-related claims in the fourth quarter of 2004. The liability for resolving
both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions:

Ÿ

The number of claims received in 2005 will be consistent with average claims received between 2000 and 2003.

Ÿ

The number of claims to be filed against us will decline each year after 2005.



Ÿ

The average settlement values for asserted and unasserted claims will be equivalent to those experienced between 2002 and 2004.

The percentage of claims dismissed between 2002 and 2004 will continue through 2034.

Our asbestos-related liability activity was as follows:

Our
liability for asbestos-related claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments. Approximately 16% of the recorded liability related to asserted claims, and approximately 84% related to
unasserted claims. These claims are expected to be paid out over the next 29 years. During the third quarter of 2005, our third-party consultants assisted us in reviewing our actual asbestos claim experience through the first half of 2005 compared
to the assumptions used in the 2004 estimate, and we determined that no adjustment to our estimate was necessary at this time. We will continue to review actual experience and adjust our estimate as warranted.

Insurance coverage reimburses us for a portion of the costs
incurred to resolve asbestos-related claims, and we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries.

We believe that our liability estimates for asbestos-related claims and the estimated insurance recoveries reflect reasonable and probable
estimates. The amounts recorded for asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts. However, future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed each year, average settlement costs, and
insurance coverage issues could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts. Estimates may also vary due to changes in the litigation environment, federal and state law governing compensation of
asbestos claimants, and the level of payments made to claimants by other defendants.

Additionally, we have a legal obligation to properly dispose of asbestos-containing materials. The estimated fair value of this obligation is $5 million at December 31, 2005, which is
recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position pursuant to FIN 47.

Environmental Costs

– We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. We have identified approximately 370 sites at which we are or may be liable for
remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements. This includes 43 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the U.S. government, 23 of which are currently on the Superfund National
Priorities List. Certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites; consequently, our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties, in addition to
costs relating to our own activities at each site.

When an environmental issue has been identified with respect to the property owned, leased, or otherwise used in the conduct of our business, we and our consultants perform environmental assessments on the property. We expense the cost of
the assessments as incurred. We accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated. We do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not
fixed or readily determinable.



Our environmental liability activity was as follows:

The
environmental liability includes costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as for ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties. Cost estimates are based on information available for each site,
financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, and existing technology, laws, and regulations. We believe that we have adequately accrued for our ultimate share of costs at sites subject to joint and several liability. However, the
ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved, site-specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the degree of contamination by
various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs. Estimates may also vary due to changes in federal, state, and local laws governing environmental remediation.
We do not expect current obligations to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Guarantees

– At December 31, 2005, we were contingently liable for $486 million in guarantees. We have recorded a liability of $7 million
for the fair value of these obligations as of December 31, 2005. We entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business, and they include guaranteed obligations related to our headquarters building, equipment financings,
and affiliated operations. The final guarantee expires in 2022. We are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees. We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

Income Taxes

– As previously reported in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, the IRS has completed its examinations and issued notices of deficiency for tax years 1995 through 2002. Among their proposed
adjustments is the disallowance of tax deductions claimed in connection with certain donations of property. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the IRS National Office issued a Technical Advice Memorandum which left unresolved whether the deductions were
proper, pending further factual development by the IRS Examination Team. We continue to dispute the donation issue, as well as many of the other proposed adjustments, and will contest the associated tax deficiencies through the IRS Appeals process,
and, if necessary, litigation. We do not expect that the ultimate resolution of these examinations will have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or liquidity. In addition, the IRS has begun its examination of tax
years 2003 and 2004.

Insurance Subsidiaries

– We
have two consolidated, wholly-owned subsidiaries that provide insurance coverage for certain risks including physical loss or property damage and certain other claims that are subject to reinsurance. At December 31, 2005, current accounts
receivable and current accrued casualty costs included $65 million for reinsurance receivables and reinsured liability, respectively, held by one of our insurance subsidiaries related to losses sustained during the West Coast storm in January 2005.
This amount may change in the future as facts and circumstances surrounding the claim and the reinsurance are finalized and settled. We collected a partial recovery of our claim from reinsurance of $25 million during the fourth quarter of 2005.



10. Other Income

Other income included the following for the years ended December 31:

11. Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement
No. 123(R)

.

The statement requires that we recognize compensation expense equal to the fair value of stock options or other share-based payments starting January 1, 2006. We adopted the statement on a modified prospective basis,
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options. We expect that the incremental, full-year compensation expense in 2006 related to the adoption of the statement will be approximately $13 million for new
awards granted after January 1, 2006 and an additional $2 million for the unvested portion of awards granted in prior years. The expense for awards granted after implementation of Statement No. 123(R) will be based upon their grant-date
fair value. The expense for those awards will be based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. That estimate will be revised if subsequent information indicates that the actual number of awards to vest will differ from the
estimate. The estimate does not materially impact our calculation of compensation expense.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47. This interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligations, as used in FASB Statement No. 143, refers to a legal obligation
to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing or method of settlement, or both, are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. An entity must recognize a liability for the fair value of a
conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. We assessed the impact of the interpretation on our financial statements, determined that we have a legal obligation to properly dispose of
asbestos-containing materials, and recorded a $5 million liability at December 31, 2005, for the fair value of this obligation.

In May 2005, the FASB issued FAS 154,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB
Statement No. 3.

This statement requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative
effect of the change. It carries forward without change the previous guidance for reporting the correction of an error and a change in accounting estimate. FAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2005.

In
July 2005, the FASB issued an exposure draft,

Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

. As drafted, the interpretation would require companies to recognize the best estimate of the impact of a
tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained during a tax audit. However, in November 2005 the FASB voted to replace the probable threshold with a more-likely-than-not criterion when determining if the impact of a tax position
should be recorded. The FASB expects to issue a final interpretation in the first quarter of 2006. When it is available, we will review the final interpretation to determine the impact it may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In September 2005, the FASB issued an exposure
draft,

Earnings per Share, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 128

. The draft clarifies guidance for the treasury stock method, contracts that may be settled in cash or shares,



and contingently issuable shares. The FASB expects to issue a final statement in the first quarter of 2006. We are currently reviewing this proposed exposure
draft to determine the impact it may have on our calculation of earnings per share.

In December 2005, the FASB deliberated issues relating to the limited-scope, first phase of its project to reconsider the accounting for postretirement benefits, including pensions. The FASB
decided that the objectives and scope of this phase include, among other items, recognizing the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or a liability in the statement of financial position. The FASB
expects to issue an Exposure Draft for the initial phase in the first quarter of 2006. In the second multi-year phase of the project, the FASB expects to comprehensively consider a variety of issues related to the accounting for postretirement
benefits, including expense recognition, obligation measurement, and whether postretirement benefit trusts should be consolidated by the plan sponsor. We will review the proposed standards when they are available to determine the impact they may
have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

12. Cumulative Effect of
Accounting Change

STB accounting rules require that
railroads accrue the cost of removing track structure over the expected useful life of these assets. Railroads historically used this prescribed accounting for reports filed with both the STB and SEC. In August 2001, the FASB issued FAS 143. This
statement was effective for us beginning January 1, 2003, and prohibits the accrual of removal costs unless there is a legal obligation to remove the track structure at the end of its life. We concluded that we did not have a legal obligation
to remove the track structure, and, therefore, under generally accepted accounting principles, we could not accrue the cost of removal in advance. As a result, reports filed with the SEC will reflect the expense of removing these assets in the
period in which they are removed. For STB reporting requirements only, we will continue to follow the historical method of accruing in advance, as prescribed by the STB. FAS 143 also requires us to record a liability for legally obligated asset
retirement costs associated with tangible long-lived assets. In the first quarter of 2003, we recorded income from a cumulative effect of accounting change, related to the adoption of FAS 143, of $274 million, net of income tax expense of $167
million. The accounting change had no effect on our liquidity. Had the change been retroactively applied, the change would not have had a material impact on net income and earnings per share.

13. Discontinued Operations

On November 5, 2003, we completed the sale of our entire trucking
interest through an initial public offering. As part of the offering, we received cash proceeds of $620 million, including a dividend from OTC of $128 million. As part of the transaction, OTC forgave our intercompany payable to them of $227 million,
and we received a $1 million promissory note. We recorded a gain on the sale of $211 million, including an income tax benefit of $126 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The tax benefit recognized in 2003 is associated with OTC goodwill written
off in the fourth quarter of 1998. Revenue from discontinued operations was $1,241 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Income before income taxes from discontinued operations was $74 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.



14. Selected Quarterly Data (Unaudited)

Selected unaudited quarterly data are as follows:

[a]

In the third quarter of 2005, we recorded an income tax expense reduction of $118 million.

[b]

In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recognized a $154 million after-tax charge for unasserted asbestos-related claims.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Corporation carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation’s management, including the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer
(CEO) and Executive Vice President – Finance and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15. In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and the CFO concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to
be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Additionally, the CEO and CFO determined that there have been no significant changes to the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f))
during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.



MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Union Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies (the Corporation) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). The Corporation’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Corporation’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of published financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation.

The Corporation’s
management assessed the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework.

Based on our assessment management believes that, as of December 31, 2005, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on
those criteria.

The Corporation’s
independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our assessment of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on page 75.

February 8, 2006



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Union Pacific Corporation, its Directors, and Shareholders:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Union Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies (the
Corporation) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. The Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility
of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over
financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the
Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated
financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 of the Corporation and our report dated February 17, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements and consolidated financial statement schedule.
