February 9, 2018

Fellow Shareholders:

﻿

Looking back at 2017, I can report Union Pacific made progress building long-term value for our four key stakeholders – shareholders, communities, customers, and employees. After two consecutive years of overall volume declines, Union Pacific experienced a 2 percent increase in volume. This increase in volume, coupled with positive pricing and continued productivity improvement, generated reported earnings of $13.36 per share.  After adjusting for the impact of corporate tax reform that was passed prior to year-end, our adjusted earnings were a record $5.79 per share*.  This result is a 14 percent improvement compared to last year’s $5.07 per share.  Our adjusted operating ratio was a record 63.0 percent*, or 0.5 points better than last year’s 63.5 percent.

﻿

Carloadings were up in our Industrial Products and Coal business units 12 percent and 6 percent, respectively, driven primarily by a robust increase in frac sand shipments.  Automotive shipments were down 3 percent resulting from lower domestic sales and reduced vehicle production, while Chemical and Agricultural Product shipments were both down 2 percent as we experienced declines in our crude oil volumes and grain carloadings.  Intermodal volumes were flat compared to 2016.

We faced several operational challenges during 2017, from significant flooding in the western portion of our network, to the unprecedented rain and flooding that accompanied Hurricane Harvey.  Despite these challenges, the men and women of Union Pacific worked tirelessly and heroically to safely serve our customers.  I am pleased with our results and look forward to continuing to build long-term enterprise value by building our Value Tracks.

﻿

Starting with

World Class Safety

, 2017 was another outstanding year for employee safety performance.  Our reportable personal injury rate of 0.79 was off slightly from last year’s all-time record low of 0.75.  Our ultimate goal is zero incidents, getting every one of our employees home safely at the end of each day.  We will maintain a relentless focus on data-driven processes and root-cause evaluations, as well as on internal safety programs such as Total Safety Culture and Courage to Care.

﻿

We have built centers of excellence around game-changing technology and other

Innovation

initiatives. Our

Engaged Team

is inspiring passion and dedication while leveraging diverse talents to extract the best ideas that will drive positive results across our Company.  The continued implementation and execution of our “Grow to 55 and Zero” initiative drives significant

Resource Productivity

, from successfully aligning our resources to meet the increase in demand, to being more efficient in virtually everything that we do across the entire organization.

﻿

Given the challenges I mentioned above, our service product in 2017 did not meet all our customers’ expectations, but we kept working to create an

Excellent Customer Experience

, anticipating customer needs, responding quickly, keeping commitments, and offering solutions.  Our robust capital program helps provide the necessary resources and network capacity to build these relationships and prepare for future growth.  It enables us to handle our business safely and efficiently, while improving network fluidity.  We invested about $3.1 billion in 2017, including about $1.9 billion in replacement capital to harden our infrastructure, and to improve the safety and resiliency of our network, as well as nearly $340 million toward completing our Positive Train Control project.

﻿

A

Maximized Franchise

is much more than our unique physical footprint.  It encompasses our employees’ skills, our assets, and a strategy that emphasizes the importance of our customers’ experiences.  It also embraces a thoughtful approach to market penetration, the competitive landscape to determine future service offerings and to identify trade flow opportunities.

﻿

This successful execution of our value track strategy to the benefit of all our stakeholders translates into value for our shareholders.  Total shareholder return increased 32 percent in 2017, compared with 22 percent for the S&P 500. Our net return on invested capital* of 13.7 percent increased a full percentage point over last year’s 12.7 percent.  We increased our quarterly declared dividend per share by 10 percent, with dividends paid in 2017 totaling $2.0 billion.  In addition, we repurchased 36 million Union Pacific shares.  In total, combining both dividends and share repurchases, Union Pacific returned $6 billion to our shareholders in 2017.

﻿

Looking to 2018, we are optimistic the economy will favor many of the segments which drive our core business, leading us to another year of positive volume growth.  We will continue to execute on our Value Tracks to benefit our employees, partner with the communities in which we serve, provide our customers an excellent experience, and generate strong returns for our shareholders.

﻿

OPERATIONS

﻿

The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable operating segment. Although we provide revenue by commodity group, we analyze the net financial results of the Railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of our rail network. Additional information regarding our business and operations, including revenue and financial information and data and other information regarding environmental matters, is presented in Risk Factors, Item 1A; Legal Proceedings, Item 3; Selected Financial Data, Item 6; Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 7; and the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 (which include information regarding revenues, statements of income, and total assets).

﻿

﻿


Operations

–

UPRR is a Class I railroad operating in the U.S. We

have 32,122 route

miles, linking Pacific Coast and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest and eastern U.S. gateways and providing several corridors to key Mexican gateways. We serve the Western two-thirds of the country and maintain coordinated schedules with other rail carriers to move freight to and from the Atlantic Coast, the Pacific Coast, the Southeast, the Southwest, Canada, and Mexico. Export and import traffic moves through Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast ports and across the Mexican and Canadian borders. Our freight traffic consists of bulk,

2017 Freight Revenue

manifest, and premium business. Bulk traffic primarily consists of coal, grain, soda ash, ethanol, rock and crude oil shipped in unit trains – trains transporting a single commodity from one origin to one destination. Manifest traffic includes individual carload or less than train-load business involving commodities such as lumber, steel, paper, food and chemicals. The transportation of finished vehicles, auto parts, intermodal containers and truck trailers are included as part of our premium business. In 2017, we generated freight revenues

totaling $19.8 billion

from the following six commodity groups:

﻿

Agricultural Products

– Transportation of grains, commodities produced from these grains, and food and beverage products

generated 19%

of

the Railroad’s 2017 freight revenue. We access most major grain markets, linking the Midwest and Western U.S. producing areas to export terminals in the Pacific Northwest and Gulf Coast ports, as well as Mexico. We also serve significant domestic markets, including grain processors, animal feeders and ethanol producers in the Midwest, West, South and Rocky Mountain states. Unit trains, which

transport a single commodity between producers and export terminals or domestic markets, represent approximately 41% of our agricultural shipments.

﻿

Automotive

– We are the largest automotive carrier west of the Mississippi River and operate or access 38 vehicle distribution centers. The Railroad’s extensive franchise serves five vehicle assembly plants and connects to West Coast ports, all six major Mexico gateways, and the Port of Houston to accommodate both import and export shipments. In addition to transporting finished vehicles, UPRR provides expedited handling of automotive parts in both boxcars and intermodal containers destined for Mexico, the U.S. and Canada. The automotive group generated 10% of Union Pacific’s freight revenue in 2017.

﻿

Chemicals

– Transporting chemicals generated 18% of our freight revenue in 2017. The Railroad’s unique franchise serves the chemical producing areas along the Gulf Coast, where roughly 5


% of the Company’s chemical business originates, travels through, or terminates. Our chemical franchise also accesses chemical producers in the Rocky Mountains and on the West Coast. The Company’s chemical shipments include six categories:  industrial chemicals, plastics, fertilizer, petroleum and liquid petroleum gases, crude oil and soda ash. Currently, these products move primarily to and from the Gulf Coast region. Fertilizer movements originate in the Gulf Coast region, the western U.S. and Canada (through interline access) for delivery to major agricultural users in the Midwest, western U.S., as well as abroad. Soda ash originates in southwestern Wyoming and California, destined for chemical and glass producing markets in North America and abroad.

﻿

Coal

– Shipments of coal, petroleum coke, and biomass accounted for 13% of our freight revenue in 2017. The Railroad’s network supports the transportation of coal, petroleum coke, and biomass to independent and regulated power companies and industrial facilities throughout the U.S. Through interchange gateways and ports, UPRR’s reach extends to eastern U.S. utilities, as well as to Mexico and other international destinations. Coal traffic originating in the Powder River Basin (PRB) area of Wyoming is the largest segment of the Railroad’s coal business.

﻿

Industrial Products

– Our extensive network facilitates the movement of numerous commodities between thousands of origin and destination points throughout North America. The Industrial Products group consists of several categories, including construction products, minerals, consumer goods, metals, lumber, paper, and other miscellaneous products.  In 2017, this group generated 21% of our total freight revenue. Commercial, residential and governmental infrastructure investments drive shipments of steel, aggregates (cement components), cement and wood products.  Oil and gas drilling generates demand for raw steel, finished pipe, frac sand, stone and drilling fluid commodities. Industrial and light manufacturing plants


receive steel, nonferrous materials, minerals and other raw materials. Paper and packaging commodities, as well as appliances, move to major metropolitan areas for consumers. Lumber shipments originate primarily in the Pacific Northwest and western Canada and move throughout the U.S. for use in new home construction and repair and remodeling.

﻿

Intermodal

– Our Intermodal business includes two segments: international and domestic. International business consists of import and export container traffic that mainly passes through West Coast ports served by UPRR’s extensive terminal network. Domestic business includes container and trailer traffic picked up and delivered within North America for intermodal marketing companies (primarily shipper agents and logistics companies), as well as truckload carriers. Less-than-truckload and package carriers with time-sensitive business requirements are also an important part of domestic shipments. Together, our international and domestic Intermodal business

generated 19% of our

2017 freight revenue.

﻿

Seasonality

– Some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons, reflecting either or both the nature of the commodity and the demand cycle for the commodity (such as certain agricultural and food products that have specific growing and harvesting seasons). The peak shipping seasons for these commodities can vary considerably each year depending upon various factors, including the strength of domestic and international economies and currencies and the strength of harvests and market prices for agricultural products.

﻿

Working Capital

–

At December 31, 2017, we

had a working capital

surplus. We

maintain adequate resources, and when necessary, have adequate access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements, in addition to sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities. At December 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit, due primarily to a decrease in other current assets related to a tax receivable for the late extension of bonus depreciation at December 31, 2015, along with an increase at December 31, 2016, in accounts payable and upcoming debt maturities.

﻿

Competition

– We are subject to competition from other railroads, motor carriers, ship and barge operators, and pipelines. Our main railroad competitor is Burlington Northern Santa Fe LLC. Its primary subsidiary, BNSF Railway Company (BNSF), operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors. In addition, we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers. Motor carrier competition exists for five of our six commodity groups (excluding most coal shipments). Because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and Gulf Coast waterways, barges can be particularly competitive, especially for grain and bulk commodities in certain areas where we operate. In addition to price competition, we face competition with respect to transit times, quality and reliability of service from motor carriers and other railroads. Motor carriers in particular can have an advantage over railroads with respect to transit times and timeliness of service.  However, railroads are much more fuel-efficient than trucks, which reduces the impact of transporting goods on the environment and public infrastructure, and we have been making efforts to convert certain truck traffic to rail.  Additionally, we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system; trucks and barges are able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities. Any of the following could also affect the competitiveness of our transportation services for some or all of our commodities: (i) improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation, (ii) legislation that eliminates or significantly increases the size or weight limitations applied to motor carriers, or (iii) legislation or regulatory changes that impose operating restrictions on railroads or that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic.

Finally, many movements face product or geographic competition where our customers can use different products (e.g. natural gas instead of coal, sorghum instead of corn) or commodities from different locations (e.g. grain from states or countries that we do not serve

,

crude oil from different regions). Sourcing different commodities or different locations allows shippers to substitute different carriers and such competition may reduce our volume or constrain prices.

For more information regarding risks we face from competition, see the Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report.

﻿

Key Suppliers

– We depend on two key domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives. Both suppliers provide parts for locomotives and one also provides maintenance under a service agreement. Due to the capital intensive nature of the locomotive manufacturing business and sophistication of this equipment, potential new suppliers face high barriers of entry into this industry. Therefore, if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives, supplying parts or providing maintenance for any reason, including insolvency or bankruptcy, we could experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations. Additionally, for a high percentage of our rail purchases, we utilize two steel producers (one domestic and one international) that meet our specifications. Rail is critical for maintenance, replacement, improvement, and expansion of our network and facilities. Rail manufacturing also has high barriers of entry, and, if one of those suppliers


discontinues operations for any reason, including insolvency or bankruptcy, we could experience cost increases and difficulty obtaining rail.

﻿

Employees

–

Approximately 85% of our 41,992 full-time-equivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions.

On January 1, 2015, current labor agreements became subject to modification and we began the current round of negotiations with the unions. Existing agreements remain in effect until new agreements are ratified or the Railway Labor Act’s (RLA) procedures (which include mediation, potential arbitration, cooling-off periods, and the possibility of Presidential Emergency Boards and Congressiona

l intervention) are exhausted.

Through industry and local negotiations, UPRR reached tentative new agreements with 12

of our 14 major rail unions.

Nine unions (representing nearly 70% of our agreement work force) have ratified those agre

ements by significant margins.

The tentative agreement failed ratification with two unions in early February 2018 (representing about 10% of our agreement work force) returning any further discussions with them to the jurisdiction o

f the National Mediation Board.

Another small union (less than 1%)

is still out for ratification.

UPRR and the industry currently continue in active mediation with the remaining coalition of two unions (representing about 20% of our agreement work force).

Under the Railway Labor Act, the National Mediation Board controls timing and location of mediation conferences and when to terminate mediation, moving the parties to the next stages of the RLA process.  Contract negotiations historically continue for an extended period of time and we rarely experience work stoppages while negotiations are pending.

﻿

Railroad Security

– Our security efforts consist of a wide variety of measures including employee training, engagement with our customers, training of emergency responders, and partnerships with numerous federal, state, and local government agencies.  While federal law requires us to protect the confidentiality of our security plans designed to safeguard against terrorism and other security incidents, the following provides a general overview of our security initiatives.

﻿

UPRR Security Measures

– We maintain a comprehensive security plan designed to both deter and respond to any potential or actual threats as they arise.  The plan includes four levels of alert status, each with its own set of countermeasures.  We employ our own police force, consisting

of more than


commissioned and highly-trained officers. Our employees also undergo recurrent security and preparedness training, as well as federally-mandated hazardous materials and security training. We regularly review the sufficiency of our employee training programs. We maintain the capability to move critical operations to back-up facilities in different locations.

﻿

We operate an emergency response management center 24 hours a day.  The center receives reports of emergencies, dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions, and other safety and security issues from our employees, the public, law enforcement and other government officials.  In cooperation with government officials, we monitor both threats and public events, and, as necessary, we may alter rail traffic flow at times of concern to minimize risk to communities and our operations.  We comply with the hazardous materials routing rules and other requirements imposed by federal law.  We also design our operating plan to expedite the movement of hazardous material shipments to minimize the time rail cars remain idle at yards and terminals located in or near major population centers.  Additionally, in compliance with Transportation Security Agency regulations, we deployed information systems and instructed employees in tracking and documenting the handoff of Rail Security Sensitive Materials with customers and interchange partners.

﻿

We also have established a number of our own innovative safety and security-oriented initiatives ranging from various investments in technology to The Officer on Train program, which provides local law enforcement officers with the opportunity to ride with train crews to enhance their understanding of railroad operations and risks. Our staff of information security professionals continually assesses cyber security risks and implements mitigation programs that evolve with the changing technology threat environment. To date, we have not experienced any material disruption of our operations due to a cyber threat or attack directed at us.

﻿

Cooperation with Federal, State, and Local Government Agencies

– We work closely on physical and cyber security initiatives with government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as well as local police departments, fire departments, and other first responders.  In conjunction with the Association of American Railroads (AAR), we sponsor Ask Rail, a mobile application which provides first responders with secure links to electronic information, including commodity and emergency response information required by emergency personnel to respond to accidents and other situations.  We also participate in the National Joint Terrorism Task Force, a multi-agency effort established by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to combat and prevent terrorism.


﻿

We work with the Coast Guard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and the Military Transport Management Command, which monitor shipments entering the UPRR rail network at U.S. border crossings and ports.  We were the first railroad in the U.S. to be named a partner in CBP’s Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism, a partnership designed to develop, enhance, and maintain effective security processes throughout the global supply chain.

﻿

Cooperation with Customers and Trade Associations

–

Through TransCAER (Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response) we work with the AAR, the American Chemistry Council, the American Petroleum Institute, and other chemical trade groups to provide communities with preparedness tools, including the training of emergency responders.  In cooperation with the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and other interested groups, we are also working to develop additional improvements to tank car design that will further limit the risk of releases of hazardous materials.

﻿

GOVERNMENTAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

﻿

Governmental Regulation

–

Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local regulations, generally applicable to all businesses.  (See also the discussion of certain regulatory proceedings in Legal Proceedings, Item 3.)

﻿

The operations of the Railroad are also subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (STB).  The STB has jurisdiction over rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic; common carrier service of regulated traffic; freight car

compensation; transfer, extension, or abandonment of rail lines; and acquisition of control of

rail common carriers. The STB continues

its efforts to explore expanding rail regulation and is reviewing proposed rulemaking in various areas, including reciprocal switching, commodity exemptions, and expanding and easing procedures for smaller rate complaints. The STB also continues to develop a methodology for determining railroad revenue adequacy and the possible use of a revenue adequacy constraint in regulating railroad rates.

The STB

post

s

quarterly reports on rate reasonableness cases and maintain

s

a database on service complaints, and

has the

authority to initiate investigations, among other things.

﻿

The operations of the Railroad also are subject to the regulations of the FRA and other federal and state agencies. In 2010, the FRA issued initial rules governing installation of Positive Train Control (PTC)

that now has a

deadline

of

December 31, 2018. The PTC implementation deadline may be extended to December 31, 2020, provided certain other criteria are satisfied. PTC is a collision avoidance technology intended to override engineer controlled locomotives and stop train-to-train and overspeed accidents, misaligned switch derailments, and unauthorized entry to work zones.

Final implementation of PTC will require us to adapt and integrate our system with other railroads whose implementation plan may be different than ours.

Through 2017, we have invested approximately

$2.6 billion

in the ongoing development of PTC.

﻿

DOT, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, and DHS, along with other federal agencies, have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety, movement of hazardous materials and hazardous waste, emissions requirements, and equipment standards. Additionally, various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law

.

﻿

Environmental Regulation

– We are subject to extensive federal and state environmental statutes and regulations pertaining to public health and the environment. The statutes and regulations are administered and monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and by various state environmental agencies. The primary laws affecting our operations are the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties; the Clean Air Act, regulating air emissions; and the Clean Water Act, regulating waste water discharges.

﻿

Information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Environmental, Item 7 and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Risk Factors

﻿

The information set forth in this Item 1A should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this report, including Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 7, and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8.

﻿

We Must Manage Fluctuating Demand for Our Services and Network Capacity

– If there are significant reductions in demand for rail services with respect to one or more commodities or changes in consumer preferences that affect the businesses of our customers, we may experience increased costs associated with resizing our operations, including higher unit operating costs and costs for the storage of locomotives, rail cars, and other equipment; work-force adjustments; and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. If there is significant demand for our services that exceeds the designed capacity of our network, we may experience network difficulties, including congestion and reduced velocity, that could compromise the level of service we provide to our customers. This level of demand may also compound the impact of weather and weather-related events on our operations and velocity. Although we continue to improve our transportation plan, add capacity, improve operations at our yards and other facilities, and improve our ability to address surges in demand for any reason with adequate resources, we cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address any service shortcomings resulting from demand exceeding our planned capacity.  We may experience other operational or service difficulties related to network capacity, dramatic and unplanned fluctuations in our customers’ demand for rail service with respect to one or more commodities or operating regions, or other events that could negatively impact our operational efficiency, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

﻿

We Transport Hazardous Materials

– We transport certain hazardous materials and other materials, including crude oil, ethanol, and toxic inhalation hazard (TIH) materials, such as chlorine, that pose certain risks in the event of a release or combustion. Additionally, U.S. laws impose common carrier obligations on railroads that require us to transport certain hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss. A rail accident or other incident or accident on our network, at our facilities, or at the facilities of our customers involving the release or combustion of hazardous materials could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury, property damage, and environmental penalties and remediation in excess of our insurance coverage for these risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

﻿

We Are Subject to Significant Governmental Regulation

– We are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal, state, and local authorities covering a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental, economic (as discussed below), and other matters.  Many laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses, permits, and other authorizations, and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. Governments or regulators may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects on our business, including, without limitation, regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution, increasing the amount of our traffic subject to common carrier regulation, business relationships with other railroads, calculation of our cost of capital or other inputs relevant to computing our revenue adequacy, the prices we charge, and costs and expenses. Significant legislative activity in Congress or regulatory activity by the STB could expand regulation of railroad operations and prices for rail services, which could reduce capital spending on our rail network, facilities and equipment and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and

liquidity. As part of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, rail carriers

were to

implement PTC by the end of

2015 (the Rail Safety Improvement Act).  The Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2015 amended the Rail Safety Improvement Act to require implementation of PTC by the end of 2018,

which deadline may be extended to December

31, 2020, provided certain other criteria are satisfied.  Final implementation of PTC will require us to adapt and integrate our system with other railroads whose implementation plan may be different than ours.  This implementation

could have a material

adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

. Additionally, one or more consolidations of Class I railroads could also lead to increased regulation of the rail industry.

﻿

We May Be Affected by General Economic Conditions

– Prolonged severe adverse domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of financial and credit markets may affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry and may have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity and our results of operations and financial condition.

﻿


We Face Competition from Other Railroads and Other Transportation Providers

– We face competition from other railroads, motor carriers, ships, barges, and pipelines. In addition to price competition, we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service. We must build or acquire and maintain our rail system, while trucks, barges and maritime operators are able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation, or legislation that eliminates or significantly increases the size or weight limitations currently applicable to motor carriers, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Additionally, any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect the competitive environment in which we operate.

﻿

We Rely on Technology and Technology Improvements in Our Business Operations

– We rely on information technology in all aspects of our business. If we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are unable to develop or implement new technology such as PTC or the latest version of our transportation control systems, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Additionally, if a cyber attack or other event causes significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems, including computer hardware, software, and communications equipment, we could suffer a significant service interruption, safety failure, security breach, or other operational difficulties, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

﻿

We May Be Subject to Various Claims and Lawsuits That Could Result in Significant Expenditures

– As a railroad with operations in densely populated urban areas and other cities and a vast rail network, we are exposed to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, property damage, environmental liability, and other matters. Any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage, personal injury, and environmental liability that exceed our insurance coverage for such risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

﻿

We Are Subject to Significant Environmental Laws and Regulations

– Due to the nature of the railroad business, our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air; discharges to waters; handling, storage, transportation, disposal of waste and other materials; and hazardous material or petroleum releases. We generate and transport hazardous and non-hazardous waste in our operations, and we did so in our former operations. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties, leased properties, and properties owned by third parties, as well as to properties we currently own. Environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation. We have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated, or are strictly liable under, these laws or regulations. We currently have certain obligations at existing sites for investigation, remediation and monitoring, and we likely will have obligations at other sites in the future.  Liabilities for these obligations affect our estimate based on our experience and, as necessary, the advice and assistance of our consultants.  However, actual costs may vary from our estimates due to any or all of several factors, including changes to environmental laws or interpretations of such laws, technological changes affecting investigations and remediation, the participation and financial viability of other parties responsible for any such liability and the corrective action or change to corrective actions required to remediate any existing or future sites. We could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing, and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown, or future environmental contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

﻿

We May Be Affected by Climate Change and Market or Regulatory Responses to Climate Change

– Climate change, including the impact of global warming, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.  Restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gasses, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs.  Restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that (a) use commodities that we carry to produce energy, (b) use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry, or (c) manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels, including chemical producers, farmers and food producers, and automakers and other manufacturers.  Significant cost increases, government regulation, or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.  Government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of


energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns, including, for example,

increasing royalties charged to producers of PRB coal by the U.S. Department of Interior and

the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers. Finally, we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change.  Any of these factors, individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors, or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

﻿

Severe Weather Could Result in Significant Business Interruptions and Expenditures

– As a railroad with a vast network, we are exposed to severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, mudslides or landslides, extreme temperatures, and significant precipitation. Line outages and other interruptions caused by these conditions can adversely affect our entire rail network and can adversely affect revenue, costs, and liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

﻿

Strikes or Work Stoppages Could Adversely Affect Our Operations

– The U.S. Class I railroads are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. The majority of our employees belong to labor unions and are subject to these agreements. Disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, or lockouts, which could cause a significant disruption of our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Additionally, future national labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, could compromise our service reliability or significantly increase our costs for health care, wages, and other benefits, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.  Labor disputes, work stoppages, slowdowns or lockouts at loading/unloading facilities, ports or other transport access points could compromise our service reliability and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.  Labor disputes, work stoppages, slowdowns or lockouts by employees of our customers or our suppliers could compromise our service reliability and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

﻿

The Availability of Qualified Personnel Could Adversely Affect Our Operations

– Changes in demographics, training requirements, and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to meet demand for rail service. Unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

﻿

We May Be Affected By Fluctuating Fuel Prices

– Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses. Diesel fuel prices can be subject to dramatic fluctuations, and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our fuel expenses from our customers through revenue from fuel surcharges, we cannot be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through our fuel surcharges. Additionally, future market conditions or legislative or regulatory activities could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharges or adequately recover increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges. As fuel prices fluctuate, our fuel surcharge programs trail such fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months, and may be a significant source of quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year volatility, particularly in periods of rapidly changing prices. International, political, and economic factors, events and conditions affect the volatility of fuel prices and supplies. Weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity. A severe shortage of, or disruption to, domestic fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.  Alternatively, lower fuel prices could have a positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer products we transport. However, lower fuel prices could have a negative impact on other commodities we transport, such as coal and domestic drilling-related shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

﻿

We Utilize Capital Markets

– Due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad, we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements.  We utilize long-term debt instruments, bank financing and commercial paper from time-to-time, and we pledge certain of our receivables.  Significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including the credit markets, or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit


our access to, and significantly increase the cost of, commercial paper and other financing sources, including bank credit facilities and the issuance of long-term debt, including corporate bonds. A significant deterioration of our financial condition could result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade, which could restrict, or at certain credit levels below investment grade may prohibit us, from utilizing our current receivables securitization facility. This may also limit our access to external sources of capital and significantly increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.

﻿

A Significant Portion of Our Revenue Involves Transportation of Commodities to and from International Markets

– Although revenues from our operations are attributable to transportation services provided in the U.S., a significant portion of our revenues involves the transportation of commodities to and from international markets, including Mexico and Southeast Asia, by various carriers and, at times, various modes of transportation. Significant and sustained interruptions of trade with Mexico or countries in Southeast Asia, including China, could adversely affect customers and other entities that, directly or indirectly, purchase or rely on rail transportation services in the U.S. as part of their operations, and any such interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Any one or more of the following could cause a significant and sustained interruption of trade with Mexico or countries in Southeast Asia: (a) a deterioration of security for international trade and businesses; (b) the adverse impact of new laws, rules and regulations or the interpretation of laws, rules and regulations by government entities, courts or regulatory bodies, including modifications to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and actions of taxing authorities that affect our customers doing business in foreign countries; (c) any significant adverse economic developments, such as extended periods of high inflation, material disruptions in the banking sector or in the capital markets of these foreign countries, and significant changes in the valuation of the currencies of these foreign countries that could materially affect the cost or value of imports or exports; (d) shifts in patterns of international trade that adversely affect import and export markets; and (e) a material reduction in foreign direct investment in these countries.

﻿

We Are Subject to Legislative, Regulatory, and Legal Developments Involving Taxes

– Taxes are a significant part of our expenses.  We are subject to U.S. federal, state, and foreign income, payroll, property, sales and use, fuel, and other types of taxes. Changes in tax rates,

such as those included in the recently enacted U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enactment of new tax laws, revisions of tax regulations, and claims or litigation with taxing authorities could result in a material effect to our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.  Higher tax rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

﻿

We Are Dependent on Certain Key Suppliers of Locomotives and Rail

– Due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment, parts and maintenance, potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry.  Therefore, if one of the domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives discontinues manufacturing locomotives, supplying parts or providing maintenance for any reason, including bankruptcy or insolvency, we could experience significant cost increases and reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary for our operations.  Additionally, for a high percentage of our rail purchases, we utilize two steel producers (one domestic and one international) that meet our specifications.  Rail is critical to our operations for rail replacement programs, maintenance, and for adding additional network capacity, new rail and storage yards, and expansions of existing facilities.  This industry similarly has high barriers to entry, and if one of these suppliers discontinues operations for any reason, including bankruptcy or insolvency, we could experience both significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail for maintenance and other projects.

﻿

We May Be Affected by Acts of Terrorism, War, or Risk of War

– Our rail lines, facilities, and equipment, including rail cars carrying hazardous materials, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks. Terrorist attacks, or other similar events, any government response thereto, and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In addition, insurance premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically, or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future.

﻿

HEADQUARTERS BUILDING

﻿

We own our headquarters building in Omaha, Nebraska. The facility has 1.2 million square feet of space that can accommodate approximately 4,000 employees.

﻿

HARRIMAN DISPATCHING CENTER

﻿

The Harriman Dispatching Center (HDC), located in Omaha, Nebraska, is our primary dispatching facility. It is linked to regional dispatching and locomotive management facilities at various locations along our network. HDC employees coordinate moves of locomotives and trains, manage traffic and train crews on


our network, and coordinate interchanges with other railroads. Approximately


employees currently work on-site in the facility. In the event of a disruption of operations at HDC due to a cybe

r attack, flooding or severe weather or other event, we maintain the capability to conduct critical operations at back-up facilities in different locations.

﻿

RAIL FACILITIES

﻿

In addition to our track structure, we operate numerous facilities, including terminals for intermodal and other freight; rail yards for building trains (classification yards), switching, storage-in-transit (the temporary storage of customer goods in rail cars prior to shipment) and other activities; offices to administer and manage our operations; dispatching centers to direct traffic on our rail network; crew quarters to house train crews along our network; and shops and other facilities for fueling, maintenance, and repair of locomotives and repair and maintenance of rail cars and other equipment.  The following table includes the major yards and terminals on our system:

﻿

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

﻿

Our rail network requires significant annual capital investments for replacement, improvement, and expansion. These investments enhance safety, support the transportation needs of our customers, and improve our operational efficiency. Additionally, we add new locomotives and freight cars to our fleet to replace older, less efficient equipment, to support growth and customer demand, and to reduce our impact on the environment through the acquisition of more fuel-efficient and low-emission locomotives.

﻿


Capital Program

– During 2017, our capital

program totaled approximately $3.1 billion. (See the cash capital expenditures table in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources, Item 7.)

﻿

2018 Capital Plan

–

In 2018, we expect our capital plan to be approximately $3.3 billion.  The plan includes expenditures to renew and improve our existing infrastructure as well as new capacity investments, including initial construction work on a new classification yard in our Southern Region.  In addition, expenditures will be made for PTC, locomotives, intermodal containers and chassis, and freight cars.  We may revise our 2018 capital plan if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments.  (See discussion of our 2018 capital plan in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – 2018 Outlook, Item 7.)

﻿

OTHER

﻿

Equipment Encumbrances

– Equipment with a carrying value of

approximately $2.0 billion

and $2.3 billion at

December 31, 2017, and 2016,

respectively served as collateral for capital leases and other types of equipment obligations in accordance with the secured financing arrangements utilized to acquire or refinance such railroad equipment.

﻿

As a result of the merger of Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (MPRR) with and into UPRR on January 1, 1997, and pursuant to the underlying indentures for the MPRR mortgage bonds, UPRR must maintain the same value of assets after the merger in order to comply with the security requirements of the mortgage bonds. As of the merger date, the value of the MPRR assets that secured the mortgage bonds was approximately $6.0 billion. In accordance with the terms of the indentures, this collateral value must be maintained during the entire term of the mortgage bonds irrespective of the outstanding balance of such bonds.

﻿

Environmental Matters

– Certain of our properties are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment.

Legal Proceedings

﻿

From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and litigation that occur in connection with our business. We routinely assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest available information and, when necessary, we seek input from our third-party advisors when making these assessments. Consistent with SEC rules and requirements, we describe below material pending legal proceedings (other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business), material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities, other proceedings arising under federal, state, or local environmental laws and regulations (including governmental proceedings involving potential fines, penalties, or other monetary sanctions in excess of $100,000), and such other pending matters that we may determine to be appropriate.

﻿


ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

﻿

We receive notices from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are or may be liable under federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the U.S., including sites on the Superfund National Priorities List or state superfund lists. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs.

﻿

On May 2, 2015, a UPRR train en route from Chicago, IL. to St. Louis, MO. experienced an accidental

release of diesel fuel in the vicinity of Sidney, IL. It is believed that the release was caused by a puncture

to a fuel tank under one or more of the locomotives attached to the train. The impacted fuel tank(s) released the majority of their contents onto the ground, approximately 400 feet from an unnamed creek. Some of the fuel migrated into that creek, which discharges to the Salt Fork River. We immediately notified federal, state and local authorities and dispatched our own emergency response resources to the scene. On May 29, 2015, we entered into an agreed-upon interim order to perform a comprehensive site investigation and remedial measures at the release site. On March 13, 2017, the State of Illinois issued a demand for $125,000 in civil penalties as part of the ongoing enforcement action. We are currently evaluating the State's demand.

﻿

Information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Environmental, Item 7.  See also Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

﻿

OTHER MATTERS

﻿

Antitrust Litigation

–

As we reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, 20 rail shippers (many of whom are represented by the same law firms) filed virtually identical antitrust lawsuits in various federal district courts against us and four other Class I railroads in the U.S. Currently, UPRR and three other Class I railroads are the named defendants in the lawsuit. The original plaintiff filed the first of these claims in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey on May 14, 2007. The number of complaints reached a total of 30. These suits allege that the named railroads engaged in price-fixing by establishing common fuel surcharges for certain rail traffic.

On June 21, 2012, Judge Friedman issued a decision that certified a class of plaintiffs with eight named plaintiff representatives. The decision included in the class all shippers that paid a rate-based fuel surcharge to any one of the defendant railroads for rate-unregulated rail transportation from July 1, 2003, through December 31, 2008. On July 5, 2012, the defendant railroads filed a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia requesting that the court review the class certification ruling. On August 9, 2013, the Circuit Court vacated the class certification decision and remanded the case to the district court to reconsider the class certification decision in light of a recent Supreme Court case and incomplete consideration of errors in the expert report of the plaintiffs. After reviewing an intervening case, supplemental expert materials and related briefing from the parties, Judge Friedman scheduled and completed a new class certification hearing during the week of September 26, 2016. On October 10, 2017, the parties received a ruling from Judge Friedman denying class certification.

Plaintiffs have sought appellate review of that ruling and on December 20, 2017, were granted the right of an interlocutory appeal by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

﻿

As we reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on June 10, 2011, the Railroad received a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on June 7, 2011, by Oxbow Carbon & Minerals LLC and related entities (

Oxbow

).  The parties are currently conducting discovery in this matter.

For additional information on Oxbow, please refer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings, under Other Matters, Antitrust Litigation in

our

Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.

﻿

We continue to deny the allegations that our fuel surcharge programs violate the antitrust laws or any other laws. We believe that these lawsuits are without merit, and we will vigorously defend our actions. Therefore, we currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and applicable notes to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8, and other information in this report, including Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A and Critical Accounting Policies and Cautionary Information at the end of this Item 7.

﻿

The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable business segment. Although revenue is analyzed by commodity, we analyze the net financial results of the Railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of the rail network.

﻿

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

﻿


Results

﻿

·

Safety

– During


, we continued our focus on safety to reduce risk and eliminate incidents for our employees, our customers and the public.

We finished 2017 with a 3% improvement in our reportable derailment incident rate per million train miles compared to 2016.   Although reportable personal injury incidents per 200,000 employee-hours increased 5% from last year’s record low, it is our second lowest year and a 9% decrease from 2015. Despite our efforts in 2017, our crossing incidents rate increased 5% from 2016.  Overall, our 2017 safety results reflect our employees’ dedication to our safety initiatives and our efforts to further engage the workforce through programs such as Courage to Care, Total Safety Culture, and UP Way (our continuous improvement culture).

Network Operations

–

O

ur average train speed, as reported to the

AAR,

decreased

5%

compared

to 2016

, and our average terminal dwell time

increased 8

% from


.  D

isruptions across our network, including the impact of Hurricane Harvey, negatively impacted network fluidity.  Continued implementation and testing of Positive Train

Control across a growing number of routes in

our network also negatively impacted overall average train speed

and terminal dwell

.

Network operational challenges in the latter part of the year also negatively impacted terminal dwell.

Tax Reform

– The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017.  The Tax Act reduced the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.  As a result, we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities which resulted in a $5.9 billion non-cash reduction in our income tax expense in 2017.  In addition, we recognized a $212 million non-cash reduction to operating expense related to income tax adjustments recognized at certain equity-method affiliates.  See Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

For comparability purposes, the following table reconciles our full year 2017 reported results under

accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.

(GAAP) to our 2017 adjusted results (non-GAAP) for the tax related items described above.  We believe the adjusted results provide relevant information to our investors as they more accurately reflect on-going financial performance.  In addition, these measures should be considered in addition to, and not a substitute for operating income, income taxes, net income, diluted EPS, operating ratio, and effective tax rate.

Adjusted Results

Non-GAAP

–

In 2017

, we ge

nerated adjusted operating income of more than

$7.8 billion, an 8% increase

c

ompared to 2016.  Volume growth of 2

%, combined with core pricing

a

nd productivity

gains

, generated

solid

financial

performance improvement and more than offset $86 million of operating expense associated with our workforce reduction plan implemented in the third quarter of 2017.  Our 2017 adjusted operating ratio

was an all-time record

63.0%, improving 0.5 points from 2016.


Adjusted net income of

$4.6

billion translated into

adjusted

e

arnings

of

$5.79

per diluted share, a best-ever performance.

·

Freight Revenues

–

Our freight revenues increased


% year-over-year to $

19.8

billion

driven by volume growth of 2%,

higher fuel surcharge revenue, and core pricing gains.

Growth in frac sand, coal, and intermodal shipments more than offset

declines in grain,

crude oil

, finished vehicles, and rock shipments.

﻿

·

Fuel Prices

– Our average price

of diesel fuel in 2017

was $1.81 per gallon, an in

crea

se of

22%

from

2016, as both crude

oil and conversion spreads between crude oil and diesel

increased in 2017. The higher price

resulted in increased operating expenses of

$


million (excluding any impact from year-over-year volume

growth

).

Gross-ton miles

increased


%, which also

drove higher f

uel expense.

Our

fuel consumption rate, computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles in thousands

,

improved

2%

.

﻿

·

Free Cash Flow

– Cash generated by o

perating activities

totaled

$7.2

billion, yielding free cash flow of

$2.2

billion after reductions of

$3.1

billion for cash used in in

vesting activities

and

$2 billion in dividends, which included

a 10% increase

in

our

quarterly dividend per share

from $0.


to $0.6


5 declared

and paid in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid.

﻿

Free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under

GAAP

by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe free cash flow is important to management and investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financings. Free cash flow should be considered in addition

to, rather than as a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure):

﻿


Outlook

﻿

·

Safety

–

Operating a safe railroad benefits all our constituents: our employees, customers, shareholders and the communities we serve.  We will continue using a multi-faceted approach to safety, utilizing technology, risk assessment, training and employee engagement, quality control, and targeted capital investments.  We will continue using and expanding the deployment of Total Safety Culture and Courage to Care throughout our operations, which allows us to identify and implement best practices for employee and operational safety.  We will continue our efforts to increase detection of rail defects; improve or close crossings; and educate the public and law enforcement agencies about crossing safety through a combination of our own programs (including risk assessment strategies), industry programs and local community activities across our network.

﻿

·

Network Operations

–

In 2018, we will continue to align resources with customer demand, maintain an efficient network, and ensure surge capability

of

our assets.

﻿

·

Fuel Prices

–

Fuel price projections for crude oil and natural gas continue to fluctuate in the current environment.  We again could see volatile fuel prices during the year, as they are sensitive to global and U.S. domestic demand, refining capacity, geopolitical events, weather conditions and other factors.  As prices fluctuate, there will be a timing impact on earnings, as our fuel surcharge programs trail increases or decreases in fuel price by approximately two months.

﻿

Lower fuel prices could have a positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer products that we transport. Alternatively, lower fuel prices could likely have a negative impact on other commodities such as coal and domestic drilling-related shipments.


·

Capital Plan

–

In 2018, we expect our capital plan to be approximately $3.3 billion, up around 5% compared to 2017. The plan includes expenditures to renew and improve our existing infrastructure as well as new capacity investments, including initial construction work on a new classification yard in our Southern Region. In addition, expenditures will be made for PTC, locomotives, intermodal containers and chassis, and freight cars. We expect to take delivery of approximately 60 new locomotives in 2018, which will complete our multi-year purchase commitments. The capital plan may be revised if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments. (See further discussion in this Item 7 under Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Plan.)

﻿

·

Financial Expectations

–

Economic conditions in many of our market sectors continue to drive uncertainty with respect to our volume levels.  We expect volume to grow in the low single digit range in 2018 compared to 2017, but it will depend on the overall economy and market conditions.  One of the more significant uncertainties is the outlook for energy markets, which will bring both challenges and opportunities.  In the current environment, we expect continued margin improvement driven by continued pricing opportunities, ongoing productivity initiatives, and the ability to leverage our resources and strengthen our franchise. Over the longer term, we expect the overall U.S. economy to continue to improve at a modest pace, with some markets outperforming others.

﻿

·

Tax Reform

–

The Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017.  The Tax Act reduced the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.

Due to the tax rate change, we expect to generate additional cash from operations in 2018 of approximately $1 billion, assuming normal business conditions prevail.  We will continue to evaluate the best use of that cash, which will include pursuing capital projects with adequate returns, and returning cash to shareholders thro

ugh share repurchases and

dividends.

﻿

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

﻿

Operating Revenues

﻿

﻿

﻿

We generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our six commodity groups. Freight revenues vary with volume (carloads) and average revenue per car (ARC). Changes in price, traffic mix and fuel surcharges drive ARC. We provide some of our customers with contractual incentives for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations, which we record as reductions to freight revenues based on the actual or projected future shipments. We recognize freight revenues as shipments move from origin to destination. We allocate freight revenues between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them.

﻿

Other revenues include revenues earned by our subsidiaries, revenues from commuter rail operations that we manage, accessorial revenues, which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage, and miscellaneous contract revenue. We recognize other revenues as we perform services or meet contractual obligations.

﻿

Freight revenues

increased 7% year-over-year to $19.8 billion

driven by volume growth of 2%,

higher fuel surcharge revenue, and core pricing gains.

Growth in frac sand, coal, and intermodal shipments more than offset

declines in grain,

crude oil

, finished vehicles, and rock shipments.

﻿

Freight revenues decreased 9% in 201


compared to 201


due to a


% decline in carloadings, and lower fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by core pricing gains.  Volume declines in coal, intermodal, frac sand, crude oil, finished vehicles, and metals shipments more than offset volume growth in grain, automotive parts, and industrial chemicals shipments.

﻿


Our fuel surcharge programs generated freight revenues

of $966 million

,

$560 million, and $1.3 billion in 2017, 2016, and 2015

, respectively.

Fuel surcharge revenue in 2017

increased $406 million

as a result of a

22%

increase in fuel price and

2%

growth

in carloadings

.

Fuel

surcharge

revenue in 2016

decreased $


m

illion

as a result of

a

20% decrease in fuel price, a 7

% reduction in carloadings

, and the lag impact on fuel surcharge

(it can generally take up to two months for changing fuel prices to affect fuel surcharge recoveries

)

.

﻿

In 2017

, other revenue

increased

from 2016

due to

higher revenues at our subsidiaries, primarily those that broker intermodal

, transload

, and refrigerated

warehousing logistics

services

.

﻿

In 2016, other revenue

decreased

from 2015 due to

lower revenues at our subsidiaries, primarily those that broker intermodal and

transload services, and lower intermodal

accessorial revenue and demurrage

fees.

﻿

The following tables summarize the year-over-year changes in freight revenues, revenue carloads, and ARC by commodity type:

Each intermodal container or trailer equals one carload.

﻿


﻿

Agricultural Products

–

Freight revenue from agricultural products

increased compared to 2016 driven by core pricing gains and higher fuel

surcharge revenue, partially offset by

a 2% decrease in

volume

.

Grain

and grain product

shipments

decreased 3

% in

2017 compared to 2016.  Strong export demand for wheat drove volume growth in the first half of the year, which was more than offset by declines of grain shipments in the second half of the year due

to

an abundance of

global suppl

y reducing U.S. grain competitiveness.

Freight revenue from agricultural products increased in 2016 compared to 2015 driven by

2017 Agricultural Products Carloads

volume growth and core pricing gains, partially offset

by l

ower fuel surcharge revenue and mix of traffic.  Grain shipments

increased 11% in

2016 compared to 2015 due to strong export demand in the second half of the year.  Market conditions in South America and ample supply of U.S. grains led to competitive U.S. pricing relative to the global market.

﻿

﻿

Automotive

–

Freight revenue from automotive

shipments was flat compared

to 2016

as

core pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue were offset by a 3% decline in volume and mix of traffic

.  Finished vehicle shipments fell 7% for the year resulting from lower domestic sales and reduced production for certain manufacturers.  Automotive parts shipments grew 1% driven by continued growth in truck-to-rail conversions.

Freight revenue from automotive shipments decreased

in 2016

compared to 2015 as a result of lower fuel surcharge revenue and mix of traffic, partially offset by core pricing gains.

Volume

was flat compared to 2015 as a 7%



Automotive Carloads

growth in automotive parts from truck-to-rail conversions was offset by a 5% decrease in finished vehicles resulting from a partial contract loss during the year. Overall U.S. vehicle production was flat compared to 2015

.

﻿

﻿

Chemicals

– Freight revenue from che

mical shipments increased in 2017 versus 2016

due to

core pricing gains, higher

fuel surcharge revenue,

and mix

of traffic, which were partially offset by a 2% decrease in volume.  Crude oil shipments declined significantly through the third quarter, resulting from continued low crude oil prices, regional

pricing differences and available pipeline capacity.

Conversely, shipments of refined petroleum products grew due to stronger demand.  F

ertilizer shipments

also increased as a result of continued strength in potash exports.

Freight revenue from chemical shipments

declined in 2016 versus 2015 due to volume

2017 Chemicals Carloads

declines and lo

wer fuel surcharge revenue, which

were partially offset by core pricing gains.  Crude oil shipments declined significantly resulting from continued low crude oil pric

es, regional pricing differences

and available pipeline capacity.  Fertilizer shipments also declined due to weak world-wide demand for potash in the first half of the year and the strong U.S. dollar.  These decreases were partially offset by growth in industrial chemical and liquid petroleum gas shipments.


﻿

Coal

–

Freight revenue from coal shipments increased in 2017 compared to 2016 driven by v

olume

growth, mix of traffic, and higher f

uel surcharge revenue

.

Shipments out of the Powder River Basin (PRB)

grew 5%

in 201


driven by strong growth in the first half of the year due to higher year-over-year natural gas prices and lower inventory levels at utilities.

Shipments out of Colorado and Utah

increased 7% compared to 2016

due to the same drivers, combined with stronger export demand

.

Lower volume, lower fuel surcharge revenue, and mix of traffic resulted in a decline in freight

revenue from coal shipments in 2016 compared

2017 Coal Carloads

to 2015.

Shipments out of the Powder River Basin (PRB) declined 24% in 2016 due to high inventory levels at utilities and competitive natural gas prices. Shipments out of Colorado and Utah declined 15% compared to 2015 due to the same drivers, combined with lower international demand.

﻿

﻿

Industrial Products

– Freight revenue from industrial products shipments increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to a 12% increase in volume, core pricing gains, higher fuel surcharge revenue, and mix of traffic.  Increased shale drilling activity and proppant intensity per drilling well drove substantial volum

e growth in frac sand shipments.

Conversely, rock shipments declined 7% due to inclement weather in the West in the first half of the year, combined

with

decreased construction activity in Texas.

Freight revenue from industrial products shipments decreased in 2016 compared to 2015

2017 Industrial Products Carloads

due to volume

declines,

lower fuel surcharge revenue,

and mix of traffic

partially offset by core pricing gains. Declines in shale drilling activity, due to lower oil prices, negatively impacted non-metallic mineral (frac sand) shipments compared to 2015.  Rock shipments also decreased as weather events and flooding in the Southern Region during the second and third quarters limited

construction activity, thus limiting

demand for

transportation of

materials.

In addition, steel shipments

declined as a result of reductions in shale drilling activity and strong

import levels associated with the strength of the U.S. dollar.

﻿

﻿

Intermodal

–

Freight revenue from intermodal shipments

increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher fuel surcharge revenue

and core pricing gains.  Volume was flat versus 201

6, as a 1% growth in international shipments was muted

by flat domestic shipments due to available truck capacity during most of 2017, offsetting a strong holiday shipping season in the fourth quarter.

Freight revenue from intermodal shipments decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to lower volume and lower fuel

surcharge revenue, which were partially offset by core pricing gains.

Volume levels from international and domestic

traffic decreased

11%

and


%, respectively,

2017 Intermodal Carloads

compared to last year due to weaker global trade activity, softer domestic sales, high retail inventories, and a customer bankruptcy.

﻿


Mexico Business

–

Each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from Mexico.

Freight revenue from Mexico

business was $2.3 billion in 2017, up 2% compared to

2016.  Core pricing gains and higher

fuel surcharge revenue

more than

offset the


% volume

decline. The decrease in v

olume was driven by

lower shipments of automotive parts, partially offset by growth in coal and refined petroleum products shipments.

﻿

Freight revenue from Mexico business

was $2.2 billion in 2016, flat with 2015.  Lower fuel surcharge revenue and mix of traffic offset the 4% of volume growth and core pricing gains.  Volume growth was driven by

Ag

ricultural Products, Coal, and automotive p

arts shipments.

﻿

Operating Expenses

﻿

﻿

﻿

﻿

Operating expenses increased $510 million in 2017 compared to 2016 driven by higher fuel prices, inflation, $86 million of expenses related to the third quarter workforce reduction plan, depreciation, contract services, and volume-related costs.  Partially offsetting these increases was a $212 million reduction to operating expense related to income tax adjustments at certain equity-method affiliates, continued productivity gains, lower locomotive and freight car lease expense, and lower environmental, personal injury, and joint facility costs.

Operating expenses decreased $1.1 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 driven by lower fuel


Operating Expenses

prices, volume-related

savings, productivity gains and lower

locomotive and freight car

maintenance expense.  These cost reductions were partially offset by inflation,

d

epreciation

, and higher environmental and other costs

.

﻿

Compensation and Benefits

–

Compensation and benefits include wages, payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension costs, other postretirement benefits, and

incentive costs. In 2017

, expenses

increased 5%

compared to 201


, driven by

general wage and benefit inflation,

$86 million of expenses associated with the workforce reduction plan,

volume-related

costs, and higher training expenses for trainmen,

which were partially offset by resource productivity gains.

﻿

In 2016, expenses

decreased 8%

compared to 2015, driven by lower volume-related costs, productivity gains, and lower training expense.  General wage and benefit inflation partially offset these decreases.

﻿

Purchased Services and Materials

– Expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors and other service providers (including equipment maintenance and contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services); materials used to maintain the Railroad’s lines, structures, and equipment; costs of operating facilities jointly used by UPRR and other railroads; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers; leased automobile maintenance expenses; and tools and supplies. Purchased services and materials

increased 5

%

in 2017

compared to 201


primarily due to

volume-related costs (including higher subsidiary contract services) and Hurricane Harvey-related contract service costs, which were partially offset by lower joint facility expenses.


Purchased services and materials

in 2016 decreased 7%

compared to 2015 primarily due to lower volume-related costs and

lower locomotive and freight car repair

and maintenance expenses.

﻿

Fuel

– Fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and non-highway vehicles and heavy equipment.

Locomotive diesel fuel prices, which

averaged

$

1.81

per gallon (including taxes a

nd transportation costs) in 2017

, compared

to $

1.48

per

gallon in

2016, increased expenses $334 million.

In addition, fuel costs were

higher

as gross-ton

miles

increased

5%

compared to 2016

.

The fuel consumption rate (c-rate), computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles in

thousands, improved

﻿

Locomotive diesel fuel prices, which

averaged

$1.48

per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2016, compared to

$1.84 per gallon in 2015, reduced

expenses $347 million. In addition, fuel costs were lower as gross-ton miles

decreased


%. The fuel consumption rate (c-rate), computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles in thousands, improved


% compared

to 2015.

﻿

Depreciation

– The majority of depreciation relates to road property, including rail, ties, ballast, and other track

material.

A higher depreciable asset base, reflecting recent years’ higher capital spending,

increased

depreciation expense in 2017 compared to 2016. This increase was partially offset by our recent depreciation studies that resulted in lower depreciation rates for some asset classes.

﻿

A larger

depreciable asset base, reflecting higher capital spending in recent years,

increased

depreciation expense in 2016 compared to 2015. This

increase

was partially offset by our recent depreciation studies that resulted in lower depreciation rates for some asset classes.

﻿

Equipment and Other Rents

– Equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases; and office and other rent

expenses

.

Equity income from certain equity method investments is also included.  Equipment and other rents expense decreased $249 million compared to 2016.  $212 million of the reduction was due to income tax adjustments at certain equity-method affiliates.

Lower locomotive and freight car lease expense also contributed to the year-over-year decrease.  Conversely, increased car rent expense due to volume growth in certain markets partially offset these decreases.

﻿

Equipment and other rents expe

nse decreased $93 million in 2016

compared to 2015

as lower

volume levels

drove a r

educ

tion in car

hire

and

locomotive lease expense

s

.

﻿

Other

– Other expenses include state and local taxes, freight, equipment and property damage, utilities, insurance, personal injury, environmental, employee travel, telephone and cellular, computer software, bad debt, and other general expenses

.

Other expenses

decreased

5%

in 2017

compared to 2016

as a result of

lower environmental and

personal injury expenses, and higher

bad debt expense

in 2016 resulting from a customer bankruptcy.  Conversely, increased costs associated with destroyed equipment owned by third parties, and higher property and damaged freight costs partially offset these decreases.

Other

expenses increased 8% i

n 2016

compared to 2015 as a result of higher environmental costs, state and local taxes, bad debt expense (customer bankruptcy), and the write-off of certain in-progress capit

al projects that were cancelled

.  These cost increases were partially offset by lower

expenses for damaged

freight, property

, and

equipment

not owned by the Company

.

﻿

Non-Operating Items

﻿

﻿

﻿

Other Income

–

Other

income

increased

in



compared to 201


primarily

as a result of a $65 million gain on a litigation settlement for back rent and a $57 million real estate sale gain, both recognized in the third quarter of 2017.  Rental income also increased in 2017 compared to 2016.

﻿


Other

income decreased in

2016 compared to 2015 primarily due

to

large real estate transactions:

a $113 million gain from a real estate sale in 2015

, partially offset by $67 million of gains from two real estate sales in 2016.

﻿

Interest Expense

–

Interest expense

increased in 2017

compared to 2016

due to an increased weighted-average debt level of $

15.9 billion in 2017 from $15.0 billion in 2016, partially offset by the impact of a lower effective interest rate of 4.6% in 2017 compared to 4.7% in 2016.

﻿

Interest expense increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to an increased weighted-average debt level of $15.0 billion in 2016 from $13.0 billion in 2015, partially offset by the impact of a lower effective interest rate of 4.7% in 2016

compared to 4.8% in 2015.

﻿

Income Taxes

–

Income taxes were a benefit of $3.1 billion in 2017 compared to expense of $2.5 billion in 2016.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on December 22, 2017.  The

Tax

Act reduced the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.  As a result, we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities which resulted in a $5.9 billion non-cash reduction in our income tax expense in 2017.  Higher

pre-tax incom

e and an increase in the State of Illinois corporate tax rate effective July 1, 2017 modestly offset the impact of the deferred tax adjustment.

Our effective tax rate for 2017 was (40.4%) compared to 37.4% in 2016.

﻿

Lower pre-tax income decreased income taxes in 2016 compared to 2015. Our effective tax rate for 2016 was

37.4%

compared to 37.7% in 2015.

OTHER OPERATING/PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL STATISTICS

﻿

We report a number of key performance measures weekly to the Association of American Railroads.  We provide this data on our website at www.up.com/investor/aar-stb_reports/index.htm.

﻿

Operating/Performance Statistics

﻿

Railroad performance measures are included in the table below:

﻿

﻿

﻿

Average Train Speed

–

Average train speed is calculated by dividing train miles by hours operated on our main lines

between terminals.  Average train speed, as reported to the Association of American Railroads,

declined


% in 2017 compared to 2016 as disruptions across our network, including the impact of Hurricane Harvey, negatively impacted network fluidity.  Continued implementation and testing of Positive Train Control across a

growing number of routes in our network

combined with operational challenges

also negatively impacted overall average train speed.

﻿

Average train speed improved 5% in 2016 compared to 2015.

Velocity gains resulted from lower volumes, improved network fluidity and a strong resource position.

﻿

Average Terminal Dwell Time

– Average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals. Lower average terminal dwell time improves asset utilization and service. Average terminal dwell time

increased


%

in 2017

compared to 201

6 resulting from network disruptions and operational challenges which negatively impacted network fluidity.

﻿

Averag

e terminal dwell time improved 4% in 2016 compared to 2015

, reflecting

the impact of lower volume and improved network operations.

﻿

Gross and Revenue Ton-Miles

– Gross ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled. Revenue ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the


weight

of freight by the number of tariff miles.  Gross ton-miles and revenue ton-miles

increased

5%

and


%,

respectively in 201

7 compared to 2016

, resulting from a

2%

increase

in

carloads

.

Changes in commodity mix drove the variances in year-over-year increases between gross ton-miles, revenue ton-miles

,

and carloads.

﻿

Gross ton-miles a

nd revenue ton-miles decreased 8% and 9%, respectively in 2016

compared to 201

5, resulting from a 7

% decrease in

carloads.

Changes in commodity mix

drove

the variances in year-over-year declines between gross ton-miles, revenue ton-miles and carloads.

﻿

Operating Ratio

– Operating ratio is our operating expenses reflected as a percentage of operating revenue

.  Our operating

ratio

improved

1.5

points

to

62.0%

in


7 compared to 2016

.

Income tax adjustments at our equity-method affiliates drove one point of the

improvement.  C

ore pricing gains, volume leverage, and productivity savings

more than offset higher inflation, $86 million of costs associated with the

workforce reduction plan

, higher fuel prices, and other expenses to drive 0.5 points of operating ratio improvement.

﻿

Our operating ratio

increased

0.4 points to

63.5% in 2016

﻿

Return on Invested Capital as Adjusted (ROIC)

﻿

﻿

﻿

ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our long-term capital investments.  In addition, we currently use ROIC as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of equity compensation for our executives. ROIC should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, other information provided in accordance with GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is Return on Average Common Shareholders’ Equity. The tables above provide reconciliations from return on average common shareholders’ equity to ROIC.  Our 2017 ROIC of

27.6

% increased

compared to 2016,

largely as a result the $5.9 b

illion reduction to our deferred tax liability,

that

was recognized as an income tax benefit

in 2017 (See Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for


additional information)

.

Higher earnings

from base operations also contributed to the increase, more than offsetting our

higher invested capital base.

Debt to Capital

﻿

﻿

Adjusted Debt to Capital

﻿

﻿

﻿

Adjusted debt to capital is a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the total amount of leverage in our capital structure, including off-balance sheet lease obligations, which we generally incur in connection with financing the acquisition of locomotives and freight cars and certain facilities.  Operating leases were discounted

using 4.6%

and 4.7

% at

December 31, 2017, and 2016

, respectively

. The discount rate reflects our effective interest rate. We monitor the ratio of adjusted debt to capital as we manage our capital structure to balance cost-effective and efficient access to the capital markets with our overall cost of capital. Adjusted debt to capital should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, debt to capital. The tables above

provide reconciliations from debt to capital to adjusted debt to capital. Our

December 31, 2017

debt to capital ratios

decreased

as a result of a

$4.9 b

illion

increase

in

equity

from

December 31, 2016

.  The increase i

n equity is largely due to a $5.9 billion

reduction to our deferred tax liability

that

was recog

nized as an income tax benefit in 2017

.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

﻿

As

of

December 31, 2017

, our

principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents, our receivables securitization facility, and our revolving credit facility, as well as the availability of commercial

paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets.

We had $1.7 billion of committed credit available under our credit facility, with no borrowings outstanding as of

December 31, 2017

. We did not make any borrowings under this facility during 2017. The value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the $650 million capacity receivables securitization facility was $500 million as of

December 31, 2017

.

Our access to this receivables securitization facility may be reduced or restricted if our bond ratings fall to certain levels below investment grade. If our bond rating were to deteriorate, it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. Access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market conditions. Deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively

impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity. Access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability. We expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all of the following sources or activities: (i) increasing the size or utilization of our receivables securitization, (ii) issuing commercial paper, (iii) entering into bank loans, outside of our revolving credit facility, or (iv) issuing bonds or other debt securities to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets.

The Company’s $1.7 billion revolving credit facility is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper by UPC and also

serves as an emergency source of liquidity. The Company currently does not intend to make any borrowings under this facility.

﻿

At

December 31, 201


,

we had a working capital

surplus.

At December 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit

.

The decrease at 2016 year-end was primarily due to a decrease in other current assets related to a tax receivable for the late extension of bonus depreciation at December 31, 2015, along with an increase at December 31, 201


,

in accounts payable and upcoming debt maturities.

We

maintain adequate resources, and when necessary, have adequate access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements, in addition to sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities.

﻿

﻿

﻿

Operating Activities

﻿

Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 due t

o the timing of

tax

payments in 2016 related to bonus depreciation on capital spending.  The decrease was mostly offset by higher income in 2017 compared to 2016.

Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2016 compared to 2015.  The timing of tax payments primarily related to

bonus depreciation and changes in working capital more than offset lower net income.

﻿

The Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act extended 100% bonus

depreciation effective September 27, 2017 through 2022

, and phases out bonus deprecation by 2027

.

Locomotives and freight cars include early lease buyouts of $173 million in 2017, $90 million in 2016, and $327 million in 2015.

﻿

﻿

﻿

Capital Plan

–

In

2018, we expect our capital plan to be approximately $3.3 billion, which may be revised if business conditions or the regulatory environment affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these

investments. While asset replacements will fluctuate as part of our renewal strategy, we expect to use around 70% of our capital investments to renew and improve existing capital assets. We will continue to balance investment in our network infrastructure and terminal capacity as appropriate, including initial construction work on a

new classification yard in our Southern Region. Significant investments in technology improvements are planned, including PTC. We also will continue commercial investments in rail facilities and equipment, including approximately 60 new locomotives, intermodal containers and chassis, and freight cars.

﻿

We

expect to fund our 2018 cash capital plan by using some or all of the following: cash generated from operations, proceeds from the sale or lease of various operating and non-operating properties, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, and cash on hand. Our annual capital plan is a critical component of our long-term strategic plan. We expect our plan will enhance the long-term value of the Company for our shareholders by providing sufficient resources to (i) replace and improve our existing track infrastructure to provide safe and fluid operations, (ii) increase network efficiency by adding or improving facilities and track, and (iii) make investments that meet customer demand and take advantage of opportunities for long-term growth.

Financing Activities

﻿

Cash used in financing

activities decreased in 2017 compared to 2016.

An increase of $908 million in common shares purchased and an increase of $103 million in dividends paid was more than offset by an increase of $752 million in debt issued, a decrease of $173 million in debt repaid, and a decrease of $191 million in debt exchange costs.

﻿

Cash used in financing activities increased in 2016 compared to 2015.

An increase of $457 million in debt repaid and a decrease of $1,345 million in debt issued more than offset a decrease of $465 million in dividends paid. The

decrease in dividends paid was a result of adjusting the dividend payable dates in 2015 to align with the timing of the quarterly dividend declaration and payment dates within the same quarter. Aligning the quarterly dividend declaration and payment resulted in two payments in the first quarter of 2015: the fourth quarter 2014 dividend of $438 million, which was paid on January 2, 2015, as well as the first quarter 2015 dividend of $484 million, which was paid on March 30, 2015. The second quarter 2015


dividend of $479 million was paid on June 30, 2015, the third quarter 2015 dividend of $476 million was paid on September 30, 2015, and the fourth quarter 2015 dividend of

$467

million was paid on December 31, 2015.

﻿

See Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of all our outstanding financing arrangements and significant new borrowings.

﻿

Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges

﻿

For each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, our ratio of earnings to fixed charges

was 10.3,

9.6,

and 11.6, respectively. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis. Earnings represent income from continuing operations, less equity earnings net of distributions, plus fixed charges and income taxes. Fixed charges represent interest charges, amortization of debt discount, and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges.  (See Exhibit 12 to this report for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges.)

﻿

Common Shareholders’ Equity

﻿

Dividend Restrictions

– Our revolving credit facility includes a debt-to-net worth covenant (discussed in the Credit Facilities section above) that, under certain circumstances, restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders. The amount of retained earnings available for dividends

was $16.4 billion

and $12.4

billion at December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively

.

﻿

Share Repurchase Program

﻿

Effective January 1, 2017, our B

oard of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 120 million shares of our c

ommon stock by December 31, 2020

, replacing our previous repurchase program. As of

December 31, 2017

, we repurchased

a total

of $23.2 billion

of our common stock since the commencement of our repurchase programs in 2007.

The table below represents shares repurchased

in 2017

under this repurchase program

and shares repurchased in 2016 under our previous purchase program.

﻿

﻿

﻿

Management's assessments of market conditions and other pertinent facts guide the timing and volume of all repurchases.  We expect to fund any share repurchases under this program through cash generated from operations, the sale or lease of various operating and non-operating properties, debt issuances, and cash on hand.  Repurchased shares are recorded in treasury stock at cost, which includes any applicable commissions and fees.

﻿

From January 1, 2018, through February 8, 2018, we repurchased 2.6 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $349 million.

﻿

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments

﻿

As described in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and as referenced in the tables below, we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition. Based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, including material sources of off-balance sheet and structured finance arrangements, other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets (as described in Item 1A of Part II of this report),  there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event, or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. In addition, our commercial obligations, financings, and commitments are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations, particularly within the transportation industry.


The following tables identify material obligations and commitments as of

December 31, 2017:

﻿

﻿

﻿

[a]

Excludes cap

ital lease obligations of $892

million, as well as unamortized discount and deferred issuance costs of

$(887)

million. Includes

an interest component of $12,026

million.

[b]

Includes leases for locomotives, freight cars, other equipment, and real estate.

[c]

Represents total obligations, incl

uding interest component of $187

million.

[d]

Purchase obligations include locomotive maintenance contracts; purchase commitments for fuel purchases, locomotives, ties, ballast, and rail; and agreements to purchase other goods and services.  For amounts where we cannot reasonably estimate the year of settlement, they are reflected in the Other column.

[e]

Includes estimated other post retirement, medical, and life insurance payments, payments made under the unfunded pension plan for the next ten years.

[f]

Future cash flows for income tax contingencies reflect the recorded liabilities and assets for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, as of

December 31, 2017.

For amounts where the year of settlement is uncertain, they are reflected in the Other column.

﻿

﻿

﻿

affiliated operations.

[d]

None of the letters of credit were dr

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

﻿

Guarantees

–

At

December 31, 2017, and 2016

, we were contingently liable for

$


million and $4

3 million in guarantees. The fair value of these obligations as of both

December 31, 2017, and 2016

, was $0. We entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business, and they include guaranteed obligations related to our affiliated operations. The final guarantee expires in 2022. We are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees. We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

OTHER MATTERS

﻿

Labor Agreements

–

Approximately 85% of our 41,992

full-time-equivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions.

On January 1, 2015, current labor agreements became subject to modification and we

began the current round of negotiations with the unions. Existing agreements remain in effect until new agreements are ratified or the Railway Labor Act’s (RLA) procedures (which include mediation, potential arbitration, cooling-off periods, and the possibility of Presidential Emergency Boards and Congression

al intervention) are exhausted.

Through industry and local negotiations, UPRR reached tentative new agreements with 1

2 of our 14 major rail unions.

Nine unions (representing nearly 70% of our agreement work force) have ratified those agre

ements by significant margins.

The tentative agreement failed ratification with two unions in early February 2018 (representing about 10% of our agreement work force)


returning any further discussions with them to the jurisdiction of the National Mediation Board.  Another small union (less than 1%)

is still out for ratification.

UPRR and the industry currently continue in active mediation with the remaining coalition of two unions (representing about 20% of our agreement work force).

Under the Railway Labor Act, the National Mediation Board controls timing and location of mediation conferences and when to terminate mediation, moving the parties to the next stages of the RLA process.  Contract negotiations historically continue for an extended period of time and we rarely experience work stoppages while negotiations are pending.

﻿

Inflation

– Long periods of inflation significantly increase asset replacement costs for capital-intensive companies. As a result, assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels, depreciation charges (on an inflation-adjusted basis) would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts.

﻿

Sensitivity Analyses

– The sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition. These hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results.

﻿

At

December 31, 2017

, we

had variable-rate debt representing

approximately 4.4% of

our total debt. If variable interest rates

average one percentage point higher in 2018

than our

December 31, 2017

variable

rate, which was

approximately

2.2

%, our interest expense would increase by approximately $7.5 million. This amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balance

s of our variable-rate

debt at

December 31, 2017

.

﻿

Market risk for fixed-rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of

December 31, 2017

, and amounts to an increase of approximately $2.2 billion to the fair value of our debt at

December 31, 2017

. We estimated the fair values of our fixed-rate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted

market prices and current borrowing rates.

﻿

Accounting Pronouncements

– See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

﻿

Asserted and Unasserted Claims

– Various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries. We cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. To the extent possible, we have recorded a liability where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated. We do not expect that any known lawsuits, claims, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters.

﻿

Indemnities

– Our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements, including certain tax indemnifications, can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount, depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements. Due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved, we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements. We do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions.

﻿

Climate Change

– Although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this report), we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact. However, we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment, including investments in new technologies, using training programs to reduce fuel consumption, and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency.

CR

ITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

﻿

Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in Note 2 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8. These critical accounting


policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements may be material.

﻿

Personal Injury

– The cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. We use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability, including unasserted claims. The Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA) governs compensation for work-related accidents. Under FELA, damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out-of-court settlements. We offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work.

﻿

Our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments.

Approximately 95% of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and approximately 5% is related to unasserted claims at December 31, 2017. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims, it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately $285 million to $310 million. We record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other.  Estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation.

﻿

Our personal injury liability activity was as follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿

﻿

Our personal injury claims activity was as follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿

In conjunction with the liability update performed in 2017, we also reassessed our estimated insurance recoveries. We have

recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at December 31, 2017, and 2016.

Any changes to recorded

insurance recoveries are included in the above table in the Changes in estimates for prior years category.

﻿

Asbestos

– We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos. We assess our potential liability using a statistical analysis of resolution costs for asbestos-related claims.  This liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs. The liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions:

﻿

·

The ratio of future claims by alleged disease would be consistent with historical averages adjusted for inflation.

·

The number of claims filed against us will decline each year.

·

The average settlement values for asserted and unasserted claims will be equivalent to historical averages.

·

The percentage of claims dismissed in the future will be equivalent to historical averages.

﻿

Our liability for asbestos-

related claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments. Approximately 16% of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately 84% related to unasserted claims at December 31, 2017.  Because of the uncertainty


surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestos-related claims, it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately $99 million to $105 million

.  We record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more

probable than any other.

﻿

Our asbestos-related liability activity was as follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿

Our asbestos-related claims activity was as follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿

In

conjunction with the liability update performed in 2017, we also reassessed our estimated insurance recoveries. We have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at December 31, 2017, and 2016.  The amounts recorded for asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known

facts. However, future events, such as the number of new claims filed each year, average settlement costs, and insurance coverage issues, could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts. Estimates also may vary in the future if strategies, activities, and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change; federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants; and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants.

﻿

Environmental Costs

– We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. We have

identified 315 sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements. This includes 33 sites that are the subject of actions taken by the U.S. government, 21

of

which are currently on the Superfund National Priorities List. Certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites; consequently, our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties, in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site.

﻿

When we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned, leased, or otherwise used in our business, we perform, with assistance of our consultants, environmental assessments on the property. We expense the cost of the assessments as incurred. We accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Our environmental liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments.

﻿

Our environmental liability activity was as follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿


Our environmental site activity was as follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿

The environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties. Cost estimates are based on information available for each site, financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, and existing technology, laws, and regulations. The ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties, site-specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs. Estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal, state, and local laws governing environmental remediation. Current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.

﻿

Property and Depreciation

– Our railroad operations are highly capital intensive, and our large base of homogeneous, network-type assets turns over on a continuous basis.  Each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers.  Assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria.  Properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated service lives, which are measured in years, except for rail in high-density traffic corridors (i.e., all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment, yard and switching tracks, and electronic yards) for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track.  We use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics, use, and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes, and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates.  The group

method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources, not as singular items.  We currently

have more than 60 depreciable

asset

classes, and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to

changes in technology, asset strategies, or other factors.

﻿

We determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property by means of depreciation studies.  We perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets (i.e., rail and other track material, ties, and ballast) and other road property.  Our depreciation studies take into account the following factors:

﻿

·

Statistical analysis of historical patterns of use and retirements of each of our asset classes;

·

Evaluation of any expected changes in current operations and the outlook for continued use of the assets;

·

Evaluation of technological advances and changes to maintenance practices; and

·

Expected salvage to be received upon retirement.

﻿

For rail in high-density traffic corridors, we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track.  It has been our experience that the lives of rail in high-density traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage (i.e., the amount of weight carried over the rail).  The service lives also vary based on rail weight, rail condition (e.g., new or secondhand), and rail type (e.g., straight or curve).  Our depreciation studies for rail in high-density traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives.  For rail in high-density traffic corridors, we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross ton-miles carried over the rail (i.e., the weight of loaded and empty freight cars, locomotives and maintenance

of way equipment transported over the rail) by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile.  Rail in high-density traffic corridors accounts for approximately 70 percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material.  Based on the number of gross ton-miles carried over our rail in high

density traffic corridors during 2017, the estimated service lives of the majority of this rail ranged from approximately 19 years to approximately 41 years.  For all

other depreciable assets, we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies.  Changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates

are implemented prospectively.


Estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use, technology, asset strategies, and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets.  We are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets.  Actual use and retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates, which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods.

﻿

Changes in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.  If

the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year, annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately $65 million.  If the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year, annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately $70

million.  Our recent depreciation studies have resulted in lower depreciation rates for some asset classes. These lower rates will partially offset the impact of a projected higher depreciable asset base, resulting in an increase in total depreciation

expense by approximately

5% in 2018 versus 2017.

﻿

Under group depreciation, the historical cost (net of salvage) of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized.  The historical cost of certain track assets is estimated by multiplying the current replacement cost of track assets by a historical index factor derived from (i) inflation indices published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and (ii) the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies.  The indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes.  Because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired, we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate.  In addition, we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies.  Any deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets.

﻿

For retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business, a gain or loss may be recognized if the

retirement meets each of the following three conditions: (i) it is unusual, (ii) it is material in amount, and (iii) it varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies.  During the last three fiscal years, no gains or losses were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad properties.  A gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations

.

﻿

Income Taxes

– We account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. These expected future tax consequences are measured based on current tax law; the effects of future tax legislation are not anticipated.  Future tax legislati

on, such as a change in the corporate tax rate, could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.  For example, a permanent 1% increase in future income tax rates would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately $430 million.  Similarly, a permanent 1% decrease in future income tax rates would decrease our deferred tax liability by approximately $430 million.

﻿

When

appropriate, we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized. In determining whether a

valuation allowance is appropriate, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, based on management’s judgments using available evidence for purposes of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize a deferred tax asset. In 2018 and 2017, there were no valuation allowances.

﻿

We recognize tax benefits that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement. A liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards.

﻿

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

– We use an actuarial analysis to measure the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and medical and life insurance benefits (OPEB) to eligible employees. In order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses, we must make several assumptions. The critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount


rates and expected rate of return on pension assets. For OPEB, the critical assumptions are the discount rates and health care cost trend rate.

﻿

We evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually, and selected assumptions are based on the following factors:

﻿

·

Beginning in 2016,

we

measure the service cost and interest cost components of our net periodic benefit cost by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future

year

.

Discount rates are based on a Mercer yield curve of high quality corporate bonds (rated AA by a recognized rating agency).

·

Expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return, taking into consideration current and expected market conditions.

·

Health care cost trend rate is based on our historical rates of inflation and expected market conditions.

﻿

The following tables

present the key assumptions used to measure net periodic pension and OPEB cost/(benefit) for 2018 and the estimated impact on 2018 net periodic pension and OPEB cost/(benefit) relative to a change in those assumptions:

Opinion on the Financial Statements

﻿

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Union Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies (the "Corporation") as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in common shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Table of Contents at Part IV, Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

﻿

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 9, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting.

﻿

Basis for Opinion

﻿

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

﻿

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

For purposes of this report, unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to the “Corporation”, “Company”, “UPC”, “we”, “us”, and “our” mean Union Pacific Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Union Pacific Railroad Company, which will be separately referred to herein as “UPRR” or the “Railroad”.

1. Nature of Operations

﻿

Operations and Segmentation

– We are a Class I railroad operating in the U.S. Our network includes

32,122

route miles, linking Pacific Coast and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest and Eastern U.S. gateways and providing several corridors to key Mexican gateways. We own

26,042

miles and operate on the remainder pursuant to trackage rights or leases. We serve the western two-thirds of the country and maintain coordinated schedules with other rail carriers for the handling of freight to and from the Atlantic Coast, the Pacific Coast, the Southeast, the Southwest, Canada, and Mexico. Export and import traffic is moved through Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast ports and across the Mexican and Canadian borders.

﻿

The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our

one

reportable operating segment. Although we provide and analyze revenue by commodity group, we treat the financial results of the Railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of our rail network.

The following table provides freight revenue by commodity group:

﻿

﻿

﻿

Although our revenues are principally derived from customers domiciled in the U.S., the ultimate points of origination or destination for some products

we transport

are outside the U.S. Each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from Mexico. Included in the above table are

freight

revenues from our Mexico business which amounted

to

$

2.3

billion in 2017,

$2.2

billion in 201


,

and

$2.2

billion in 201


.

﻿

Basis of Presentation

– The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) as codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC).

2. Significant Accounting Policies

﻿

Principles of Consolidation

– The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Union Pacific Corporation and all of its subsidiaries. Investments in affiliated companies (20% to 50% owned) are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. We currently have no less than majority-owned investments that require consolidation under variable interest entity requirements.

﻿

Cash and Cash Equivalents

– Cash equivalents consist of investments with original maturities of three months or less.

﻿

Accounts Receivable

–

Accounts receivable includes receivables reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is based upon historical losses, credit worthiness of customers, and current economic conditions.  Receivables not expected to be collected in one year and the associated allowances are classified as other assets in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

﻿


Investments

– Investments represent our investments in affiliated companies (20% to 50% owned) that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and investments in companies (less than 20% owned) accounted for under the cost method of accounting.

The results of operations for our equity method investments that are integral to our operations are recorded in operating expenses.

﻿

Materials and Supplies

– Materials and supplies are carried at the lower of average cost or market.

﻿

Property and Depreciation

– Properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated service lives, which are measured in years, except for rail in high-density traffic corridors (i.e., all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment, yard and switching tracks, and electronic yards), for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track.  We use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics, use, and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes, and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates.  The group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources, not as singular items.  We determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad assets by means of depreciation studies.  Under the group method of depreciation, no gain or loss is recognized when depreciable property is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business.

﻿

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

– We review long-lived assets, including identifiable intangibles, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the long-lived assets, the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value as measured by the discounted cash flows.

﻿

Revenue Recognition

– We recognize freight revenues as freight moves from origin to destination. The allocation of revenue between reporting periods is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred. Other revenues, which include revenues earned by our subsidiaries, revenues from our commuter rail operations, and accessorial revenue, are recognized as service is performed or contractual obligations are met. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping to/from specific locations, are recorded as a reduction to operating revenues based on actual or projected future customer shipments.

﻿

Translation of Foreign Currency

– Our portion of the assets and liabilities related to foreign investments are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Unrealized gains or losses are reflected within common shareholders’ equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.

﻿

Fair Value Measurements

– We use a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.  The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  These levels include:

﻿

Level 1:  Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2:  Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.

Level 3:  Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

﻿

We have applied fair value measurements to our

short term investments,

pension plan assets and short- and long-term debt.

﻿

Stock-Based Compensation

– We have several stock-based compensation plans under which employees and non-employee directors receive stock options, nonvested retention shares, and nonvested stock units. We refer to the nonvested shares and stock units collectively as “retention awards”. We have elected to issue treasury shares to cover option exercises and stock unit vestings, while new shares are issued when retention shares are granted.

﻿

We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors, including stock options. Compensation expense is based on the calculated fair value of the awards as measured at the grant date and is expensed ratably over the service period of the awards (generally the vesting period). The fair value of retention awards is the closing stock price on the date of grant, while the fair value of stock options is determined by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

﻿


Earnings Per Share

– Basic earnings per share are calculated on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share include shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options and stock-based awards where the conversion of such instruments would be dilutive.

﻿

Income Taxes

– We account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. These expected future tax consequences are measured based on current tax law; the effects of future tax legislation are not anticipated.  Future tax legislation, such as a change in the corporate tax rate, could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

﻿

When appropriate, we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, based on management’s judgments using available evidence for purposes of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize a deferred tax asset.

﻿

We recognize tax benefits that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement. A liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards.

﻿

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

– We incur certain employment-related expenses associated with pensions and postretirement health benefits. In order to measure the expense associated with these benefits, we must make various assumptions including discount rates used to value certain liabilities, expected return on plan assets used to fund these expenses, compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and expected future health care costs. The assumptions used by us are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. We use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability associated with these benefits.

﻿

Personal Injury

– The cost of injuries to employees and others on our property is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. We use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability. Our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value. Legal fees and incidental costs are expensed as incurred.

﻿

Asbestos

– We estimate a liability for asserted and unasserted asbestos-related claims based on an assessment of the number and value of those claims. We use a statistical analysis to assist us in properly measuring our potential liability. Our liability for asbestos-related claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments. Legal fees and incidental costs are expensed as incurred.

﻿

Environmental

– When environmental issues have been identified with respect to property currently or formerly owned, leased, or otherwise used in the conduct of our business, we perform, with the assistance of our consultants, environmental assessments on such property. We expense the cost of the assessments as incurred. We accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated. We do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable. Legal fees and incidental costs are expensed as incurred.

﻿

Use of Estimates

– The preparation of our

Consolidated Financial Statements

in conformity with GAAP requires management to make

estimates and assumptions

that affect

certain

reported

assets

and

liabilities,

and the disclosure of certain contingent assets and liabilities

as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue

and expenses

during the reporting period

. Actual future results may differ from such estimates.

3. Accounting Pronouncements

﻿

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09),

Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)

.  ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.  The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the


consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in the exchange for t

hose goods or services.

This may require the use of more judgment and estimates in order to correctly recognize the revenue expected as an outcome of each specific performance obligation. Additionally, this guidance will require the disclosure of the nature, amount, and timing of revenue arising from contracts so as to aid in the understanding of the users of financial statements.

﻿

This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company has analyzed our freight and other revenues and we expect to continue to recognize freight revenues as freight moves from origin to destination and to recognize other revenues as identified performance obligations are satisfied.  We have also analyzed freight and other revenues in the context of the new guidance on principal versus agent considerations and evaluated the required new disclosures. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09 using the modified retrospective transition method.  The ASU did not have

an

impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows

.

﻿

In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 (ASU 2016-01),

Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Subtopic 825-10)

. ASU 2016-01 provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is not permitted.

ASU 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

﻿

In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-07 (ASU 2017-07),

Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (Topic 715)

. ASU 2017-07 requires the service cost component be reported separately from the other components of net benefit costs in the income statement, provides explicit guidance on the presentation of the service cost component and the other components of net benefit cost in the income statement, and allows only the service cost component of net benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization. This standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and we intend to adopt the standard beginning in 2018 using retrospective adoption.

The Company currently records service costs and net

benefit costs within compensation and benefits expense. Upon adoption, the service cost will be recorded within compensation and benefits expense, and the other components of net benefit costs, including $69 million related to the 2017 workforce reduction plan as described in Note 4, will be recorded in other income. The retrospective impact of future adoption is shown in the table below:

﻿

﻿

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 (ASU 2016-02),

Leases (Subtopic 842)

. ASU 2016-02 will require companies to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. For public companies, this standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after

December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, and expects that the adoption will result in an increase in the Company’s assets and liabilities of over $2 billion.

﻿

On December 22, 2017 the SEC staff issued S

taff Accounting Bulletin


(SAB 118)

, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “

Tax

Act”).  SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under A

ccounting

S

tandards

C

odification

(ASC)

740. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the

Tax

Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. To the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the

Tax

Act is incomplete but for which they are able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional amount in the financial statements.

Provisional treatment is proper in light of anticipated additional guidance from various taxing authorities, the SEC, the FASB, and even the Joint Committee on Taxation.  Provisional treatment is also necessary if the company is waiting for final financial information from domestic and foreign equity investments.

If a company cannot determine a provisional amount to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the

Tax

Act.

﻿

﻿


4. Workforce Reduction Plan

﻿

On August 16, 2017, the Company approved and commenced a management and administrative personnel reorganization plan (the “Plan”) furthering its on-going efforts to increase efficiency and more effectively align Company resources. The Plan implemented productivity initiatives identified during a recently completed Company-wide organizational review that included the reduction of approximately 460 management positions and 250 agreement positions. The Plan resulted in a pretax charge recognized in the third quarter of 2017 within compensation and benefits expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income. This charge consisted of management employee termination benefits, including pension expenses, severance costs, and acceleration of equity compensation expense as shown in the table below.  The actions associated with the Plan are substantially complete, and we do not expect to incur additional charges for the Plan in subsequent years.

﻿

﻿

﻿

5. Stock Options and Other Stock Plans

﻿

In April 2000, the shareholders approved the Union Pacific Corporation 2000 Directors Plan (Directors Plan) whereby

2,200,000

shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance to our non-employee directors.

Under the Directors Plan, each non-employee director, upon his or her initial election to the Board of Directors, receives a grant of 4,000 retention shares or retention stock units. Prior to December 31, 2007, each non-employee director received annually an option to purchase at fair value a number of shares of our common stock, not to exceed 20,000 shares during any calendar year, determined by dividing 60,000 by 1/3 of the fair market value of one share of our common stock on the date of such Board of Directors meeting, with the resulting quotient rounded up or down to the nearest 50 shares.

In September 2007, the Board of Directors eliminated the annual payment of options for 2008 and all future years. As of

December 31, 2017,

44,000

restricted shares and

no

options

were outstanding under the Directors Plan.

﻿

The Union Pacific Corporation 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (2004 Plan) was approved by shareholders in April 2004. The 2004 Plan reserved

84,000,000

shares of our common stock for issuance, plus any shares subject to awards made under previous plans that were outstanding on April 16, 2004, and became available for regrant pursuant to the terms of the 2004 Plan. Under the 2004 Plan, non-qualified options, stock appreciation rights, retention shares, stock units, and incentive bonus awards may be granted to eligible employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. Non-employee directors are not eligible for awards under the 2004 Plan. As

of December 31, 2017,

1,557,350

options and


retention shares and

stock units were outstanding under the 2004 Plan.  We no longer grant any stock options or other stock or unit awards under this plan.

﻿

The Union Pacific Corporation 2013 Stock Incentive Plan (2013 Plan) was approved by shareholders in May 2013. The 2013 Plan reserved

78,000,000

shares of our common stock for issuance, plus any shares subject to awards made under previous plans as of February 28, 2013, that are subsequently cancelled, expired, forfeited or otherwise not issued under previous plans.  Under the 2013 Plan, non-qualified options, incentive stock options, retention shares, stock units, and incentive bonus awards may be granted to eligible employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. Non-employee directors are not eligible for awards under the 2013 Plan. As of

December 31, 2017,

4,072,514

options and

3,450,600

retention shares

and stock units were outstanding under the 2013 Plan.

Pursuant to the above plans

72,151,415

;

73,745,250

;

and 76,548,520

;

shares of our common stock were authorized and available for grant at

December 31, 2017

, 2016, and 2015

, respectively.

﻿

Stock-Based Compensation

– We have several stock-based compensation plans under which employees and non-employee directors receive stock options, nonvested retention shares, and nonvested stock units. We refer to the nonvested shares and stock units collectively as “retention awards”. We have elected to issue treasury shares to cover option exercises and stock unit vestings, while new shares are issued when retention shares are granted.

﻿


Information regarding stock-based compensation appears in the table below:

﻿

Stock Options

– We estimate the fair value of our stock option awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The table below shows the annual weighted-average assumptions used for valuation purposes:

The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant; the expected dividend yield is calculated as the ratio of dividends paid per share of common stock to the stock price on the date of grant; the expected life is based on historical and expected exercise behavior; and expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected life of the option.

﻿

A summary of s

tock option activity during 2017

is presented below:

﻿

﻿

﻿

Stock options are granted at the closing price on the date of grant, have

ten

-year contractual terms, and vest no later than

three

years from the date of grant.

None

of

the stock options outstanding at

December 31, 2017,

are subject to performance or market-based vesting conditions.

﻿

At December 31, 2017,

there

was

$19

million of unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

1.1

years. Additional information regarding stock option exer

cises appears in the following table

:

﻿

﻿

﻿


Retention Awards

– The fair value of retention awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the grant date. Dividends and dividend equivalents are paid to participants during the vesting periods.

﻿

Changes in our retention awards during 201


were as follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿

Retention awards are granted at no cost to the employee or non-employee director and vest over periods lasting up

to

four

years

.

At December 31, 2017,

there

was

$87

million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested retention awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period

of

1.6

years.

﻿

Performance Retention Awards

– In February 2017

, our Board of Directors approved performance stock unit grants. The basic terms of these performance stock units are identical t

o those granted in February 2016

, except for different annual return on invested cap

ital (ROIC) performance targets.  T

he

2016 and 2017 plans also include the

addition of relative operating income growth (OIG) as a modifier compared to the companies included in t

he S&P 500 Industrials Index.

We define ROIC as net operating profit adjusted for interest expense (including interest on the present value of operating leases) and taxes on interest divided by average invested capital adjusted for the present value of operating leases.

The modifier can be up to +/- 25% of the award earned based on the ROIC achieved.

﻿

Stock units awarded to selected employees under these grants are subject to continued employment for 37 months and the attainment of certain levels of ROIC, and for the 2016 and 2017 plans, modified for the relative OIG.

We expense the fair value of the units that are probable of being earned based on our forecasted ROIC over the 3-year performance period, and with respect to the third year of the 2016 and 2017 plans, the relative OIG modifier.

We measure the fair value of these performance stock units based upon the closing price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated future dividends. Dividend equivalents are paid to participants only after the units are earned.

﻿

The assumptions used to calculate the present value of estimated future divide

nds related to the February 2017

grant were as follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿

Changes in our performa

nce retention awards during 2017

were as follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿

At

December 31, 2017

, there was

$39

million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested performance retention awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period

of

1.5

years. This expense is subject to achievement of the performance measures established for the performance stock unit grants.


6. Retirement Plans

﻿

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

﻿

Pension Plans

– We provide defined benefit retirement income to eligible non-union employees through qualified and non-qualified (supplemental) pension plans. Qualified and non-qualified pension benefits are based on years of service and the highest compensation during the latest years of employment, with specific reductions made for early retirements.  Non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2018, are no longer eligible for pension benefits, but will be eligible for an enhanced 401(k) plan as described below in other retirement programs.

﻿

Other Postretirement Benefits (OPEB)

– We provide medical and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees hired before January 1, 2004. These benefits are funded as medical claims and life insurance premiums are paid.

﻿

Funded Status

﻿

We are required by GAAP to separately recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our pension and OPEB plans as an asset or liability. The funded status represents the difference between the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and the fair value of the plan assets. Our non-qualified (supplemental) pension plan is unfunded by design. The PBO of the pension plans is the present value of benefits earned to date by plan participants, including the effect of assumed future compensation increases. The PBO of the OPEB plan is equal to the accumulated benefit obligation, as the present value of the OPEB liabilities is not affected by compensation increases. Plan assets are measured at fair value. We use a December 31 measurement date for plan assets and obligations for all our retirement plans.

﻿

Changes in our PBO and plan assets were as follows for the years ended December 31:

﻿

﻿

﻿

Amounts recognized in the statement of financial position as of

December 31, 2017, and 2016

consist of:

﻿

﻿

﻿


Pre-tax amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) as of

December 31, 2017, and 2016

consist of:

﻿

﻿

﻿

Pre-tax changes recognized in other comprehensive inco

me/(loss) during 2017, 2016, and 2015

were as follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿

Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) expected to be amortized into net periodic cost during


:

﻿

﻿

﻿

Underfunded Accumulated Benefit Obligation

– The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) is the present value of benefits earned to date, assuming no future compensation growth. The underfunded accumulated benefit obligation represents the difference between the ABO and the fair value of plan assets. At

December 31, 2017, and 2016

, the non-qualified (supplemental) plan ABO was

$481

million and

$412

million, respectively. The following table discloses only the PBO, ABO, and fair value of plan assets for pension plans where the accumulated benefit obligation is in excess of the fair value of the plan assets as of December 31

:

﻿

﻿

﻿

The ABO for all defined benefit pension plans

was

$4.2

billion and

$3.9

billion at

December 31, 2017, and 2016

, respectively.

﻿


Assumptions

– The weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31:

﻿

﻿

﻿

Expense

﻿

Both pension and OPEB expense are determined based upon the annual service cost of benefits (the actuarial cost of benefits earned during a period) and the interest cost on those liabilities, less the expected return on plan assets. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes changes in fair value over a

five

-year period. This practice is intended to reduce year-to-year volatility in pension expense, but it can have the effect of delaying the recognition of differences between actual returns on assets and expected returns based on long-term rate of return assumptions. Differences in actual experience in relation to assumptions are not recognized in net income immediately, but are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and, if necessary, amortized as pension or OPEB expense.

﻿

The

workforce reduction plan

initiated

in

the

third quarter of 2017

included a curtailment loss of

$20

million and a special termination benefit of

$49

million as a result of a remeasurement as of September 30, 2017, due

to the eliminated future service for approximately


management employees.  These amounts were

recognized in 2017 within compensation and benefits expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income

.  In connection with this

remeasurement,

the

Company

also

updated

the

pension

effective

discount

rate

assumption

from

4.20%

to

3.81

%

.

﻿

The components of our net periodic pension and OPEB cost were as follows for the years ended December 31:

﻿

﻿

﻿


Assumptions

– The weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine expense were as follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿

Beginning in 2016, we measure the service cost and interest cost components of our net periodic benefit cost by using individual spot discount rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year.

The discount rates were based on a yield curve of high quality corporate bonds.  The expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return, taking into account current and expected market conditions. The actual return/(loss) on pension plan assets, net of fees, was approximately

19%

in 2017,

8%

in 2016

, and

(1)%

i

n 2015.

﻿

Assumed health care cost trend rates have an effect on the expense and liabilities reported for health care plans. The assumed health care cost trend rate is based on historical rates and expected market conditions. The


assumed health care cost trend rate for employees under 65

is

6.09%

.  It is assumed the rate will decrease gradually to an ultimate

rate of

4.5%

in


and

will remain at that level.  A one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on OPEB:

﻿

﻿

﻿

Cash Contributions

﻿

The following table details our cash contributions for the qualified pension plans and the benefit payments for the non-qualified (supplemental) pension and OPEB plans:

﻿

﻿

﻿

Our policy with respect to funding the qualified plans is to

fund at least the minimum required by law and not more than the maximum amount deductible for tax purposes. All contributions made to the qualified pension plans were voluntary and were made with cash generated from operations.

﻿

The non-qualified pension and OPEB plans are not funded and are not subject

to any minimum regulatory funding requirements. Benefit payments for each year represent supplemental pension payments and claims paid for medical and life insurance. We anticipate our


supplemental pension and OPEB payments will be made from cash generated from operations.

﻿


Benefit Payments

﻿

The following table details expected benefit payments for the years

2018 through 2027

:

﻿

﻿

﻿

Asset Allocation Strategy

﻿

Our pension plan asset allocation

at December 31, 2017, and 2016

, and target allocation for


, are as follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿

The investment strategy for pension plan assets is to maintain a broadly diversified portfolio designed to achieve our target average long-term rate of return of

7.0%

.

While we believe we can achieve a long-term average rate of return of 7.0%, we cannot be certain that the portfolio will perform to our expectations. Assets are strategically allocated among equity, debt, and other investments in order to achieve a diversification level that reduces fluctuations in investment returns. Asset allocation target ranges for equity, debt, and other portfolios are evaluated at least every three years with the assistance of an independent consulting firm. Actual asset allocations are monitored monthly, and rebalancing actions are

executed at least quarterly, as

needed.

﻿

The pension plan investments are held in a Master Trust. The majority of pension plan assets are invested in equity securities because equity portfolios have historically provided higher returns than debt and other asset classes over extended time horizons and are expected to do so in the future. Correspondingly, equity investments also entail greater risks than other investments.  Equity risks are balanced by investing a significant portion of the plans’ assets in high quality debt securities. The average credit rating of the debt portfolio exceeded A at both

December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016

. The debt portfolio is also broadly diversified and invested primarily in U.S. Treasury, mortgage, and corporate securities. The weighted-average maturity of the debt portfolio was


years and


years at

December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

﻿

The investment of pension plan assets in securities issued by UPC is explicitly prohibited by the plan for both the equity and debt portfolios, other than through index fund holdings.

﻿

Fair Value Measurements

﻿

The pension plan assets are valued at fair value. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.

﻿

Temporary Cash Investments

– These investments consist of U.S. dollars and foreign currencies held in master trust accounts at The Northern Trust Company (the Trustee).  Foreign currencies held are reported in terms of U.S. dollars based on currency exchange rates readily available in active markets. These temporary cash investments are classified as Level 1 investments.

﻿


Registered Investment Companies

– Registered Investment Companies are entities primarily engaged in the business of investing in securities and are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Plan’s holdings of Registered Investment Companies include both public and private fund vehicles. The public vehicles are mutual funds (real estate) and exchange-traded funds (stocks), which are classified as Level 1 investments. The private vehicles (bonds) do not have published pricing and are valued using Net Asset Value (NAV).

﻿

Federal Government Securities

– Federal Government Securities consist of bills, notes, bonds, and other fixed income securities issued directly by the U.S. Treasury or by government-sponsored enterprises. These assets are valued using a bid evaluation process with bid data provided by independent pricing sources.  Federal Government Securities are classified as Level 2 investments.

﻿

Bonds and Debentures

– Bonds and de

bentures consist of debt

securities issued by U.S. and non-U.S. corporations as well as state and local governments.  These assets are valued using a bid evaluation process with bid data provided by independent pricing sources.  Corporate, state, and municipal bonds and debentures are classified as Level 2 investments.

﻿

Corporate Stock

– This investment category consists of common and preferred stock issued by U.S. and non-U.S. corporations.  Most common shares are traded actively on exchanges and price quotes for these shares are readily available. Common stock is classified as a Level 1 investment.  Preferred shares included in this category are valued using a bid evaluation process with bid data provided by independent pricing sources.  Preferred stock is classified as a Level 2 investment.

﻿

Venture Capital and Buyout Partnerships

– This investment category is comprised of interests in limited partnerships that invest primarily in privately-held companies.  Due to the private nature of the partnership investments, pricing inputs are not readily observable.  Asset valuations are developed by the general partners that manage the partnerships.  These valuations are based on the application of public market multiples to private company cash flows, market transactions that provide valuation information for comparable companies, and other methods.  The fair value recorded by the Plan is calculated using each partnership’s NAV.

﻿

Real Estate Partnerships

– Mo

st of t

he Plan’s real estate investments are

primarily interests in

private real estate investment trusts

, partnerships,

limited liability companies

, and similar structures

. Valuations for the holdings in this category are not based on readily observable inputs and are primarily derived from property appraisals. The fair value recorded by the Plan is calculated using the NAV for each investment.

﻿

Collective Trust and Other Fund

s

– Collective trust and other funds are comprised of shares or units in commingled funds

and limited liability companies

that are not publicly traded.  The

underlying assets in these entities

(U.S. stock funds, non-U.S. stock funds, commodity funds,

hedge funds,

and short term investment funds) are publicly traded on exchanges and price quotes for the assets held by these funds are readily available.  The fair value recorded by the Plan is calculated using NAV for each investment.

﻿


As of

December 31, 2017

, the pension plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿

﻿

[a]

Registered investment companies measured at fair val

ue include stock

investments.

[b]

Registered investment companies measured at NAV include bond investments.

[c]

Other assets include accrued receivables

, net payables,

and pending broker settlements.

﻿

As of

December 31, 2016

, the pension plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿

[a]

Registered investment companies measured at fair value include stock and real estate investments.

[b]

Registered investment companies measured at NAV include bond investments.

[c]

Other assets include accrued receivables and pending broker settlements.

﻿


For the years ended

December 31, 2017 and


, there were

no

significant transfers in or out of Levels 1, 2, or 3.

﻿

The Master Trust’s investments in limited partnerships and similar structures (used to invest in private equity and real estate) are valued at fair value based on their proportionate share of the partnerships’ fair value as recorded in the limited partnerships’ audited financial statements. The limited partnerships allocate gains, losses and expenses to the partners based on the ownership percentage as described in the partnership agreements. At Dece

mber 31, 2017 and 2016

, the Master Trust had future commitments for additional contributions to private equity pa

rtnerships totaling

$359

million and

$392

million

, respectively, and to real estate partnership

s and funds totaling

$67

million and

$32

million, respectively.

﻿

Other Retirement Programs

﻿

401(k)/Thrift Plan

–

For non-union employees hired prior to January 1, 2018, and eligible union employees for whom we make matching contributions, we provide a defined contribution plan (401(k)/thrift plan).

We match


cents for each dollar contributed by employees up to the first

6%

of compensation contributed. Our plan contributions were

$19

million in 2017,

$19

m

illion in 2016,

and

$20

million in 2015.

For non-union employees hired on or after

January 1, 2018

, we will match

dollar

-for-dollar, up to the first

6%

of compensation contributed, in addition to contributing an annual amount of

3%

of the employee’s annual base salary.

﻿

Railroad Retirement System

–

All Railroad employees are covered by the Railroad Retirement System (the System).

Contributions made to the System are expensed as incurred and amounted to approximately

$672

million in 2017,

$671

m

illion in 2016,

and

$749

million in 2015.

﻿

Collective Bargaining Agreements

–

Under collective bargaining agreements, we participate in multi-employer benefit plans that provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for eligible union employees.

Premiums paid under these plans are expensed as incurred and amounted

to

$60

million in 2017,

$50

million in 2016

, and

$46

million in 2015.

﻿

7. Other Income

﻿

Other income included the following for the years ended December 31:

﻿

﻿

﻿

[a]

2017 includes $65 million related to a favorable litigation

settlement

.

[b]

2017 includes $26 million

and $57 million related to

a

real estate sale in the first quarter and in the third quarter

, respectively

.

[c]

2016 includes $17 million and $50 million related to a real estate sale in the first quarter

and

second quarter

, respectively

.


8. Income Taxes

﻿

Components of income tax expense were as follows for the years ended December 31:

﻿

﻿

﻿

[a]

2017 includes

a

$(5,935)

million adjustment to income tax expense resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Of this amount,

$(5,965)

million is a federal income tax benefit and

$30

million is a state income tax expense.

﻿

For the years ended December 31, reconciliations between statutory and effective tax rates are as follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the expected future tax consequences of events that are reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax purposes.  The majority of our deferred tax assets relate to deductions that already have been claimed for financial reporting purposes but not for tax purposes.  The majority of our deferred tax liabilities relate to differences between the tax bases and financial reporting amounts of our land and depreciable property, due to accelerated tax depreciation (including bonus depreciation), revaluation of assets in purchase accounting transactions, and differences in capitalization methods.

﻿

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act made

significant changes to federal tax law, including a reduction in the federal income tax rate from

35%

to

21%

effective January 1, 2018,

100%

bonus depreciation for certain capital expenditures, stricter limits

on deductions for interest and certain executive compensation, and a one-time transition tax on previously

deferred earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. As a result of our initial analysis of the Tax Act and

existing implementation guidance, we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities and computed our

transition tax liability net of offsetting foreign tax credits. This resulted in a

$5.9

billion reduction in our

income tax expense in 2017. We also recorded a

$212

million reduction to our operating expense related

to income tax adjustments at equity-method affiliates.

﻿

The SEC provided guidance in SAB 118 on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act (See Note 3). In

accordance with that guidance, some of the income tax effects recorded in 2017 are provisional, including

those related to our analysis of 100% bonus depreciation for certain capital expenditures, stricter limits on

deductions for certain executive compensation, the one-time transition tax, and the reduction to our

operating expense related to income tax adjustments at equity-method affiliates. The accounting for these

income tax effects may be adjusted during 2018 as a result of continuing analysis of the Tax Act;

additional implementation guidance from the IRS, state tax authorities, the SEC, the FASB, or the Joint

Committee on Taxation; and new information from domestic or foreign equity affiliates.

﻿


On July 6, 2017, the

State of Illinois increased its corporate income tax rate effective July 1, 2017.  In the third quarter of 2017, we increased our deferred tax expense by

$33

million to reflect the increased tax rate.

﻿

Deferred income tax (liabilities)/assets were comprised of the following at December 31:

﻿

﻿

﻿

[a]

2017 amounts reflect the provisional impact of the Tax Act.

﻿

When appropriate, we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized based on management’s judgments using available evidence for purposes of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize a deferred tax asset. In 201


and 201


, there were

no

valuation allowances.

﻿

Tax benefits are recognized only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits are tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards.

﻿

A reconciliation of changes in unrecognized tax benefits liabilities/(assets) from the beginning to the end of the reporting period is as follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿

We recognize interest and penalties as part of income tax expense. Total accrued liabilities for interest and penalties were

$8

million at both December 31, 2017, and 2016. Total interest and penalties recognized as part of income tax expense (benefit) were

$(3)

million for 2017,

$5

million for 2016, and

$(3)

million for 2015.

﻿

The statute of limitations has run for all years prior to 2014 and UPC is not currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for any of its open years.  In 2017, UPC amended its 2013 income tax returns, primarily to claim deductions resulting from the resolution of prior year IRS examinations

.  We have not received any communication from the IRS related to these amended returns.

﻿


In 2016, UPC amended its 2011 and 2012 income tax returns to claim deductions resulting from the resolution of IRS examinations for years

prior to 2011. The IRS and Joint Committee on Taxation reviewed these

amended

returns.  In the third quarter of 2017, we received a refund of

$62

million, consisting of

$60

million of tax and

$2

million of interest.

﻿

In the third quarter of 2015, UPC and the IRS signed a closing agreement resolving all tax matters for tax years 2009-2010. The settlement had an immaterial effect on our income tax expense. In connection with the settlement, UPC paid

$10

million in the fourth quarter of 2015.

﻿

Several state tax authorities are examining our state income tax returns for years 2010 through 2015.

﻿

We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly in the next 12 months.

﻿

The portion of our unrecognized tax benefits that relates to permanent changes in tax and interest would reduce our effective tax rate, if recognized. The remaining unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax positions for which only the timing of the benefit is uncertain. Recognition of the tax benefits with uncertain timing would reduce our effective tax rate only through a reduction of accrued interest and penalties.  The unrecognized tax benefits that would reduce our effective tax rate are as follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿

﻿

﻿

﻿

﻿

﻿

﻿

﻿

﻿

9. Earnings Per Share

﻿

The following table provides a reconciliation between basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31:

﻿

﻿

﻿

Common stock options

totaling

1.6

million,

2.0

million,

and

1.1

million

for

2017,



,

and



, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices of these options exceeded the average market price of our common stock for the respective periods, and the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.


10. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)

﻿

Reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) were as follows (net of tax):

﻿

﻿

﻿

[a]

The accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) reclassification components are 1) prior service cost/(benefit) and 2) net actuarial loss which are both included in the computation of net periodic pension cost.  See Note 6 Retirement Plans for additional details.

11. Accounts Receivable

﻿

Accounts receivable includes freight and other receivables reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is based upon historical losses, credit worthiness of customers, and current economic conditions.

At December 31, 2017, and 2016, our accounts

receivable were reduced by

$3

million and

$5

million

, respectively

.  Receivables not expected to be collected in one year and the associated allowances are classified as other assets

in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  At

both

December 31, 2017, and 2016, receivables classified as other

assets were reduced by allowances

of

$17

million

.

﻿

Receivables Securitization Facility

– The Railroad

maintains a

$650

million,


-year receivables securitization facility (the Receivables Facility), maturing in

July 2019

. Under

the Receivables Facility, the Railroad

sells most of its eligible third-party receivables to Union Pacific Receivables, Inc. (UPRI), a

consolidated,

wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary that may subsequently transfer, without recourse, an undivided interest in accounts receivable to investors. The investors have no recourse to the Railroad’s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims. Creditors of the Railroad do not have recourse to the assets of UPRI.

﻿

The amount outstanding under the

Receivables F

acility was

$500

million and

$0

at

December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016.

The

Receivables F

acility was supported

by

$1.1

billion and

$1.0

billion of accounts receivable as collateral at

December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively

, which, as a retained interest, is included in accounts receivable, net in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

﻿

The outstanding amount the Railroad is allowed to maintain under the

Receivables F

acility, with a maximum of $650 million, may fluctuate based on the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by business volumes and credit risks, including receivables payment quality measures such as default and dilution ratios. If default or dilution ratios increase one percent, the allowable outstanding amount under the

Receivables F

acility would not materially change.

﻿

The costs of the

Receivables F

acility include interest, which will vary based on prevailing benchmark and commercial paper rates, program fees paid to participating banks, commercial paper issuance costs, and fees of participating banks for unused commitment availability.  The costs of the

Receivables F

acility are


included in interest expense and

were

$6

million,

$7

million

,

and

$5

million

for

2017,



,

and



, respectively.

12. Properties

﻿

The following tables list the major categories of property and equipment, as well as the weighted-average estimated useful life for each category (in years):

﻿

﻿

﻿

﻿

﻿

﻿

﻿

[a]

Other roadway includes grading, bridges and tunnels, signals, buildings, and other road assets.

﻿

Property and Depreciation

– Our railroad operations are highly capital intensive, and our large base of homogeneous, network-type assets turns over on a continuous basis.  Each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers.  Assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria.  Properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated service lives, which are measured in years, except for rail in high-density traffic corridors (i.e., all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment, yard and switching tracks, and electronic yards) for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track.  We use the group method of depreciation in which all


items with similar characteristics, use, and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes, and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates.  The group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources, not as singular items.  We currently have more than 60 depreciable asset classes, and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology, asset strategies, or other factors.

﻿

We determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad assets by means of depreciation studies.  We perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets (i.e., rail and other track material, ties, and ballast) and other road property.  Our depreciation studies take into account the following factors:

﻿

·

Statistical analysis of historical patterns of use and retirements of each of our asset classes;

·

Evaluation of any expected changes in current operations and the outlook for continued use of the assets;

·

Evaluation of technological advances and changes to maintenance practices; and

·

Expected salvage to be received upon retirement.

﻿

For rail in high-density traffic corridors, we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track.  It has been our experience that the lives of rail in high-density traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage (i.e., the amount of weight carried over the rail).  The service lives also vary based on rail weight, rail condition (e.g., new or secondhand), and rail type (e.g., straight or curve).  Our depreciation studies for rail in high-density traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives.  For rail in high-density traffic corridors, we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross ton-miles carried over the rail (i.e., the weight of loaded and empty freight cars, locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail) by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile.  For all other depreciable assets, we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies.  Changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively.

﻿

Under group depreciation, the historical cost (net of salvage) of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized.  The historical cost of certain track assets is estimated by multiplying the current replacement cost of track assets by a historical index factor derived from (i) inflation indices published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and (ii) the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies.  The indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes.  Because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired, we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate. In addition, we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies. Any deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets.

﻿

For retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business, a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions: (i) is unusual, (ii) is material in amount, and (iii) varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies.  A gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations.

﻿

When we purchase an asset, we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use.  However, many of our assets are self-constructed.  A large portion of our capital expenditures is for replacement of existing track assets and other road properties, which is typically performed by our employees, and for track line expansion and other capacity projects.  Costs that are directly attributable to capital projects (including overhead costs) are capitalized.  Direct costs that are capitalized as part of self-constructed assets include material, labor, and work equipment.  Indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset.

﻿

Normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred, while costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset, improve the safety of our operations or improve operating efficiency are capitalized. These


costs are allocated using appropriate statistical bases. Total expense for repairs and maintenance incurred was $2.5 billion for 2017, $2.3 billion for 2016, and $2.5 billion for 2015.

﻿

Assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease.

13. Accounts Payable and Other Current Liabilities

﻿

14. Financial Instruments

﻿

Short-Term Investments

– The Company’s short-term investments consist of time deposits and government agency securities. These investments are considered level 2 investments and are valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair

value (

$90

million of time deposits as of December 31, 2017).  All short-term investments have a maturity of less than one year and are classified as held-to-maturity.  There were

no

transfers out of Level 2 during the year ended December

31, 201


.

﻿

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

– The fair value of our short- and long-term debt was estimated using a market value price model, which utilizes applicable U.S. Treasury rates along with current market quotes on comparable debt

securities. All of the inputs used to determine the fair market value of the Corporation’s long-term debt are Level 2 inputs and obtained from an independent source. At December 31, 2017, the fair value of total debt was

$18.2

billion, approximately

$1.3

billion more than the carrying value.  At December 31, 2016, the fair value of total debt was

$15.9

billion, approximately

$0.9

billion more than the carrying value. The fair value of the Corporation’s debt is a measure of its current value under present market conditions. It does not impact the financial statements under current accounting rules. At

both

December 31, 2017, and 2016, approximately

$155

million of debt securities contained call provisions that allow us to retire the debt instruments prior to final maturity

at par

, with

out

the payment of fixed call premi

ums

.  The fair value of our cash equivalents approximates their carrying value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.


15. Debt

﻿

Total

debt as of December 31, 2017, and 2016, is summarized

below:

﻿

﻿

﻿

Debt Maturities

– The following table

presents aggregate debt maturities as of December 31, 2017, excluding market value adjustments:

﻿

﻿

﻿

Equipment Encumbrances

– Equipment with a carrying value of

approximately

$2.0

billion and

$2.3

billion at December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively, served as collateral for capital leases and

other types of equipment obligations in accordance with the secured financing arrangements utilized to acquire

or refinance

such railroad equipment.

﻿

As a result of the merger of Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (MPRR) with and into UPRR on January 1, 1997, and pursuant to the underlying indentures for the MPRR mortgage bonds, UPRR must maintain the same value of assets after the merger in order to comply with the security requirements of the mortgage bonds. As of the merger date, the value of the MPRR assets that secured the mortgage bonds was approximately

$6.0

billion. In accordance with the terms of the indentures, this collateral value must be maintained during the entire term of the mortgage bonds irrespective of the outstanding balance of such bonds.

﻿

Credit Facilities

–

At December 31, 2017, we

had

$1.7

billion

of credit available under our revolving credit

facility, which is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of

commercial paper. We did

not

draw on the facility during 2017. Commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated, investment-grade borrowers. The facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on London Interbank Offered Rates, plus a spread, depending upon credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt. The facility matures in

May 2019

under a

five

-year term and requires UPC to maintain a debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio.

﻿

The definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio includes, among other things, certain

credit arrangements, capital leases, guarantees and unfunded and vested pension benefits under Title IV of ERISA. At December 31, 2017, the debt-to-net-worth coverage ratio allowed us to carry up to

$49.7

billion of debt (as defined in

the facility), and we

had

$17.0

billion of debt

(as defined in the facility) outstanding at that

date.  Under our current financial

plans, we expect to continue to satisfy the


debt-to-net-worth

coverage ratio; however, many factors beyond our reasonable control could affect our ability to comply with this provision in the future. The facility does not include any other financial restrictions, credit rating triggers (other than rating-dependent pricing), or any other provision that could require us to post collateral. The facility also includes a

$125

million cross-default provision and a change-of-control provision.

﻿

During 2017, we did not

issue

or

repay

any commercial paper, and at December 31, 2017, and 2016, we had no commercial paper

outstanding

. Our revolving credit facility supports our outstanding commercial paper balances, and, unless we change the terms of our commercial paper program, our aggregate issuance of commercial paper will not exceed the amount of borrowings

available under the facility.

﻿

Dividend Restrictions

– Our revolving credit facility includes a debt-to-net worth covenant (discussed in the Credit Facilities section above) that, under certain circumstances, restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders. The amount of retained earnings available for dividends

was

$16.4

billion

and

$12.4

billion at December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively

.

﻿

Shelf Registration Statement and Significant New Borrowings

–

In 2016, the Board of Directors reauthorized the

issuance

of up to $4.0

billion of debt securities. Under

our shelf registration, we may issue, from time to time, any combination of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more

offerings.

﻿

During 2017

, we issued the following unsecured, fixed-rate debt securities under our current shelf registration:

﻿

﻿

﻿

﻿

We used the net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. These debt securities include change-of-control provisions

.

At December 31, 2017

, we had remaining authority to issue

up to

$1.55

billion

of debt securities under our shelf registration.

﻿

Receivables Securitization Facility

–

As of

December 31, 2017, and 2016, we

recorded

$500

million

and

$0

, respect

ively, of borrowings under our R

e

ceivables F

acility, as secured debt. (See further discussion of our receivables securitization facility in Note 11).

16. Variable Interest Entities

﻿

We have entered into various lease transactions in which the structure of the leases contain variable interest entities (VIEs). These VIEs were created solely for the purpose of doing lease transactions (principally involving railroad equipment and facilities) and have no other activities, assets or liabilities outside of the lease transactions.  Within these lease arrangements, we have the right to purchase some or all of the assets at fixed prices. Depending on market conditions, fixed-price purchase options available in the leases could potentially provide benefits to us; however, these benefits are not expected to be significant.

﻿

We maintain and operate the assets based on contractual obligations within the lease arrangements, which set specific guidelines consistent within the railroad industry. As such, we have no control over activities that could materially impact the fair value of the leased assets. We do not hold the power to direct the activities of the VIEs and, therefore, do not control the ongoing activities that have a significant impact on the economic performance of the VIEs. Additionally, we do not have the obligation to absorb losses of the VIEs or the right to receive benefits of the VIEs that could potentially be significant to the VIEs.

﻿

We are not considered to be the primary beneficiary and do not consolidate these VIEs because our actions and decisions do not have the most significant effect on the VIE’s performance and our fixed-price purchase options are not considered to be potentially significant to the VIEs.  The future minimum lease payments associated with the VIE leases totaled

$1.9

billion as of

December 31, 2017.


17. Leases

﻿

We lease certain locomotives, freight cars, and other property. The Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of

December 31, 2017, and 2016 included

$1,635

million, net of

$953

million of accumulated depreciation, and

$1,997

million, net of

$1,121

million of accumulated depreciation, respectively, for properties held under capital leases. A charge to income resulting from the depreciation for assets held under capital leases is included within depreciation expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Future minimum lease payments for operating and capital leases with initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of

December 31, 2017,

were as follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿

Approximately

97%

of capital lease payments relate to locomotives. Rent expense for operating leases with terms exceeding one month

was

$480

million in 2017,

$535

million in 201


,

and

$590

million in 201


. When cash rental payments are not made on a straight-line basis, we recognize variable rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals and sub-rentals are not significant.

18. Commitments and Contingencies

﻿

Asserted and Unasserted Claims

– Various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries. We cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. To the extent possible, we have recorded a liability where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated. We do not expect that any known lawsuits, claims, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters.

﻿

Personal Injury

– The cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. We use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability, including unasserted claims. The Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA) governs compensation for work-related accidents. Under FELA, damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out-of-court settlements. We offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work.

﻿

Our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments.

Approximately

95%

of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and approximately

5%

is related to unasserted

claims at December 31, 2017. Because of

the uncertainty surrounding the

ultimate outcome of personal injury claims, it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately

$285

million to

$310

million. We record

an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is

more probable than any other.  Estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation.

﻿


Our personal injury liability activity was as follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿

In conjunction with the liability update

performed in 2017, we also reassessed our estimated insurance recoveries. We have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at December 31, 2017, and 2016.

Any changes to recorded insurance recoveries are included in the

above table in the Changes in estimates for prior years category.

﻿

Asbestos

– We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos. We assess our potential liability using a statistical analysis of resolution costs for asbestos-related claims.  This liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs. The liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions:

﻿

·

The ratio of future claims by alleged disease would be consistent with historical averages adjusted for inflation.

·

The number of claims filed against us will decline each year.

·

The average settlement values for asserted and unasserted claims will be equivalent to historical averages.

·

The percentage of claims dismissed in the future will be equivalent to historical averages.

﻿

Our liability for asbestos-related claims is

not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments.

Approximately

16%

of the recorded liability related to asserted claims and approximately

84%

related to unasserted claims at December 31, 2017.  Because of

the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestos

-related claims, it is reasonably possible that

future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately

$99

million to

$105

million.  We record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than

any other.

﻿

Our asbestos-related liability activity was as follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿

In conjunction with the liability update

performed in 2017, we also reassessed our estimated insurance recoveries. We have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at December 31, 2017, and 2016.  The amounts recorded for asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts. However, future events, such as the number

of new claims filed each year, average settlement costs, and insurance coverage issues, could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts. Estimates also may vary in the future if strategies, activities, and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change; federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimants; and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants.

﻿

Environmental Costs

– We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. We have identified


sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements. This includes


sites that are the subject of actions taken by the U.S. government,


of which are currently on the Superfund National Priorities List.


Certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites; consequently, our ultimate environmental liability may include

costs relating to activities of other parties, in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site.

﻿

When we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned, leased, or otherwise used in our business, we perform, with assistance of our consultants, environmental assessments on the property. We expense the cost of the assessments as incurred. We accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Our environmental liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments.

﻿

Our environmental liability activity was as follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿

The environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties. Cost estimates are based on information available for each site, financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, and existing technology, laws, and regulations. The ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties, site-specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs. Estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal, state, and local laws governing environmental remediation. Current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.

﻿

Insurance

– The Company has a consolidated, wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary (the captive), that provides insurance coverage for certain risks including FELA claims and property coverage which are subject to reinsurance.  The captive entered into annual reinsurance treaty agreements that insure workers compensation, general liability, auto liability and FELA risk. The captive cedes a portion of its FELA exposure through the treaty and assumes a proportionate share of the entire risk.  The captive receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Company’s premium costs in other expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The treaty agreements provide for certain protections against the risk of treaty participants’ non-performance, and we do not believe our exposure to treaty participants’ non-performance is material at this time. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, the Company is not relieved of its primary obligation to the policyholders for activity prior to the termination of the treaty agreements. We record both liabilities and reinsurance receivables using an actuarial analysis based on historical experience in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

﻿

Guarantees

– At December 31, 2017, and 2016, we were contingently liable for

$33

million and

$43

million in guarantees, respectively. The fair value of these obligations as of both December 31, 2017, and 2016 was

$0

. We entered into these contingent guarantees in the normal course of business, and they include guaranteed obligations related to our affiliated operations

.

The final guarantee expires in 2022.

We are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees

. We do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

﻿

Indemnities

– We are contingently obligated under a variety of indemnification arrangements, although in some cases the extent of our potential liability is limited, depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements. Due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved, we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements. We do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions.

﻿


19. Share Repurchase Program

﻿

Effective January 1, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 120 million shares of our common stock by

December 31, 2020, replacing

our previous repurchase program. As of December 31, 2017, we repurchased a total of $23.2 billion of our common stock since the commencement of our repurchase programs in 2007.  The table below represents shares repurchased in 2017 under this repurchase program and shares repurchased in 2016 under our previous repurchase program.

﻿

﻿

﻿

Management's assessments of market conditions and other pertinent factors guide the timing and volume of all repurchases. Repurchased shares are recorded in treasury stock at cost, which includes any applicable commissions and fees.

﻿

From January 1, 2018, through February 8, 2018, we repurchased 2.6 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $349 million.

Controls and Procedures

﻿

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Corporation carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation’s management, including the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and the CFO concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

﻿

Additionally, the CEO and CFO determined that there were no changes to the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.

﻿


MA

NAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

﻿

The management of Union Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies (the Corporation) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). The Corporation’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Corporation’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

﻿

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

﻿

The Corporation’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

. Based on our assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2017, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

﻿

The Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on the next page.

﻿

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

﻿

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Union Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies (the "Corporation") as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by COSO.

﻿

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statements of financial position of the Corporation as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in common shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Table of Contents at Part IV, Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”) and our report dated February 9, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

﻿

Basis for Opinion

﻿

The Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

﻿

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

﻿

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

﻿

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

﻿

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
